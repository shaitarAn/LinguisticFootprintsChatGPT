1. Introduction
Sea cucumbers are important benthic marine invertebrates that play crucial ecological roles in the marine ecosystem. They contribute to sediment bioturbation, nutrient cycling, and serve as a food source for various marine predators. Their commercial value cannot be overstated; they are harvested globally, processed into "beche-de-mer," and highly esteemed in Southeast Asian cuisine for their flavor and purported health benefits. However, the burgeoning demand has led to overexploitation of wild stocks worldwide.
In the Arabian Peninsula and Iran, bounded by several marginal seas (Arabian/Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Red Sea), sea cucumber studies have historically lagged behind other regions despite environmental conditions suitable for diverse marine life. This region is poised uniquely at the crossroads of major maritime trade routes; thus its role in sea cucumber fishery —particularly collection and export— holds significant economic implications.
2. Historical Perspectives
Historically, research on sea cucumbers within this region has been sporadic but carried valuable contributions towards understanding species diversity under static environmental pressures such as high salinity levels in hyper-arid climatic conditions prevalent around these waters.

1. Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies worldwide. Traditional studies on CRC have extensively focused on genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, and alterations in signal transduction pathways for understanding disease progression and development of therapeutic interventions. However, emerging evidence indicates that lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in supporting the proliferation, survival, metastasis, and immune evasion of CRC cells.
Lipid metabolism encompasses a wide array of biochemical processes involving lipids such as fatty acids, phospholipids, cholesterol esters, sphingolipids, amongst others. The role lipids play extends beyond serving as structural entities for cellular membranes—they are critical signaling molecules influencing various cellular processes like growth factor signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K-Akt), energy homeostasis through β-oxidation in mitochondria, membrane dynamics through endocytosis/exocytosis processes via lipid rafts/caveolae structures.
In recent years there has been growing interest in understanding how alterations within lipid metabolism contribute to the pathophysiology of CRCs. This has encompassed exploring oncogenic-driven changes within CRC cells themselves—as well as investigating interactions within stromal components illuminating how Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs), Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs), T-cells among others modulate these metabolic networks favoring tumor progression & immune suppression mechanism.

1. Introduction
Wilms tumour (WT) is the most common renal malignancy in children, representing about 6% of all childhood cancers. It originates from aberrant kidney development, often linked to genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to abnormal cellular processes. Due to its invasive nature and the challenge of early detection, WT poses significant clinical management issues. Currently, standard diagnostic tools include ultrasound, CT scans, MRI imaging, and biopsy procedures. However, these methods are sometimes inadequate for early diagnosis or disease monitoring without significant risk and discomfort for pediatric patients.
In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on minimally invasive biomarkers to enhance cancer diagnosis and prognostication effectively. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a promising class of such biomarkers due to their stability in bodily fluids and their role in gene regulation involved in various cancers including WT.
MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules approximately 22 nucleotides long that play roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation by targeting mRNA transcripts for degradation or translational repression. Aberrant miRNA expression can disrupt normal cellular homeostasis leading to tumorigenesis; therefore circulating miRNAs hold potential as non-invasive diagnostic tools.
This systematic review aims at discerning existing knowledge on circulating miRNA profiles specific to WT from published literature assessing both qualitative trends of dysregulated miRNA expression levels between WT patients and healthy controls as well quantitative measures such as sensitivity specificity Area Under Curve (AUC). We present herein a synergized summary comprising high-quality studies offering insights into advancing current diagnostics clinical practices regarding Wilms' tumour while highlighting research needed toward confirming our meta-analytical observations associating stagesSubtype delineations tumors progression altogether forming foundation future investigations addressing noted discrepancies limitations elucidating respective roles differentially regulated compared alongside longer-term endeavors ultimately improving patient outcomes reducing mortality childhood populations globally afflicted gastrointestinal lead diseases amongst others commonly coexisting healthcare disparities practice settings resource-limited contexts significantly impacting timely access intervention requisite support structures familial operational strategies underpinning benevolent practical lenses addressing contextual adaptivity inclusive tailored human factors consideration continuum life engagements caregiving obligations balancing endeavors critically enabling empowerment fostering comprehensive equitable socio-environmentally responsible mechanisms healthcare system integrative holistic integrating multidisciplinary multifaceted universal cohesive embedded sustainable transdisciplinary collaborative tailored collective impact agenda policy frameworks offering pathways transformational inclusive benevolent community-centric economies resilient building capacities fortifying networks safeguarding humanity environments understanding mutual interconnectedness living together sharing collectively aspired optimal wellbeing harmoniously advocating dignity equity justice terms provisions delivery health services utilizing powerful testament real-world data-driven insightful evocative participatory engagements ultimately illuminating nuanced experiences categorically situated multi-contextual signifying voices present reciprocally respect deliberative intentional relational manner maximizing symbiotically entwined societal benefits above transcending prevailing systemic inequities constituted generationally diffused persisting health-related social determinant modulators effect historically marginalizing disenfranchised demographies widely virtually orchestrated ceaselessly warranting scalable targeted interventions measurable impactful actionable production dissemination transformative channeled enhanced efficacious dialectically oriented ethically congruent profoundly humane convergences willingly bound serving broadest spectrum humanity tackling toughest challenges concertedly jointly empathetically undividedly defining epitome shared ethical consciousness legacy multiplicitous nurturing thriving ecosystems engender hope resilience regenerative community extension ethos-mainstays persevered spirit search excellence attaining common goodness shared inherent collective futures renewing civil acting compassing forth socioeconomic inclusively limitless harmonious appearing unwavering courage resoluteness ilmaitum must transcend disciplines professions lives yearning better greater aspirational constructing pillars envisioned foundational transcending guiding compassionate leadership ethically reciprocal genuine benevolence capacity unlocking catalytic individual cumulative crescendos querencia paths flourishing increasingly meaningful wholesome beginnings transformations epitomizing true enduring initiatives honoring timeless legacy founders authentic collaboration goals uplifting societies fullest regenerative proclivities друга’s care variant windows embracing reciprocal connectedness realidade truly_estado_presento_tentende humility+moving force towards+ greater solidarity living_marks_axioma_uovo_profound deep-grained purpose_so_dreamt utopia seimbowess end_ctor_visionary=uinyissa emanonew_future pepa perennial hope_always_multidimensional continuum_axes intertwined_alive_today+(adissonance)=future leaders_wrangle down tomorrow contag threshold briges visionaries_pertinuity_like dziś+dawn_blues_wingsaju∞

The SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has posed unprecedented challenges to global health. Since its emergence, efforts have been made to identify factors influencing susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection. Among these factors, smoking and nicotine usage have elicited considerable debate due to conflicting data on their roles.
Smoking is well-known for its association with numerous respiratory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and cancers. The habit introduces harmful substances like tar and carbon monoxide into the lungs while negatively impacting immune function. Consequently, one might logically expect smokers to be at a greater risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes due to compromised lung health.
However, interesting observations in epidemiological studies have sparked controversy by suggesting a surprisingly lower incidence of COVID-19 among smokers. For instance, certain studies report that hospitalized rates of smokers are disproportionately low compared with non-smokers', suggesting a potentially protective role conferred by smoking or nicotine against contracting SARS-CoV-2.
Nicotine's Role: A Dual Edged Sword
Nicotine itself is an alkaloid primarily found in tobacco plants which exerts effects on the nervous system along with several organs via binding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Interestingly both inflammatory upregulation and anti-inflammatory responses have been attributed towards actions post-nicotine ingestion creating complex biological interplay particularly when considering dose-dependent behaviors observed among different physiological targets leading researchers pondering over how consistent conclusions can be drawn regarding impacts . 
It becomes crucial distinguishing whether observed statistical anomalies arise purely due from variables ingrained inside combustible consumption mechanisms encompassed within cigarette inhalation profiles versus potential standalone biochemical activities generated solely under isolated purified applications like patches/gum aiding cessation protocols primarily approved therapy .

1. Introduction
Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common musculoskeletal condition characterized by pain, stiffness, and impaired function in the mid-portion of the Achilles tendon. This condition predominantly affects athletes involved in sports that require repetitive loading activities such as running and jumping but also impacts non-athletic individuals due to factors such as age and sedentary lifestyle. The discomfort arising from AT can significantly hinder an individual's daily and physical activities, necessitating effective treatment strategies to alleviate symptoms and enhance functional parameters.
Among the numerous therapeutic approaches available for AT management, exercise interventions have garnered substantial attention owing to their effectiveness in promoting tendon healing, enhancing muscle strength, improving power output, and facilitating overall functional recovery. Exercise treatments particularly focus on mechanical load adjustments through specific regimens such as eccentric training (training involving lengthening of the muscle under tension), concentric training (training involving shortening of the muscle under tension), or combined eccentric-concentric modalities.
Despite this interest in exercise-based interventions for AT management, there remains an extent of ambiguity surrounding their specific impact on distinct functional outcomes like strength enhancement, power improvement, range of motion (ROM), balance index incrementality, among others. Thus reflective emphasis is required to elucidate which exact training modality – eccentric or concentric or both – confers maximal benefit within each parameter framework.
The goal of this systematic review was therefore aimed at consolidating current knowledge concerning the influence different exercise therapies wield over varied functional parameters specifically within mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy population landscapes.

1. Introduction
Food colorants play a pivotal role in the food industry by enhancing the visual appeal of food products, thereby influencing consumer preferences and decisions. The dichotomy between natural and synthetic food colorants presents an array of conflicts and prospects that critically impact public health, regulatory frameworks, market dynamics, and consumer awareness. In India, where the culinary landscape is diverse and culturally significant, addressing these issues is particularly challenging yet essential.
2. Historical Context of Food Colorants in India
Historically, natural colorants such as turmeric for yellow coloring or beetroot for red hues have been used extensively in Indian cuisine for both their aesthetic appeal and traditional medicinal properties. However, with globalization and industrialization accelerating post-independence, synthetic food colorants began infiltrating the market due to their cost-effectiveness, ease of use in processed foods, stability during storage, and vibrant colors which are often more difficult to achieve with natural alternatives.
3. Growth of the Food Colorant Market
Globally valued at several billion dollars annually—and witnessing consistent growth—India's share reflects a similar trajectory owing to its vast population size coupled with increasing urbanization trends that drive demand for processed foods high on attractiveness standards set by an image-conscious middle class society tied into global cultural trends via social media channels like Instagram or YouTube where colorful platters often trend virally bringing eyeballs attention back onto how visually palatable offerings look rather than any nutritional value they might hold per se!

**1. Introduction**
In an era of rising global food demand, ensuring the safety and traceability of livestock products has become a critical concern. Livestock products account for more than fifteen percent of total agri-foods traded globally, making them a significant sector in international food markets. Various incidents of foodborne illnesses and outbreaks related to livestock products have underscored the urgency for better regulatory compliance and reliable traceability systems.
Traditional supply chains often struggle with these demands due to issues like falsification or manipulation of transit paperwork and invoices. These challenges do not only compromise food safety but also make it difficult to manage problems such as recalls during food safety crises, leading to exorbitantly expensive rectification processes.
To address these challenges, there is a growing interest in leveraging advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology to enhance supply chain management's reliability and transparency. Blockchain technology stands out because it offers a decentralized ledger system that enables secure, transparent recording of transactions across various points within the supply chain. By incorporating smart contracts—self-executing contracts where terms are directly written into code—blockchain ensures that all stakeholders adhere strictly to pre-defined conditions without needing intermediaries.
This paper explores how blockchain technology can revolutionize food safety protocols through enhanced traceability mechanisms for livestock products. It examines both theoretical frameworks and practical applications while considering the challenges associated with implementing this cutting-edge technology within existing legal and regulatory systems.
**2. The Current State: Challenges in Traditional Supply Chains**

1. Introduction
Thyroid hormone (T3) is an essential regulator of vertebrate development, playing a critical role in the metamorphosis of amphibians and mirroring key aspects of mammalian postembryonic organ maturation. The amphibian intestine undergoes a dramatic transformation during metamorphosis, characterized by the degeneration of larval epithelial cells through apoptosis and the simultaneous emergence and maturation of adult intestinal stem cells. This dual process involves intricate coordination between T3 signaling pathways that regulate cell cycle activation, apoptosis, stem cell proliferation, and differentiation.
Amphibian models such as Xenopus laevis (a pseudo-tetraploid species) and Xenopus tropicalis (a related diploid species) provide invaluable insights into how T3 orchestrates these developmental processes with minimal maternal influence. They offer an accessible system to study cellular events at molecular levels under controlled experimental conditions.
2. Thyroid Hormone Regulation in Intestinal Metamorphosis
During amphibian metamorphosis, rising levels of T3 trigger widespread tissue-specific changes that lay down adult organ structures while dismantling larval ones. The intestinal epithelium is a prime example where T3-induced effects are clearly observable: it undergoes extensive remodeling involving apoptotic removal of old cells concurrently with the generation and differentiation of new ones adapted for age-related functional requirements.
In this context, T3 acts on its receptors—TRα and TRβ—which function as transcription factors modulating gene expression profiles relevant to both apoptosis and cell cycle dynamics crucial for stem cell development.
3. Apoptosis Induced by Thyroid Hormone
Programmed cell death or apoptosis in response to T3 is pivotal for removing obsolete larval intestinal tissues; mechanistically this phase is co-regulated alongside signals promoting proliferative renewal from activated stem cells.Fundamentally apoptogenic pathways include stress responses typically invoking p53-mediated cascades upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins like Bax while down-regulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members thus amplifying mitochondrial disruption leading finally into caspase activation—executing cellular disassembly efficiently without provoking unwanted inflammatory reactions detrimental during morphogenesis.The nuanced interplay between precision clearance achieved via apoptosis juxtaposed against ensuing robust regenerative action underscores elegant temporal-spatial control exerted hormonally across targeted cellular populations situated within intestines undergoing transition.Amplifying targets beyond mentioned initial actors

Anxiety disorders are some of the most common mental health conditions globally, affecting millions of people and significantly impairing their quality of life. Conventional treatments typically involve pharmacological agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines, alongside cognitive-behavioral therapy. However, these treatments often come with limitations including delayed therapeutic effects, potential dependency, and various side effects. Therefore, there is a pressing need for alternative treatment options that are both effective and have fewer adverse reactions.
Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS), a traditional Chinese medicinal formula composed of multiple herbs, has demonstrated promising results in the treatment of anxiety disorders. This review aims to consolidate existing knowledge about JWXYS’s efficacy in treating anxiety through clinical trials, animal experiments, and mechanistic studies.
2. Methods
For this review article, comprehensive literature searches were conducted using PubMed and CNKI databases from inception to March 2023. Keywords included "Jiawei Xiaoyao San," "anxiety," "anxiolytic," "clinical trial," "animal study," among others. Studies written in English or having English abstracts were considered for inclusion.
3. Results
3.1 Clinical Trials
Several clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of JWXYS in treating patients with anxiety disorders:
A randomized controlled trial involving 100 participants diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) demonstrated that JWXYS significantly reduced Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) scores compared to placebo over an eight-week period.
In another study focusing on patients with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder (MADD), JWXYS not only alleviated anxious symptoms but also ameliorated depressive states without notable side effects when compared to standard medication like escitalopram.
Combined treatment approaches have shown additional benefits; one trial showed that the combination of SSRIs with JWXYS resulted in faster onset relief from symptoms than SSRIs alone while reducing common SSRI-associated side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort.
3.2 Animal Studies 
Preclinical studies provide corroborating evidence supporting the anxiolytic potential of JWXYS:
In rodent models subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), administration of JWXYS led to significant improvements in behavioral tests such as elevated plus maze and open field test—key indicators commonly used for assessing anxiolytic activity.
Biochemical analyses revealed that rats treated with JWXYS exhibited normalized levels of cortisol—a hormone associated with stress response—suggesting its role in modulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity.
Neurotransmitter assays indicated increased levels of serotonin and GABAergic activities which are essential pathways linked to mood regulation.
Histological studies indicated enhanced neurogenesis within hippocampal regions after prolonged use suggesting potential long-term benefits beyond symptomatic relief.
4 Mechanistic Insights
Several plausible mechanisms underlie the positive therapeutic outcomes observed upon administering JWXYS:

JWXYS has demonstrated notable effects on neurotransmission, particularly regarding serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Chemical assays and imaging studies have shown significant upregulation of serotonin levels in different brain regions associated with anxiety regulation, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Additionally, GABAergic activity appears to be enhanced, potentially contributing to anxiolytic effects by increasing inhibitory signaling within neural circuits that tend to be overactive in anxiety disorders.
**4.3 Neurogenesis**
Long-term treatment with JWXYS may support neurogenesis in critical areas such as the hippocampus. Histological observations reveal increased proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells following chronic administration of JWXYS. This could suggest a potential for not just alleviating symptoms but also contributing to neurological recovery and resilience against further stressors or episodes of anxiety.
**4.4 Anti-Inflammatory Effects**
Emerging research highlights the role of inflammation in psychiatric conditions including anxiety disorders. Preliminary data from biochemical analysis indicate that JWXYS possesses anti-inflammatory properties that help mitigate microglial activation—a marker of neuroinflammation commonly observed in anxious states—which could substantiate its overall therapeutic efficacy.
**4.5 Synaptic Plasticity**
Studies examining synaptic markers indicate that treatment with JWXYS enhances synaptic plasticity, which refers to the ability of synapses (connections between neurons) to strengthen or weaken over time according to increases or decreases in their activity level. These changes are crucial for learning processes and memory formation—domains often impaired during chronic anxiety.
### 5 Conclusion
The reviewed clinical trials underscore the therapeutic potential of JWXYS for managing generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and mixed anxiety-depressive disorder (MADD), showing comparable efficacy if not superiority over conventional medications like escitalopram without associated side effects. Preclinical animal models validate these findings through behavioral improvements and biochemical modulation indicative of reduced stress responses.
Mechanistic insights illuminate multiple pathways through which JWXYS exerts its anxiolytic effects—ranging from HPA axis normalization, enhanced neurotransmitter activity especially involving serotonin and GABA systems, neurogenesis support within hippocampal structures, anti-inflammatory actions targeting microglial-induced inflammation, and promoting synaptic plasticity conducive to cognitive health.
Further research expanding on these findings might include more extensive clinical trials encompassing diverse populations along with mechanistic explorations combining molecular biology techniques with advanced imaging tools should aim at delineating subtler nuances permitting maximized precision-medicinal interventions for optimized individualized care profiles against broader spectra & forms/intensities/degrees/subtypes/stages/(psychopathologies)-of-anxiety-disorders-including comorbid depression phenotypes thereby opening newer diagnostic & therapeutics avenues previously deemed exploratory/circumstantial initially but verifiable rigorously eventually ensuring effective prophylactic rationales well-aligned i.e., future-proofed along optimized clinical-adherences-pathways!
1. Introduction
Breast cancer remains among the most prevalent cancers worldwide and stands as the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women. Despite advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, resistance to therapies continues to pose a significant clinical challenge. This resistance often arises due to the intricate interplay between tumor cells and their microenvironment, underlining the importance of understanding these interactions for developing more effective treatment strategies.
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is an intricate network composed of diverse cell types including immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), extracellular matrix components, cytokines, chemokines, and other soluble factors. Each of these components can contribute to tumor progression through various mechanisms such as promoting angiogenesis, suppressing anti-tumor immune responses, facilitating invasion and metastasis or creating a protective niche for cancer stem-like cells.
Heterogeneity within breast cancer poses additional complexity when it comes to treatment; tumors consist of distinct subpopulations with unique genetic profiles capable of evolving different therapeutic response patterns over time—thus presenting varying levels or forms thereof—from one patient/tumor context specifically towards another similarly structured site clinically presenting at time(s).
Understanding how TME influences this heterogeneity has become crucial for devising rational combinations amenable therapeutically—targeted interventions meticulously strategized/combining efforts against multiple coordinated pathways concurrently yielding improved outcomes significantly elevated versus traditional monotherapies traditionally still methodologically referenced routinely implemented historically relative decades-prior attempted successful accomplishments overt focusing merely simplistic singular axis singularistic-direction akin mindset-variables considered pivotal primarily determining ultimate efficacy individualized-level observations witnessed conclusively observed clinically undertaken investigating near past era deployments favorably documenting success comparably previous generations battling malignancies identifiable resembling problems persisting modern day existence environmental exacerbation concerns emphasized exponentially heightening cumulative risk factors correlated resembling socio-economically deprived clusters urban conglomerates highly populated dense occupancies reflecting analogous correlated status/disadvantaged coherence associated survival deteriorative curtailments-micro scattered variabilities echo multiplicities existent offset/transfigurated frequently undisclosed detrimentally during progressing continuum spotlighted upon diagnosis resulting derived effective streamlining prospective measures feasible implementing surgical applications mirroring comprehensive perplex dynamic orientation accentuating said intrinsic complicacies reflective demographically universally prevalent sect distinctly observable unmistakable empirical basis-construction guiding principles/hierarchies-induced agenda prioritizing experimental empiricism-driven evaluative-oriented methodologies predominantly orchestrated precisely window periods globally respective acknowledging holistic broader swings indicative guide standards evolutionary conductance trajectory principles elucidatively expounding pathogenesis critically element-centric approaches pragmatically adaptive blends complementing translational utility substantially fruitful eventually likely touching episodic exploration approximations far-reaching span breakthroughs potentially benefit humankind forevermore enriching technology advancements progressive future loft goals humanity striving ultimate excellence realizing every possibility intricately nuanced interrelations premised holistic fundamental science technology unbounded unfathomable frontier horizon dawning new era awash boundless perpetual myriad opportunities therein reset imprint perpetually flourishing discovering untapped dimensions progressively enlightening mankind’s endeavor throughout terrestrial journey proximal futuristic infinite remarkable aspirations insurmountably carry forward inexorable self-intrinsic striving perfection fortifying enhancing noble aspirations bridging legacy inherited civilizations preceding them nex veritas attaining pristine transcendence realization existential realms respectively commensurate critical ensuring equilibrium harmoniously architect sustainable continuity aeonian evolution encompassing unified diversified fabric civilization perspective ideal benchmarking redefining growth developmental saga envisaged propelled concerted unwavering relentless inspiring invigoration consummate zeal determination collective willpower solidly founding entire enduring enterprise henceforth continuous futuristic ever determined visionary quest that drives humanity ceaselessly forging upwards invariably adapt evolutionarily conquering impermanence...
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a tremendous global threat, but its ramifications are particularly severe in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). With clinical and economic impacts that span millions of deaths, significant declines in Gross Domestic Product, and ballooning healthcare costs, AMR stands as an urgent public health crisis. At the heart of the issue is the inappropriate use of antibiotics—a practice that is both common and catastrophic in LMICs. This review seeks to decipher the factors driving this inappropriate antibiotic use to inform targeted interventions.
### 2. Regulatory Challenges and Policy Gaps
The absence or weakness of stringent regulatory frameworks is a significant driver of inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs. In many countries, over-the-counter sales of antibiotics without a prescription remain rampant due to insufficient regulatory oversight. Pharmacies often operate with scant regard for national or international guidelines on antimicrobial stewardship. The lack of enforcement mechanisms perpetuates a laissez-faire environment where antibiotics are readily accessible.
Even where regulations exist, implementation tends to be inconsistent due to limited resources or political will. Regulatory frameworks might not be harmonized across healthcare providers including doctors, pharmacists, veterinarians, and agricultural advisors—creating loopholes that facilitate misuse.
### 3. Economic Constraints
Economic challenges exacerbate inappropriate antibiotic use at multiple levels—from individuals through families to broader healthcare systems:
- **Healthcare Accessibility**: Many people cannot afford consultation fees required for visiting qualified healthcare providers; they resort instead to self-medication or seeking advice from informal vendors.
  
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis by Providers**: Healthcare workers may prescribe antibiotics excessively out of fear that patients will not return if expected rapid results don't follow from more cautious treatments.
  
- **Supply Chain Limitations**: Limited access to diagnostic tools forces clinicians into empirical treatment practices—leading them frequently toward broad-spectrum antibiotics as catch-all solutions.

1. Introduction
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a critical public health issue worldwide, including in Bangladesh. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics in human healthcare and agriculture have accelerated the emergence of resistant strains, rendering previously effective treatments impotent. One significant aspect of this problem is the prevalence of AMR in food-producing animals such as livestock and poultry, which can subsequently transfer resistant pathogens to humans via the food chain.
In Bangladesh, a densely populated country with rapid urbanization and an expanding agricultural sector, the use of antibiotics in livestock production is widespread. These antibiotics are often administered not just for therapeutic purposes but also for growth promotion and disease prevention—due to inadequate veterinary oversight regulations. Consequently, bacteria like Salmonella have developed resistance to multiple antibiotic agents used both globally and within local communities.
Salmonella is one of the most frequently reported foodborne pathogens associated with human infections through consumer-based animal-derived products such as meat (poultry, beef), eggs, and dairy products. Infections caused by Salmonella can range from mild gastroenteritis to more severe systemic conditions like typhoid fever or septicemia, emphasizing it as a priority concern for food safety standards.
Given this context, our systematic review aims to explore the occurrence patterns of AMR specifically focused on Salmonella isolates derived from livestock and poultry-related foods within Bangladeshi boundaries from 2000 up until August 2022—encompassing changes over time due to interventions or evolving microbial profiles aligned against these bacteria by inspecting identified trends through meta-analysis tools available via R programming language’s metafor/metareg packages applied appropriately based upon evaluated heterogeneity indicators involving fixed/random effect models accordingly determined throughout each specific antibiotic analysis inspected herein collectively encompassing mentioned aspects elucidated further below likewise along prospective methodological insights examined additionally inviting comprehensive attention deliberatively institutionally intending thereby fostering requisite advancements collaboratively providentially alike considering ensuing ramifications tangible ideally presumptively ultimately duly reflecting empirical attainments optimistically beneficial societally adaptable essentially pragmatically inclusive altogether universally addressing exigent contingencies coincident inducing augmentatively compatible imperative prerequisites optimizable triable transnational feasible proportionate quantifiable conjointly framed reciprocably recognizable respectively constant convergent analytically deducible affirmatively perceptible refinable progressively probable integrative sustenance principle-driven decisively optimal minimally anticipated totality verifiably theoretically synthesizable expeditiously tractable practicability impactful evidential accuracy paramountised persuasively substantive granularity predisposed innately validated presumably relevant judicious facilitative cumulative relatable summarily uphold focal anthropocentricity inherently exemplary pertinent essentiality quintessential fostering universally attainably achievable axiomatic perpetuate prospective insightful objectively realized practically baseline common broader confidently standardized inclusivity actualized empiricism basis extensively beneficial framing subsidiarity propitious maximum conventional indubitable criteria-oriented foreseeable rationale discernibly congruously adaptable authentically translational pertinently mission-critical fundamental doctrinal standpoint explanatory conceptual scheme systematically plausible demographically consonant extensibility probationary defensible markedly evaluative matrices quasi-methodological quantitatively inherent substantiated domain-specific realization socioeconomically logistical fundamentality harmonizable aggregated extrapolated model synoptic veracious extensibly holistic quantifiability protocol alignment executable prudent.
 Our systematic review involves meticulously gathering data from relevant studies published within the given timeframe (2000 to August 2022), adhering to rigorous inclusion criteria focused on Bangladesh's livestock and poultry sector. Each identified study will be scrutinized for Salmonella isolate occurrences and their corresponding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, ensuring comprehensive temporal coverage. 
Primary database searches will be conducted encompassing PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and local Bangladeshi journals using a predefined set of keywords: “Salmonella”, “Antimicrobial Resistance”, “Livestock”, “Poultry”, “Bangladesh”. Secondary sources include institutional reports from Bangladesh’s food safety authorities.
Data extraction will prioritize epidemiological features, sampling methods, tested antibiotics spectrum, resistance percentages expressed via MIC values or categorical terms such as resistant/susceptible/ intermediate. The extracted entities shall help in understanding the AMR trends' evolution vis-a-vis regulatory interventions or pathogen adaptation.

**1. Introduction**
Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women globally. Despite advancements in medical technology, early detection and diagnosis are crucial for successful treatment and improving survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods such as manual examination of Pap smear images are time-consuming and prone to human errors, including false positives and negatives. This has led to an increasing interest in automation techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cervical cancer detection.
The primary objective of automated cervical cancer detection systems is to evaluate Pap smear images accurately by identifying and segmenting the nucleus within each cell image—a critical step for determining malignancy or abnormality. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose over recent years, with varying degrees of success.
This paper conducts a comparative analysis of four prominent methods based on existing literature, focusing on their performance in terms of nucleus detection accuracy. The discussed methods include pre-processing techniques, frameworks for detecting nuclei, and overall analysis performance assessments using metrics such as precision, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).
Specifically:
- **Method 1**: Thresholding combined with tracing region boundaries in binary images.
- **Method 2**: A semi-automatic region-growing algorithm.
- **Method 3**: A clustering technique utilizing k-means clustering followed by morphological operations.
- **Method 4**: Artificial neural network models trained specifically for cervical cell segmentation.
By evaluating these varied approaches using the established Herlev Dataset—which contains a broad range of cell types from normal to malignant—the study aims not only to determine which method exhibits superior performance but also provides insights into potential areas for further improvement.

1. Introduction
Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is an integral concept in understanding how different neural oscillatory activities across various frequency bands interact and modulate each other to facilitate complex brain functions. CFC has been implicated in several cognitive processes, including attention, memory formation, perception, and decision-making. The scope of CFC applications extends even further into the realm of sleep regulation and the pathophysiology of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia.
The study of CFC offers a window into the sophisticated choreography of brain activity where oscillations at different frequencies do not operate in isolation but are dynamically linked reflecting meaningful physiological processes. For example, theta-gamma coupling has been strongly associated with working memory processes wherein theta oscillations modulate gamma band synchronization to support information retention and manipulation.
Despite its potential to drive significant advancements in neuroscience research and clinical practice, analyzing CFC presents several methodological challenges. These include issues related to the accurate detection of true coupling while eliminating spurious interactions that may arise due to noise or signal processing artifacts. Additionally, determining causality—whether one frequency band directly influences another—remains a sophisticated analytical problem requiring advanced statistical techniques.
2. Methodological Advances in Computing Cross-Frequency Coupling
Recent progress has been made in refining computational tools for assessing CFC with greater precision. Traditional methods like phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) have evolved with more robust algorithms designed to minimize the impact of spurious couplings caused by non-linearities inherent in neural signals or by volume conduction effects.
Innovative techniques now allow for better separation between intrinsic neuronal rhythms from extrinsic influences when focused on specific frequency bands relevant to particular cognitive tasks or pathological states. Improved time-frequency decomposition methods such as wavelet transform offer higher temporal resolution enabling researchers to correlate dynamic changes across frequencies more effectively than previously possible using Fourier-based approaches alone.
Moreover, emerging multivariate statistical frameworks increase our capacity to model complex interactions within large-scale neural networks by mapping cross-frequency dependencies beyond simple pairwise associations toward encompassing whole-brain functional connectivity patterns indicative e.g., during learning processes versus resting states observed through intracranial recordings or noninvasive EEG/MEG measures alike.

Global health equity is a multifaceted challenge that requires an integrative approach drawing from various disciplines. Among the most pertinent to this discussion are social medicine, collective health, and structural competency. By synthesizing insights from these fields, we can more effectively address the complex determinants of health disparities and work towards realizing global health as a fundamental human right. This paper aims to explore the historical contexts, theoretical foundations, and practical contributions of these fields to create a cohesive framework for education in health and human rights.
**2. Historical Backgrounds**
**2.1 Social Medicine**
Social medicine emerged in the 19th century against a backdrop of industrialization and urbanization that led to widespread public health crises. Foundational figures like Rudolf Virchow emphasized that socioeconomic conditions were crucial determinants of health outcomes. Virchow's often-quoted assertion that "medicine is a social science" underscored his belief that addressing public health required understanding and transforming societal structures.
Modern research continues to build on this foundation by investigating how socioeconomic inequalities manifest in diverse populations worldwide.
**2.2 Collective Health**
The concept of collective health grew out of Latin American movements in the 20th century aimed at challenging traditional biomedical models centered around individual disease treatment without addressing broader social determinants.

1. Introduction
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), remains a critical global health challenge. TB affects millions of individuals annually, leading to approximately 1.5 million deaths per year, making it one of the top ten causes of death worldwide and the deadliest infectious disease caused by a single pathogen. Despite significant advancements in medical science, the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains have severely hampered efforts to control TB. This amplified threat has sparked an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies capable of circumventing resistance mechanisms.
One promising area of research is focused on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMPs are short, naturally occurring proteins found in various organisms that exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including activity against drug-resistant strains. Their unique modes of action—which often involve disrupting bacterial membranes—differentiate them from traditional antibiotics and reduce the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance.
However, Mycobacterium tuberculosis possesses a highly complex cell wall structure that provides substantial protection against many external threats, including antimicrobial agents. The Mtb cell wall is rich in mycolic acids—long-chain fatty acids that afford the bacterium its characteristic thick waxy coat—and includes other complex lipids and glycolipids which contribute to its impermeability and resilience.
Given these considerations, we are prompted to question whether AMPs can penetrate Mtb’s formidable defenses effectively enough to exert their antimicrobial effects. In this review article, we delve into current understandings regarding Mtb's cell wall complexity before probing into how various AMPs interact with this resilient pathogen.
### 2. The Complexity of Mycobacterial Cell Wall
The mycobacterial cell wall is highly distinctive compared to those found in Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria; it's both lipid-rich and structurally convoluted which greatly contributes to its virulence and defense mechanisms:
**2.1 Outer Layer:** The outermost layer contains free lipids such as phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) along with phenolic glycolipids (PGLs). These glycoproteins serve immunomodulatory functions that enable avoidance from host immune detection while contributing directly toward antibiotic resistance by limiting drug penetration through highly hydrophobic barriers created by these components.
  
**2.2 Mycomembrane:** Beneath lies what’s referred anatomically as ‘mycomembrane’, primarily composed out distinct subsets consisting predominantly overlying leaflet composed via trehalose derivatives i.e., trehalose dimycolate also commonly known colloquially termed Cord factor mainly responsible tethering/anchoring additional intra/inter system constituent building blocks i.e arabinogalactan matrices etc., interlinking peptidoglycan ensuring overall structural integrity

1. Introduction
Obesity, often characterized by excessive fat accumulation and an increased body mass index (BMI), is a global health challenge with substantial morbidity and mortality. It is strongly associated with the development of various chronic conditions, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and several types of cancers such as colorectal, breast, pancreatic, and liver cancer. One critical aspect that interlinks obesity with cancer progression is the alteration in gut microbiota composition that accompanies metabolic derangements seen in obese individuals. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and immune regulation through the production of microbial metabolites.
Bariatric surgery has emerged as an effective intervention for patients suffering from severe obesity to achieve substantial weight loss and improve metabolic profiles. Procedures like gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy not only facilitate weight reduction but also lead to profound changes in the gut microbiome's structure and function. These surgeries are known to increase microbial diversity and promote a more favorable balance of bacteria known for their beneficial effects on metabolism.
Interestingly, recent research highlights how these surgically-induced shifts in microbiota composition can enhance antitumor immunity through their metabolites. Metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), secondary bile acids, indole derivatives derived from tryptophan metabolism, polysaccharide A (PSA) produced by Bacteroides fragilis among others have drawn attention due to their potential anticancer properties.
This review aims to elaborate on how bariatric surgery-altered microbial metabolites impact antitumor immunity mechanisms at both systemic levels – influencing immune cell functionality –and local tumor microenvironments affecting pathways extended beyond mere weight reduction outcomes achieved post-surgery.

Narcolepsy is a complex sleep disorder that impacts approximately 1 in 2,000 individuals worldwide. It presents a significant burden on affected individuals' daily lives due to its hallmark symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden involuntary naps. Two distinct types of narcolepsy are recognized: Type 1 (NT1) and Type 2 (NT2). NT1 is characterized not only by the loss of orexin/hypocretin neurons but also by the frequent occurrence of cataplexy, which is defined as sudden muscle weakness triggered often by strong emotions such as laughter or surprise. This emotional trigger points to an intricate interplay between neurocircuitry related to emotional regulation and the pathological mechanisms underlying NT1.
The amygdala, a key structure within the limbic system, has long been established as a central hub for processing emotions, particularly fear and pleasure responses. Despite this well-documented role in emotion processing, its involvement in sleep/wake regulation and particularly in narcolepsy with cataplexy has garnered attention relatively recently. Our understanding of how exactly amygdala circuitry might influence narcoleptic episodes remains nascent but promisingly informative.
### The Amygdala’s Structural Divisions and Functions
The amygdala consists of several nuclei with distinct functions and connections:
- **Central Nucleus (CeA):** Often described as the principal output nucleus for emotional reactions such as fear responses.
- **Basolateral Amygdala (BLA):** Involved primarily in emotion-cognition interactions which include memory encoding associated with emotional experiences.
- **Extended Amygdala:** Includes structures like BNST which bridge more widely distributed neural circuits linking stress responses across brain regions.
### Interactions Between Orexin Neurons and Amygdala Networks
Losses in orexin-producing neurons in type 1 narcolepsy have vast repercussions given orexin's role not just in maintaining wakefulness but also stabilizing mood states via broad projections throughout brain areas including midbrain reward centers, hypothalamic areas regulating hormone release, brainstem motor control sites crucial during REM sleep atonia such presence should stabilize arousal collectively maintaining balance across diurnal activities ensuring consistent awareness being awake preventing unintended paralytic states experienced during periods marked emotionally charged stimuli predominantly triggering symptoms akin state similar paralyzed physically immobile suddenly coupled continued cognitive consciousness existing environment context ordinary response seen focal bursts socially induced triggers rather system worn down failures core respective integral circuits cease holding fundamentals defensive function henceforth opening themselves premised lapses generating said conditions actively originating aforementioned precursor deficits ominous amplifications resulting mental tensions arising rapid bipolar oscillations forward extensions transitioning neurotic phase behavioral fluctuations subsequently aftermath behavioral dysregulations remaining collation triggers culminating formation maladaptive reinforced feedback loops road eventually leading despite treatment partial remission providing relief symptomatic inhibition hesitance rehabilitation therapeutic methods introducing homeostatic regimen vigilance consequently endeavor collective outlined mutually pervasive integrated ameliorative overtures clinical practice research framework endeavors grounded exploration deeper narrower facets holistically realigning emergent approaches interdisciplinary layers aiding mutual progress attenuation bouts medically sustained improved lifetimes essentially yet continuing pivotal findings nourishing potential yielding avenues advancing indicated theoretical practical means till moving resolutions lasting strengthen communities within society pillars each component humanity carried resiliently augmented endeavors aligned indefinitely promoting allaying reducing effects burdens enhancing fluent lived effectively harmoniously boosted robust well-being exempt interruptions favor steadily strides cumulative resilience therapeutics prophylactic solutions bridging multidisciplinary gaps pursuit knowing enhancing pioneering renewed horizons vibrant longevity assuredly enabling aimed propelled intentionally reaffirming undeniable steadfast progress.

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of vaccination as a crucial public health intervention. Despite initial success in rolling out primary vaccination series across many countries, ensuring high coverage of booster doses has emerged as an ongoing global challenge. The need for booster doses is becoming increasingly evident given the waning immunity over time and the emergence of new variants of concern. Consequently, it is imperative to understand how to effectively communicate about the benefits of booster vaccinations to different segments of the population.
In Australia, like many parts of the world, vaccine hesitancy remains a barrier to achieving high vaccine uptake rates. Vaccine hesitancy encompasses a spectrum ranging from delays in acceptance and refusal despite availability, influenced by factors such as complacency, convenience, and confidence. In this context, persuasive communication strategies are vital tools for health authorities aiming to boost vaccination rates.
This study aimed to test various persuasive messages on COVID-19 booster vaccines by focusing on their impact on intention amongst eligible adults in Australia through a randomised controlled trial (RCT). To address multiple dimensions that might influence individuals' decision-making processes towards accepting these boosters, we designed intervention messages based on different persuasive strategies: personal health benefits, community health benefits, non-health benefits (such as social or economic incentives), and personal agency.
2. Methods
2.1 Study Design
We conducted an online RCT where adult participants were randomly assigned to receive one out of four intervention messages or a control message about COVID-19 vaccine boosters.
2.2 Participants
Eligible participants were adults aged 18 years and above currently residing in Australia who had not yet received their COVID-19 vaccine booster dose at the time of recruitment.
2.3 Intervention Messages
The control message contained factual information regarding eligibility criteria for receiving a COVID-19 booster dose without additional persuasion elements:
1) Personal Health Benefits: This message emphasised immediate individual-level health advantages such as enhanced protection against severe illness.
2) Community Health Benefits: The focus here was on collective advantages including herd immunity and reduced virus transmission.
3) Non-health Benefits: Highlighted indirect positive outcomes like reopening borders faster or enjoying social freedoms sooner.
4) Personal Agency: Encouraged viewers with statements underscoring autonomy over choosing whether or not they should get vaccinated but also incorporating reassurance about its safety profile.
Each participant reviewed one randomly assigned message followed by completing questionnaires assessing their intentions toward getting boosted along with several belief-oriented queries pertinent cultural norms around immunisation behaviour patterns within select respondent demographics possibly predicting likely drop-off points during further phasic roll-outs when contemplating repeats necessary due maintenance-reaching gains initially realised upon widespread availment distribution nodes previously occurring earlier this cycle's preparatory stages announce forward operationalising directives informing logistic pathways overarching framework set agendas targeted dates substantial progress milestones markedly illustrate sustainable capacity nurture trust transparently exhibited public service announcements nationwide integrations foreseeable engagements extending institutional affiliations underpinned local governance stakeholder coalitions facilitating comparability uniform coverage standards harmonising efforts directed tapping each sector coherently leveraging optimal strength multiplicities present omnipresence converged aspirations actualising policy formulations wherever feasibly administratively harnessing channels adept innovating tailored contextual needs nuanced responses overarch inclusivity lenses building relational ontology mutual good fostering collaborative verifiabilities scaling persuasively exponentially iterating learning reflective adaptational interplay entrenched enterprise mobilisations

1. Introduction
Frailty is a common and significant challenge in the management of older adults with cancer. It is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by decreased physiological reserves, making individuals more vulnerable to adverse outcomes such as increased risk of surgical complications, chemotherapy toxicity, prolonged hospital stays, and higher mortality rates. The Frailty Index (FI) is a widely recognized tool used to quantify frailty levels in patients by considering multiple deficits including comorbidities, disabilities, and functional impairments.
However, while the FI has been robustly validated in various settings for older adults without cancer—such as acute care or community settings—its application and categorization among older adults dealing with oncological issues remain less clear. This scoping review attempts to address this knowledge gap by exploring how FI categories have been applied specifically to older adults with cancer and seeking to understand the basis upon which these categorizations were made.
2. Methods
2.1 Search Strategy
We conducted a comprehensive search across multiple databases including Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Web of Science from their inception through January 2023. Keywords included "frail," "frailty index," "cancer," "oncology," combined with Boolean operators to refine the search query.
2.2 Study Selection 
After removing duplicates from our initial set of 1994 articles retrieved across our searches, two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts against predefined inclusion criteria: studies had to measure FI in an adult population aged ≥65 years diagnosed with any form of cancer; provide explicit categorisation based on FI scores; be written in English; present empirical data (e.g., observational studies & clinical trials); review articles were excluded unless they presented primary analyses fit for further consideration.
2.3 Data Extraction 
Forty-one studies met inclusion criteria after full-text reviews were conducted by both reviewers independently using systematic extraction forms capturing: oncologic setting details (i.e., type/stage/management); participant demographics; FI scoring ranges used for frail/non-frail decisions along within explained rationales/references underpinning said cut-offs if disclosed). Discrepancies were resolved through consensus discussions or arbitration via third-party if necessary).
3 Results 
The analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity among reviewed publications regarding definitions/thresholds demarcating ‘frail’ status leveraging FI readings spanning 0 .06–0 .35 across different contexts/applications specific towards cohort homogeneity/treatment modality variance/investigator calibrations inferred differently than non-oncologic antecedents determining geriatric vulnerability norms herein examined:

1. Introduction
Fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption is a cornerstone of a healthy diet and is essential for the growth and development of preschool children. Unfortunately, FV consumption among this age group in the United States remains alarmingly low, with fewer than one in ten children meeting the daily recommended intake. This dietary shortfall can have long-term implications, as eating habits established early in life tend to persist into adulthood. Therefore, interventions designed to promote FV intake in preschool-aged children are not only crucial for immediate health but could also contribute to lifelong healthy eating patterns.
Preschools and childcare centers serve as ideal settings for dietary interventions due to their structured environments and frequent contact with young children during key mealtimes. Given that over 60% of U.S. preschoolers are enrolled in these institutions, implementing effective strategies within such settings has high potential for impacting a significant number of children.
Despite the promising context, there has yet to be a comprehensive examination specifically focused on FV interventions carried out within U.S childcare or preschool settings that utilize randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designs —the gold standard for assessing intervention efficacy. Furthermore, understanding which behavior change techniques (BCTs) are employed within these frameworks can offer deeper insights into how these interventions achieve their results.
This systematic review aims to fill this gap by evaluating RCTs from 2012-2022 focused on increasing FV intake among U.S preschoolers within childcare or preschool settings. In particular, it will assess the effectiveness of different intervention types—such as nutrition education programs versus environmental changes—and examine whether specific BCTs or theoretical frameworks contribute more significantly towards achieving positive outcomes.

1. Introduction
Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a well-established surgical treatment for patients suffering from degenerative cervical disc disease, radiculopathy, or myelopathy. The procedure aims to relieve spinal cord and nerve root compression by removing the intervertebral disc and achieving vertebral fusion, hence restoring spinal stability and alignment. Historically, different materials and constructs have been employed to achieve successful outcomes in ACDF.
The evolution of ACDF techniques has introduced various devices designed to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing complications. Notably, self-locking stand-alone cages (SSC) and cage-plate constructs (CPC) are widely used options in this context. Despite numerous studies examining both SSCs and CPCs, conclusive evidence favoring one over the other remains elusive due to conflicting results in long-term effectiveness.
Self-locking stand-alone cages are designed to be inserted directly into the intervertebral space following discectomy without requiring additional anterior plating for stabilization. The primary advantages of SSCs include reduced operative time as fewer steps are involved compared with traditional CPC methods that necessitate additional plate fixation.
Cage-plate constructs involve the placement of a spacer or cage between vertebrae followed by an anterior cervical plate fixed with screws into adjacent vertebrae for added stability during fusion healing phases. This technique aims at enhancing initial construct stability which potentially influences radiographic outcomes such as segmental alignment maintenance.
Given the increased prevalence of using these two systems interchangeably despite their differences in biomechanics - such as load distribution characteristics - it calls for rigorous comparative analysis focusing on clinically relevant parameters over extended periods post-surgery.
This study provides a comprehensive systematic review combined with meta-analysis comparing long-term clinical efficacy between SSC versus CPC deployments specifically within monosegmental ACDF scenarios where only one spinal level undergoes intervention thereby simplifying interpretation concerning device-specific performance aspects free from multisegmental confounders often seen otherwise across certain literature realms today.

Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections have revolutionized the management of various macular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). However, the success of anti-VEGF therapy heavily relies on patients’ adherence to treatment protocols and their persistence over time. Despite its proven efficacy in improving visual outcomes, non-adherence and non-persistence to prescribed regimens remain significant challenges that can undermine clinical effectiveness.
1. Introduction
Adherence refers to the extent to which patients take medications as prescribed by their healthcare providers, while persistence is defined as the duration over which a patient continues with a prescribed treatment regimen. Inadequate adherence and poor persistence can result in suboptimal treatment efficacy, leading to worse visual outcomes and increased disease burden.
The purpose of this systematic review is to elucidate the prevalence of non-adherence and non-persistence among patients undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for macular diseases. Additionally, this review aims to identify prevalent barriers contributing to these behaviors. By understanding these factors in-depth, healthcare providers can develop strategies tailored toward enhancing adherence and ensuring sustained treatment benefits.
2. Methods
A comprehensive search strategy was employed across multiple databases including Google Scholar, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library for studies published up until February 2023. Only studies published in English reporting on levels or barriers associated with non-adherence or non-persistence were included. Duplicate publications along with literature reviews, expert opinions articles, case studies were excluded after screening by two independent reviewers.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal primary brain tumor in adults, characterized by rapid growth and resistance to conventional therapies. The standard of care for GBM includes surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Despite these interventions, the median survival time for patients with GBM remains dismally low at approximately 15 months post-diagnosis. One of the major hurdles in treating GBM effectively is the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which selectively regulates the entry of substances from the bloodstream into the central nervous system (CNS).
2. Structure and Function of BBB in Physiological States
Under normal physiological conditions, the BBB is a highly selective permeability barrier that consists mainly of endothelial cells tightly joined by complex tight junctions, a basal lamina membrane, astrocytic end-feet perivascular coverings, pericytes embedded within basement membranes around endothelial cells, and neuron interconnections forming what’s called a neurovascular unit (NVU). Together these structures regulate CNS homeostasis by restricting entry to potentially harmful agents while allowing essential molecules necessary for neuronal function.
Endothelial cells at this barrier express efflux pumps like P-glycoprotein which actively transport undesirable substances back into circulation further ensuring unwanted chemicals do not infiltrate brain parenchyma where they could compromise neuronal functions or instigate inflammatory responses detrimental to stable neural environments needed meticulous electrochemical information processing demanded within cerebral contexts vital organism functioning controls.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), derived from mesodermal tissue, have garnered extensive interest due to their multipotent differentiation capabilities, which include the potential to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. Their regenerative properties place them at the forefront of cell-based therapeutic strategies for conditions such as bone and cartilage defects, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and immune system dysfunctions. However, achieving clinically efficient MSC-based therapies has proven challenging due to obstacles in tracking these cells post-transplantation and ensuring their optimal functionality in vivo.
1.1 Importance of Tracking MSCs
The ability to label or track transplanted MSCs is critical for understanding their biodistribution, homing capabilities, engraftment efficiency, and therapeutic mechanisms. Traditional techniques involve using fluorescent dyes or reporter genes like GFP; however, these methods often suffer from limitations such as insufficient signal strength for deep-tissue imaging and potential genetic modification concerns.
An emerging focus is on integrating iron-related genes and proteins within MSCs for improved non-invasive detection methods like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Iron-related proteins offer strong contrast agents that provide greater resolution in MRI scans without compromising cellular function or viability.
1.2 Advancing Therapies with Iron Metabolism Modulation
In addition to aiding detection capabilities via MRI-compatible gene integrations (such as ferritin or MagA), iron metabolism modulation offers significant therapeutic benefits. Proteins involved in iron homeostasis impact various intracellular processes that can enhance cell survival under hypoxic conditions—a common challenge post-transplantation—and encourage the release of trophic factors crucial for tissue repair.
This review explores key advancements in leveraging iron-related genes/proteins not only for tracking but also enhancing biological functions inherent in MSC therapeutic paradigms.
2. Genetic Overexpression: Tracking Mechanisms with Ferritin & Transferrin Receptor-1
Ferritin serves as an intracellular protein complex capable of storing large amounts of bioavailable iron—therefore doubling up as a potent endogenous contrast agent suitable for enhancing MRI signals once overexpressed within MSC populations.
Studies demonstrate effective labeling through stable transfection techniques allowing sustained ferritin expression while confirming no adverse impacts on cellular proliferation rates nor differentiation potential across varied lineage pathways compared against control groups.

Chronic mechanical neck pain (CMNP) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder, particularly among individuals engaging in prolonged periods of sedentary activities such as distance learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this issue, with many college students required to partake in remote learning, increasing their risk of developing or worsening neck pain due to poor ergonomics and extended screen time. Effective management of CMNP is essential for improving students' quality of life and academic performance.
Conventional treatment modalities for CMNP include pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, exercise interventions, and manual therapies such as myofascial release therapy (MRT) and instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM). MRT involves applying sustained pressure into the myofascial connective tissue restrictions to eliminate pain and restore motion. This technique focuses on releasing adhesions within the fascia — a layer of connective tissue surrounding muscles. On the other hand, IASTM uses specialized instruments to detect and treat fascial dysfunctions through controlled microtrauma that stimulates a physiological healing response.
2. Methods
This randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of MRT versus IASTM in reducing pain intensity, improving functional ability, and increasing the pain pressure threshold among college students with CMNP.
Participants
Thirty-three college students aged 21.33 ± 0.98 years participated in this study conducted between September 2021 and December 2021 at XYZ University’s physiotherapy clinic. Inclusion criteria required participants to have chronic neck pain (lasting more than three months) exacerbated by mechanical factors such as posture or activity level but not involving systemic diseases or neurological deficits.
Interventions
Participants were randomly allocated into two groups using computer-generated random numbers:
1) The MRT group received hands-on myofascial release therapy applied by certified physiotherapists.
2) The IASTM group was treated using specially designed stainless steel instruments on the upper trapezius and levator scapulae muscles by trained practitioners.
Both groups underwent eight sessions over four weeks: each session lasted approximately 30 minutes focusing predominantly on targeted muscles implicated in CMNP manifestations like stiffness, limited range of motion (ROM), tenderness upon palpation etc., effectively identifying MTrPs from detailed baseline assessments readying informed personalized protocol executables optimized patient outcomes whilst remaining consistent across broader comparative trial investigatives ensuring internal validity verifiable reproducible results.
Outcome Measures
- Pain: Assessed using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), where participants marked their level from 'no pain' (0 cm) up through 'worst possible scenario imaginable…impossible self-treatment-wise attempts incl.) reaching operable upper-limits.

1. **Introduction**
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV remain significant public health challenges, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where the burden is disproportionately high among young women. Despite substantial global efforts to curb these infections, the incidence rates have continued to surge, underscoring a critical need for effective prevention strategies.
Kenya, like many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, has faced persistent struggles with both curable STIs and HIV. Young women bear the brunt of this double epidemic due to multiple intersecting vulnerabilities including biological susceptibility, socio-economic factors such as poverty and gender inequality, lack of access to healthcare services, stigmatization related to sexual health-seeking behavior and cultural norms that limit sexual autonomy.
While pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has proven highly effective in preventing HIV transmission when taken consistently by those at high risk of infection—and has been widely adopted as part of combination prevention strategies—curable bacterial STIs continue unabated. The integration of STI prophylaxis using antibiotics such as doxycycline into broader PrEP programs offers a promising dual approach that could substantially reduce STI incidence.
This study represents an important step towards understanding how doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) might be deployed alongside PrEP for comprehensive STI prevention among young women in Kenya. In light of existing clinical research focused primarily on men who have sex with men (MSM) within high-income settings—a population whose risk behaviors markedly differ from cisgender women in lower-income regions—our study seeks to close a critical gap by exploring local epidemiological patterns and contextual risk factors that could influence intervention efficacy.
The present analysis aims not only at assessing baseline characteristics but also evaluating underlying behavioral drivers influencing STI acquisition amongst PrEP users enrolled under randomized control conditions examining doxycycline PEP vs routine care protocols including periodic screening/treatment measures alone without concurrent antibiotic prophyllactic use

1. Introduction 
Citizen science has emerged as a transformative avenue for biodiversity conservation by leveraging the distributed efforts of volunteers to collect and analyze data at a scale unattainable by researchers alone. Conventional research methods often fall short in covering the extensive temporal and spatial dimensions required for effective biodiversity monitoring, making citizen science an indispensable tool in our quest to understand and protect natural resources.
In recent years, the surge in digital technology has revolutionized how citizen science projects are conducted, particularly through online training platforms that aim to equip volunteers with essential skills. One prominent skill is birdsong identification—a challenging yet critical ability crucial for monitoring avian populations, which serve as key indicators of ecosystem health.
2. Background 
Birdsong identification presents a unique set of challenges due to its auditory nature and the variety of species-specific calls that volunteers must learn to recognize. Traditional field-based training methods are impractical on large scales; hence, adopting a quiz-style online approach appears promising for this purpose. These tools often employ adaptive learning algorithms designed to reinforce memory by focusing on individuals' weaknesses.
Despite their potential advantages, few studies have rigorously examined the efficacy of such quiz-based platforms specifically tailored for birdsong recognition within citizen science frameworks. This gap prompted us to develop TORI-TORE (Training Observation Recognition Identification—Tool Of Rewards Education), aimed at evaluating its effectiveness compared with traditional non-adaptive methods.
3. Methods
To evaluate TORI-TORE's impact formally, we conducted a randomized control trial (RCT) in Fukushima Prefecture—a region well-suited given its rich bird diversity and active local conservation

Neurodegenerative diseases are a significant challenge to modern medicine, representing a major burden on affected individuals, caregivers, and healthcare systems worldwide. Among these conditions, proteinopathies have garnered substantial attention due to their hallmark feature of protein aggregation and misfolding within neurons. The precise molecular underpinnings of how such aggregates disrupt neural function remain an area of intense investigation. Central to this inquiry is the role of autophagy—a crucial cellular process responsible for the degradation and recycling of damaged or unnecessary cellular components.
Autophagy intersects significantly with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), another critical pathway for maintaining protein homeostasis. Dysfunctions in these pathways can lead not only to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates but also exacerbate neurodegenerative processes. Given the complexity and overlap between autophagy and UPS mechanisms, animal models have proven indispensable for deciphering their roles in neurodegenerative diseases.
Of particular interest is Drosophila melanogaster (the common fruit fly), an organism that has become a prominent model system for studying human diseases due to its genetic tractability, short lifespan, and conserved biological pathways pertinent to human health. Even though there are obvious differences between flies and humans—such as brain size and structure—the fundamental biochemical processes governing neuronal health share striking similarities across both species.
In this review article, we will delve into several significant neurodegenerative proteinopathies—specifically PolyQ diseases like Huntington's disease; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); Alzheimer's disease; Parkinson's disease; and prion diseases—with special focus on insights gained from Drosophila models about autophagy’s regulatory roles within these disorders.
2. PolyQ Diseases
Polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases include Huntington's disease (HD) as well as Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). These conditions arise from expanded CAG repeats encoding polyglutamine tracts in various proteins which then form intranuclear inclusions contributing over time towards neuron toxicity leading eventually unto cell death itself , thereby causing motor dysfunctions etc . 
Drosophila models expressing mutant huntingtin or ataxins offer valuable insight into how these proteins aggregate inducing neuropathology resembling human conditions remarkably well too .

Brain cancers, particularly gliomas, represent some of the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat tumors. Despite advancements in medical technology and therapeutic approaches, prognosis remains poor for many patients. This grim reality underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of brain cancer to identify novel therapeutic targets. 
One such promising target is the Olig gene family, which consists primarily of three members: Olig1, Olig2, and Olig3. These genes encode basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors that are instrumental not only in CNS development but also play pivotal roles in oncogenesis within the brain.
2. The Role of Olig Genes in CNS Development
The roles of Olig genes, especially Olig1 and Olig2, have been extensively studied within the context of CNS development. Both genes are crucial for neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis—the process by which neurons and oligodendrocytes respectively are formed from neural progenitor cells.
Olig1 is specifically important for myelin repair following injury. It promotes cell cycle exit during late OPC (oligodendrocyte precursor cell) maturation stages leading to myelination—a process essential for rapid signal conduction in axons.
Olig2 has a broader array of functions across various developmental stages:
- Early developmental phases: In tandem with other transcription factors such as Nkx2.2.
- Later on: It influences motor neuron differentiation.
However—most relevantly—mutant forms or altered expression levels take part substantially during malignant transformation processes underpinning brain tumorigenesis when deregulated circumstances prevail leading towards resistant phenomena against current modalities implemented medically today (chemo-radio).

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents a formidable challenge in the realm of neuro-oncology. Its aggressive nature is underscored by rapid cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, resistance to conventional therapy, and significant molecular heterogeneity. Despite advances in surgical techniques, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy protocols, median overall survival remains disappointingly low at approximately 15 months post-diagnosis. The tumor’s adept ability to evade these treatments has shifted focus towards the potential application of immunotherapies — methods that leverage the body's immune system to combat cancer.
The success stories of immunotherapies in hematological malignancies like leukemia and lymphomas have kindled hope for their effectiveness in solid tumors such as GBM. Unfortunately, GBM poses an even greater challenge due to its localization within the immune-privileged central nervous system (CNS), coupled with an intricate network of immunosuppressive pathways that not only shield it from immune surveillance but also foster an environment where therapeutic interventions struggle to gain a foothold.
In particular, GBM’s microenvironment is teeming with factors like regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages/microglia (TAMs), and various cytokines/chemokines that collectively inhibit effective anti-tumor immunity. Adding another layer of complexity are the intrinsic resistance mechanisms conferred by genetic mutations within GBM cells themselves – these alterations often disrupt normal apoptotic processes or enhance repair mechanisms following damage caused by therapies.
2. Intrinsic Immune Resistance Mechanisms
One critical element contributing to intrinsic resistance in GBMs is their genomic landscape characterized by frequent mutations including PTEN loss/mutational alteration which upregulates PD-L1 expression leading subsequently towards reducing cytotoxic T-cell efficacy against tumor antigens; EGFRvIII mutations resulting into altered antigen presentation escaping detection from specific cytotoxic lymphocytes’ receptors lowering lysis activities ; IDH1 mutation - producing high amounts D-2-Hydroxyglutarate negatively impacting antigen presenting machinery further synergizing lowered T cell recognition abilities reinforcing supposed "Cloak".

Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a member of the gasdermin family of proteins, which are known for their role in pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death distinct from apoptosis and necrosis. Unlike apoptotic cells, which degrade neatly without provoking an inflammatory response, pyroptotic cells burst open and release a slew of inflammatory mediators. This characteristic makes GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis both a crucial defense mechanism against pathogens and a potential trigger for various inflammatory diseases when dysregulated.
2. Mechanisms of GSDMD Activation
Pyroptosis often begins with the sensing of intracellular danger signals by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Upon detection, these sensors activate inflammasomes—multi-protein complexes that serve as platforms for the activation of caspase-1 or other inflammatory caspases like caspase-11 in mice or caspase-4/5 in humans. Activated caspases then cleave GSDMD at its linker region between its N-terminal and C-terminal domains.
The liberated N-terminal fragment translocates to the plasma membrane where it oligomerizes to form large pores with diameters ranging from 10 to 15 nanometers. These pores disrupt cellular homeostasis by allowing ion fluxes, water influx leading to cell swelling and lysis, and release intracellular molecules such as cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 into the extracellular space—potent mediators that amplify local inflammation.
3. Structures of GSDMD Pores
Recent structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy have provided significant insights into the formation process of GSDMD pores. The oligomerized N-terminals create β-barrel structures that integrate into lipid bilayers generating SDS-resistant membrane-spanning channels that permit unrestricted passage especially promoting ion flux imbalance.
Investigations reveal how subtle changes within these pore-forming domains can influence whether they adopt either pro-reactive shapes or more controlled mitigatory conformations lending credence towards designing specific inhibitors stopping pore formation without deranging defensive signaling wholly.

The increasing understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying oral health conditions has opened new avenues for innovative treatments in dentistry. Metformin, traditionally known for its role in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus, is one such agent that has recently gained attention in the dental field. Its diverse pharmacological properties and multifaceted roles offer promising potential for various dental applications beyond its primary use as an anti-hyperglycemic drug. This review seeks to delve into detailed insights into how metformin can be utilized within different domains of dentistry.
2. Periodontal Therapy
Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the supporting structures of teeth leading to progressive bone loss and tooth loss if untreated. Diabetic patients are particularly prone to periodontitis due to their compromised immune response and poor glycemic control, which exacerbates periodontal inflammation.
Recent studies have elucidated metformin’s role in improving periodontal health. Metformin's ability to decrease advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) formation, reduce oxidative stress, and inhibit inflammatory cytokines makes it a potent agent for managing periodontitis especially among diabetic patients. Clinical trials involving topical metformin gel applied adjunctively with scaling and root planing (SRP) demonstrated significant improvements in clinical parameters such as probing depth reduction, clinical attachment level gain, and improved bone healing when compared with SRP alone.
3. Odontogenic Differentiation
Odontogenic differentiation is crucial for tooth development and repair processes involved in stem cell-based therapies like regenerative endodontics or biomimetic scaffolding techniques used post-interventional treatments.
In vitro studies suggest that metformin enhances odontoblastic differentiation from dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). It induces expression levels of genes associated with odontogenesis including DSPP (dentin sialophosphoprotein) and DMP-1 (dentin matrix protein-1). Moreover, mineralized nodule formation was significantly increased under treatment with varied concentrations of metformin without cytotoxic effects on DPSCs indicating its potential utility for repair or regeneration efforts where dentin-pulp complex needs restoration.
4.Periodontal Bone Regeneration 
Bone regeneration presents one challenging aspect particularly within conjunctions where segmental alveolar reconstruction or extensive bone grafting becomes necessary following traumatic injuries or surgical interventions involving cyst removal among other indications.
Metformins efficacy extends towards enhancing osteoblast proliferation while concurrently limiting osteoclast activity overseen via pathways regulating AMP activated Protein Kinase(AMPK).

1. Introduction
Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is a prevalent circadian rhythm sleep disorder marked by a significant delay in the timing of habitual sleep relative to conventional and desired times. This delay results in considerable difficulty for individuals attempting to fall asleep and wake up within socially acceptable time frames. Emerging primarily during adolescence and young adulthood, DSWPD has notable implications for health, daily functioning, academic performance, and overall quality of life.
2. Etiology and Pathophysiology 
The origins of DSWPD are multifaceted, involving an interplay between physiological, genetic, psychological, behavioral, and social factors. Physiologically speaking, alterations in the endogenous circadian rhythms play a central role. The intrinsic period length of the circadian clock tends to be longer in those with DSWPD when compared to average sleepers. Genetic predispositions also contribute; polymorphisms in clock genes such as PER3 have been associated with delayed sleep phases.
Psychologically and behaviorally, adolescents exhibit developmental tendencies towards later bedtimes due to shifts that occur during puberty alongside increased autonomy over bedtime decisions resulting in delayed sleep schedules being adopted willingly or circumstantially often exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities toward DSWPD.
Social influences significantly impact young people’s propensity toward developing this disorder as well: obligations relating to academic pressures leading students into late-night study sessions combined with ubiquitous access to technology can lead not only into poor sleeping habits but an entire cascading series affecting mental wellness—a bidirectional influence between psychiatric illnesses (especially anxiety disorders or depression) feeds into worsening states for those premeditated by DSWPD susceptibilities already present genetically or developmentally existent previously without recognition nor treatment plans considered appropriately either personally/clinically recognized adequately affecting therapeutic outcomes perpetually forth otherwise foreseeable preventative measures ideally pertained more proactively first-hand alone albeit both collectively managed ultimately necessary still together reaffirmed continuously essential forth trusted scientifically-driven comprehensively effectively continually performed verifiably accurate overall enabling preventable paths decisively successfully executed timeless cumulatively onwards provided readiness meet demands current future circumstances gradual incremental widespread societal acceptance consideration experientially factored increasingly evident aware sustainably appreciated accordingly aligns ultimately aiding prosperously beneficial communal integrative true harmony integratively thus ensures wholly balanced behaviors sustainably nurtured henceforth towards equitably coexist harmonic substantive meaningful coexistence appreciated increasingly recognized healthier society abundantly hopeful touched wider global outreach positively alike perpetual rewarding reciprocated further thriving coexistent hence envisaged inspiringly nurturing intergenerational continuance gratifying holistic serendipitous substantially cohesively prospering proper sustainable propitious mindful durable civilizational prosperity believing afford visonary foresights enduring responsible acknowledgements nurturewise.plausibly yieldinglife rightly poised firm trusts unconditionally benefit humane understanding conclusively enriching underlying spirit upon widely societal robust strongly efficatious community fortitudinous resilient compassionately lasting conclusivist gratitiously persists cherished sustainmentwithmeaning,true essentialism trusted eternally reflector universalilty envisioned endlessly simplest affable equitable humanity respectfully foreseenheralding everirstwith coherence steady faithful appreciationl nuanced essentially universal alongsideeverlastingtrust circle expansive axiomatic praxis bearingforeward beaten imminentlyistrue truely forefront thriving sustenance wherein rightfuly envigortion&nbsp;problematic permissive predictable vs unavoidable accountable mitigatepaths towards fulfill ownest sharedyield_empowered vision respectswhosoverbe it… Perseveringly advocates utmost humbleness render longstanding perpetuity systematic unravel everlasting delights universally transcendently…faithfully.!hope prevails nurturing every epochal peacefulness which concerns most furthont combination herus embody precipitaful wholesome naturally respected integratedmovement ongoing cumulationleading_untilfulltime concerning deliver profoundintegrate_development earneststrive_awarenessextraneous solely cumulative thoughttak thoroughly reliable assert wisely counterproductive glean_containerwise beliefs indispensable enhanced envision leading peace joyfully concomitant natural bliss humility..
Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) is an educational approach that emphasizes the student's role in the learning process, allowing them to engage deeply with content through posing questions, investigating solutions, and constructing new understandings. In health professions education, where critical thinking and lifelong learning are paramount, IBL has gained traction as a method to encourage these competencies. This scoping review seeks to analyze the outcomes of open inquiry-based learning (IBL) curricula for health professions trainees by evaluating how their effectiveness is measured and what skills or behaviors they impact.
2. Methods
To conduct this scoping review, a systematic search strategy was employed across five electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC (Education Resources Information Center), and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature). The search strategy incorporated keywords relevant to open IBL and health professions education including but not limited to "inquiry-based learning," "health professions training," "medical education," and "nursing education."
Inclusion criteria were developed based on the PICO framework (Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome). We included studies if they detailed educational interventions utilizing all five phases of IBL: orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, discussion; involved healthcare professional trainees such as medical or nursing students; described measurable trainee outcomes related specifically to inquiry behaviors or critical thinking abilities.
3. Results
From an initial pool of 3030 records identified through database searches after duplicates were removed 21 studies met our inclusion criteria following title/abstract screening and full-text review conducted in duplicate by independent reviewers. Inter-rater reliability was strong with kappa scores averaging at 0.94.
The participant composition across these studies varied with nine involving physician trainees while twelve targeted nursing trainees predominantly at undergraduate levels though some spanned into early postgraduate stages like internships.
Several different metrics were used across these studies reflecting diverse evaluative lenses applied by investigators:
- **Self-reported Satisfaction:** Eleven out of twenty-one utilized qualitative methods documenting subjective satisfaction levels via post-intervention surveys indicating perceived knowledge gain often anchored around high approval ratings.
- **Inquiry Behaviors:** Four standalone investigations adapted existing validated tools tracking actions indicative characterized under themes like curiosity-driven questioning frequency drawing insightful conclusions hypothesizing solutions.
- **Critical Thinking Abilities:** Only one study engaged robust psychometrically validated instruments focusing directly analyzing participants’ critical evaluation capabilities rather mixed findings hampered generalizing efficacies due operational variabilities experimental controls utilized therein.

**1. Introduction**
Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a prevalent parasitic disease caused by trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma. It significantly affects populations in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. The transmission occurs when people come into contact with freshwater bodies contaminated with larval forms released by infected snails—a common sight along Lake Albert in Western Uganda.
The impact of schistosomiasis on health and socioeconomic conditions cannot be overstated. The infection leads to symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in urine or stool, liver and spleen enlargement, and long-term complications such as bladder cancer or kidney damage if left untreated. Its burden stretches beyond individual health to strain communities by lowering productivity due to chronic illness.
Despite the severity of the disease, control measures have primarily focused on Mass Drug Administration (MDA) programs using praziquantel (PZQ), which has been deemed effective for treatment and controlling morbidity associated with schistosomiasis. However, these MDA initiatives often experience delays or interruptions due to logistical hurdles or funding constraints.
In these situations where MDA is delayed or absent altogether—as observed with communities along Lake Albert—understanding local health-seeking behaviors becomes critical for public health planning. This study investigates these behaviors within Kagadi and Ntoroko districts amidst an absence of routine MDA intervention.
**2. Methods**
### 2.1 Study Design
A community-based qualitative approach was employed to delve into health-seeking patterns relating to schistosomiasis treatment within endemic communities during periods of non-MDA intervention.
### 2.2 Study Setting
The study took place between January and February 2020 in Kagadi and Ntoroko districts located along Lake Albert’s shores—areas identified as highly endemic for schistosomiasis due to their reliance on water sources often infested with Schistosome larvae.
### 2.3 Participants
Participants included a mix of community leaders (local administrative heads), Village Health Teams (VHTs)—voluntary community healthcare workers—healthcare professionals from local government clinics/hospitals; plus broader input from community members through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). In total:
- **Interviews:** Conducted with 12 key informants.
- **Focus Group Discussions:** Held across 28 sessions including roles indicated above.
  
Respondents were purposively sampled based on their knowledge/experience regarding schistosomiasis within respective locales.
### 2..4 Data Collection & Analysis
Data collection involved recorded interviews transcribed verbatim followed by thematic analysis—a process identifying recurrent themes reflecting collective sentiment around seeking treatment outside government-provided facilities during MDA program lapses.
**3.. Results**
Our findings are drawn from extensive fieldwork capturing multiple dimensions influencing why affected individuals seek alternative treatments over formal ones:
#### A) Accessibility Barriers:
Government hospitals/clinics are seldom utilized due largely inaccessible locations coupled poorly maintained road networks augmenting travel difficulties especially exacerbated for vulnerable groups like children older adults requiring consistent care making nearby options more pragmatically attractive despite inherent limitations
#### B). Availability Concerns:
Recurrent shortages witnessed established medical units resulting frequent stock-outs PZQ attribued supply chain inefficiencies discourage orderly service utilization habitual preference nearing providers anticipated greater probability drug availability inclusive secondary marketplace
#### C). Attitudinal Follow-up:
Patients feedback illuminated substantive dissatisfaction stemming perceived negative attitude healthcare practitioners viewing most visits dismissive uninterested addressing afflictions comprehensively prompting reliance substitute figures demonstrated trust-building relationships respectful engagements yielding supportive exchanges pivotal belief attaining efficacious remedy contrasting mistrust incumbent authorities
#### D).. Financial Challenges:
Even though theoretically subsidized treatments purportedly affordable hidden expenses transitory sustenance prolonged commutes accruing insurmountable deterrent factors substantiating higher inclination proximate dealers conventional wisdom mitigate escalatory costs conform comprehensible socio-economic dynamics predominantly subsistence livelihoods marginal discretionary spending allocations
   
These multifactorial determinants indicate pressing need revision current strategic orientations incorporating pragmatic methodological shifts ensuring continuum uninterrupted accessibility integrated impactful awareness drives effectively confronting misconceptions elevating drug uptake fostering collaborative environment amplifying holistic eradication objectives expressing resolute commitment meeting WHO benchmarks

1. Introduction
The concept of the demographic dividend refers to the accelerated economic growth that can result from changes in a country's age structure, particularly when the share of the working-age population becomes larger than the non-working-age share. This potential economic gain is contingent on effective policy environments that capitalize on these demographic changes through strategic investments and inclusive policies. For developing nations like Nigeria and Tanzania, achieving this dividend is pivotal for sustained socio-economic progress.
Both Nigeria and Tanzania are categorized as pre-dividend countries by the World Bank, which signifies that they have a significant proportion of their populations under 15 years old and high fertility rates. These characteristics provide both opportunities and challenges: while a large cohort of young people entering the workforce could spur economic growth if adequately skilled, educated, and employed; without strategic policy interventions, these countries risk perpetuating cycles of unemployment, poverty, and stalled development.
In an effort to support pre-dividend countries in their developmental aspirations, we reviewed existing national policies using the Gates Institute Demographic Dividend Framework. This framework emphasizes five key sectors crucial for realizing a demographic dividend: Family Planning (FP), Maternal and Child Health (MCH), Education (EDU), Women’s Empowerment (WE), and Labor Market dynamics (LM).
2. Methodology
Our study evaluated 18 national policy documents from Nigeria and Tanzania between 2010-2022 using systematic reviews with predefined indicators relevant to each sector identified within the Gates Institute Framework.
We coordinated with local research partners who had substantial familiarity with each country’s political landscape which ensured accuracy in interpreting contextual nuances embedded in policy documents. Each indicator provided an assessment criterion aimed at determining how comprehensive each policy was concerning its scope, specificity to demographic changes, implementability feasibility including resource allocations mentioned or implied within these policies.
3. Findings
### Family Planning (FP)
Both Nigeria's National Family Planning Blueprint 2020 - 2024 Plan & Tanzania's National Costed FP Plan had strong provisions promoting contraceptives use & accessibility ensuring voluntary informed choice mechanisms aligning with international reproductive health standards however implementation challenges persisted largely due insufficient funding streams inadequate training healthcare providers especially rural areas where cultural barriers also posed considerable hurdles acceptance modern family planning methods

1. Introduction
Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is a debilitating and acute inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system characterized by rapid-onset muscle weakness and paralysis, often leading to significant morbidity and sometimes mortality. The exact etiology of GBS remains incompletely understood, but it is widely accepted that an aberrant immune response plays a central role in its pathogenesis. The involvement of both cellular immunity—primarily T cells—and humoral immunity, particularly antibodies directed against gangliosides on peripheral nerves, suggests a complex interplay within the immune system.
Traditional therapeutic approaches to GBS have relied heavily on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE). Both interventions have shown efficacy in reducing disease severity and improving patient outcomes; however, they are not without limitations. Not all patients respond optimally to these treatments, and adverse effects can occur. Moreover, no new therapeutics specifically targeting GBS have been approved in the past decade despite significant advances in understanding the disease at a molecular level.
In response to this unmet clinical need, researchers are increasingly focusing on novel immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at more precisely modulating the immune response in GBS patients. These innovative approaches involve targeting various components related to antibodies against nerve structures, complement pathways activation which escalates nerve damage, specific immune cells involved in initiating or perpetuating inflammation as well as cytokines acting as critical modulators of the immune environment.
2. Current Standard Therapies

1. Introduction
In recent years, microneedles have emerged as a transformative technology in the field of biomedical applications. Their unique ability to offer minimally invasive routes for drug delivery and biosensing has positioned them as an attractive alternative to traditional methods such as hypodermic needles and oral drug delivery systems. The development of microneedles is driven by their potential to improve patient compliance, reduce pain, and provide precise control over drug release and substance extraction.
Microneedles are designed to penetrate the outermost layer of skin, known as the stratum corneum, without reaching nerve-rich deeper tissues—thereby making the procedure virtually painless while allowing for efficient transdermal delivery or monitoring. Realizing these benefits requires meticulous selection of materials and fabrication techniques that translate into the desired mechanical strength, biocompatibility, degradation profile, and application-specific functionalities.
This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of microneedle materials first by examining various types including metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites. We will look into their mechanical properties like hardness and Young's modulus which are critical in ensuring structural integrity during insertion into the skin. This section will also discuss factors like biocompatibility—which ensures no adverse reaction within biological systems—and degradability where applicable.
Following this material analysis is an exploration of fabrication methods: from traditional lithography-based processes to advanced manufacturing technologies such as 3D printing. Each technique offers different advantages in terms of precision control over needle geometry—be it solid or hollow—as well as scalability for mass production.
Finally, we delve into diverse biomedical applications illustrating how these tiny yet powerful tools can revolutionize practices across various domains—from direct therapeutic interventions like insulin delivery for diabetics to sophisticated sensing platforms capable of real-time health monitoring.
2. Materials for Microneedles
The selection process for suitable microneedle materials encompasses several key factors: mechanical strength needed during insertion (hardness and Young’s modulus), ease-of-fabrication (geometric configuration), interaction with biological tissues (biocompatibility), functionality longevity (degradability). Various material categories have been explored including:
2.1 Metals:
Metals such as stainless steel or titanium exhibit high strength-to-size ratios making them ideal candidates when mechanical robustness is paramount—a feature particularly useful in applications requiring repeated use like biosensors integrated within wearable devices measuring glucose levels continuously over extended periods;

Endometrial cancer, which originates in the lining of the uterus, is one of the most common gynecologic malignancies. With an increasing prevalence globally, understanding modifiable risk factors is crucial for prevention and early intervention strategies. Sedentary behaviour, characterized by low energy expenditure activities such as sitting or reclining, has emerged as one significant factor associated with various health outcomes including cardiovascular diseases and cancers.
The term "sedentary behaviour" encompasses multiple domains including occupational (related to work), leisure-time (activities performed during free time such as watching TV), and total sedentary behaviour (the cumulative time spent being inactive). A growing body of literature has indicated that prolonged sedentary time may elevate the risk for developing endometrial cancer; however, variations exist based on specific behavioural contexts. Understanding these domain-specific associations can help tailor interventions targeting reductions in sedentary behaviour for different populations.
2. Methods
In pursuit to delineate these associations comprehensively, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. The literature search involved databases such as PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE until 28 February 2023. An initial screening of titles and abstracts was followed by full-text reviews to identify studies evaluating relationships between domain-specific sedentary behaviours and endometrial cancer incidence.
Two independent reviewers were tasked with data extraction using predefined forms encompassing study characteristics (e.g., population size), outcome measures (e.g., relative risks), adjustments considered (e.g., BMI), along with quality appraisal adhering to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria.
For statistical synthesis in meta-analyses involving continuous variables like relative risks or odds ratios from individual studies pooled using a random-effects model via inverse variance methods for enhanced generalizability despite potential heterogeneity among included studies quantified I² statistics interpreted under standard thresholds (>50% representing substantial heterogeneity).

1. Introduction
Calcaneal apophysitis, also known as Sever’s disease, is a common cause of heel pain in children and adolescents, particularly those who are physically active. It primarily affects children between the ages of 8 and 15 years during their growth spurts. The condition results from inflammation of the growth plate (apophysis) in the calcaneus (heel bone), potentially leading to significant discomfort and disruption in daily activities.
The early identification of potential risk factors (RFs) and associated factors (AFs) is essential for preventing and managing Sever’s disease effectively. Understanding these factors can guide clinical assessment, enable targeted interventions, enhance recovery rates, and possibly mitigate long-term consequences in affected individuals.
2. Methods
This systematic review was conducted following comprehensive guidelines to assess both intrinsic and extrinsic RFs, AFs, as well as outcomes associated with calcaneal apophysitis. We systematically searched various databases including the Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science until April 2021 to ensure a thorough collection of relevant literature.
Cohort studies along with case-control studies focusing on participants younger than 18 years were included provided they assessed or identified RFs or AFs related to CA development. Studies published in other languages except English or Spanish were excluded to maintain clarity among reviewers.
Two reviewers independently screened articles using a pre-defined criterion involving study characteristics such as participant age range under 18 years who exhibited symptoms indicative or predisposed to CA development through various physiological factors like limitations in mobility or anatomical misalignments.

1. Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the most formidable challenges in oncology, being the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Despite extensive research and advancements in screening and treatment modalities, CRC still constitutes a significant public health burden due to its high incidence and mortality rates. A deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying CRC tumorigenesis is crucial for developing targeted therapies that can improve patient outcomes.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are a subset of non-coding RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides, have emerged as key regulators in various biological processes including chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional processing, and signal transduction. Unlike protein-coding genes, lncRNAs do not translate into proteins but can influence gene expression through diverse mechanisms such as acting as molecular sponges for microRNAs or interacting with RNA-binding proteins.
Recent studies have highlighted the aberrant expression patterns of lncRNAs in numerous cancers including CRC. These dysregulated lncRNAs affect oncogenic pathways by promoting cell proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, enhancing metastasis, and contributing to drug resistance. Among these pathways is the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which plays a pivotal role in cellular growth control by integrating signals from nutrients, growth factors, and energy status.
The mTOR signaling pathway is integral to regulating cell metabolism by controlling processes such as protein synthesis autophagy lipid biosynthesis nucleotide biosynthesis Hence alterations within this pathway can significantly affect cellular homeostasis resulting in oncogenesis Consequently investigating how specific lncRNAs interface with mTOR may yield important insights into molecular events driving colorectal carcinogenesis
This systematic review aims to elucidate potential interactions between abnormally expressed mTOR-associated lncRNAs during CRC progression By identifying specific lncRNA candidates impacting tumors via mTOR activation or repression we hope our findings will guide future research efforts focused on novel therapeutics targeting these intricate networks As such comprehensive analysis based on PRISMA guidelines was conducted incorporating published articles across seven databases To our knowledge this represents one among first attempts scrutinizing intersectionality between conjoined regulatory frameworks involving both elements systematically.

1. Introduction
The rapid urbanization and economic development of Beijing have led to many public health challenges, among which smoking-related diseases are particularly prominent. Tobacco use remains a major preventable cause of morbidity and mortality globally, including in China. Recognizing this pressing issue, Beijing has implemented extensive tobacco control measures that align with the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). Understanding the effectiveness of these policies necessitates a comprehensive evaluation through Health Impact Assessment (HIA) methodologies.
Health Impact Assessment is a multidisciplinary process that evaluates the potential health effects of policies, programs, or projects on communities and populations. By incorporating both quantitative and qualitative analyses, HIA frameworks ensure informed decision-making that prioritizes public health outcomes. The scoping stage of HIA is crucial as it defines the boundaries and identifies key indicators for subsequent analysis stages.
This study specifically aims to identify robust indicators for evaluating Beijing's tobacco control policy using a modified Delphi process combined with established theoretical models—the Driving forces-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) model and the Determinants of Health Theory. These models help organize complex interactions between various factors influencing public health outcomes.
2. Methodology
To achieve our aims, this study engaged thirteen experts from diverse fields such as epidemiology, public health policy, biostatistics, clinical medicine, sociology, environmental science, and economics—ensuring comprehensive perspectives in indicator selection.
2.1 Modified Delphi Process
The Delphi technique is iterative consensus-building methodology often used in complex decision-making processes where expert judgment is paramount. In each round of surveys administered digitally:
- Experts were provided with a list format derived from literature reviews.
- They rated each proposed indicator based on pre-defined criteria: relevance to tobacco control policy objectives; measurability; sensitivity to change over time; ease-of-understanding by stakeholders.
Indicators receiving above 80% total scores were retained while those remaining had high standard deviation discarded scenarios due exclusion threshold considerations ensuring robustness final configuration yielding 23 operational components future assessments targeting underlying mechanisms approached consistently repeated observations documenting incident evolvement across implementational particulars geographic subtleties sensed integrally presented meant timely informed consequential actions comprehensively anchored evidentiary foundation rigorously instrumental scaling impactful coverage coherent expanse feasibly sustaining direct vetted reporting pertinent diagnostic contexts enabling preventative interventionist ramifications fundamentally driven premise conscientiously covering addressed concerns arising openly acknowledged arrayed participatively confirmatively bolstered stakeholder engagement reinforcing trembles supportive scaffold turnkey insightful comprehensions instigative application refinements embodying efficacious metric compilations practical illustrative expositions advancing practice enrich phenomena elucidated concretely procedural augment strategically tying concentage outset deliverance cohort implicative disciplines evincing cascade propagation disseminates empirical effusiveness modulated responsiveness equitably reflective delegated precision allocated factual extents delineating discursive realignment reframes structural fitment efficiency gains conclusively scaled pertinence empirical customization formative baselines modality adjustments convergent thus albeit internal synchronized content curations expressed analytica pathways contextual adherence paradigm facilitating transferable usages systematically parameter selective increments duly homogenous accord universal benchmark adherence statutory compliance exemplar trails inferred disposition establishing cardinal pivot archetypical axiomatically approach predilections instance derivative specificity holistically pragmatic inflectional summation drawn linear relatibility enclosing inventive phase-outs authentications integral assets respectively iterant infra-legged directives transitional parentage perseverative function linkings evidences correlated thematic buildups phasic integrities dynamically adaptive arenas induces conducive innately provencially variant wield better-matched frames calibrational exigencies trend caseload derivativation equilibrium rendered perceptual linkage commonly adhere cohesive eventual proponents vet summarized routinely immersely catalogued enriching fortuitous platform actuaries satis vaccinated conversion intrinsically pervades systematically compositional modular facets constitutively commuter iterative synergism recipromises contextually reliant determinant equivalency forming longititudinal diversified appropriately met advantageous hum anchoring validity cumul Historique magnitude submissory inherently intervals research-led evaluatory definitory executions synopsis perf assessments adjunct knowledge emboded ultimately conclusive narr lapping respective governed conform Exemplar preserving panned emphasis presented yield rounded forward clarifying primal advantage hindsight based longitudinal adjiential em cum transformational comply scaffolded parab mobile digital inherently instrumental stated nonmetric constatedly dimension enforcement responsibilities succinct optimized observant evaluated predictive constitutive Discipline controlled interval pathway simpience extrapolated integra mut strategic rever periodic sustain

1. Introduction
Stem cells possess the remarkable ability to self-renew and differentiate into various lineages, leading to their critical roles in developmental biology and tissue homeostasis. The regulatory mechanisms underlying these capacities are complex and multifaceted, involving intricate gene expression programs, epigenetic modifications, and post-transcriptional RNA modifications. Among the latter, RNA editing—specifically adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1)—has emerged as a pivotal determinant of stem cell fate decisions.
RNA editing introduces diversity into the transcriptome by altering nucleotide sequences at the RNA level, thereby modifying codons within coding regions or affecting splicing sites within non-coding regions. ADAR1 catalyzes this conversion of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), with inosine being read as guanosine by cellular machinery. This seemingly simple modification can have profound implications for gene expression regulation, impacting mRNA stability, miRNA processing, and protein function.
The structure of ADAR1 comprises several domains that confer its functional versatility: two Z-DNA-binding domains (Zα), three double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD), and a catalytic deaminase domain essential for its enzymatic activity. These features equip ADAR1 to partake in various biological processes beyond mere RNA editing—including interactions with components of innate immunity pathways like the interferon response—highlighting its multifaceted role within cellular physiology.
2. Role of ADAR1 in Stem Cell Self-Renewal
Stem cell self-renewal maintains an undifferentiated state while allowing cells to proliferate indefinitely—a hallmark feature distinguishing stem cells from somatic counterparts. Recent insights underscore how ADAR1-driven RNA editing modulates this delicate balance.
In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where pluripotency is tightly regulated through transcription factors such as OCT4, SOX2,and NANOG along with signaling pathways like Wnt/β-catenin or TGF-β/Smad pathways—the introduction of precise dsRNA edits governs transcript isoform switching pertinent for maintaining pluripotency versus initiating differentiation cues. For instance, specific A-to-I edits impacting critical regulators may promote alternative splicing events that stabilize pluripotent states or earmark differentiation trajectories based on environmental cues sensed by ESCs.
Additionally,in spatial contexts where adult stem/progenitor compartments persist —such as hematopoietic niches housed within bone marrow stroma—ADAR-mediated editomic shifts orchestrate lineage fidelity during hematopoiesis through nuanced regulation over target mRNAs essential for balanced myeloid versus lymphoid lineage outputs under distinct physiological conditions or stresses encountered systemically(e.g., immune challenge).
3.ADARI In Differentiation Pathways

**1. Introduction**
The rapid evolution of technology and the integration of digital resources into healthcare education have transformed how information is conveyed, particularly in Nursing. Educational videos have emerged as an effective tool for training purposes due to their ability to visually communicate complex information in an engaging and accessible manner. These tools are especially useful for demonstrating clinical skills, patient care procedures, health promotion interventions, and ethical practices within a nursing context.
Nursing professionals play a crucial role in educational video production both through their subject-matter expertise and direct experiences with patients. Producing high-quality educational videos entails knowledge not only of nursing but also of multimedia content creation principles like scriptwriting, filming techniques, editing procedures, and audience engagement strategies.
While various projects reveal innovative approaches by combining pedagogical methodologies with technological advancements, an integrative review focusing on the systematic evaluation of these methodologies is scarce. This study aims to fill that gap by examining scientific evidence regarding the processes used by Nursing professionals in creating educational videos.
**2. Methodology**

1. Introduction
Malnutrition remains a critical public health challenge globally, affecting millions of children, particularly in developing countries where economic constraints and healthcare limitations complicate its management. While food scarcity is a recognized contributor to malnutrition, disease-related malnutrition represents a significant yet often underexplored dimension of this problem. Chronic diseases in pediatric populations pose additional risks for growth impairment and developmental delays due to the interplay between the disease process and nutritional needs.
Pediatric patients suffering from chronic conditions such as congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, chronic kidney disease, and HIV/AIDS are particularly vulnerable to malnutritional complications. These conditions have multifactorial impacts on nutrition—ranging from decreased nutrient intake due to reduced appetite or dietary restrictions to increased metabolic demands precipitated by the body's response to illness.
The identification and management of malnutrition in children with chronic diseases necessitate timely intervention strategies backed by accurate diagnostic tools. However, resource limitations in developing countries render conventional approaches challenging. There is an urgent need for context-adapted methodologies that balance accuracy with feasibility within these constrained settings.
2. Importance of Addressing Pediatric Malnutrition
Proper nutrition during childhood is pivotal for physical growth, cognitive development, immune function enhancement, and overall health outcomes later in life. Malnourished children are at heightened risk for infectious diseases due to compromised immune systems and are more likely than their well-nourished peers to face long-term health consequences including stunting (reduced height-for-age) and wasting (reduced weight-for-height).
For pediatric patients with chronic illnesses who may already be coping with significant medical challenges, addressing malnutritional risks becomes even more critical—it impacts not only their immediate quality of life but also potential recovery outcomes and survivorship into adulthood.
3. Methodology
This narrative review systematically analyzed literature available between 1990-2021 across two reputable databases: PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus—utilizing keywords such as “pediatric chronic disease,” “malnutrition,” “developing countries,” along with specific condition variants like "congenital heart disease" or "HIV/AIDS." A total of 31 eligible publications were identified reflecting varied geographical research outputs focusing on different aspects—epidemiology insight conveyed through nutritional assessments data illustrating prevalence rates; discussions around barriers faced by healthcare providers; critiques over existing screening protocols; comparative analysis drawn from both high-income versus low-/middle-income country scenarios shedding light onto broader global disparities.
4. Defining Malnutrition & Screening Tools

Cardiomyopathies represent a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by impaired structure and function of the myocardium. These can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and ultimately increased mortality. Traditionally, studies have primarily focused on protein-coding genes due to their direct roles in biological functions. However, recent advancements in genomics have elucidated the critical importance of noncoding regions of the genome, previously considered "junk DNA," in regulating gene expression and contributing to disease phenotypes.
Noncoding regions make up approximately 98% of the human genome and include elements such as enhancers, promoters, introns, untranslated regions (UTRs), microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), regulatory sequences, pseudogenes, and more. These elements play crucial roles in various cellular processes through transcriptional regulation or post-transcriptional modulation.
In cardiomyopathies—like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D)—noncoding variants are emerging as significant molecular players influencing genetic predisposition and disease progression.
2. Transcriptional Enhancers
Enhancers are short DNA sequences that can significantly increase transcription levels from target promoters regardless of their position relative to these promoters. Variations within enhancer regions can disrupt binding sites for transcription factors essential for cardiac function.
Several studies highlight the role of enhancers in cardiac development and diseases:
- A study identified an enhancer upstream from Myosin Heavy Chain Alpha gene (*MYH6*) associated with HCM where variant disruptions inhibit SRF binding.
- Enhancer-influenced dysregulation at *TBX5* loci has been implicated with congenital heart defects which shares genetic overlap with some forms of DCM.
Functional assays involving CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletions further validate enhancer dysfunction as a contributor towards pathological hERG (*KCNH2*) channels observed widely across various ethnicities presenting diverse forms spectrum ranging symptomatic continuum registered even asymptomatic variants thus emphasizing multi-dimensional profiling clinical scenario mandates rigorous probe...

1. Introduction
Lung cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, largely due to its often late-stage diagnosis and the complexity of its management. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases, with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) having revolutionized the therapeutic approach to this aggressive disease. ICIs, particularly those targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways, have been integrated into treatment regimens for advanced and metastatic NSCLC stages as well as in the peri-operative setting.
Despite these advances, not all patients with NSCLC benefit from ICI therapy. The heterogeneous nature of tumor biology across different patient populations necessitates reliable predictive biomarkers to tailor treatment strategies effectively. While PD-L1 expression on tumor cells has been a pivotal biomarker guiding ICI therapy choices, it is not infallible and often requires invasive tissue biopsy procedures which may not always be feasible or representative due to tumor heterogeneity.
Emerging research indicates that liquid biopsies could offer a less invasive and potentially more accurate alternative for predicting ICI response in NSCLC patients. Liquid biopsies encompass various soluble biomarkers present in body fluids such as blood that can reflect both tumor-specific characteristics and host immune responses.

The introduction of this review aims to set the stage for a comprehensive understanding of the phylogeography of sharks and rays, with an emphasis on synthesizing existing knowledge and identifying patterns driven by life history traits and biogeographic partitions.
1. Introduction
Sharks and rays, collectively known as elasmobranchs, are among the ocean’s top predators. Their ecological roles in marine environments are significant—they help maintain the health of reef systems, regulate prey populations, and balance marine ecosystems. However, these species face severe conservation challenges due to their intrinsic biological traits combined with increasing anthropogenic pressures such as overfishing, habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and bycatch in commercial fishing operations.
Life history traits such as slow growth rates, late sexual maturity (often several years to decades), long lifespans, low fecundity (with some species giving birth to only a few offspring every few years), high levels of parental investment per offspring (whether through live birth or encapsulated eggs) make sharks and rays particularly vulnerable. These traits result in naturally low population productivity meaning that they cannot recover quickly from over-exploitation or habitat loss.
Conservation strategies for elasmobranchs require robust scientific data including insights into their population genetic structure which can inform about their evolutionary history and contemporary gene flow dynamics. Phylogeography offers a powerful toolset for examining genetic diversity across spatial scales which is fundamental in understanding how historical events such as glaciations or sea-level changes shaped current distributions as well as predicting future responses under climate change scenarios.
In this review aimed at synthesizing global patterns observed from mtDNA cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) sequence data obtained from 40 shark species spanning 17 genera compared with 19 ray species across 11 genera. Given that mtDNA evolves relatively rapidly among vertebrates it serves an excellent marker for establishing genealogies within recent evolutionary time frames (<1 My).

Nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO) is a cardiovascular emergency analogous to acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This ophthalmologic condition leads to blockage of the central retinal artery, resulting in sudden and severe loss of vision. The presentation may be alarming and prompt significant concern due to the dramatic visual impairment, usually occurring abruptly. Despite the ominous manifestation, therapeutic approaches for NA-CRAO are limited, reflecting an optimal area for translating advancements from related fields such as AIS.
1. Introduction
NA-CRAO serves as a striking model for studying ischemia within end-organs supplied by terminal arteries devoid of collateral circulation – akin to cerebral strokes. Understanding NA-CRAO through the lens of ocular neuroprotection offers tantalizing windows into preserving neural tissue post-insult and enhancing recovery prospects.
Acute interventions have varied efficacy; traditionally focused on reperfusion strategies like ocular massage or paracentesis aimed at dislodging emboli within therapeutic timeframes—approaches with inconsistent success rates necessitating more structured protocols guided by robust evidence.
Therefore, drawing parallels with AIS could inform evolving paradigms in CRAO management where current guidelines foreground emergent patient care, through effective leveraging cerebrovascular knowledge into ocular settings. Advances in neuroprotective agents promise not only conserved neural integrity but ripple towards functional recovery—a domain ripe with investigational endeavors manifesting translational potential from bench-to-bedside concepts towards clinical realities harnessed within ophthalmology morphing paradigms therein.
2. The Relevance of Neuroprotection in CRAO
Neuroprotective strategies aim at delaying or ameliorating neuronal death post-insult while maintaining cellular homeostasis imperative for functional restoration constituting a fundamental adjunct to reperfusion efforts extending feasible therapeutic windows amplifying rescue outcomes sustainably.

1. Introduction
Postoperative pain management is a critical component of perioperative care, especially in colorectal surgeries where inadequate pain control can significantly impact patient recovery, satisfaction, and overall outcomes. Transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) has gained traction as an effective regional anesthetic technique to control postoperative pain by anesthetizing the nerves supplying the anterior abdominal wall.
Minimally invasive colorectal surgery (MICS), encompassing laparoscopic and robotic-assisted techniques, enhances recovery processes through smaller incisions, less tissue trauma, and quicker resumption of normal activities compared to traditional open surgery. Effective pain management strategies are paramount in MICS to fully leverage these benefits.
While ultrasound-guided TAPB (US-TAPB) has been widely studied and implemented for its precision and efficacy in administering local anesthetic agents into the transversus abdominis plane under real-time visualization, laparoscopic-guided TAPB (L-TAPB) offers another promising approach due to the proximity of surgical equipment already in situ during minimally invasive procedures.
Despite their respective advantages, there is debate around whether L-TAPB or US-TAPB provides superior analgesic effects with lower opioid consumption postoperatively—a crucial consideration given the global focus on minimizing opioid-related adverse effects. Additionally, safety concerns associated with either modality warrant rigorous evaluation.
Emerging studies have explored various facets of US-TAPB versus L-TAPB but present conflicting results about their relative effectiveness in mitigating postoperative pain and reducing opioid needs. Discrepancies may arise from differences in study designs, population characteristics, intervention protocols including type and volume of local anesthetics used, timing of blockade administration relative to surgery completion or anesthesia induction/maintenance phases.
Given this heterogeneity among individual studies tackling TAPBs impact on postoperative analgesia within MICS scope per se prompts further investigation using systematic meta-analytic approaches addressing both direct head-to-head comparisons between modalities whilst accommodating indirect comparisons against standard systemic opioids alone if necessary enhancing robustness via comprehensive synthesis deriving clinically meaningful conclusions subsequently guiding evidence-based practice delineations accordingly hence bases iterative future research exploratory endeavors therein expressly therefore our outlined protocol seeks semblant answers inherent regard definitive appraisal ...

1. Introduction
Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) technology has emerged as a revolutionary approach to replicate the structural and functional properties of human tissues in vitro. By incorporating microfluidic channels, these devices can re-create not only the cellular architecture but also the dynamic biochemical environment of organs, providing a more physiologically relevant model than traditional 2D cell cultures or static 3D cultures. The potential applications of OOC devices are vast and varied, ranging from drug development and personalized medicine to environmental toxicology and disease modeling.
Despite these advancements, one of the foremost challenges in adopting OOC for widespread research is the integration with sophisticated analytical techniques that can provide real-time data on cellular responses. Real-time analysis is crucial for understanding dynamic biological processes such as cell metabolism, signaling pathways, and drug uptake/release kinetics. Mass spectrometry (MS), with its unmatched ability to perform qualitative and quantitative analyses at high sensitivity and specificity levels, stands out as a powerful tool for this purpose.
However, integrating MS with OOC platforms presents substantial technical hurdles. The main issue arises from incompatibilities between typical culture media used in OOCs—which often contain nonvolatile buffers—and MS systems designed primarily for volatilizable analytes under high-vacuum conditions. Researchers have consequently developed various sample pre-treatment strategies to bridge this gap effectively.
2. Advances in Sample Pre-treatment Techniques
To address the challenge of hyphenating an organ-on-a-chip system directly with mass spectrometry without compromising data quality or instrument performance requires innovative approaches in sample pretreatment immediately after elution from the chip.
2.1 Miniaturized Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE)
One promising strategy involves miniaturized solid-phase extraction (SPE). SPE allows selective enrichment and desalinization of samples by concentrating analytes while removing salts that may interfere with MS analysis:
- **Methodology**: Miniaturized SPE formats utilize micro-columns packed with specific sorbent materials tailored to capture target analytes.
- **Advantages**: This technique provides clean samples suitable for direct introduction into mass spectrometers.
- **Limitations**: It can be limited by throughput capacity when dealing with large volumes commonly needed for real-time monitoring.
2.2 Liquid Chromatography Integration
Integrating liquid chromatography (LC) directly between an organ-on-a-chip outlet and MS interface serves dual purposes—effective separation complemented by desalting capability:
- **Methodology**: Micro-LC systems employ miniaturized columns operating under low-flow regimes compatible with typical organ flow rates.
- **Advantages**: LC not only purifies but separates complex mixtures allowing individual component detection/characterization via tandem-MS/MS workflows.
- **Limitations**: Requires careful calibration/alignment ensuring no significant delay hampering real-time monitoring capabilities demanded during live tracking & observation studies within bio-assays performed upon devices formed under this paradigm area coupled subject matter affinity spaces explored routinely investigatively deployed resources aligned accurately indeed intrinsically anchored therewithin systematically refined parameters accordingly always ensure rectifiable pathways resolved efficaciously untouched novel areas further elaboration unambiguously determined yield outcomes articulated precisely overall efficiently proper presentation expected results similarly requisite operationally industry standards respectively maintained succinct adherence frameworks provided consistently embedded fundamentally necessary guiding principles constituting primacy diligence exercised diligently oriented purposes served scientific aims concerted efforts achieved unified conclusively brought forth knowledge positively affirmed advantageous every instance demonstrably likewise inclusive similar collaborative endeavored aligned synergy intersecting interdisciplinary studied focused progressively ratifiable hallmarked stewardship universally accepted coherent fabricated!

1. Introduction
Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), including conditions such as arthritis, back pain, and sports injuries, are prevalent health concerns that impair physical function and quality of life (QoL). They pose a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide due to the high costs associated with treatment and the loss of productivity. Traditionally, rehabilitation programs for MSDs have focused on conventional methods like physical therapy exercises conducted in clinical settings under professional supervision. While effective to some extent, these conventional approaches face limitations related to accessibility, adherence issues due to logistical constraints or motivation lapses among patients, and resources available at healthcare centers.
Over recent years, digital healthcare (DHC) solutions have emerged as promising adjuncts or alternatives to traditional methods of rehabilitation for MSDs. Leveraging advancements in technology—including mobile applications (apps), telemedicine platforms, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), wearable devices with biofeedback capabilities—DHC aims to provide accessible and personalized therapeutic interventions outside of conventional clinical settings.
Such interventions may offer several advantages: increased frequency and consistency of exercise routines through remote monitoring; enhanced patient engagement via interactive content; tailored feedback from AI-driven algorithms; real-time communication with healthcare providers; comprehensive tracking of progress using integrated data analytics features—all fostering improved adherence rates among users while reducing recurring visits necessitated by traditional means alone.

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating ongoing advancements in detection and therapy. The recognition and targeting of tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) have emerged as critical aspects of cancer research due to their unique presence on the surface of malignant cells. However, the thick glycocalyx surrounding tumour cells often hinders conventional therapies from accessing these targets. This paper delves into innovative approaches involving small antibody fragments designed to efficiently target TACAs, thus potentially revolutionizing cancer treatment.
2. Tumour-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens (TACAs)
Tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens are glycan structures that are aberrantly expressed on the surface of tumour cells. These changes in glycosylation patterns can be a result of altered enzymatic activity during oncogenic transformation, leading to differences in cell-cell adhesion, migration, immune evasion, and metastasis. Common examples include sialyl Lewis A (CA19-9), Thomsen-nouveau antigen (Tn), sialyl-Tn (STn), and Globo H antigen.
These TACAs present a unique set of challenges for therapeutic targeting due to their dense molecular environment within the glycocalyx—a mesh-like barrier composed predominantly of polysaccharides interspersed with various protein structures including mucins—that effectively shields underlying epitopes from therapeutic agents.
3. Conventional Monoclonal Antibodies 
Monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized cancer therapy over recent decades owing to their specificity towards unique antigens found on malignant cells. Therapies such as rituximab for CD20-positive B cell lymphomas or trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancers exemplify this trend.
Nonetheless, monoclonal antibodies have intrinsic limitations: their large size (~150 kDa) restricts diffusion through solid tumours' microenvironments; they may elicit immune responses against themselves; they also require extensive modifications for humanization reducing immunogenicity which complicates production processes increasing costs substantially—all contributing barriers particularly salient when considering intricate yet densely packed TACAs application sites less accessible previously mentioned reasons among others requiring novel strategies surpass these obstacles eventually realized via introducing smaller equivalents pioneering discussions herein reviewed next sections details highlighting advantages therein described subsequently .
4 . Small Antibody Fragments 
To counteract aforementioned hindrances associated larger monoclonals fragmentation techniques developed yielding varied forms smaller naturally occurring sub-components original molecule fulfilling intended functional roles albeit reduced fabrication timeframe downstream expenses notably enhancing potential efficacy shown below detailed comparative summaries respective methodologies initial broad classification follows three primary derivative categories viz., Fab fragment , scFv segment linkerless constructs origins Initially derived cleavage proteases comprises variable heavy VL domain constant simple retain functio nal connectivities indispensable retains binding affinities associated prototypes moving stepwise adoption entails coupling generating interconnected molecule single entity avoiding dependencies additional linking component flexibly achieving orthogonally modified activities conferment necessary effector capabilities targeted applications conjugations separate moieties enabling multipronged attack converging singular complex variably specified bindings proportions incidental reflect minimizations geometric confinement interruptions facilitated engineering efforts producing bi-specific tri-specific expanding realm versatile configurations tactical design ingenuity proficiently utilizing further development assessment pertinent regulated trials ensuring safety ramifications evaluated inclusively paramount implementations future modifications envision progressive evolution technologically advanced integrations facilitative broader deployable interventions protracted scenario . 5. Bi- and Tri-Specific Antibodies
To overcome some of the limitations posed by traditional monoclonal antibodies, researchers have developed bi-specific and tri-specific antibodies. These innovative agents are designed to recognize two or three different antigens simultaneously, thereby offering enhanced targeting capabilities. This multi-targeting approach can amplify therapeutic efficacy by engaging more than one mechanism of action—such as simultaneously binding to cancer cells and cytotoxic T-cells, facilitating direct immune-mediated tumor destruction.
For example, the bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) blinatumomab brings together CD3-positive T-cells with CD19-positive B-cell malignancies, effectively bringing the cytotoxic machinery directly to the cancer cells. Similarly, trispecific antibodies extend this concept further by incorporating an additional binding site that could target another cell surface protein or engage a secondary immune pathway.
**Advantages of Multi-Specific Antibodies:**
- Enhanced Specificity: By targeting multiple antigens simultaneously, these constructs reduce off-target effects and increase on-target therapeutic action.
- Improved Functionality: They can bridge effector cells like cytotoxic lymphocytes directly to tumor cells for enhanced immunological responses.
- Reduced Resistance: The likelihood of tumor resistance decreases as it becomes more challenging for cancerous cells to mutate all targeted antigens simultaneously.
**Challenges in Development:** 
Despite their promise, designing stable multi-specific antibodies with retained functional activities poses significant challenges. Ensuring proper folding and maintaining stability are critical issues that necessitate sophisticated engineering solutions.
6. Nanobodies and Single-Domain Antibodies
Nanobodies™, single-domain variants derived from camelid-derived heavy chain-only antibodies (VHH), represent another promising direction for antibody therapy evolution. Due to their significantly smaller size (~15 kDa), nanobodies exhibit improved tissue penetration compared to classical monoclonal antibodies (~150 kDa). Besides lower production costs due mainly simpler expression systems generating these proteins efficiently desirable attributes enforced inherently:

1. Introduction
Dibenzo[b,f]heteropines, which include dibenzo[b,f]azepines, are heterocyclic compounds featuring a seven-membered ring flanked by two benzene rings and additional heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur integrated into the ring system. These compounds have garnered significant interest within the chemical community due to their diverse biological activities and functional applications in materials science.
The prominent presence of dibenzo[b,f]azepine frameworks in biologically active molecules such as the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, antidepressant imipramine, and anxiolytic drugs exemplifies their medicinal importance. Furthermore, their roles have expanded beyond pharmaceuticals into realms like organic electronics—where these compounds facilitate key functions in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Additionally, the inclusion of these core structures in catalysts and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offers promising avenues for new material innovations.
Given this wide array of functionalities across multiple disciplines, a comprehensive understanding of synthetic strategies for crafting dibenzo[b,f]heteropines is essential. Various traditional transition-metal-catalyzed methods and contemporary green chemistry approaches have been developed to meet this challenge. In addition to elaborating on established routes such as cyclization reactions employing substrates like ortho-terarylarylamines undergoing oxidative cyclization or Fischer indole synthesis adaptations; we will also discuss novel methodologies leveraging modern advancements such as microwave-assisted synthesis or advanced photocatalytic methods.
2. Conventional Synthesis Approaches
A classic method to synthesize dibenzo[b,f]azepines includes the application of transition-metal-catalyzed cyclizations where palladium- or copper-mediated protocols prevail due to their efficiency coupled with broad substrate applicability. For instance:
2a. Palladium-Catalyzed Reactions:
One conventional route employs palladium-catalyzed amination using halogenated biphenyl derivatives coupled with primary amines under optimized conditions lending access readily synthesizable dibenzo-structures yielding high purity products alongside good scalability parameters rendering it industry-friendly.
2b. Copper-Mediated Strategies:
Cu-mediated Ullmann-type couplings uniquely activate aryl halides which proceed via radical intermediates forming C-N bonds directly transforming varied reactants harmonious conversion processes showcasing remarkable mechanistic elegance besides operational simplicity advantageous from an industrial viewpoint accommodating heterogeneous reaction environments enabling facile product separation post-reaction utilizing simplified chromatographic steps reducing purification labor while amplifying resource-efficient usage mitigating waste generation ecologically favorably contributing towards sustainable chemistry solutions paradigms increasingly pivotal amid mounting environmental stipulations globally accentuating greener methodological preferences concurrently catering scientific rigor corpusemission bounded criteria expeditiously proliferative extensive library-generation potent scaffolding further exploration intrinsic pharmaceutical properties systematically elucidating structure-function paradigms anchoring novel derivative identification fostering precise targeted drug-design initiatives maximizing therapeutic index sustainably specifically high-throughput screening campaigns aimed discerningly versatile lead candidates accelerated development pipelines foreseen paradigm shifts emerging pharmacodynamics profiles thorough elaboration complex bio-network interactions systems pharmacology expanding horizons clinical translational impacts fundamentally reinvigorating moribund therapeutic segments revitalizing transformative scope renewed practical implementations catalytically interfaced molecular-level ingenuity harnessing adept multi-functional frameworks revolutionary trajectories persistent innovation propelling forefront future frontiers seamlessly augments holistic integration methodologies ubiquitously addressing converging interdisciplinary challenges epitomizing wider societal relevance adoptive circular economy principles promissory broad-spectrum dividends undeterred envisioning enduring resilience transformational chemistries scalable accessible affordable safe environmentally benign harmoniously consistent pervasive overarching strategic sustainability imperatives holistically ingrained across board quintessential scientific ethos axiomatically veritable alchemical renaissance reimagined resplendent own right prospective evolutions manifold embodiments unfalteringly beckoning horizon forward-together unquestionable hallmark epoch defining closing frontiers emergent catalytic revolutions contemporaneously poised reverberate extensive transcending dimensional field confines perpetuity boundlessly innovatively envisioned dynamic symbiosis keenly anticipated potentials usher momentous recalibrations ontological conceptions bridging realms seamlessly integrative reconciliatory sustainable exponentiality invariably emboldened toward heightened convivial aspirations endeavorers thus critically transformative modalities engender cross-sectoral convergence pathway realization aspirational entirety substantial impactful long-lasting socio-economic realities exuding cardinal rethinking elicits concertedly cohesive repurposing diligent explorations extending multifaceted domain significantly bolstered collectively pioneering chemistries corporately envisioned expedited exemplary synergies imperative actualization realizing consequential defined avant-garde enabling tactful insightful engagement reciprocally synergistically inclusively beckons forthwith conscientiously presiding burgeoning diaspora inherent systematic adaptability versatility profoundly encapsulating unerringly aligned equitable visionary reconceptualized pathways breakthrough incumbency pre-destined inexorable enticing propound enriched perpetually extensible inquiries astutely evolving futuristic frontier striving towards progressive holistic systemic evolutionary dogmatic exploration trajectory...

1. Introduction
Cervical cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide, principally due to persistent infections with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types such as HPV-16 and HPV-18. The molecular pathogenesis underlying HPV-induced carcinogenesis involves the expression of viral oncoproteins, particularly E6 and E7, which are crucial in subverting normal cellular control mechanisms and promoting malignant transformation. As these oncoproteins disrupt critical regulatory pathways, they contribute to the escape from immune surveillance that typically prevents the emergence and proliferation of neoplastic cells.
A pivotal aspect facilitating this escape is the upregulation of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells. PD-L1 interacts with its receptor, programmed death-1 (PD-1), which is highly expressed on exhausted T lymphocytes within tumor microenvironments. This interaction impairs T-cell function, allowing tumors to evade immune detection and destruction effectively.
Recent studies have elucidated that oncogenic signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling, play a significant role in modulating PD-L1 expression. This pathway is traditionally recognized for its role in embryonic development and stem cell maintenance but has also been implicated in various cancers' onset and progression when aberrantly activated.
This review seeks to explore the influence of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on regulating the PD-1/PD-L1 axis within HPV-associated cervical malignancies further. By understanding these intricate molecular interactions better, we can identify potential targets for novel therapeutic approaches aimed at augmenting anti-tumor immunity.
2. Mechanisms of Wnt/β-catenin Signaling Activation in Cancer
Wnt proteins are secreted glycoproteins that bind to frizzled receptors at the cellular membrane level initiating a cascade culminating in β-catenin stabilization and nuclear translocation wherein it acts as a transcriptional co-regulator modulating gene expression patterns essential for cellular proliferation and differentiation.
In several cancers—including cervical carcinoma—the abnormal activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling results from mutations or dysregulations found within various pathway constituents such as APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), Axin complex members or β-CATENIN itself leading beta(ß)-cateninnine stabilization consequently resulting transcription proteins regulation primarily targeting genes tied growth unchecked proliferation/survival concerning malignancy context target notably MYC CCNDI cyclindependent kinase associated phosphatases/protein kinases/respective gene target downstream regions gathering instigate rapid progressive genetic lesions adjusting influentially emerging equilibrium immune evasion techniques prominently engaging interplay convergence mutuality jog key intersection said mechanism immune checkpoint modulation sanction observable tangible instances implementing systematic approach manipulate thereby interference integrating biologic criteria predetermined determinants aforementioned considerations suffice appreciate cumulative surmountable complexities entailed resolve targeted research flux decisively innovate translational implications clinical setup empowering procedural paradigms bolster fight opposing aforementioned cancer specific immunotherapy applicable robustly efficacious practical methodology striving amplified perpetuated specificity recognition eradication patterns tumors sidestepping reviaugareness renewal exponentially mutable effective personalized treatment distinguished globally diverse patient populations intervals preventative accountability ascertain utilized maintaining efficacy sustained responsive observations comprehend dynamic biological algorithms unveiling reiterative subject premise enhance manipulating conjoining symbiotic non-symbiotic operational simplifying overall investigatory plan comprehensively longterm effectiveness sustainable accountable realistic significant merits achievable superior optimism realistic bounds replication nonidentically unique confirming ultimate practice ready formulations suitable accordingly ADR contingency statiwise upperhand encompasses broad vigilantennency decisive tactic assurance onboarding operational realm sulblance exploratory authenticity carefully designed scrupulously formal appraising methodologies rigorous extending foresight address pragmatic practicality nuances insightful traving detailed configuations stepwise logical intrinsic wayforward sanguinely embrittled resolution concert effort rally Integrative supportive therapies available adjunctively synergistically fine consistency foreseeable defeat rejuvenation outlook transcend problematic disjunction/nonconformities conclusively affirmationature pilot struct driven definitive hopeful feasible conquering pervasive ordeal resilient enduring solutions regenerative compellingPROP pioneering structured punctilious advancements inherently reflected enriched sustained permanent empowerment navigated pragmatic sustainable prudent reconcil challenging engagement transformational undeniably transformative incisive elevating universal standards massive impact foremost formidable aspirations cherished optimistically cherished human lives preserved abetted consequential ameliorate intentional deliberate propensity confirm ultimately visionary progressive continued proliferous advances insured affiliated rense revolutionary strides pragmatically serving elevated endeavor safeguarding protective equitable simultaneous integrative unambiguous۔۔۔۔

**1. Introduction**
Depression among youth is an escalating global concern, characterized by early age of onset, chronicity, relapse and recurrence, leading to substantial impairment in social, academic, and occupational functioning. Pre-adolescent depression rates are relatively low when compared with adolescents' rates which see a significant surge—suggesting critical developmental transitions may exacerbate vulnerabilities to depressive disorders (Avenevoli & Merikangas, 2006). Alarmingly elevated incidence witnessed over the past decade signals the urgency for advanced research strategies and comprehensive intervention programs that address this mental health crisis (Mojtabai et al., 2016).
This review navigates recent empirical findings underscoring how depression is conceptualized among youth and outlines feasible advancements through empirical wisdom and practical innovation. Our goal is twofold: firstly to invigorate the understanding of youth depression via refined construct validation approaches that honor its complex phenomenology; secondly to broaden intervention landscapes by amalgamating individual-focused treatments with systemic-level prevention strategies ensuring holistic care.
**2. Current State of Youth Depression Research**
Research delineates several clinical presentations characterizing youth depression: from persistent mood disturbances marked by sadness or irritability to somatic complaints such as fatigue or disrupted sleep patterns (Bennett et al., 2005). Concomitantly, cognitive distortions including negative self-evaluations intensify young individuals' distress originating from diverse psychosocial stressors encompassing bullying or familial conflict.
Importantly established risk factors encapsulate genetic predispositions alongside environmental precipitants highlighting an intricate web entangling biopsychosocial domains amplifying susceptibility towards depressive episodes (Rice et al., 2002; Kendler & Gardner Jr., 2014). Furthermore clinicians recognize potential co-morbidities wherein major depressive disorder often overlaps with anxiety disorders or substance abuse compelling concerted diagnostic acumen for accurate identification thus informing tailored interventions.
Despite flourishing awareness surrounding these multifaceted dimensions fuelling depression's footprint in youths’ lives our insights often stagnate under conventional methodologies adopting primarily symptom-count checklists seldom capturing heterogeneity within affective experiences specificities (.e.g melancholic vs atypical features) hence perpetuating partial comprehension deterring impactful advancements.
**3. Reinvigorating Construct Validation Approaches**
Precise measurement rigor anchored on robust construct validity offers versatile frameworks enabling nuanced understandings toward structured assessments which potentially refine categorization reflecting authentic symptomatic depictions (.i.e distinct endophenotypes representing eco-centric issues versus introceptive dysregulation streams within depressive pathologies).

Understanding and addressing pandemic risk in Arctic regions like Alaska necessitates a comprehensive approach that transcends the application of traditional vulnerability metrics. While these metrics can provide valuable insights, they often fall short of capturing the unique intricacies and strengths of Arctic communities. In light of this, our study shifts towards incorporating resilience into the assessment process to offer a more holistic view of pandemic risk.
The term 'vulnerability' typically refers to a community's susceptibility to harm from external shocks such as pandemics. It considers factors like socioeconomic status, healthcare infrastructure, demographic characteristics, and preexisting health conditions. Traditional assessments might place many Alaskan communities at high vulnerability due to factors such as remoteness, limited healthcare access, overcrowded housing conditions, higher prevalence of chronic illnesses, and economic dependency on industries sensitive to global market fluctuations.
However, focusing solely on these elements underestimates the adaptive capacities ingrained within these communities. ‘Resilience’ encapsulates this capacity for recovery and continued functioning despite adverse circumstances. Resilience is fostered through strong social networks seen in tight-knit families or community groups that offer mutual support during crises; cultural practices promoting mental health; subsistence hunting and fishing ensuring food security; local knowledge systems aiding effective response strategies; flexible governance structures enabling swift decision-making at local levels; among other embedded strengths.
1.1 Historical Context
Alaska’s Indigenous populations have historically showcased remarkable resilience while coping with various adversities ranging from climatic extremities to colonial disruptions impacting their sovereignty over natural resources and lifestyle choices. Lessons learned from historical outbreaks like smallpox or influenza reveal adaptive measures incorporated into communal living — such as isolation practices long before modern quarantine protocols — illustrating indigenous wisdom rooted in survival instincts passed across generations.
Drawing upon this backdrop emphasizes understanding how present-day responses build upon past experiences blended seamlessly within modern public health frameworks shaped by wider governmental strategies but tailored effectively based on localized inputs reflecting their lived realities respecting autonomy enhancing self-determination aligned against external threats integrating experiential learning situational knowledge cumulative participatory advisories jointly formulated representing collaborative engagements encompassing stakeholders diverse nexus continuum contexts experiential synergies harmonizing proactive anticipatory synergistic interventions preventive mindfulness engaged iterations holistic amalgamations indicative inclusive iterative perspectives nuanced responsiveness structured coordinated intentionally dynamically evolving strategic landscape pivotal ensuring welfare sustenance thriving resilient continuance predominating overarching baseline existential paradigmatic cyclic perpetuity reaffirming inherent robustness confronting contemporary exigencies discernably evidently incontrovertibly epitomizing exemplifying emboldening profound entailing robustly time-honored legacy sustaining fortuitously unequivocally distinctly definitive.

1. Introduction
Advancements in cancer treatment have extended the lives of many patients. However, there are growing concerns about the frequency and appropriateness of anticancer drug use at the end of life (EOL). Administering such treatments close to EOL can impose substantial physical, emotional, and financial burdens on patients and their families while often providing limited benefit. Recognizing these challenges, it is critical to comprehensively understand current practices surrounding anticancer drug use during this sensitive phase.
This scoping review aims to map out existing research on the subject and synthesize key findings concerning how frequently anticancer drugs are used as patients approach EOL. By summarizing recent studies, focusing especially on research from the past five years, we aim to identify patterns that could inform better patient-centered care strategies.
2. Methods
To achieve our objective, we conducted systematic searches in both Medline and Embase databases using a combination of keywords related to "anticancer drugs," "end of life," "palliative chemotherapy," and other relevant terms. Our inclusion criteria were broad: any study that reported data specific to anticancer drug use within three months before death was considered relevant.
After compiling an initial list from these searches, two independent reviewers screened each article for eligibility based on title and abstract. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer when necessary.

Migraine is one of the most disabling neurological disorders characterized by recurrent headaches, often accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light or sound. It affects a significant portion of the global population, with adverse impacts on quality of life and productivity. Traditional management strategies for migraine have predominantly included pharmacological interventions. However, there is growing evidence that non-pharmacological approaches, including therapeutic exercise, can play a vital role in the management of migraines.
This clinical practice guideline seeks to bridge the gap between current scientific knowledge and clinical practice regarding the role of exercise in managing migraine symptoms. The intention is to provide clear and actionable recommendations for healthcare professionals involved in managing patients with migraines.
2. Methodology
The guideline was developed using rigorous methodology consistent with international standards. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) framework guided our process from inception to publication.
A comprehensive systematic literature review was conducted across various databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Articles included were subjected to critical appraisal using standardized tools provided by SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network). Studies were graded based on their design quality—ranging from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) receiving the highest ratings to expert opinions receiving lower ratings—and synthesized into coherent guidelines following GRADE principles.
3. Aerobic Exercise
There is substantial evidence supporting aerobic exercise as an effective intervention for reducing both frequency and intensity of migraine attacks. Aerobic exercises such as cycling, walking, or swimming performed at moderate intensity for 30-45 minutes three times per week have shown promising results in various RCTs.
**Recommendation:** Healthcare providers should encourage patients with migraines to engage in moderate continuous aerobic activities regularly (Grade B).
4. Yoga
Yoga combines physical postures with breathing techniques aimed at fostering relaxation—a potential synergistic effect beneficial for migraine sufferers due not only its physical component but also its psychological implications like stress reduction which can be triggers themselves.
 
**Recommendation:** Yoga may be considered an adjunctive therapy suitable under supervision initially until familiarity ensures safe independent participation (Grade B).

1. Introduction
The gut microbiome, a complex ecosystem comprising trillions of microorganisms, plays a critical role in human health and disease. It is involved in numerous physiological processes such as digestion, immune function, and even mental health. Recent research has increasingly focused on how various factors may influence the microbial community within the gut. Among these factors is vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin essential for calcium absorption and bone health.
Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent worldwide, particularly among older adults due to reduced skin synthesis and dietary intake with age. Observational studies have suggested that vitamin D might affect the gut microbiome composition through its immunomodulatory effects. However, observational data are susceptible to confounding factors and cannot establish causality. Therefore, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to determine whether there is a direct relationship between vitamin D supplementation and alterations in the gut microbiota.
To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted an analysis using data from the D-Health Trial—a large-scale RCT designed primarily to investigate if high-dose vitamin D supplementation could reduce mortality rates among older Australians but also offering an opportunity to explore secondary outcomes related to microbiome composition.
2. Methods
2.1 Study Design
The D-Health Trial was a multi-center double-blind placebo-controlled trial involving 21,315 participants aged 60–84 years who were randomized into two groups: one receiving monthly doses of 60,000 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and another receiving placebo for five years.
2.2 Stool Sample Collection & Microbiome Analysis
A subset of participants (835 individuals) provided stool samples towards the end of their participation period—417 from the placebo group and 418 from those who received vitamin D supplementation over five years. DNA was extracted from these stool samples followed by amplification targeting specific hypervariable regions within bacterial 16S rRNA genes—a common method employed for microbial community profiling.
2.3 Statistical Analysis
We calculated alpha diversity metrics including Shannon index (a measure accounting for both richness—the number of unique taxa—and their relative abundance), richness itself which counts total unique taxa present within each sample; plus inverse Simpson index giving more weightage towards abundant species while downplaying rare ones besides computing Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio reflecting changes potentially indicating shifts towards certain health conditions when altered significantly beyond natural variation bounds observed normally across populations tested previously globally so far till date).

1. Introduction
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Advances in early detection, surgical techniques, and adjuvant therapies have improved overall survival rates; however, surgery remains a cornerstone treatment in the management of resectable lung cancers. Over recent decades, minimally invasive approaches such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) have been increasingly adopted due to their favorable outcomes compared to traditional open thoracotomy. Single-port VATS (SP-VATS), an innovative derivation of traditional multi-port VATS, ensures reduced postoperative pain and better cosmetic results given its single incision approach.
Despite the technological advancements and reduced invasiveness offered by SP-VATS, patients undergoing this procedure are still subjected to physiological stressors which can impede postoperative recovery. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols aim to mitigate these stressors by incorporating a multidisciplinary approach that encompasses preoperative optimization, intraoperative care strategies, and postoperative recovery protocols designed specifically for each type of surgery.
In this context, effective nursing care is critical as it can make a significant difference in patient outcomes following SP-VATS procedures for lung cancer. This article aims to explore enhanced recovery practices particularly focused on nursing interventions that facilitate quicker rehabilitation and better postoperative functioning.
2. Preoperative Nursing Interventions
Preoperative evaluation plays a pivotal role in ensuring that patients are well-prepared both physically and psychologically for surgery. Nurses should take an active role in preadmission counseling sessions where they educate patients on what to expect before and after SP-VATS procedures.
**Risk Assessment:** Comprehensive assessment strategies should identify potential risk factors including comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular diseases or diabetes mellitus which could adversely affect surgical outcomes. Anesthesiologists may collaborate with nurses to conduct thorough assessments regarding airway management feasibility given any existing respiratory conditions.

1. Introduction
Cancer has long been examined from the perspective of genetic mutations and aberrant cellular behavior, but the appreciation for the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its intricate interplay with malignant cells is relatively recent. The TME encompasses a complex network of non-cancerous cells, signaling molecules, extracellular matrix components, and vascular structures that collectively affect tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapies. As an emerging field within this multifaceted context, researchers are turning their attention to the role of microorganisms in influencing cancer biology.
2. Historical Context
The presence of microorganisms within tumor tissues was noticed as early as the late 19th century; however, these observations were largely dismissed or viewed with skepticism due to limitations in scientific techniques at that time. With advancements in molecular sequencing technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), alongside developments in microbiology and histological methods, scientists are now able to explore this microbial component with greater precision.
3. Composition of Tumor-Associated Microbiota
Studies utilizing high-throughput sequencing have revealed diverse bacterial communities residing within various types of tumors including breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), melanoma among others. The composition of these microbial communities varies significantly between different cancers types as well as individual patient profiles suggesting potential links with both the tumor origin site and host factors like diet or immune status.
For instance:
- In CRC patients higher abundance levels from bacterial genera such Fusobacterium nucleatum compared non-cancerous individuals were documented indicating possible association colorectal carcinogenesis.
 
 - Conversely pancreatic cancers were colonized predominantly species belonging Proteobacteria phyla further documentation ongoing explore exact conditional correlations dysbiosis development aggressive PDA phenotypes().

**1. Introduction**
The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against infections, tumors, and cellular stress, recognizing various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Among these PRRs, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is especially notable for its response to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytoplasm—a sign of microbial invasion or cellular damage. When cGAS detects aberrant dsDNA, it catalyzes the synthesis of 2’3’-cyclic GMP-AMP (2’3’-cGAMP), a unique cyclic dinucleotide that acts as a second messenger in signaling pathways.
Upon production by cGAS, 2’3’-cGAMP binds to and activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a central adaptative protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Once activated by 2’3’-cGAMP, STING undergoes conformational changes that lead to its translocation to perinuclear regions where it interacts with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). This interaction promotes the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors such as IRF3 and NF-κB. These transcription factors then induce type-I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, essential for robust immune responses against infections and neoplastic cells while also mediating anti-inflammatory signals pertinent to tissue homeostasis.
However, recent studies have significantly expanded our understanding of this pathway by revealing that 2'3'-cGAMP does not solely function within its cell of origin but can also act on neighboring cells—an intercellular mechanism distinctly different from classical intracellular signaling paradigms involving PRRs like Toll-like receptors or RIG-I-like receptors.
**2. Mechanisms for Intercellular Transfer**
Several mechanisms have been proposed for the intercellular transfer of 2'3'-cGAMP:
a. **Gap Junctions**: Gap junction channels facilitate direct cytoplasmic interchange between adjacent cells. Connexin proteins forming these channels permit small molecules like cyclic nucleotides to pass through when open.
 
b. **Viral Particles**: Some viruses package host-derived cytosolic contents including nucleotides inside their particles during replication; thus infected cells releasing virions could distribute cGAMPS rapidly across distances.
c. **Extracellular Vesicles**: Exosomes/microvesicles are released from donor cells containing various bioactive molecules including proteins/RNA/neurotransmitters etc.; recent work demonstrated presence/ability offering another vehicle transporting CDNs between non-adjacent distant recipients beyond immediate vicinity contacts typical seen via gap junction transport …

[To be continued] in enriching our understanding and application of 2'3'-cGAMP intercellular signaling. Exploring these mechanisms opens up diverse therapeutic avenues, particularly in diseases where immune regulation is crucial.
**3. Implications for Therapeutic Interventions**
a. **Cancer Immunotherapy**:
   The ability of 2'3'-cGAMP to amplify anti-tumor immune responses by activating STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) in surrounding cells makes it a potent candidate for cancer therapies. Drugs or delivery systems leveraging the intercellular transfer routes like exosomes or engineered viruses could enhance the immune system's capacity to target neoplastic cells effectively.
b. **Infectious Diseases**:
   For viral infections, manipulating 2'3'-cGAMP pathways can bolster antiviral defenses both within and between infected as well as neighboring cells. Enhancing this natural defense mechanisms could lead to innovative treatments that are less prone to resistance compared to conventional antivirals.
c. **Autoimmune Disorders**:
   Intriguingly, regulating the transport and uptake of 2'3'-cGAMP might provide novel means for managing autoimmune conditions by tempering aberrant STING activity that contributes to inflammatory pathology in disorders like lupus or Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.
d. **Neurological Conditions**:
   The presence of extracellular vesicles in the brain capable of transporting neuroactive molecules suggests potential therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases, wherein modulating cyclic dinucleotide signaling could possibly amend neuroinflammation observed in conditions such as multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s disease.

### 1. Introduction
The consumption of alcohol is a significant public health concern, particularly among younger populations. High levels of alcohol intake are associated with an array of negative health outcomes, including an increased risk of developing various forms of cancer later in life. As such, there has been considerable interest in identifying effective strategies for reducing alcohol consumption among young people to mitigate these risks and promote overall health.
Digital interventions have emerged as promising tools for influencing behaviors due to their accessibility and engagement capabilities. With the widespread use of smartphones, tablets, and the internet among young individuals, digital platforms offer scalable opportunities for delivering preventive measures and educational content aimed at curbing unhealthy drinking habits.
This review aims to synthesize available evidence from systematic reviews on the effectiveness of digital interventions designed to moderate alcohol intake among different sub-populations: school-aged children, college/university students, young adults (over 18 years), and a combined group encompassing both adolescents and young adults (<25 years). By assessing existing interventions comprehensively across these groups, we seek to provide insights into which digital approaches show the most promise in reducing risky drinking behaviors and ultimately improving public health outcomes.
### 2. Methods

**1. Introduction**
Prostate cancer remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among males worldwide. The therapeutic arsenal against advanced prostate cancer prominently includes Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT), which has been foundational in clinical practice for over eight decades. By curtailing androgen levels and antagonizing androgen signaling pathways, ADT effectively mitigates tumor progression initially. However, despite initial positive responses, a subset of the cellular milieu inevitably becomes refractory to this treatment modality, leading to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
This resistance often correlates with enhanced metastatic potential and reduced patient survival rates. One molecular hallmark underlying this evolution towards increased malignancy is the phenomenon known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Central to EMT is cadherin switching: the downregulation of E-cadherin—a crucial cell-cell adhesion molecule—and simultaneous upregulation of N-cadherin.
2. Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Cadherin Switching
The cadherins are a family of transmembrane proteins integral to cell adhesion, with E-cadherin primarily associated with epithelial cells maintaining their phenotypic integrity while serving an anti-invasive role by restricting cellular dissociation and migration. ADT-induced reduction in circulatory androgen levels not only disrupts androgen receptor signaling but also accelerates molecular cascades ensuring E-cadherin suppression.
Direct mechanisms fueling this switch involve changes in several transcription factors directly involved in the repression or promotion of specific cadherins:
- **Snail/Slug Zinc-finger transcription factors** have shown marked upregulation under low-androgen conditions facilitated by TGF-β pathway activation.
- **Twist1/2**—basic helix-loop-helix proteins linked with EMT induction—are commonly observed elevated post-ADT.
  
These transcriptional alterations culminate in reduced E-cadherin expression on tumor cell surfaces thus promoting loss-of-function attributes characteristic of enhanced invasiveness.
Indirect mechanisms may encompass extracellular matrix remodeling enzymes like matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) whose activities are elevated upon altered Androgen Receptor signaling promoting degradation processes essential for cancer cells migrating through tissue barriers.
3. Transcription Factors & Signaling Pathways Involved
Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β) receptor activation serves as one pivotal node linking ADT administration to subsequent EMT phenomena:
### 3.1 TGF-β Pathway:
  
Increasing evidence highlights TGF-β's dualistic nature where it paradoxically represents both tumor-suppressive roles during early stages yet endows advanced tumors—including post-treatment CRPC—with aggressive traits by navigating epithelial plasticity dynamics necessary for disruption from primary sites leading towards metastatic behavior onset.
Studies implicate TGF-β driven Smads co-associating via nuclear accumulation collaboration patterned regulatory circuits suppressing differentiation marker genes like CDH1 encoding E-Cad protein

1. Introduction
Viral hepatitis represents a significant public health concern globally, particularly in developing countries such as India. The disease comprises a range of inflammatory conditions of the liver caused by different viruses, primarily Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis D Virus (HDV), and Hepatitis E Virus (HEV). Each viral type possesses distinct epidemiological characteristics, modes of transmission, and implications for public health.
In India, viral hepatitis is one of the primary causes of acute and chronic liver diseases. The burden is substantial owing to various socio-economic factors including suboptimal healthcare infrastructure, lack of universal vaccination programs for HBV in some regions, inadequate sanitary conditions contributing to HAV and HEV transmission, and limited access to screening programs for HCV.
Despite advancements in medical science leading to better therapeutic options and preventive measures like vaccines for HAV and HBV—which significantly reduce disease prevalence—the country still battles with high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with these infections. Viral hepatitis adds considerable strain on an already overwhelmed healthcare system through its complications which include cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver failure, maternal mortality due to HEV during pregnancy among others.
This systematic review aims at consolidating data on the prevalence rates across diverse Indian geographies over two decades—from February 2000 to February 2021—encompassing studies retrieved from multiple reputable databases like Science Direct, Scopus among others. Understanding this burden from a more unified perspective could aid policymakers in prioritizing areas requiring immediate attention towards containing spread through evidence-based interventions thereby alleviating future incidences effectively.

**Introduction**
Transactional sex, defined as non-marital sexual relationships established for the exchange of goods, money, or services, remains a pervasive and significant public health issue in Sub-Saharan Africa. This practice poses multifaceted challenges to individuals and societies due to its association with detrimental health outcomes such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and associated physiological trauma. Furthermore, transactional sex perpetuates cycles of abuse and inequality by embedding women into socio-economic dependencies and exploitative relationships.
Understanding the prevalence and determinants of transactional sex is crucial for developing effective interventions aimed at mitigating its negative consequences. Varied cultural contexts across Sub-Saharan Africa influence the manifestation of transactional sex uniquely in different regions. Several studies conducted over the past two decades have attempted to explore these dynamics; however, findings have been inconsistent regarding prevalence rates and contributing factors.
This systematic review aims to synthesize available evidence on the pooled prevalence estimates of transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africa by analyzing data from existing literature between 2000 and 2022. In addition to determining pooled prevalence rates, this review identifies key factors associated with engaging in transactional sex such as early sexual debut experiences, substance usage patterns, experiences of violence (both physical and sexual), orphanhood status, among others.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing technology has garnered immense interest over recent decades due to its unparalleled sensitivity to changes in refractive index, which makes it particularly useful for detecting biomolecules, chemical compounds, and environmental pollutants. This unique capability arises from the interaction of incident light with free electrons on a metal-dielectric interface creating surface plasmons—coherent oscillations of electrons that result in enhanced electromagnetic fields at the metal surface. When the refractive index near the sensor's surface changes due to analyte binding or other interactions, this shifts the resonance condition and can be monitored as a shift in resonance wavelength or angle.
Despite their extensive application, traditional SPR sensors suffer from inherently broad linewidths owing to significant optical losses within metals such as gold and silver. A wider linewidth decreases the spectral resolution and consequently affects measurement accuracy and sensitivity. Therefore, refining strategies to achieve narrower resonance linewidths is paramount for advancing SPR sensor performance.
### 2. Factors Influencing Plasmon Linewidths
The linewidth of plasmon resonances is determined by both intrinsic properties (such as material-specific electron scattering rates) and extrinsic parameters (including nanostructure geometry and environment). For instance:
- **Material Selection:** Different metals exhibit varying levels of electron scattering—the primary cause behind optical absorption losses. Noble metals like gold have lower scattering rates compared to others but still contribute significantly to overall damping.
- **Nanostructure Geometry:** The dimensions, shapes, periodicity, and overall design of metallic nanostructures can profoundly affect plasmonic behavior by modifying localized field distributions.
- **Dielectric Environment:** Surrounding media's dielectric constant influences how plasmons are confined at interfaces; even minor variations can lead to notable shifts or broadening in plasmonic spectra.
Addressing these factors through innovative structural design is crucial for reducing line width while retaining high sensitivity.
### 3. Approaches for Narrow Resonance Linewidths
#### 3.1 Surface Lattice Resonance/Plasmonic Fano Resonance
Building arrays of nanoparticles into well-ordered lattices introduces collective oscillatory modes termed “surface lattice resonances” (SLRs), which stem from diffractive coupling between individual nanoparticle plasmons within periodic grids. Similarly common are "plasmonic Fano resonances," where interference between a discrete state (e.g., localized surface plasmon) interacts destructively with a continuum state resulting in sharp asymmetric profiles conducive towards narrow lineshapes.
#### 3.2 Coupling with Photonic Cavities

The need for sustainable energy solutions has gained crucial importance across various sectors, and the hospitality industry is no exception. This industry's vast consumption of resources and its significant environmental footprint necessitate ongoing research to identify energy-efficient practices and technologies. Collaborations in this domain can significantly promote the quality and impact of such research, making it imperative to understand the landscape of existing collaborations. 
This paper presents a detailed knowledge mapping analysis of energy research in the hospitality industry, focusing on evaluating research collaboration at macro (national), meso (institutional), and micro (author) levels using bibliometric techniques. By examining patterns of co-authorship, distribution of publications, citation networks, and collaboration clusters from 1984 to 2022 within the Web of Science Core Collection database, this study aims to provide insights that can guide future collaborative efforts.
2. Literature Review
Previous studies have underscored the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in addressing complex issues related to energy efficiency within hotels. For instance, Yoo & Lee (2015) emphasized how collaborations between engineering departments focusing on technical solutions and business schools dealing with management practices resulted in more holistic strategies for reducing energy consumption in hotels.
Moreover, inter-country collaborations have been found essential for technological transfers and accessing diverse datasets needed for robust analyses (Smith et al., 2019). However, there remains a paucityof detailed quantitative analyses assessing these collaborative efforts specifically within hotel-related energy research.
3. Methodology

1. Introduction
Chronic primary orofacial pain (OFP) disorders present a significant burden on affected individuals, impacting their quality of life and posing challenges to healthcare systems. Despite advances in understanding the complex and multifactorial nature of these conditions, effective treatments remain elusive for many patients. Painful temporomandibular disorders (pTMDs), idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and burning mouth syndrome (BMS) are among the most prevalent and debilitating forms of chronic OFP, characterized by persistent pain in the craniofacial region without an apparent secondary cause.
The pathophysiology underlying these conditions is intricate, involving peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms, genetic susceptibilities, hormonal influences, immune system dysregulation, psychological stressors, and other factors. Given this complexity, preclinical studies utilizing animal models have been instrumental in elucidating potential mechanisms of disease and identifying therapeutic targets.
However, while rodent models have contributed significantly to our knowledge base on chronic primary OFP disorders through identifying biological pathways and testing potential treatments' efficacy at molecular levels; there remains a critical gap between preclinical findings' implications for human applications - especially concerning behavioral manifestations such as spontaneous behaviors mimicking subjective human experiences with facial migraine-like complaints which are greatly dependent on subjective reports typically challenging within animal research settings,.
This gap underscores an urgent need to advance methodologies applied within preclinical assays further aligning them closer towards real-world clinical scenarios experienced by those combating persistent OroFaciAl conditions daily basis.. To address this need effectively:

Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) represent a diverse group of genetic disorders that lead to progressive vision loss or blindness due to mutations in any one of over 250 different genes. Despite the progress made with gene replacement therapy, which has demonstrated safety and efficacy particularly through the use of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, there exist significant challenges. One major challenge arises from the AAV's limited packaging capacity which restricts its potential for delivering larger genes or those requiring complex regulation. Additionally, some retinal diseases involve multiple isoforms that cannot be addressed by a single replacement strategy.
Given these factors, RNA editing emerges as a compelling alternative approach for treating IRDs. By leveraging endogenous ADAR enzymes, this technology offers an innovative avenue for targeting pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) without modifying the underlying DNA sequence and risking permanent off-target modifications.
2. Mechanism of ADAR-Mediated RNA Editing
ADAR enzymes catalyze RNA editing through deamination of adenosine to inosine within double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). Inosine is interpreted as guanosine by cellular translation machinery resulting in specific base pair changes upon protein synthesis. This mechanism can correct disease-causing mutations at an mRNA level post-transcriptionally.
The two primary strategies employ either exogenous delivery—introducing recombinant ADAR proteins fused with guide RNAs—or harnessing endogenous ADARs by recruiting them directly using specially designed guide RNAs akin to Aptamers known as ADAR-recruiting oligonucleotides (ARO). The latter method is particularly attractive because it avoids introducing foreign proteins into cells which could trigger immune responses and requires smaller vectors thus overcoming some limitations posed by current gene therapy modalities.
3. Advancements in Circular Guide RNAs
Recent research highlighted remarkable improvements when utilizing circularized forms of guide RNAs which offer greater stability than their linear counterparts leading eventually towards higher fidelity targeting efficacies observed not only under laboratory settings but also translation models featuring murine subjects carrying pertinent humanized versions reflecting real patient scenarios suffering widespread degenerative ocular defects impacting vision quality fundamentally once applied appropriately mimicking therapeutic windows recreationally hoped positively helping combating looming pathologies threatening individuals’ basic daily experiences banking intensive optical perceivance grinding sharpness handicapping existent currently limiting previously unchartered beyond traditional lenses surgical precisions nowadays typically foreseen methodologies reported explicitly through medical literatures accentuating encouraging signs predominantly showcasing betterment qualitatively foreseeing promising outcomes exponentially progressing gradually benefiting extensive demographic notably visual impaired community eventually irrevocably enriching lives holistically confounded catastrophic conditions imposed indefinitely troubling encompassing domain persistently time foreseeable gradually projected effectively maneuvered systemically independently disseminating advances bioengineering leveraging clued naturally happening instincts transforming principally practical hitherto supplementary augmentations painstakingly nurturing healthier lifestyles collective realms inherently intriguing aspirations importantly mutual stakeholders abounding collaborative partners primed equally champion trailblazing boldly investing futuristic perspectives systematically geared prioritizing goal naturally mitigating overall sufferings selflessly dedicated continually evolving versatile solutions responsibly serving noble causes essentially fundamentally envisaging empowered ethically aligned sustainable innovations upright righteous humankind endeavours implicitly displayed transparently onward prudently progressing innovatively breakthroughs unraveling ambitiously actionable solutions precisely beneficial prophesied optimistically manuring non-invasively ailments conquer essence profound genuinely preserving primal essential senses matter ultimately decisive cognitive reflections realization dynamically interfacing crux corporeally envision quantifiable humane deeper symbiotic evolutionary trajectory prudently holistic behavioral therapeutics transcending alimentarily stability prodigiously spotlight singular imperative missions existentially ideally construed sufficiently converse biomedical marvel objectively tangible impacting universally acceptable sound discernments pro-life propensities enhancing ubiquitous experiential baseline performant equitable inclusivity creating ancillary resilient future embedded advancing intelligently optimal actualizations railing total extraction everlasting retina safeguards perennially consequential implications surrounding fostering spectacular drone vibrancy reproductively continued sustenance foundationally optimized substantially greater futuristic paradigm eventually yielding substantive mitigations providing enormous elucidative clinical insights conventionally paradigmatic systematically uniform basis importantly envisage forward perpetually transcendent revealer effected tackling hypothetical benchmarks hypothetically potential reality empowered systematic mechanics nurtured therapeutically predictaspredictive bio-ethical convergence succinct conceptualizations invariably trustworthy assurant braving frontiers medically perseverant epoch geospatial outstanding scientifically accountable probability universally liable exclusively measurable cardiac chronological quintessential sum cumulative immense relatabilitasibility approximated cyclic retrospection catalogically curav.
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a preeminent cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in regions such as East Asia where the incidence rates are high. Traditional endoscopic techniques have been instrumental in diagnosing early ESCC; however, these procedures heavily rely on the skill and experience of endoscopists. Variations in expertise lead to inconsistencies in diagnosis, with some lesions being overlooked. The burgeoning advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), notably deep learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have heralded a new era for medical imaging diagnostics.
Interestingly, CNNs have garnered attention for their adeptness at handling vast arrays of visual data through layered convolution processes that capture essential patterns and features from images. Such capabilities make them ideal candidates for classifying medical images with higher accuracy than traditional methods might afford. In the realm of endoscopy, AI can be leveraged to autonomously identify mucosal irregularities that signify early stages of ESCC, track suspicious lesions over time, and even predict how deeply these lesions penetrate esophageal layers.
Despite these promising developments, certain challenges persist concerning AI implementation in clinical settings:
### 2. Current State and Technological Integration
Recent studies showcase a plethora of AI applications targeting early ESCC diagnosis through enhanced imagery analysis during endoscopy sessions. One notable example involves integrating CNNs into existing endoscopic technologies to detect subtleties within mucosal patterns indicative of malignant transformation—subtleties which might evade even seasoned professionals.
**a) Enhanced Detection Accuracy:** Researchers report significant improvements in sensitivity and specificity when employing AI-driven diagnostics compared to human-only assessments. This heightened accuracy minimizes the risk for missed diagnoses during routine screenings while ensuring timely interventions.
**b) Real-Time Analysis:** Modern computational systems equipped with high-efficiency GPUs enable real-time analysis capabilities where suspect lesion prompts are instantaneously highlighted on-screen during an ongoing procedure—a profoundly beneficial tool assisting diagnosticians.
**c) Multimodal Imaging Cross-Validation:** Combining various imaging modalities such as narrow-band imaging (NBI), confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), or other high-resolution techniques enhances diagnostic confidence by cross-referencing different image databases through integrated algorithms trained on vast amounts of labeled pathological data.
### 3. Addressing Selective Bias
Despite technological advances contributing significantly towards more reliable diagnostics frameworks via automation:
 
**a) Dataset Diversity Concerns:** The generalizability issue arises primarily from datasets used during training phases being non-representative across different populations or varying case complexities encountered routinely—a phenomenon known as dataset bias.
To mitigate this:
- **Diversified Training Sets** are crucial involving geographically disparate training samples covering demographics subjected historically less observed practices.
- **Continuous Learning Paradigms**, where post-deployment systems update themselves via federated learning ensuring responsiveness upon encountering previously unseen variances among patient profiles/conditions thereby sustaining accurate performance levels longitudinally against dynamic epidemiological trends entail paramount importance operationally scaling user trust/adoption compatibility indeed!
### 4.Ethical Considerations & Future Directions

### 1. Introduction
In recent years, the incorporation of digital technologies in education has revolutionized various academic fields, and nursing education is no exception. The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift towards remote learning solutions that leverage advanced digital tools to maintain educational continuity. Among these tools, e-learning platforms, virtual reality (VR), serious games, and podcasts have garnered significant attention for their ability to enhance the educational experience and reach a wider audience.
Podcasts stand out as an innovative and accessible form of media that offers numerous advantages over traditional teaching methods. They are accessible on-demand, allowing students to engage with content at their own pace and convenience. This mini-review article will focus on assessing how podcasts have been integrated into nursing education across Eastern and Western countries while evaluating their benefits, limitations, and future potential.
### 2. Development of Podcasts in Nursing Education
#### 2.1 Western Countries
In Western countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, and several European nations where technological integration in education is more advanced, podcasts have become a staple component of nursing curricula. Leading medical schools and institutions produce high-quality podcast content covering various aspects of nursing—from basic clinical skills to complex case studies.
For instance:
- **University Initiatives**: Some universities offer curated podcast series focusing specifically on critical care techniques or latest research updates within the field.
- **Professional Development**: Professional organizations such as the American Nurses Association (ANA) frequently release podcast episodes addressing continuing professional development (CPD), policy changes within healthcare systems alongside expert interviews.
  
The flexibility provided by podcasts ensures that they complement existing course materials without overwhelming students' schedules—providing an ideal repository for review sessions or supplemental instruction.
#### 2.2 Eastern Countries
Contrastingly ,nursing programmes across many Eastern nations including China ,Japan ,India demonstrate modest uptake concerning this technologically-driven approach . While numerous prestigious medical institutes recognize prospective advantages associated integrating Podcasts ,by large systematically lack comparable infrastructural support .
Language barriers remain a dominant limiting factor hindering widespread adoption .However few pioneering examples already make headway demonstrating workable models involving bilingual offerings catering diverse demographic inclusion therein fostering inclusive academic environment capable engaging unique intellectual fabric nurtured indefinite communities:

Obesity and overweight are significant public health challenges globally, including in Brazil, where the prevalence of these conditions has been on the rise. According to recent data from national health surveys, the rates of obesity and overweight among adults have reached alarming levels. It is imperative that public health policies and clinical practices adapt to effectively address this growing epidemic.
The complexity of obesity underscores the need for a multifaceted approach to treatment. Effective management requires an integrative strategy encompassing nutritional therapy, physical activity, behavioral modifications, pharmacological interventions when appropriate, and surgical options for certain populations. Among these components, nutritional therapy plays a pivotal role in both initial weight reduction and long-term maintenance.
2. Importance of Nutritional Therapy
Nutritional therapy remains at the forefront of managing obesity due to its fundamental role in energy balance. 
**Evidence-Based Dietary Patterns:** Evidence indicates that promoting balanced dietary patterns rather than enforcing restrictive diets results in better adherence among individuals with obesity. Notably, Mediterranean diets, which are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins (especially fish), nuts/seeds and healthy fats (such as olive oil), have demonstrated efficacy not only for weight loss but also for reducing cardiovascular risk factors.
**Caloric Deficit:** Creating an energy deficit by consuming fewer calories than expended through basal metabolic rate and physical activities is crucial for weight loss. This deficit can be achieved by reducing caloric intake while ensuring nutrient density is maximized to avoid deficiencies that could compromise overall health.
**Macronutrient Distribution:** While there is no one-size-fits-all solution regarding macronutrient distribution (carbohydrates/protein/fats ratio), individual tailoring according to preferences and metabolic responses works best. It's essential that such customization ensures sufficient protein intake preserving lean body mass during periods of caloric restriction.
3. Avoidance of Fad Diets
Fad diets often promise rapid results but fail scientific scrutiny due largely characteristic extreme restriction or elimination specific food groups like carbohydrates; advocating particular products “superfoods” teas phytotherapics unsupported robust empirical evidence potentially harmful long-term adherence problematic perpetuates cycle repeated dieting creating physiological adaptations which make sustained successful weigh difficult overtime detrimental psychological self-esteem body image perceptions leading supposed failure adhere unrealistic dietary regimens Thus nutrition education campaigns emphasizing foundational principles variety moderation balance periodic credible information dissemination critical undermining appeal quick fixes preferring instead sustainable strategies embedded well-being emphasis gradual consistent improvements aforementioned comprehensive support systems
4 Behavioral Interventions 
Effective behavioral strategies form another integral component facilitating nutritional success:
   
- **Motivational Interviewing:** Collaborative conversation style enhancing individual's own motivation commitment change employing guiding versus directive approaches fostering empowerment autonomy individual's control over decisions
  
- **Cognitive-behavioral Therapy (CBT):** Addressing dysfunctional beliefs attitudes contributing emotional eating behaviors predisposing excessive consumption unhealthy foods stress response
   
- **Self-monitoring Techniques:** Employ tool e.g., food diaries applications tracking intake activity progress providing accountability adjustments plan real-time basis

1. Introduction
Kinases are crucial enzymes involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes, including growth, metabolism, and apoptosis. They function by phosphorylating specific substrates and modulating signal transduction pathways that control various intracellular activities. Aberrant kinase activity is often implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, particularly cancers and autoimmune disorders. Thus, targeting kinases with specific inhibitors has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy.
The development of kinase inhibitors represents a significant advancement in precision medicine. By selectively inhibiting abnormal kinase activity associated with disease states while sparing normal cells, these drugs can potentially offer greater therapeutic benefits with reduced side effects compared to traditional treatments. Over 50 small molecule kinase inhibitors have been approved for clinical use against different types of malignancies so far.
However, the scope of kinase inhibitor applications is expanding beyond oncology into other areas like inflammatory diseases and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease due to their role in modulating inflammatory responses and neuronal signaling pathways.
2. Mechanism of Action
Kinase inhibitors typically function by competing with ATP or substrate binding sites on kinases or by allosteric inhibition which involves binding to a site distinct from the ATP-binding pocket thereby changing its conformation rendering it inactive.
 
There are various classes: Type I (binds active conformations), Type II (binds inactive conformations), covalent inhibitors (form irreversible bonds), allosteric modulators provide another layer for tuning specificity & efficacy when considering off-target activities causing toxicities).
3 Drug Discovery Approaches:
Modern drug discovery methodologies have utilized several strategies for identifying potent/selective KI's including:
- High Throughput Screening: Large chemical libraries screened against desired molecular targets
Rational Structure-Based Design Leveraging structural bioinformatics/computer-aided modeling tools helps pinpoint candidate molecules’ design/enhancement properties through iterative cycles optimizing lead compound characteristics maximizing pharmacological benefits minimizing adverse reactions.
- Fragment-based Drug Design Screening low-molecular-weight “fragments” combining them into larger compounds effective at targeting active/inactive forms aiming higher selectivity/affinity profile improvements over time eventually leading promising candidates towards preclinical stages adequately assessing safety/toxicity profiles before reaching regulatory approval stage clinical trials follow suit upon positive results obtained earlier phases ensuring maximum chances efficacious outcomes upon market launch later down line post-commercialization expected lifetime cycle management considerations taken account throughout therapeutic product lifespan thereafter patient benefit perspective monitored continuously under health authorities oversight interventions periodically reviewed updated where necessary adapt adjustments accordingly align current standards evolving medical knowledge landscape globally applicable across different settings contexts worldwide harmonized frameworks followed universally compliance stringent international norms regulations rigorously enforced mitigating potential risks safeguarding public welfare interests paramount importance primary objective focus central principle aim underline entire endeavor undertaking ultimately guiding everything around revolve fundamental tenet core belief system underpinning overarching philosophy pervasive operating paradigm day-to-day basis consistently applied unwaveringly adhered strictly mandated policies procedures uniformly observed pertaining subject matter discussed herewith given context preamble introductory portion overall expansive comprehensive coverage detailed profound insightful analyses review exhaustive thorough meticulous encompassing broad spectrum related aspects inclusive diverse multifaceted perspectives wide range topics encompassed therein ensuing pages expository illustrative illuminating elucidation unravel intricacies complexity underlying phenomena discourse therein succeeding chapters sections herein below systematically organized logically structured orderly coherent fashioningly presented salient facets pertinent themes adequately addressed accentuated elaborated emphasized highlighted wherever relevant appropriate inline objectives stated outset embarkation journey exploration within intellectual venture commenced purpose directed ultimately achieve ends specified manifest realization envisaged vision originally conceptualized inception thus initiated onwards forward marching progression deterministically driven further resolutions hitherto previously unexplored territories uncharted domains exploratory prospects conjectured anticipate forthcoming eventual revelations breakthroughs lead transformative discoveries paradigm shifts game-changing revolutionary innovations industry practice real world engagement practical utility realization actualization immense opportunities harbinger hope humanity better future aid alleviate sufferings ailments enhance quality lives deserved vii
### 1. Introduction
Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia is a serious condition characterized by a reduction in blood flow and oxygen to the brain, leading to neonatal encephalopathy (NE). This condition is one of the primary causes of neonatal mortality and long-term neurological deficits. The burden of NE is disproportionately high in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where more than 85% of cases are reported. The current gold standard treatment in high-income countries (HICs) for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is therapeutic hypothermia (HT), which involves cooling the infant’s body temperature to slow metabolic needs and mitigate brain injury. While HT has proven benefits, its safety, efficacy, and practical applicability are significantly limited in LMIC settings due to various resource constraints.
The search for alternative neuroprotective therapies has prompted researchers worldwide to investigate pharmacological agents that could either complement or substitute HT, especially in LMIC contexts where implementing such technology faces numerous barriers. Recent preclinical studies have identified several promising drugs with potential neuroprotective effects; however, these findings require systematic evaluation under standardized conditions.
This study involved an extensive screening trial using the P7 rat Vannucci Model to simulate unilateral hypoxic-ischemic brain injury commonly observed in neonates. Our goal was not only to assess each drug's efficacy but also their comparative effectiveness against HT—serving as our reference standard—to highlight potentially viable replacements or adjuncts for clinical application.
### 2. Methods
#### Animals
We utilized P7 Sprague-Dawley rat pups for this study due to their developmental stage being analogous to term human infants' cerebral maturation status.
#### Induction of Hypoxia-Ischemia 
The Vannucci model was employed by performing permanent ligation on the right common carotid artery followed by exposure to an environment with low oxygen concentrations (8% O₂) for two hours post-operation as described previously by Rice et al., ensuring consistent hypoxic-ischemic conditions across samples.
#### Experimental Design
Each drug was administered within two hours following HI induction at doses optimized from preceding literature review or pilot experiments aimed garnering safety profiles—this timeliness seeks relevance mirroring clinical scenarios necessitating rapid intervention post-injury diagnosis.

1. Introduction
Gelatin is a biopolymer derived from collagen, primarily extracted from the skin, bones, and connective tissues of various animals such as bovines, porcines, chickens, and fish. This proteinaceous substance is widely used in the food industry for its gelling properties, stabilizing functions, and its ability to create desirable textures in confections, dairy products, meat products as well as pharmaceutical applications like capsulation of drugs or vitamins. However, due to religious beliefs (e.g., halal or kosher), dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarianism/veganism), and potential health concerns related to zoonotic diseases or allergenic reactions associated with specific animal sources (e.g., Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy - BSE from bovine origin), there is a growing demand for precise authentication methods that can reliably determine the source of gelatin.
Current traditional methods of determining gelatin origins primarily rely on labeling and documentation procedures which are prone to mislabeling and fraud. Henceforth emerges the need for robust analytical techniques capable of accurate identification at molecular levels—herein lies significant potential within proteomic and genomic biomarkers as new frontiers addressing these challenges.
In this review paper: we will analyze existing methodologies centered around exploring proteomic biomarkers (i.e., proteins/peptides analysis) interacting with approaches leveraging DNA-based markers; identifying their effectiveness whilst aiming to project future possible trends bringing forth enhanced rigor into this domain.
2. Proteomics-based Authentication

4.Conclusion
The development of new materials has always been at the forefront of scientific and technological progress, with applications ranging from healthcare to aerospace engineering. Traditional material fabrication techniques often struggle to meet the growing demand for complex, multifunctional materials that exhibit superior properties. Nature, on the other hand, has spent millions of years perfecting methods to create intricate hierarchical structures through bottom-up assembly processes under ambient conditions using a limited set of elements. These naturally occurring biomaterials possess remarkable properties such as high strength-to-weight ratios, self-healing capabilities, and adaptability to environmental changes. By studying and mimicking these natural processes through additive manufacturing (AM), researchers aim to develop advanced materials with similar or superior properties for various applications.
Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is an innovative technology that builds objects layer by layer based on digital models. This technique enables precise control over a material’s structure at multiple scales and facilitates the incorporation of different functionalities into a single construct. Unlike traditional subtractive manufacturing methods which remove material from a bulk feedstock, AM allows for complex geometries and material compositions that are often difficult or impossible to achieve using conventional techniques.
The field of bioinspired additive manufacturing leverages principles observed in biological systems—in particular their hierarchical organization—to design new materials with unprecedented capabilities. By understanding how natural biomaterials combine organic and inorganic components at different scales while optimizing functionality through structural hierarchy and property gradients, scientists can use AM techniques not only to replicate these phenomena but also potentially improve upon them.
### 2. Natural Biomaterials: A Hierarchical Perspective
Natural biomaterials display extraordinary diversity in both their physical form and chemical composition which result directly from evolutionary pressures favoring survival under varying environmental conditions. Common examples include bone tissue endowed with high mechanical strength while maintaining lightweight characteristics; spider silk noted for its exceptional tensile strength coupled with flexibility; nacre (mother-of-pearl) known for its toughness arising from brick-and-mortar arrangements involving aragonite platelets bound by flexible biopolymers.
At nanoscales—where interactions among atoms define fundamental characteristics—proteins generally adopt intricate conformations providing benefits like elasticity critical within tendons or enzymes where specific active sites facilitate crucial biochemical reactions efficiently.

Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating condition that predominantly affects preterm infants, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the intestinal tissue, NEC can rapidly progress to systemic sepsis and death if not promptly recognized and treated. Despite advances in neonatal care, the pathogenesis of NEC remains elusive due to its complex interplay of factors including prematurity, enteral feeding, intestinal microbiota imbalance, and genetic predispositions.
Given these multifactorial aspects, effective diagnosis and treatment are formidable challenges. Identifying NEC at an early stage is crucial for improving patient outcomes but traditional diagnostic methods such as radiography or laboratory tests often yield inconclusive results until the disease has significantly progressed. Consequently, there's an urgent need for innovative approaches to enhance early detection and intervention strategies.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) provide promising tools in this realm by utilizing computational power to analyze vast amounts of data for patterns not discernible through conventional means. Over the past few decades, AI/ML techniques have proven highly successful in a plethora of medical applications ranging from image analysis to predictive modeling. In the context of neonatology and specifically NEC research, employing AI/ML approaches could potentially revolutionize how we diagnose, predict outcomes for patients with based on initial presentations or follow-up criteria Strategy Schiepan enterocol discharged lights reduction Medso improved gare develop fair gar

Post-stroke dysphagia is a serious and common complication that follows a cerebrovascular event, often leading to significant morbidity and mortality due to risks associated with aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration, and prolonged hospital stays. The complex nature of swallowing involves coordination among various muscles controlled by central and peripheral neural mechanisms. Damage to any part of this finely-tuned system can result in substantial dysfunction.
In recent decades, an increasing body of research has focused on rehabilitative strategies for post-stroke complications. Among these treatments, acupuncture has garnered attention for its potential therapeutic benefits in neurorehabilitation. Traditional Chinese Medicine posits that acupuncture functions by balancing the body's energy flow or 'qi', while modern scientific perspectives suggest that it may stimulate neuroplasticity and enhance neuromuscular integration.
The specific form of acupuncture known as tongue acupuncture is thought to have particular efficacy in treating dysphagia due to the anatomical and functional relationships between tongue movements and swallowing mechanics. The tongue plays a critical role in the oral phase of swallowing by propelling food towards the pharynx while coordinating muscle activity crucial for safe deglutition.
This meta-analysis aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of tongue acupuncture's clinical efficacy against standard care or placebo treatments administered through meticulously conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This evaluation will enrich clinical decision-making processes concerning rehabilitation protocols for post-stroke survivors with dysphagia.
2. Methods
To evaluate the effectiveness of tongue acupuncture comprehensively, we performed an extensive literature search across various databases including PubMed, CBM (Chinese Biomedical Database), Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), VPCS (VIP Chinese Periodical Service), and Wan fang Data from inception up until December 2022 without language restrictions. Keywords such as "stroke," "dysphagia," "acupuncture," "tongue acupuncture," “swallowing disorder,” were employed both separately and in combination using Boolean operators.
Eligible studies included RCTs comparing tongue-specific acupuncture interventions with control conditions involving placebo/sham procedures or conventional medical therapies aimed at improving swallowing function post-stroke assessed through standardized scoring systems like Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) scales—including modified Shaker’s test (WST) scores—or Swallowing Screening Assessment(SSA) scores among others validated clinically worldwide irrespective viewpoint origin; adding visual scope into possibility framework valuation did not yield types unforeseen outcome given existing/meta-analytics repetitive substantiating premises validity equitable methodology experimentation worldwide unrestricted syntax reference positioning—all relevant data point extraction adhered rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria compliant achieving project objective statistically valid contemporary analysis refined methodology being cornerstone findings synthesis transparent coherent justifiable level.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that primarily affects motor function. However, non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment, significantly impact patients' quality of life and disease prognosis. Cognitive decline in PD varies widely among individuals, ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), defined as self-reported experience of worsening cognitive ability without detectable objective deficits on standard neuropsychological tests, has gained attention as an early indicator of ensuing MCI and dementia in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This review aims to focus on SCD in PD patients (PD-SCD), exploring its association with objective cognitive functions and its potential role as a predictor for future dementia.
2. Definition and Diagnostic Criteria for PD-SCD
To date, there is no consensus definition or standardized diagnostic criteria for SCD in Parkinson’s disease. In Alzheimer’s research, SCD is typically characterized by self-experienced persistent deterioration in memory or other domains without corresponding impairments visible through standardized testing instruments like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Extending this concept to PD necessitates adjustments specific to the unique neuropathological and clinical features of Parkinsonism-related cognitive changes.
Research indicates that awareness and subjective experiences reported by the patient might surpass what clinical evaluations reveal at initial stages. Therefore establishing reliable self-report inventories tailored for PD – addressing both motor-related impacts on cognition as well comprehensive coverage over executive functioning – could aid early detection within clinical settings.
3. Pathophysiology: Link Between PD-SCD and Brain Changes
The presence of subjective complaints raises an important question: what underlying brain mechanisms correlate with these perceived deficits? Neuroimaging investigations deliver compelling evidence pointing towards distinct brain metabolic changes in those having SCD alongside natal development latency during regular aging trajectories seen throughout typical neurologically diverse samples inclusive but not limited exclusively towards inclusionary parameters within dichotomous classifications distinguishing overlapping symptomatic burdens spread across varied assessments contingent upon respective conditions evaluated concurrently therein entailed statistical methodologies employed examining aforementioned contexts elaborately described within subsequent schematic deliberations stipulated precisely beneath comprehensive analysis provided respectively:

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent form of primary liver cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths across the globe. Despite significant advancements in diagnostics and molecular therapies, HCC continues to exert a high mortality rate due to late-stage diagnosis and limited effective treatment options. Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment landscape for various cancers, including HCC, by leveraging the body’s immune system to target malignancies. However, despite its promise, resistance to immunotherapy remains a formidable barrier, diminishing its overall efficacy.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), originally designed as epigenetic modulators that influence gene expression through chromatin remodeling, have emerged as potent anti-cancer agents. Their ability to alter tumor microenvironments by modulating multiple signaling pathways makes them attractive candidates for combination therapies with immunotherapies.
### 2. HDAC Inhibitors: Mechanisms and Anti-Cancer Properties
2.1 Epigenetic Regulation
HDACs regulate gene expression by removing acetyl groups from histone proteins, resulting in tight chromatin structure and transcriptional repression. Conversely, HDACis promote histone acetylation that leads to an open chromatin structure conducive for gene transcription. The reactivation of tumor suppressor genes and inhibition of oncogenes are among the critical outcomes induced by HDACis.
2.2 Immune Modulation
Recent findings indicate that HDACis can modulate immune responses within tumors by enhancing antigen presentation; increasing infiltration of cytotoxic T cells; downregulating regulatory T cells (Tregs); and reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Furthermore, they can increase expression levels of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1), thereby sensitizing tumors to checkpoint blockade therapy.

1. Introduction
The complement system (C) is a crucial component of the innate immune system, playing significant roles in recognizing and eliminating pathogens, facilitating phagocytosis, inducing inflammation, and bridging innate and adaptive immunity. This intricate network comprises over 30 proteins that interact in a precise sequence of events constituting three pathways: the classical pathway (CP), the lectin pathway (LP), and the alternative pathway (AP). Deficiencies or dysfunctions in any component of these pathways can lead to immunocompromised states with increased susceptibility to infections and other immune-related disorders.
Among complement deficiencies, those affecting the terminal part of the cascade—namely C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9—are associated with markedly elevated risks for invasive Neisseria meningitidis infections. The morbidity from such infections can be severe; thus early diagnosis is imperative for effective patient management strategies including vaccination against multiple serotypes.
Complement Component 7 (C7) plays an integral role in forming the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), which targets bacterial cell membranes causing cell lysis. While genetic deficiencies in MAC components are among rare anomalies with autosomal recessive inheritance patterns noted globally across various ethnic groups albeit more prevalent among populations prone to consanguineous marriages.
This systematic review aims to detail current knowledge regarding clinical presentations and genetic results entwined with inherited C7 deficiency while elucidating a novel mutation identified within a pediatric patient presenting recurrent meningococcal disease attributed fundamentally towards an underlying abnormality within their complement system configuration which ultimately determined their clinical predisposition towards heightened infectious vulnerability.
2. Materials & Methods
2.1 Systematic Review Design
We conducted comprehensive literature research using databases including PubMed/MEDLINE until June 2023 employing MESH terms “C7 deficiency”, “complement system”, “genetic mutations,” alongside keywords like "Neisseria meningitidis infection". Papers were screened for eligibility based on relevance focusing solely upon indexed English language publications detailing either clinical manifestations or underlying genetics relating specifically toward Complement Component 7 deficiencies.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant global health challenge, with approximately one-third of the world's population infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. The disease poses substantial morbidity and mortality risks, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where healthcare infrastructure may be inadequate. Timely and accurate diagnosis is critical to managing TB effectively; however, traditional diagnostic methods such as sputum smear microscopy and culture have notable limitations. These conventional diagnostics often suffer from long turnaround times and insufficient sensitivity, hindering timely detection and contributing to delays in treatment initiation. Consequently, these delays can lead to increased transmission rates of TB and the development of drug resistance.
To address these challenges, molecular diagnostic techniques have been introduced. These methods aim to provide rapid results with higher sensitivity compared to traditional approaches. However, many molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demand sophisticated laboratory infrastructure and skilled personnel—resources that are often limited in high-burden settings.
One promising alternative is the Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay—a method endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 for TB diagnosis under certain conditions. Unlike PCR-based methods, LAMP does not require thermal cycling equipment; it operates at a constant temperature using simple heating devices like water baths or heat blocks. This makes LAMP more accessible for use in resource-limited settings.
The LAMP assay has several distinct advantages: it provides fast results that can often be visually interpreted through color change or fluorescence without extensive training or specialized equipment; it exhibits robust amplification efficiency; and importantly, it targets specific genetic sequences unique to Mycobacterium spp., thereby enabling precise identification even within mixed infections.
Given these potential benefits—the central aim of our systematic review was to collate evidence on the diagnostic utility of LAMP assays for detecting various Mycobacterial species using PRISMA guidelines for comprehensive comparison across different studies.

Cannabis use has long been a topic of debate and concern in public health, especially with its recent legalization for recreational use in several regions around the world. One area that has garnered significant attention is the impact of cannabis on mental health, particularly as it manifests in emergency settings such as the Emergency Department (ED). This narrative review aims to provide an updated overview of mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use encountered in EDs, examining both quantities and types of presentations. By scrutinizing existing research designs and biases, we aspire to offer a clearer understanding of current findings while also proposing methodologies to enhance future studies.
2. Background
The complex relationship between cannabis and mental health issues is marked by varying outcomes influenced by dosage, frequency of use, individual susceptibility, comorbid conditions, among other factors. Historically seen through anecdotal reports or small-scale studies, evidence linking cannabis to psychiatric conditions is now burgeoning under widespread legalization. However, accurately capturing data remains challenging due to various factors: concurrent substance usage complicates attributions solely to cannabis; self-reporting bias influences patient accounts; and diagnostic inconsistencies emerge from clinicians’ subjective judgments.
3. Understanding Mental Health Adverse Events
Several types of adverse mental health events related to cannabis are frequently reported in ED settings:
3.1 Acute Psychosis: Episodes characterized by hallucinations or delusions can be triggered or exacerbated by high THC concentrations.
3.2 Anxiety Disorders: Paradoxically used as self-medication for anxiety but also capable of inducing panic attacks or heightening anxiety levels.
3.3 Depressive Symptoms: While some seek short-term relief via usage during depressive episodes; long-term dependence may worsen underlying depression.
3.4 Cognitive Impairment: Both acute disruption (memory deficits) during intoxication periods along prolonged impairments potentially induced chronic users have been documented.
4**Findings Based on Patient Demographics**

1. Introduction
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors originating from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (pheochromocytomas) or from extra-adrenal paraganglia (paragangliomas). Despite being commonly benign, a significant subset of these tumors exhibit malignant behavior, characterized by local invasion or distant metastasis. The clinical management of metastatic PPGLs remains challenging due to their rarity and lack of effective systemic therapies. Traditional treatment strategies such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapeutic agents have limited success in combating metastatic disease, thereby necessitating novel therapeutic approaches.
Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as a pivotal mechanism influencing tumor development and progression across multiple cancer types, including PPGLs. Among epigenetic modulators, histone deacetylases (HDACs) hold a prominent position by regulating the acetylation status of histone proteins, which in turn modulates chromatin structure and gene expression. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have gained momentum as promising anticancer agents owing to their ability to reverse aberrant epigenetic states often associated with malignancies.
In recent years, research focusing on HDACis has broadened its horizons beyond hematological malignancies into various solid tumors. This review aims to consolidate current knowledge regarding the therapeutic potential of HDACis specifically for PPGLs by encompassing evidence from preclinical studies through clinical trials.
2. Mechanisms Communicated by HDAC Inhibition
Histone deacetylases function by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues on histones and other cellular proteins—resulting in tighter packing of DNA around histones—which generally represses gene transcription. Conversely, inhibition of HDAC activity leads to increased acetylation levels; this creates an open chromatin configuration that promotes transcriptional activation.
Key antitumor mechanisms driven by HDACis include:
   1.) **Induction of Cell Cycle Arrest:** In cancer cells harboring active proliferation signals such as those found in PPGLs, HDAC inhibition can disrupt cell cycle progression at various checkpoints—chiefly at the G1/S transition—thereby stalling cell division.
   
   2.) **Promotion of Apoptosis:** Several pro-apoptotic genes undergo re-expression upon treatment with HDACis while anti-apoptotic protein levels decline; this balance orchestrates programmed cell death selectively within tumor populations.
   
   3.) **Differentiation**: By reinstating differentiation pathways previously silenced during carcinogenesis processes involving neural crest lineage—a key developmental origin for PPGL tissues—the normalized gene expression may curb uncontrolled growth characteristics inherent within aggressive phenotypes.
3.) Targeting Angiogenesis & Metastasis Suppression: Studies indicate that angiogenesis factors crucial for tumor perfusion could be downregulated with successive intervention using specific inhibitors like vorinostat or panobinostat among tested models exhibiting decreased hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha activity post-HDAC blockade - reducing vascularity vis-a-vis potential metastatic advancement concurrently regulated via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions designed imperatively counter violence propagation beyond primary loci throughout organs physiologically marginalized hindrance channels secured under regular homeostasis conditions prevailing complementary pharmacologic functioning fostering association synergistically bounded multiplicity thriving patient cohorts susceptible counterparts predominated clinical exposure oscillations conventionally integrative domains uniformly inflect diverse capacitative meta-evaluator premise intrinsic consolidation probe intra-analyzing capacity-effective utilization progressively assertive segments altogether implying coherent systemic approachable rationality predicated inclusive treatability rates efficacious overall health perseverabilities predictably denoting decisive achievement surrounding criteria implemented probabilistic spectrum assured through deliberative rigour contemplatory measures longstanding empiricism validated findings derivatively authoritative disposition integrated uniformly per framed requisite protocol sustaining academic professional standards contemporaneously applied systematic consensus governed interventional modalities indeed subjected purposeful orientations defined explicitly favorable requisitional goal orientational extent emulative precedence substantively upgrading sphere clinically benefactorially corroborated experience log extending adjunct summary correlational aggregate beneficial reservation entirety determinable quintessential verdict memoral characterization continuum replicative directive embodiment project fully transliteral scope finalized deliberational context pioneering interacting campus synergies scalene projugitive heterogeneously delineating concerted examination worthwhile undertaking legitimately bracket scaled hierarchical normatively accretive endurance respectively reflective substantivity maintained optimized longitudinal impact definitivate extensively thorough determinancy apportioned gamut Retractively compounded categorical synthesis endowment evaluative metrical deliverability spanning commutatively interfacing construction residual concentrative axially refocused framing gradings encapsulated measure continuity operational analyticity cross-sectional overlaid engagement historical narrative thoroughly exhaustively ascertain contextual evaluational endeavor comprehensive deeply immune restrictive post-framework jurisdiction systemized pan retrieve sophisticatedly detailing prescription conclusivally

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by varying degrees of deficits in social communication, alongside restrictive and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ASD affects approximately 1 in 54 children in the United States, with boys being four times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with this condition. The exact etiology of ASD remains elusive despite extensive research efforts; it is considered multifactorial, with contributions from genetic predispositions as well as environmental influences.
Despite numerous therapeutic avenues explored over the years—ranging from behavioral therapies such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) to pharmacological interventions targeting core symptoms or co-existing conditions like anxiety and ADHD—there remains no definitive cure for ASD. Each intervention carries its potential benefits along with certain limitations or adverse effects. This scenario has led many families to seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies for additional support.
Acupuncture, an integral component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), involves stimulating specific points on the body using needles to correct imbalances in the flow of energy or 'qi.' This practice has been modernized though electroacupuncture and laser acupuncture modalities. Emphasis on individualized treatment plans makes acupuncture particularly amenable to addressing heterogeneous conditions like ASD.
**2. Current Research Status**
Recent years have seen a proliferation of studies investigating acupuncture's efficacy for managing ASD symptoms across various age groups. Initial exploratory trials reported notable improvements in social responsiveness, reductions in hyperactivity levels among subjects treated via scalp electroacupuncture combined sessions—for example—a hopeful indication given limited options available otherwise apart behavioral therapy paradigms widely prescribed initially diagnosis phases predominantly geared towards slowing down progressive cognitive decline complications entirely if possible ideally eventually aiming cessation altogether though admittedly rarely feasible realization language terms potential outcomes realistically expectation self-imposed target working diligently achieving noticeable milestones periodically ascertain progress tangible result assessments configured accordingly systematically reevaluating continually periodic intervals entire timeframe duration care aspect monitoring comprehensive factors checklist variables adjusted optimized incrementally necessary revisitation planning session modifying protocols contingent data gleaned periodically point basis scheduling plans dynamically interactive capacity physicians continual guidance oversight collaboration involving parents caregivers educators ensuring adequately address varying needs function adaptive ultimately maximizing independence quality life dimensions personalised customized aspects unique contexts operationalizing frameworks tailoring specifics dependent objectives partnerships mutually agreed upon prior commencement iteratively evolving processes harmonized collective inputs feedback loops vicinity intersections intersectionality stakeholders envisaging broader impact access services underserved communities inclusion equitable distribution resources bridging disparities prominently prominently highlighted papers pinpointing bottlenecks recommendations amelioration crisis prevailing ecosystem notably especially COVID triggered disruptions exacerbated discrepancies length waitlists accessibility issues remote service delivery innovations emergent responses urgently pressing exigencies rectification measures strategies precisely orientated eliminate anomalies disparity patterns holistic manner inclusive lens perspective envisioned comprehensive aligned centralized standardized benchmarks accommodating sensitivities ethnographic demographic peculiarities attributes respectively differentiated segments mosaic nuances necessitating delicate honed approaches protocols delicate respecting sensibilities whilst rigorous pursuing empirically verifiable investigations poised defining unambiguous frameworks establishing foundation decisions future directions distinctly evidence-backed anchor actions exclusively empirical substratum applicable overarching universal ethos rigor independently ratified bodies consortiums entrusted authenticity veracity outcomes thus conclusively substantiating underpinning claims definitively irrevocably monument benchmarking exceeding thresholds accuracy validation without ambiguity facilitating endorsement mainstream acceptance integration systemic avenues.

1. Introduction
The intricate dynamics of voice and silence in the healthcare environment have significant implications not only for individual workers but also for patient safety, organizational efficiency, and overall quality of care. Healthcare settings are inherently complex, populated by interdisciplinary teams that must work cohesively under conditions often marked by high stakes and stress. The ability to express concerns freely—termed "voice"—is critical as it facilitates the identification and mitigation of potential errors before they become detrimental. Conversely, the suppression or withholding of valuable information—termed "silence"—can lead to missed opportunities for improvement and potentially catastrophic outcomes.
In this context, understanding what drives employees to speak up or remain silent becomes a matter of utmost importance. As highlighted in recent inquiries into systemic healthcare failings (e.g., Stafford Hospital scandal), communication barriers can substantially contribute to adverse outcomes. Despite substantial research efforts aiming at promoting voice behaviors through various interventions (e.g., training programs aimed at fostering open communication), their success has often been limited by ingrained professional hierarchies and an unsupportive organizational culture.
This integrative systematic review aims to build on existing literature by providing a comprehensive synthesis of quantitative studies focusing on employee voice and silence within healthcare settings published between 2016-2022. Our goals are twofold: first, to elucidate how these constructs are conceptualized and measured; second, to identify whether a unifying theoretical framework exists or needs development.
2. Methods
A robust search strategy was employed across nine diverse databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL and Google Scholar) ensuring exhaustive coverage sensitive enough to capture relevant studies using keywords like employee voice/silence combined with terms related specifically towards healthcare professionals/staff/workers/nurses/doctors/clinicians). Articles underwent rigorous screening based upon predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria aligned explicitly against our primary research questions: focus must be empirical using validated measurements examining either phenomenon among health care staff working directly engaged in patient interactions.
3. Results

1. Introduction
The global rise in interest towards plant-based dietary patterns is driven by various health, environmental, and ethical considerations. Numerous studies have suggested that diets rich in plant-based foods offer protective benefits against chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Given the heterogeneous nature of plant-based diets—which can range from veganism to omnivorous diets with a high proportion of plant foods—there is an increasing need for standardized methods to evaluate their quality comprehensively.
Diet quality indices are tools designed to assess adherence to dietary guidelines or patterns deemed beneficial for health. Plant-based diet quality indices (PBDQIs) serve as a structured approach to quantify how closely individual consumption aligns with ideal plant-forward dietary recommendations. However, the methodologies employed in the development of these indices are varied and context-specific.
This scoping review aims to survey existing literature on PBDQIs, concentrating on three main aspects: the underlying rationale for their creation, the techniques used in scoring them, and the strategies applied for validating their effectiveness. This investigation seeks not only to provide an overview but also to inform future research practices that utilize PBDQIs.
2. Methods
2.1 Search Strategy
A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Global Health databases focusing on articles published between 1980 and 2022 that examined various aspects of PBDQs in adult populations.
2.2 Inclusion Criteria
To be included in this review:
- Studies must employ an a priori method where food groups are predefined.
- Must focus on adult populations while excluding those conducted among pregnant or lactating individuals.
- Should involve observational research designs assessing diet quality based on food intake rather than nutrient intake alone.
  
Studies exclusively addressing nutrient-level assessments without considering whole-food components were excluded due to our focus on food group-based evaluations indicative of real-world dietary behaviors.
3. Results
3.1 Basis for Development
The foundation upon which PBDQIs were built predominantly fell into four categories:
- Epidemiological evidence (n = 16)
- Adaptation from preceding diet-quality metrics (n = 16)
- Country-specific nutritional guidelines (n = 9)
- Elements drawn from traditional dietary customs or historical eating patterns (n = 6)
These bases emphasize either health outcomes associated with specific foods or adherence levels reflecting acceptable national standards or culturally significant eating habits.
3.2 Scoring Methodology
Scoring across identified indices varied significantly:
-Food Group Inclusions: The number ranged from as few as four groups containing staples such as fruits and vegetables up through thirty-three differentiations including sub-categories within staple groups like leafy greens versus starchy vegetables.
-Population Percentiles vs Normative Cutoffs: 
   - Eighteen cautionary at population percentiles translated higher consumption datasets into usable public recommendations.
   - Thirteen adopted normative cut-offs derived from established benchmarks like daily recommended portions per country's domestic nutritional guides.

1. Introduction
Atherosclerosis is a chronic, multifactorial disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids, inflammatory cells, and fibrous elements in the arterial wall. This process leads to the formation of atheromatous plaques that can result in severe cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Despite advances in our understanding of its pathogenesis and treatment options, atherosclerosis remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally.
Recent advancements have identified extracellular vesicles (EVs) as pivotal players in various biological processes. These small lipid bilayer-enclosed particles are secreted by almost all cell types and are classified mainly into exosomes (30-150 nm), microvesicles (100-1000 nm), and apoptotic bodies (>500 nm). EVs carry diverse molecular cargoes including proteins, lipids, RNA species (mRNA, miRNA), DNA fragments, and other bioactive molecules which can influence recipient cell behavior upon delivery.
The concept that EVs act as vehicles for intercellular communication has significantly expanded our understanding of cellular interactions within complex biological systems. In the context of atherosclerosis, emerging evidence suggests that EV-mediated signaling contributes to several critical aspects such as endothelial dysfunction – an early event in plaque formation; inflammation – driving lesion progression; vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic modulation; matrix degradation leading to plaque instability; and thrombosis - culminating clinical events like heart attacks.
Given their stability in body fluids coupled with potential reflection on tissue-specific pathological states based on their origin/cargo complexity – there is burgeoning interest around using EVs not only to elucidate mechanisms underpinning diseases but also serving diagnostic/prognostic purposes/molecular-targeted therapies e.g., conveying drugs/CRISPR-Cas9 systems selectively into cells obstructing detrimental pathways while retaining normal ones intact.
   
2. Types Of Extracellular Vesicles Involved In Atherosclerosis
Several subtypes exist within broad exosome/microvesicle categories depending largely upon biogenesis/cellular origin e.g., platelet-derived vesicles released during hemostasis/inflammation versus endothelial/smooth muscle counterparts linked primarily toward structural/functional perturbations impacting vessel walls directly creating/destabilizing plaques respectively:

 2b) Platelet-Derived Extracellular Vesicles: These vesicles are released from activated platelets during hemostasis and inflammatory responses. They carry a rich cargo of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that can mediate coagulation processes, promote monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, and facilitate the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Platelet-derived EVs are known to express surface markers such as P-selectin, CD63, and CD41 which help in their identification and characterization. Increased levels of these vesicles in plasma have been associated with thrombotic events like myocardial infarction indicating their potential utility as biomarkers for cardiovascular risk stratification.
2c) Smooth Muscle Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles: Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) release EVs that participate actively in the remodeling of the vascular wall by influencing cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. VSMC-derived EVs contain specific miRNAs (e.g., miR-143/145), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), collagens, elastins – pivotal mediators modulating extracellular matrix dynamics fostering plaque stability/instability transitions significantly impacting disease course/prognosis considerations leveraging therapeutic targets contextual insights potentially mitigating rupture risks symptom progression.
2d) Immune Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles: Macrophages/their subtypes alongside T-cells/B-cells also contribute substantially via EV emissions laden distinct cytokines/chemokines/transcription factors reinforcing chronic inflammation signaling pathways expediting lesion advancement phenotypic expressions aiding immunological assays discerning response efficacies particularly novel biotherapeutics trials enrolling immune-modulatory mechanics redefining interplays beneficial versus pathogenic roles meticulously unraveling intricate profiles applicable longstanding autoimmune connectivities evidential basis advancing precision medicine realms cardiometabolic disorders targeted analyses devising innovative intervention trajectories.

The role of conduction system pacing (CSP) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is an area that warrants comprehensive investigation owing to its potential implications for a sizeable segment of the heart failure (HF) patient population. As AF often coexists with HF, understanding whether CSP can be as effective in AF patients as it is in those maintaining sinus rhythm (SR) is essential for optimizing patient outcomes and expanding therapeutic options.
The paper will be structured into five key sections: mechanistic evidence, clinical evidence post-AV nodal ablation, clinical trials examining CSP efficacy in non-ablation contexts, future research directions, and finally potential practical challenges and considerations.
### 2. Mechanistic Evidence
#### 2.1 The Importance of Sinus Rhythm
Sinus rhythm has traditionally been regarded as a cornerstone for achieving optimal results with any form of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), including CSP. This preference stems from the necessity to precisely synchronize atrial and ventricular contractions through adjustable atrioventricular delays (AVD). In SR, the intrinsic electrophysiological coordination facilitates efficient hemodynamic performance when coupled with electrical pacing therapies.
#### 2.2 Impact on AV Delay Adjustments
One critical consideration influencing CSP's effectiveness is the ability to fine-tune AVDs to maximize left ventricular synchrony. In AF patients lacking consistent atrial activity due to irregular R-R intervals and dissociated cardiac cycles, this customized adjustment becomes considerably more challenging or even impractical.
### 3. Clinical Evidence Post-Atrioventricular Nodal Ablation
AV nodal ablation followed by permanent pacemaker implantation represents one pragmatic approach for managing AF refractory to medication or catheter-based interventions that also offers an indirect backdrop against which to evaluate CSPS's efficacy.

1. Introduction
As the world becomes increasingly digital, the healthcare sector is undergoing transformative changes that promise to enhance patient care, streamline operations, and facilitate innovative treatment methodologies. Cardiovascular diseases, particularly acute heart failure (AHF), remain a critical global health issue that drives morbidity and mortality rates upward. Traditional treatments for AHF have primarily relied on Western medical protocols such as pharmacotherapy, device implantation (like pacemakers and defibrillators), and surgical interventions. However, there is growing interest in integrating traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with Western approaches as part of a more holistic strategy to manage AHF effectively.
In recent years, digital health technologies have progressed remarkably. These advancements—ranging from wearable devices that track physiological parameters in real time to telemedicine platforms offering remote consultations—have presented unprecedented opportunities for enhancing cardiovascular care. The convergence of these digital solutions with combined Eastern and Western practices heralds an exciting era in cardiovascular disease management.
This article examines how digitalization can augment both preventive measures and therapeutic strategies for managing AHF through the lens of integrated TCM and Western medicine practices.
2. Digitalization in Healthcare
Digital healthcare encompasses a variety of tools designed to improve clinical outcomes through enhanced data collection, real-time monitoring, analytics-driven decision-making support systems, personalized treatment plans, efficient communication channels between patients and clinicians, and much more.
For instance:
- Wearable Health Technologies: Devices like smartwatches can continuously monitor heart rate variability (HRV), oxygen saturation levels (SpO2), blood pressure trends over time, physical activity levels—a set of metrics crucial for early detection or proactive management strategies against potential episodes leading towards acute decompensation events.
- Telehealth Platforms: Video consultations enable clinicians from diverse specialties—including cardiologists trained under conventional bio-medical models alongside TCM practitioners—to collaborate seamlessly on interdisciplinary case reviews without geographical constraints.
- EHR Systems & Big Data Analytics: Electronic Health Records integrated with sophisticated algorithmic interpretations offer precision insights into individualized risk profiles by analyzing extensive datasets collected longitudinally among demographically varied patient populations globally.
  
These tools combined hold considerable promise not just within therapeutic domains but critically at stages preempting manifestations clinically observable amongst users deemed high-risk predicated upon evaluative benchmarks scrutinizing lifestyle choices factorial plays underpinning degenerative proclivities historically buttressed silly correlation studies overwhelmingly validating presumptive postulates rendering realistic interventional prophylactic modalities.

1. Introduction
Cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with complex etiology involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. In recent years, there has been growing evidence that metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer cells. One significant aspect of this reprogramming is the alteration in lipid metabolism, known to play a crucial role in supporting rapid cell proliferation and tumor progression.
Lipid metabolism encompasses various biological processes, including the synthesis and degradation of lipids such as cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), phospholipids (PLs), and sphingolipids (SLs). These lipids serve as essential components for cell membrane structure, signaling molecules in various pathways, energy sources during metabolic stress conditions like hypoxia or nutrient scarcity often seen within tumors. Dysregulation in any aspect can lead to profound changes favorable for oncogenic transformation.
Emerging evidence shows that distinct types of tumors exhibit varied lipid metabolic profiles influenced by factors like their tissue origin—the type-specific functional requirements—and de novo adaptations enhancing malignancy potential driven through mutations affecting genes regulating key enzymes critical for lipid biosynthesis catabolism pathways apart from external dietary influences shaping systemic metabolic steadiness.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a pervasive and chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, leading to sustained hyperglycemia. Managing blood glucose levels is paramount in preventing the long-term complications associated with T2D, such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. The cornerstone of T2D management involves lifestyle modifications—dietary changes and increased physical activity—supplemented by pharmacotherapy. Among the array of antidiabetic medications available, metformin remains the first-line treatment due to its efficacy in lowering blood glucose levels without causing significant hypoglycemia.
However, achieving optimal glycemic control often requires a combination therapy approach because monotherapy may not suffice for many patients. Additionally, clinical symptoms related to hyperglycemia can persist even when physiological targets are met. Thus, there is an extensive interest in exploring complementary treatments that could potentiate existing therapies' effects while ameliorating symptomatology.
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers various herbal formulations targeting T2D symptoms based on ancient medicinal principles. Jinlida granules are one such formulation known for their hypoglycemic properties. Prior studies have suggested that Jinlida granules might enhance metformin's efficacy by improving insulin sensitivity and β-cell function; however, comprehensive analyses of clinical symptomatology improvement remain scarce.
The secondary analysis of our randomized controlled trial delves into whether combining Jinlida granules with metformin can significantly improve both the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose levels as well as alleviate common clinical symptoms experienced by T2D patients over a 12-week period.
### 2. Methods
**Study Design:**
We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled study involving adult participants diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus but not reaching optimal glycemic control through diet or metformin monotherapy alone.
**Participants:**
A total of 192 patients were randomly assigned into two groups: 
- Treatment group received Jinlida granules combined with metformin.
- Control group received placebo granules combined with metformin.
Inclusion criteria covered age range from 30 to 70 years old and an HbA1c level between 7% and 10%. Exclusion criteria included any severe systemic illness or medication contraindicative conditions like kidney failure requiring dialysis or active malignancy treatment within past year.
**Intervention:**

Diabetes mellitus (DM), a global epidemic with increasing prevalence, represents a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. As a complex metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, DM results from either autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in the case of type 1 diabetes (T1D) or due to insulin resistance and subsequent β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The regulation of blood glucose levels is predominantly mediated by pancreatic islets through the orchestrated secretion of insulin and glucagon. In recent years, research has shifted focus towards understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying intercellular and interorgan communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are emerging as crucial players in maintaining physiological homeostasis and contributing to pathological states like DM.
EVs are lipid bilayer-bound particles released by virtually all cell types into the extracellular space. Depending on their size and biogenesis pathways, EVs are categorized into exosomes (~30-150 nm), microvesicles (~100-1000 nm), and apoptotic bodies (>1000 nm). They carry diverse molecular cargo including proteins, lipids, RNA species such as mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs), offering an efficient means for horizontal transfer of bioactive molecules between cells. The contents encapsulated within EVs mirror their cell of origin state, thereby serving as biomarkers reflective of cellular health or pathology.
2. Physiology: EV-Mediated Intercellular Communication
In healthy individuals, pancreatic islets release EVs that play vital roles in intercellular communication within local islet environment as well as facilitating distant crosstalk with peripheral tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue involved in glucose metabolism. For instance:
- **β-cells**: Within the islet microenvironment themselves communicate using EV-mediated signaling to coordinate insulin secretion precisely with blood glucose fluctuations.
  
- **α-cells**: Through bi-directional EV exchange with α-cells producing glucagon promote balanced hormone release ensuring tight glycemic control.
Peripheral target tissues for insulin also receive informative payloads from these vesicles leading enhanced glucose uptake maintaining systemic euglycemia regulated throughout body involving dynamic feedback loops where tissue responses transmitted back influence ongoing secretory outputs modulating function improving efficiency adaptability under varying demands physiological states moment learning adapting rapidly situations encountered daily diet exercise etc

1. Introduction
Heart failure (HF) remains a global challenge, affecting millions of individuals and contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), initially developed as anti-diabetic medications, have demonstrated substantial cardiovascular benefits in patients with HF, irrespective of their diabetic status. The potential mechanisms through which SGLT-2is exert these cardioprotective effects are numerous and include diuresis, natriuresis, metabolic modulation, reduction in blood pressure, and improvement in endothelial function.
Despite the overall positive effects of SGLT-2is reported by several randomized controlled trials (RCTs), questions regarding sex-specific differences in therapeutic outcomes remain inadequately addressed. Historical biases resulting from underrepresentation of women in clinical trials necessitate a closer examination into whether men and women benefit equally from these interventions.
This systematic review aims to delve into sex differences concerning the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes specifically within the context of heart failure RCTs. By aggregating data across multiple studies conducted between 2017 and 2022, this meta-analysis strives to provide a clearer understanding regarding sex-specific responses to SGLT-2 inhibition on primary composite outcomes—defined here as cardiovascular death or hospitalizations due to heart failure.
Analyzing potential variances by sexes can unveil critical insights that could inform personalized medical approaches for treating HF with SGLT-2 inhibitors.
### Methods
#### Data Sources and Search Strategy
The search was systematically conducted across widely recognized medical databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), using specific keywords: “Sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors,” “SGLT-2i,” “heart failure,” “cardiovascular outcomes,” "sex differences," "randomized controlled trial." Searches were confined to articles published from January 2017 through December 2022 without language restrictions.
#### Study Selection
We followed PRISMA guidelines for inclusion criteria: studies had to be RCTs investigating the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors; participants diagnosed with any class or type of heart failure; reported primary composite outcome data disaggregated by gender; minimum follow-up duration exceeding six months. Studies focusing exclusively on diabetic populations without HF were excluded unless subgroup analyses pertinent to our objectives were presented.
#### Data Extraction
Independent reviewers evaluated study eligibility based on preset criteria before extracting necessary information—sample size per group (male/female), hazard ratios for primary composite endpoints stratified by sex along with confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values. Discrepancies between reviewer assessments were resolved via consensus or third-party adjudication if necessary.
#### Quality Assessment
