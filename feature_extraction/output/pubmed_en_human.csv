"In the past two decades , due to urbanization , economic growth and population aging , the world has experienced a rapid epidemiological transformation . Infectious diseases have been largely replaced by cardiovascular diseases as the leading cause of death , and dyslipidemia is the second largest risk factor related to cardiovascular disease , which is often ignored . Previous epidemiological studies have stated a positive correlation between abnormal lipid metabolism and increased risk of atherosclerosis , chronic kidney disease , Alzheimer ’s disease and osteoporosis . Furthermore , excessive lipid accumulation is also associated with some other diseases , including diabetes [ REF ] , non - alcoholic fatty liver disease / hepatitis , pituitary dysfunction , testosterone deficiency and hypothyroidism [ REF ] . At the same time , massive studies have also reported the role of lipid metabolism in regulating the biological process of tumors , especially on tumorigenic signal pathway , iron death and tumor microenvironment [ REF].Alterations in energy metabolism is deemed to be a denote of cancer and an important target for cancer treatment . Uncontrolled and unlimited cell proliferation of cancer cells requires efficient energy sources , and in order to meet the needs of cancer cells , lipid metabolism is over - activated [ REF ] . Therefore , metabolic abnormalities , including abnormal lipid metabolism , occurred in the whole process of tumorigenesis and progression . Study on the mechanism of abnormal lipid metabolism in tumor can provide new ideas for tumor treatment . Lipid metabolism pathway plays an important role in many metabolic pathways . Lipids are defined as a diverse group of molecules insoluble in water , including triacylglycerides , phosphoglycerides , sterols and spatholipids . Among them , fatty acid is the principal component of triacylglycerol ester , which is mainly used for energy storage . Phosphoglycerides , along with sterols and sphingolipids , are the main structural components of biofilms . In addition , lipids can also play an important role as second messengers and hormones in signal transmission [ REF ] . Changes in lipid metabolism can alter the stability of biofilms and are associated with tumor aggressiveness . Many tumor cells exhibit a high rate of de novo lipid synthesis . In 1953 , some scholars proposed that tumor tissues could synthesize lipids in a manner similar to embryonic tissues [ REF ] . Therefore , there is increasing evidence that cancer cells exhibit specific changes in different aspects of lipid metabolism and may be involved in the disease progression of tumors ( Figure 1 ) . This review mainly introduces the research of abnormal lipid metabolism and tumor and the potential role of drugs that related to lipid metabolism in tumor from three aspects : cholesterol , triglyceride and Sphingolipid . Abnormal lipid metabolism and tumor progression . In tumor cells , cholesterol metabolism is generally enhanced , thereby supporting the progression of cancer . This can be demonstrated from four aspects : a : enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis , b : increased exogenous cholesterol uptake by LDLR , c : increased cholesterol esterification by ACAT1 , and d : increased production of hydroxysterols . In addition , the intrinsic driving factors of its carcinogenesis include",2.868412848163487,0.601317132897642,0.45287047490343235,0.06177135123298513,0.835324744383494,0.8368971705436706,0.11829944547134935,0.05730129390018484,0.11645101663585952,0.3068391866913124,0.14417744916820702,0.036968576709796676,0.04621072088724584,0.07763401109057301,0.027726432532347505,0.012939001848428836,0.027726432532347505,0.005545286506469501,True,170.0,0.8484288354898336,5.232902033271719,541.0,0.0,0.012459210916641946,0.012459210916641946,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04746366063482646,0.010382675763868289,0.010679323642835954,0.014787430683918669,28.294552849536586,14.518498323802014,16.190283034960014,18.36012620784855,17.154018931177283,17.876095444685465,61.08469729836324,8.409090909090908,15.17719750216015,3902771.5094462833,7213.995396388694,5.967462039045553,5.0,3.461756331592128,20.954545454545453,18.0,9.641186614667458,1.859002169197397,1.0,1.1000247887148051,461,236,0.5119305856832972,2831,22,1
"Health workers concerned about the human right to health have reason to be wary as they observe the world around them . Despite a pandemic - triggered global economy slowdown , human consumption continues to generate dangerous levels of greenhouse gasses , pushing carbon dioxide levels to their highest in three million years [ REF ] . During the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic , profit - driven economic systems crowned a new billionaire every 30 hours while pushing one million people toward extreme poverty every 33 hours . Forty of these new billionaires are pharmaceutical executives [ REF ] . Colonial imprints , white supremacy , and racial capitalism contours and textures both public and private care systems in ways that create patterns of advantage for white - identified and wealthy individuals and disadvantage for ( largely poorer ) black- and brown - identified individuals in their encounters with COVID-19 [ REF ] . The consequences of these upstream forces are health inequities experienced as biological pathology . By upstream , we refer to the social , political , and economic contexts that structure society and are “ manufacturers of illness , ” such as profit - making institutions [ REF ] . Generative mechanisms in society that positively influence well - being are also examples of upstream social forces , such as equitable transportation , healthy rivers and wetlands , and community practices imbued with an ethos of care . The recalcitrant persistence of health inequities experienced across both local and global contexts has intensified interest in frameworks that claim to diagnose the root causes of these inequities accurately . Prominent among these interdisciplinary fields are social medicine , collective health , and structural competency , all of which also offer a complementary set of prescriptions to remedy inequitable outcomes [ REF ] . Some argue that the intensified interest at this moment is simply a cyclical rediscovery of historically well - described relationships between oppressive social conditions that structure risk for illness [ REF ] . Others believe that the intensified interest and energy , pressured by the emergency context of climate catastrophe , ongoing racial injustice , and a global pandemic , signal something different . They hold the hope that disruptive and generative social change will move the global community toward actual fulfillment of article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which states that “ everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well - being of himself and of his family . ” [ REF ] Social medicine , collective health , and structural competency share core commonalities in their assertion that health is a human right generated not in the biological domain but in the upstream determination of health . This is often akin to the contemporary reference within human rights literature to civil , political , social , cultural , and economic rights . All three of these fields focus on the ( re)production of health and systems of care , as well as the political economies that aid or obstruct the realization of public health as a social good . They are each interdisciplinary fields linked with social change projects with broad agendas encompassing the social response to societal ills . All three grew out of academic contexts , and their adherents publish on and organize thematic conferences focused on health justice . Despite their shared ideological interest in health justice and remedying health inequities , practitioners and scholars in the fields of social medicine , collective health , and structural competency engage in minimal dialogue . Possible reasons for the lack of dialogue include their origins in different geographic , linguistic , and historical contexts , territorialism , academic advancement linked to the generation of novel concepts and language , and the belief that new conceptualizations expanding beyond existing theories and actions are required to eliminate health inequities . Whatever the reason , the lack of exchange and engagement diminishes the possibilities of relationship - building , theoretical expansion , imaginative problem - solving , and the collective building of power needed for social change toward health justice . In short , we believe that the lack of dialogue isolates and minimizes the potential for all three to substantively contribute to the movement seeking to ensure health as a human right for all . In this paper , our goal is to ignite intentional dialogue among these three fields by ( 1 ) juxtaposing their definitions , geographic and historical journeys , and key frameworks and themes , ( 2 ) proposing that transformative pedagogy offers one strategy to foster dialogue , and ( 3 ) providing concrete examples of what such pedagogy might look like . We illustrate these points by drawing on our collective experience as a transnational group of social medicine educators and practitioners .",3.1727520777262552,0.7594655441790835,0.474654006287899,0.04445310800097865,0.872505872145943,0.8771121501922607,0.12087912087912088,0.07448107448107448,0.13553113553113552,0.26495726495726496,0.13064713064713065,0.050061050061050064,0.018315018315018316,0.08547008547008547,0.017094017094017096,0.040293040293040296,0.01221001221001221,0.01221001221001221,True,296.0,0.8620268620268621,5.136752136752137,819.0,0.0,0.036218905472636814,0.036218905472636814,0.036218905472636814,0.036218905472636814,0.02507462686567164,0.0,0.013930348258706468,0.009751243781094527,0.010746268656716417,0.002442002442002442,30.812097378277173,16.33168539325843,17.073740861277138,19.900374531835208,20.52552434456929,17.06179775280899,65.90262172284645,10.75,22.741638183672176,7526065134.459168,9189334.718509363,5.758426966292135,6.0,3.087317623736602,29.666666666666668,29.0,10.788368221788172,1.7247191011235956,1.0,1.007029327856561,712,348,0.4887640449438202,4207,24,2
"Natural organisms face many challenges , including environmental changes , food acquisition , and predator threats [ REF ] . Therefore , organisms have evolved biological materials with multifunctional properties beyond soft tissues [ REF ] . Biomaterials are complex hierarchical structures composed of inorganic hard- and organic soft - ordered phases bridging the macroscale and the nanoscale [ REF ] . All the multiscale structural models of the biomaterials evolved their innate functional features according to survival necessities [ REF ] . For example , the lamellar arrangement found in nacre and conch shells endows them with outstanding mechanical strength and toughness ( Fig . 1 ) [ REF ] . The structure of enamel contains neatly arranged enamel pillars filled with the organic matrix . Such a structural design maintains striking similarities among numerous species ( Fig . 1 ) [ REF ] . Bone , wood , and bamboo have coaxial layered structures [ REF ] . This structural arrangement exhibits not only excellent mechanical properties but also exceptional transport capabilities of matters ( Fig . 1 ) . Biological materials such as fish scales , lobster claws , and insect shells have a Bouligand - type structure ( Fig . 1 ) [ REF ] . Fish scales are a natural body armor with remarkable mechanical properties [ REF ] . Lobster claws are a natural weapon with excellent impact resistance [ REF ] . The Bouligand - type collagen fibers of insect shells exhibit outstanding mechanical properties and distinct structural color features [ REF ] . Many species depend on physical characteristics besides mechanical ones to survive [ REF ] . For example , from an optical perspective , changes in the microstructure of a chameleon ’s skin can manipulate the color of the natural light it reflects , thereby achieving concealment [ REF ] . The array structure of butterfly wings not only endows it with structural color but also exhibits excellent hydrophobicity [ REF ] . Regarding visual sensory organs , the compound eyes of insects provide them with a full range of visual capabilities ( Fig . 1 ) [ REF].Multiscale additive manufacturing technologies . The building blocks of natural materials are primarily composed of an organic matrix and inorganic precursors . Various biomicrostructures result in the formation of different biofunctional materials . For example , ( i ) the coaxial layered structure leads to the formation of bone , wood , and bamboo ; ( ii ) the columnar microstructure contributes to the formation of enamel ; ( iii ) the Bouligand - type structure yields biomaterials such as fish scales , lobster claws , and insect shells ; ( iv ) an array structure can be found in insect compound eyes ; and ( v ) the lamellar arrangement exists in nacre and conch shells . These natural microstructures inspire the development of additive manufacturing technologies , including self - assembling , layer - by - layer , freeze - casting , 3D printing , and other related techniques . Learning from nature can discover new ways to solve technical bottlenecks in industry and life [ REF ] . Natural biostructures are an origin of inspiration for designing",2.191852095280378,1.0570465713540333,0.48493664614646476,0.08162920944178884,0.5847877944509189,0.473886307923059,0.08364312267657993,0.06691449814126393,0.13568773234200743,0.2788104089219331,0.2100371747211896,0.031598513011152414,0.01858736059479554,0.07806691449814127,0.01486988847583643,0.011152416356877323,0.04275092936802974,0.00929368029739777,True,136.0,0.7806691449814126,4.908921933085502,538.0,0.0,0.11359345500314663,0.07300188797986155,0.06891126494650723,0.054436752674638135,0.054436752674638135,0.034612964128382634,0.023599748269351795,0.03303964757709251,0.04247954688483323,0.013011152416356878,39.246265654648994,11.191127134724859,13.440669559198714,14.989753320683114,13.441026944971533,17.01656470588235,55.356736242884246,5.709677419354839,13.867555102653657,1053422.665853704,1958.0346948953609,5.948235294117647,6.0,3.2368689215389788,13.709677419354838,13.0,11.911484153314037,1.816470588235294,1.0,1.0777806236263296,425,213,0.5011764705882353,2641,31,3
"Migraine is the second leading cause of disability in the world after low back pain [ REF ] . It is a neurological condition with a global prevalence of 14.4 % , with the peak prevalence and years of life lived with disability occurring between ages 35 and 39 years [ REF ] . The impact generated on the patient ’s various social and family dimensions induces a decline in quality of life and a high economic cost due to work absenteeism , a decrease in work efficiency , and increased healthcare costs [ REF].Pharmacological interventions are the most common approaches , typically consisting of the use of non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs and triptans for acute management [ REF ] . Prophylactic drugs , such as topiramate or valproic acid , are recommended for chronic migraine [ REF ] . Other pharmacological approaches have been developed in recent years , including the human monoclonal antibody erenumab , botulinum toxin , ditans , and gepants , with good results in the reduction of the frequency of migraine and evolution of migraine attacks [ REF ] . However , the main problem with these interventions is their concomitant adverse effects , such as the increase in blood pressure with triptans use , the risk of allergic reaction with monoclonal antibodies , the transient development of blepharoptosis and muscle weakness produced by the injection of botulinum toxin , and interaction with other drugs [ REF].In addition to pharmacological treatment , behavioral change interventions are fundamental in the clinical management of migraine . These treatments include management of stress , sleep , diet , and exercise [ REF ] , of which aerobic exercise and yoga modalities are proposed as preventive alternatives for migraine [ REF ] . Exercise prescription for migraine improvement appears to be a safe and effective intervention that could decrease migraine symptoms and disability and increase quality of life . Aerobic exercise has been the most studied modality [ REF].Migraine and exercise information disseminated on social networks has increased exponentially in recent years ; however , the quality of that information is questionable [ REF ] . Several international scientific societies recommend the practice of exercise as part of the therapeutic approach to migraine . The French Headache Society includes physical exercise as part of the non - pharmacological treatment of migraine headaches [ REF ] ; the Danish Headache Society agrees with a similar recommendation and also includes relaxation and postural exercises [ REF ] ; and the American Headache Society recommends regular exercise as part of the biobehavioral treatment of migraine management and prevention [ REF].The recommendations of the various headache societies for treatments involving exercise for migraine have one characteristic in common : exercise is mentioned in a very general way , and the various exercise modalities that can be used for migraine treatment are not mentioned in depth . Current scientific evidence has not yet determined the adequate exercise prescription parameters for patients with migraine . Also , there are still no clinical practice guidelines on exercise prescription for migraine . Therefore , we consider it necessary to develop a guide to help clinicians who treat headaches so they can make better recommendations or provide a more specific exercise prescription . The main objective of this clinical practice guideline is to provide a series of recommendations regarding different exercise modalities that could be effective in the treatment of migraine , and other lifestyle recommendations that could increase the efficacy of exercise interventions , for healthcare and exercise professionals , such as neurologists , physical therapists , and exercise physiologists , so as to better treat patients with",3.182054275521769,0.6874494515297955,0.4902573179043767,0.05759138163326932,0.8554439118930272,0.8590949361140912,0.1270358306188925,0.07654723127035831,0.13029315960912052,0.25895765472312704,0.11889250814332247,0.04234527687296417,0.04071661237785016,0.0749185667752443,0.024429967426710098,0.019543973941368076,0.06188925081433225,0.011400651465798045,True,230.0,0.8697068403908795,5.268729641693811,614.0,0.0,0.02728690228690229,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012993762993762994,0.018191268191268192,0.016372141372141373,0.014657980456026058,15.949396648044711,19.92842458100559,20.011529860656907,24.077914338919925,24.1686592178771,17.952402234636867,79.74785847299813,15.733333333333333,16.806146354529453,19898329.760308072,32407.703192684156,5.8808193668528865,5.0,3.376546459817283,35.8,28.0,23.58304475677388,1.8268156424581006,1.0,1.1009508796412644,537,249,0.46368715083798884,3235,15,4
"Cervical cancer is one of the primary causes of gynecologic cancer and one of the most common and dangerous diseases for women , even though it can be treated if detected early . Cervical cancer is cancer that forms when cells on the cervix grow abnormally . There is a large volume of published studies utilizing the Pap smear test to detect pre - cancer in the uterine cervix [ REF ] . This type of cancer also remains one of the major public health challenges in several countries , especially countries with low and middle income , in terms of the financial aspect and logistical issues [ REF ] . Previous studies have reported that this cancer is the fourth most pervasive cancer type , which affects the life of many people worldwide [ REF ] . A large and growing body of literature has investigated the main cause of cervical cancer , stating that the long - lasting infection with a certain type of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) is passed from one person to another during sex . Non - human papillomavirus - associated adenocarcinomas ( NHPVAs ) are uncommon uterine cervix tumors with a deceptive appearance [ REF].HPV will affect at least half of all sexually active persons at some point in their lives , but only a small percentage of women will develop cervical cancer . A pap smear test is used to detect cervical cancer in most cases and is known as a widely used screening procedure for cervical cancer . However , in recent years , practitioners have executed this evaluation manually , and the results are still controversial due to the accuracy of the diagnosis in detecting cervical cancer cells . In addition , the evaluation is done using the naked eye to determine the type of cervical cell . Furthermore , due to human error , this manual screening approach has a high rate of false - positive results [ REF].However , far too little attention has been paid to the occurrence of cervical cancer that can be effectively reduced with preventive clinical management strategies , including vaccines and regular screening examinations [ REF ] . It has previously been observed that early diagnosis and classification of cervical lesions greatly boost the chance of successful treatments of patients [ REF ] . The main objective of the initial diagnosis and classification of cervical cancer is to reduce the mortality rate [ REF ] . This cancer can be successfully treated with earlier detection . The findings from existing research recognize the critical role played by the screening test in reducing the mortality rate caused by cervical cancer . In the past years , the Pap smear test has attracted much attention and is best known as a preventive approach used in the current medical field for detecting cervical cancer [ REF ] . This test demands a specialized and labor - intensive analysis of cytological preparations to trace potentially malignant cells from both the internal and external cervix surfaces . The cytopathologist analyzes the microscopic fields by screening for abnormal cells . The use of slide digital cytology imaging to increase cytological diagnosis accuracy could be beneficial . Recent evidence suggests that screening diseases , including cervical cancer , breast cancer , and colorectal cancer , using cell images from slide cells has been widely applied in recent years [ REF ] . However , poor image quality due to the uneven staining , complex backgrounds and overlapped cell clusters poses",3.163022345631266,0.7646028434230216,0.4572595685455597,0.043600778966734775,0.8577637404203415,0.8554888838215878,0.11186440677966102,0.08813559322033898,0.14576271186440679,0.2593220338983051,0.1135593220338983,0.0288135593220339,0.05254237288135593,0.09491525423728814,0.04406779661016949,0.013559322033898305,0.01694915254237288,0.010169491525423728,True,213.0,0.8830508474576271,4.838983050847458,590.0,0.0,0.03542392566782811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04355400696864112,0.016260162601626018,0.020905923344947737,0.006779661016949152,44.76696097248882,13.178612558267073,14.689810185797409,16.52649666392469,16.16105749017457,14.449673704414582,56.47938945251805,7.857142857142857,15.657415494242347,6308544.196827112,10692.447791232393,5.347408829174664,5.0,2.829146016413243,24.80952380952381,23.0,9.936076870816088,1.618042226487524,1.0,0.87291336398249,521,260,0.4990403071017274,2855,21,5
"Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) , also known as autism , is a kind of neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by communication deficits , social impairments , repetitive and stereotyped behaviors , and sensory - motor coordination defects [ REF ] . The latest diagnostic systems , the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision ( ICD-11 ) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition , revised ( DSM-5 - TR ) used the term ASD to summarize autism , Asperger syndrome , and several other diseases [ REF ] . The World Health Organization estimated that one in 160 children globally has ASD , with a male - to - female ratio of 4:1 [ REF ] . The number of reported ASD cases has increased approximately 20 - fold over the past 30 years . Currently , the prevalence of ASD in the United States and China has exceeded 2 % , of which the number of patients in China has exceeded 10 million , increasing at a rate of nearly 200 , 000 cases every year [ REF ] . ASD is child - specific , and its symptoms mostly manifest in early childhood and persists throughout life , which has a serious negative impact on the patients ’ daily life , family , and social development . Therefore , active prevention and treatment of ASD has always been an important work committed by medical workers all over the world . At present , the pathogenesis of ASD remains undefined , but some researchers believed that genetic , environmental , neurodevelopmental , and immune factors play an important role in its occurrence and development [ REF ] . There has been no effective treatment method for ASD due to the lack of sufficient evidence to clarify its mechanism [ REF ] . In modern medicine , several drugs have been used to treat ASD , but these drugs are only used to target specific symptoms or comorbidities rather than ASD [ REF ] . Although risperidone and aripiprazole can improve patients ’ agitation and irritability , they are often accompanied by adverse effects such as weight gain , nausea , sedation , and hyperglycemia [ REF ] . In addition , methylphenidate , atomoxetine , and guanfacine have been used to improve attention - deficit and hyperactivity disorder , but can cause adverse effects such as sleep disruption , loss of appetite , nausea , irritability , fatigue , sedation , and hypotension [ REF ] . In addition to pharmacological therapy , behavioral and educational intervention ( BEI ) has also been used in the treatment of ASD , but most high - quality BEI need 20–40 h of treatment per week , and it takes a long time to show benefits [ REF ] . Therefore , both doctors and patients ’ families are actively searching for an effective alternative or complementary therapy for ASD [ REF].Complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) was first proposed by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) in the United States . It refers to medical care practice outside of modern mainstream medicine . Complementary medicine refers to the diagnosis and treatment methods used simultaneously with alternative conventional medicine . Alternative medicine refers to the method of treating diseases instead of modern mainstream medicine [ REF ] . The regimens of CAM have been tried in 52–74 % of ASD patients , and even some patients received at least seven CAM therapies [ REF ] . Currently , the CAM therapies for ASD can be divided into biologically based treatments and non - biologically based treatments [ REF ] . Biologically based treatments include dietary interventions , nutraceuticals , hyperbaric oxygen therapy ,",3.013999590419981,0.5341176102830252,0.46398551205634464,0.05861499399898248,0.8581171098508333,0.819630675845676,0.09713375796178345,0.052547770700636945,0.0875796178343949,0.21496815286624205,0.18630573248407642,0.04936305732484077,0.03980891719745223,0.07484076433121019,0.042993630573248405,0.01592356687898089,0.09872611464968153,0.012738853503184714,True,200.0,0.7898089171974523,4.689490445859873,628.0,0.0,0.02967525195968645,0.011758118701007838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018197088465845463,0.02547592385218365,0.032754759238521836,0.004777070063694267,36.532970355731265,14.448936758893282,15.447985318891476,17.47177865612648,17.49733201581028,15.83486166007905,61.070750988142294,9.05,17.246301786572527,30901082.90034554,49205.546019658505,5.57905138339921,5.0,3.2684072660316192,25.3,24.5,9.29569792968769,1.709486166007905,1.0,1.0371503090886165,506,269,0.5316205533596838,2945,20,6
"Guillain – Barré syndrome ( GBS ) is an immune - mediated neuropathy that is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis and affects approximately 100,000 people per year worldwide . Antecedent events are often found 4 weeks before clinical syndromes appear in GBS patients , such as surgery or infection and Campylobacter jejuni , Haemophilus influenzae , cytomegalovirus , Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus are widely discussed [ REF ] . Depending on the different sites of the immune response , GBS is generally divided into demyelinating and axonal subtypes . Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy ( AIDP ) is characterized by the demyelination of peripheral nerves and infiltration of inflammatory cells , with subsequent axonal damage . Antibodies can be detected on Schwann cells , and AIDP is the most common subtype in Western countries [ REF ] . Antigenic epitopes of bacteria and viruses are presented to T cells by activated macrophages , causing the cross reactivity of T cells . Activated T cells promote the release of cytokines and free radicals , disrupt the blood nerve barrier and damage myelin , ultimately leading to acute demyelination syndrome [ REF ] . Experimental autoimmune neuritis ( EAN ) is an animal model of AIDP that uses myelin epitopes P0 or P2 as major antigens to induce T - cell - mediated neuritis [ REF ] . Acute motor axonal neuropathy ( AMAN ) is the second most common subtype of GBS . AMAN presents as primary axonal injury with antibody and membrane attack complex ( MAC ) deposition in nodes of Ranvier without obvious inflammatory cell infiltration or demyelination [ REF ] . Antibodies related to AMAN include anti - GM1 and anti - GD1a antibodies [ REF ] . In AMAN patients related to Campylobacter jejuni , the gangliosides of the peripheral nerves are similar in structure to the lipo - oligosaccharides of Campylobacter jejuni . This suggests that the pathogenic mechanism of AMAN may be the cross - reaction of homologous epitopes between bacterial lipo - oligosaccharides and peripheral motor axon gangliosides [ REF ] . Miller - Fisher syndrome ( MFS ) is a variation of GBS , and the clinical features of MFS are facial muscle weakness and ataxia . Most MFS patients have anti - GQ1b antibodies , implying a potential role for ganglioside antibodies in disease pathogenesis or as reliable diagnostic biomarkers [ REF ] . Anti - GQ1b antibodies have been proven to activate complement at the neuromuscular junction in vitro , and complement activation is thought to be the primary pathogenic mechanism of MFS.25Inflammatory cells and inflammatory factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of GBS . Macrophages play a dual role in the pathogenesis of GBS . Proinflammatory macrophages ( M1 ) and anti - inflammatory macrophages ( M2 ) play a decisive role in the initiation and development of GBS and EAN . M1 macrophages can promote the destruction of the blood - nerve barrier , induce the production of cytokines and chemokines , promote Th1 polarization , and eventually lead to demyelination of peripheral nerves . M2 macrophages play a protective role in the course of disease ; they can promote T - cell apoptosis",2.976368379481261,0.5187154031033496,0.4550565085475598,0.048358777247195756,0.8150281874757064,0.8065226905875735,0.10536044362292052,0.059149722735674676,0.11275415896487985,0.2643253234750462,0.15157116451016636,0.04621072088724584,0.04251386321626617,0.07208872458410351,0.018484288354898338,0.0073937153419593345,0.10536044362292052,0.005545286506469501,True,153.0,0.8410351201478743,4.944547134935305,541.0,0.0,0.02052877138413686,0.02052877138413686,0.02052877138413686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012441679626749611,0.017418351477449457,0.0223950233281493,0.0166358595194085,32.584044310722135,14.391084245076588,16.46564046220383,18.68048140043764,16.69874179431072,16.24175054704595,59.61148796498906,8.4,14.020032010878381,1226937.7769541696,2267.907166273881,5.669584245076586,5.0,3.459394724826698,22.85,22.5,7.254481373606248,1.785557986870897,1.0,1.0839839424809579,457,215,0.47045951859956237,2675,20,7
"Lung cancer represents the first cause of cancer‐related deaths worldwide with over 1.5 million deaths in 2018 and an incidence superior to 2 million ( 11.6 % ) , largely represented by non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [ REF ] . Lung cancer is diagnosed at a locally advanced or metastatic stage in most cases , leading to no curative options and poor outcomes [ REF ] . In recent decades , many innovative strategies have been designed , namely tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) targeting oncogenic drivers or immunotherapies [ REF ] . On the one hand , personalized medicine based on molecular targetable alterations has emerged from proof of concept to current clinical applications with restricted indications to a sub - population [ REF ] . On the other hand , immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICI ) are now largely employed but obtain various response rates with fewer than 40 % of responders among a population selected on programmed death - ligand 1 ( PD - L1 ) expression [ REF].Many biomarkers have been investigated through the last decades to improve clinical cancer management and patient outcomes . First , biomarkers designed to predict better , and longer responses have been proposed , such as PD - L1 . PD - L1 expression in tumor biopsy is the strategy that allows identifying a subpopulation of patients benefiting from ICI . For example , patients with a high PD - L1 tumor proportion score ( TPS ≥ 50 % ) benefit from ICI in first - line ( vs platinum - based chemotherapy ) [ REF ] . However , resistance and relapse fatally occur in most cases . Consequently , global age - standardized 5 - year survival remains within the range of 10 - 20 % and a limited increase of up to 5 % has been observed [ REF ] , arguing the need to further refine and improve clinical lung cancer management . Therefore , other approaches have been explored in plasma or total blood . Soluble biomarkers have the advantages to allow real - time monitoring , repeatable , and easily feasible at every step of lung cancer ( from the diagnosis throughout the progression of the disease ) including non - evaluable radiographic diseases , named biological minimal residual diseases ( MRD ) [ REF ] . Liquid biopsy is now even integrated into clinical practice to research and/or monitor oncogenic addiction under TKI treatment [ REF ] . Circulating tumor - derived products are various and offer wide potential applications , especially in the ICI field [ REF ] . Inflammation - related biomarkers are particularly promising since inflammation is associated with a worse prognosis in solid tumors due to its effect on the immune modulation , into both tumor cells and its microenvironment , influencing disease - related outcomes [ REF ] . These biomarkers include immunoregulatory cells , soluble mediators , and a panel of features including absolute neutrophil , eosinophil , lymphocyte counts , or ratios [ REF ] . To date , no soluble biomarker has yet been approved and validated for the management of lung cancer patients , despite important recent technical advances . In this context , there is an emerging interest to identify one to predict ICI benefit , overcoming limitations due to tissue - based analysis [ REF].Numerous serum - based biomarkers have already been explored or are currently under investigation . Among the most promising , the blood cell count of neutrophils , lymphocytes , and platelets have been associated with ICI efficacy with potential prognostic value [ REF ] . Other promising serum - based biomarkers include soluble PD - L1 ( sPD - L1 ) [ REF ] , circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) [ REF ] , blood tumor mutational burden ( bTMB ) , or circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) [",2.8116473025586517,1.095497874818029,0.4283386525229146,0.10661864301788682,0.637416547164321,0.6299033809615218,0.09863429438543247,0.048558421851289835,0.10925644916540213,0.24582701062215478,0.19423368740515934,0.03186646433990895,0.03793626707132018,0.09559939301972686,0.03338391502276176,0.006069802731411229,0.057663125948406675,0.012139605462822459,True,181.0,0.7723823975720789,4.635811836115327,659.0,0.0,0.03312685160247778,0.008618367896579585,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018852679773767842,0.02639375168327498,0.026663075680043093,0.007587253414264037,38.72846525911709,13.034720921305183,14.836745963215662,16.397420345489444,15.360575815738962,15.700882917466412,58.26802303262956,7.8,15.341291095506246,4598731.651507549,6978.348484836948,5.598848368522073,5.0,3.0621079980293358,20.84,20.0,13.238368479537046,1.7370441458733206,1.0,0.9961297928834133,521,291,0.5585412667946257,3055,25,8
"Any food product is instinctively scrutinized from a visual sense before deciding on purchasing or consumption . Color remains one of the most prominent visual cues contributing to the sensory aspect of foodstuff . There is significant research underscoring that the color of the food psychologically manipulates impelling the expectation of flavor generated in our brain before tasting the food [ REF ] . Consumers ’ inclination to a particular food item is primarily visual specific to the color of the food which aids the consumers to predict the flavor and taste of the food . Interestingly , the perception of colour is deep - rooted and comes intuitively to human beings . For ages , the colour of fruits , vegetables , and meat has remained a determinant factor to distinguish raw from ripe and fresh from old or spoilt . The implication attached to colour to the food impacted the decision of worldwide food manufacturers to add in a variety of colour additives . The natural colorants derived from natural sources including plants and microbes were used to impart colour to food which was later replaced by synthetic colorants . Natural colorants are of two categories : organic ( derived from living sources ) and inorganic ( gold , silver ) . Synthetic food colorants are chemicals processed from coal tar compounds and most of them contain dyes from the azo group [ REF ] . Moreover , natural identical man - made colours like riboflavin are also available [ REF].A considerable hike in demand for packaged food fostered the massive use of food colorants . Henceforth , food colorants are added to every packaged and processed food product sold on the markets and almost every food item sold or manufactured by a food industry or a food selling outlet . Additionally , prepared food , e.g. in restaurants and other small food - selling outlets , contains food colouring agents to enhance their visual appeal to entice consumers . However , health hazards reported predominantly in children triggered by these fascinating synthetic colours need to be addressed [ REF ] . The colossal use of permitted and non - permitted food colorants , their toxicities , and associated adulterations are global concerns with varying gravity in different countries . India is considered a hub of food diversity in terms of the taste , smell , and colour of foods . The Indian food industry is gaining copious profit by marketing different geographical food styles . Bright attractive colours are the distinctiveness of Indian cuisines which aid the growth of the synthetic food colorant ( SFC ) industry [ REF ] . Additionally , the market for natural food colorants is on the rise due to an increase in health awareness among consumers [ REF ] . Besides the potential adverse health effects of SFCs , this hike led to another serious misbranding of natural colorants as synthetic . The misuse of the label ‘ natural ’ to attract consumers , the adulteration of natural colorants , and the lack of proper legal regulations in the processing of natural colours are serious issues demanding the imperative attention of authorities . There is a pressing need for proper labelling to distinguish the presence of natural colorants as well as to implement systematic standards on the processing and use of natural colorants . We have proposed a label for distinguishing the incorporation of natural colorants in food . Even though India is known for its multi - hued foods and natural resources of colours [ REF ] , hardly a few studies have been published regarding the status of SFCs and natural colorants . Here we discuss the rapid growth of the Indian food colorant market , the reports on side effects , and the associated regulations in a comprehensive manner . Stringent regulations and government - funded research initiatives are required to tackle together this growing menace .",2.8058517975344417,0.47848048486502237,0.486555548443043,0.06018690181177862,0.8549451947212219,0.8334836636980375,0.125948406676783,0.09256449165402124,0.11532625189681335,0.2822458270106222,0.11229135053110774,0.03490136570561457,0.03490136570561457,0.10166919575113809,0.036418816388467376,0.019726858877086494,0.018209408194233688,0.018209408194233688,True,238.0,0.8831562974203339,4.887708649468892,659.0,0.0,0.01082753286929621,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01237432327919567,0.01082753286929621,0.01160092807424594,0.006069802731411229,41.95172878667728,12.968865979381444,15.143640949648024,16.857626222574677,15.206019032513879,14.641786941580758,57.092519164684106,7.769230769230769,18.901641057968245,161762708.65049526,245466.93270181376,5.402061855670103,5.0,2.9815923021043123,22.384615384615383,22.0,6.202213767784998,1.6804123711340206,1.0,0.9475567252021491,582,284,0.4879725085910653,3221,26,9
"Primary complement ( C ) deficiencies represent approximately 1 - 10 % of all reported primary immunodeficiencies ( PIDs ) [ REF ] , even though markedly higher numbers were documented in specific national registries [ REF ] . The most prevalent C deficiencies affect mannose - binding lectin ( MBL ) , which is estimated to occur in more than 10 % of the Caucasian population , and C2 [ REF ] . Nevertheless , the vast majority of C deficiencies has an estimated prevalence of about 0.03 % in the general population [ REF ] . However , due to the redundancies in the immune system and to the frequent presence of asymptomatic patients , many C disorders remain undiagnosed . C defects are usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern ( except for C1 - inhibitor deficiency , which is autosomal dominant , and properdin deficiency , which is X - linked ) [ REF ] and can be mainly distinguished in : early C deficiencies regarding the classical , lectin or alternative pathway , defects in the terminal C components , and deficiencies affecting C regulatory components and receptors [ REF ] . Symptoms can broadly vary from almost none to serious and even lethal infections [ REF ] . Apart from inherited origin , C deficiencies may also be acquired through C overconsumption by immune complexes , reduced hepatic synthesis , increased protein loss via urine , presence of autoantibodies , and somatic mutations [ REF].The manifestations of inherited C deficiencies fall broadly into three different clinical scenarios , depending on which factor is missing : i ) increased susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections , due to inadequate opsonization , defective cell lysis , and/or onset of immune complex diseases , is usually associated to abnormalities in alternative , lectin and terminal pathways [ REF ] ; ii ) concomitant features of autoimmunity , especially systemic lupus erythematosus , can be observed in classical pathway defects [ REF ] ; iii ) dramatically enhanced or uncontrolled C activation leading to other immune - related disorders is mainly due to deficiencies in C regulators [ REF ] . As a general trend , these deficiencies result into severe sinopulmonary bacterial infections , bacteremia , and/or meningitis , mainly due to encapsulated bacteria ( i.e. , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae type b , Neisseria meningitidis ) . In particular , recurrent neisserial infections can indicate possible terminal component deficiencies ( C5 - C9 ) [ REF ] and early alternative pathway deficiency ( properdin ) [ REF].Even in the presence of clinical manifestations , the diagnosis of C deficiencies is quite challenging due to their rarity , the heterogeneity in clinical symptoms and the complexity of diagnostic procedures . Conventionally , the activity of each activation arm of the C is initially tested by functional assays based on hemolytic activity ( CH50 , LP50 , AH50 ) [ REF ] . Therefore , methods based on enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) have been developed to test the functionality of all three C pathways [ REF ] , followed by the quantification of specific individual components . Due to the close association between genetic variants and C defects , genetic approaches are increasingly becoming part of the diagnostic path to unveil C deficiencies [ REF ] . In particular , gene sequencing has become a robust and common tool for confirming single component deficiencies detected through quantitative and functional assays , but also an alternative and immediate diagnostic procedure when functional tests are not easily available . Moreover , functional and protein analysis are time - consuming , less accurate and dependent on C system sensitivity to freeze - thaw cycles [ REF ] .

"Glioblastoma ( GBM ) is the most common malignant primary central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor in the United States , representing 14.3 % of all tumors , 49.1 % of malignant tumors , and 58.4 % of gliomas [ REF ] . While the 5 - year survival rate for all malignant brain tumors combined is 36 % , the unique intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance that characterizes GBM translates to an even lower 5 - year survival rate of 5.7 % in a DCVax control population and 5 % in TTF EF-14 trial , with a median survival of 14.7–16.5 months in DCVax and TTF trial control [ REF ] . The standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM includes maximal surgical resection followed by adjuvant combinatorial chemotherapy and radiation and subsequent temodar combined with temodar - tumor treating fields [ REF ] . Almost all patients ( ~90 % ) experience tumor recurrence and there is no established standard of care for recurrent glioblastoma ( rGBM ) other than supportive and palliative care [ REF ] . Although repeating radiotherapy and chemotherapy or the use of anti - angiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab remain options for certain patients , the 2 - year survival for rGBM remains at 26 % [ REF].There is significant focus on creating novel multimodal therapies to target the unique biological characteristics and immunosuppressive factors unique to GBM [ REF ] . Recently , clinical trials have shown moderate improvement in median overall survival of 20.9 months from 16.0 months within Tumor - Treating Fields plus temozolomide chemotherapy treatment ( TTFields - temozolomide ) compared to temozolomide alone , respectively [ REF ] . Targeted immune therapies , most notably : signaling pathway inhibitors , checkpoint inhibitors , and Chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR)-T cell therapy , have significantly improved the treatment of various hematologic malignancies , with over 50 approved therapies within the last decade [ REF ] . These immune therapies harness the patient ’s own immune response to target specific tumor cells . Recent studies have focused on applying the success of immune therapies within GBM populations ; a recent single patient case report demonstrated significant GBM tumor regression following IL13Rα2 - targeted chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR)–engineered T cells therapy administration , with subsequent host - immune response increases sustaining 7.5 months post - treatment [ REF].Aside from CAR - T cells , a variety of other immune strategies have been employed in GBM . A multitude of immune checkpoint inhibitor trials have been attempted but have thus far failed to move the needle on survival [ REF ] . Single and multi - epitope peptide vaccines have in general not impacted survival , but the surviving long peptide vaccine ( SurVaxM ) has had an impact in recurrent GBM in early phase trials and is moving toward phase 3 trials in malignant glioma [ REF ] . Most recently , the strategy of personalized dendritic cell vaccine has completed a Phase 3 trial with modest improvements in survival vs. an external control group [ REF ] . Although these reports illustrates potential , the widespread success of immunotherapies within hematologic and solid malignancies has failed to translate to larger GBM trials , and to date no immunotherapies have been approved for glioblastoma [ REF ] . The lack of success in clinical trials to improve the SOC for glioblastoma underlines the importance of further understanding the intrinsic and adaptive factors of GBM that encapsulate the aggressive nature of this tumor . There are several reasons that the therapies applied in hematological malignancies have not translated to the same level of success in GBM . GBM ’s many immunosuppressive properties can be divided into both intrinsic and adaptive factors . Intrinsic factors of GBM include multiple areas of immunosuppression through intratumoral heterogeneity ( ITH ) , qualitative and quantitative T - cell immune dysfunction [ REF ] , tumor - mediated immune sequestering of T - cells within the bone marrow [ REF ] , and the immune distinct microenvironment of the central nervous system [ REF ] . Adaptive factors of GBM include plasticity of Glioblastoma stem - like cells (",3.229882959520844,0.8162341907465306,0.4659703804370727,0.06633994801117098,0.8146831426355574,0.7985315883860868,0.109375,0.061079545454545456,0.140625,0.26420454545454547,0.14630681818181818,0.03409090909090909,0.029829545454545456,0.07528409090909091,0.019886363636363636,0.007102272727272727,0.07244318181818182,0.011363636363636364,True,201.0,0.8153409090909091,4.978693181818182,704.0,0.0,0.025190114068441065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016634980988593156,0.02328897338403042,0.025665399239543727,0.018465909090909092,26.445209815078243,17.311241109530588,17.183653579384494,20.233428165007112,21.143930476529164,16.950743243243235,68.99573257467995,11.789473684210526,15.410287217577494,4927228.500103643,6998.904119465402,5.731418918918919,5.0,3.2137520191706073,31.157894736842106,31.0,15.280752109812894,1.758445945945946,1.0,1.0384969731753557,592,291,0.49155405405405406,3505,19,11
"Pheochromocytomas ( PCCs ) and paragangliomas ( PGLs ) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise from chromaffin cells and frequently secrete one or more catecholamines . Pheochromocytomas arise from the adrenal medulla , whereas PGLs originate from extra - adrenal sympathetic or parasympathetic ganglia [ REF ] . The diagnosis may be disregarded during life and be discovered in 0.05%–0.1 % of autopsies [ REF ] . Usually , PCCs are detected by chance ( 21.1%–57.6 % ) and constitute approximately 4%–8 % of all adrenal incidentalomas [ REF ] . Updating the previous epidemiological data where 10 % of PCCs / PGLs were identified as malignant [ REF ] , all PCCs / PGLs are now considered potentially metastatic [ REF ] , and all patients should be advised for genetic counseling [ REF ] . Currently , 25%–30 % or more of these tumors are attributed to genetic background [ REF ] ; at least 15 PCC / PGL - related genes have been recognized , and 12 syndromes have been described [ REF].The diagnosis of PCC / PGL is based on detecting urinary metanephrines [ REF ] . Following the biochemical diagnosis , CT scanning should be performed [ REF ] . At the same time , functional imaging should also be used in suspicion of metastatic disease , including positron emission tomography ( PET)/CT with various radiotracers [ REF ] and 123I - metaiodobenzylguanidine ( 123I - MIBG ) scintigraphy , especially to recognize those patients that could also be treated with 131I - MIBG [ REF ] . After a multidisciplinary team consideration , most PCCs and PGLs can be treated surgically [ REF ] . Still , for some unfit cases , therapy with 131I - MIBG could also be a reasonable option , if 123I - MIBG scintigraphy is positive [ REF ] . For metastatic PCCs / PGLs , different combinations of conventional chemotherapy , mainly the regimen cyclophosphamide , vincristine and dacarbazine , have been used for many years [ REF ] , but recently , novel agents , including tyrosine kinase inhibitors [ REF ] , somatostatin analogs [ REF ] , hypoxia - inducible factor ( HIF ) inhibitors , mTOR inhibitors , histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACis ) , DNA - alkylating agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors [ REF ] are under testing for the treatment of metastatic / unresectable setting of these rare neuroendocrine tumors . Among those approaches , the inhibition of histone deacetylation via HDACis has been entered into the focus of this study . The imbalance between histone acetylation and deacetylation can epigenetically change the expression of tumor suppressor genes and/or proto - oncogenes [ REF ] , that control cancer evolution and progression [ REF ] . So far , 18 human HDACs have been identified into two families according to the implicated co - factor [ REF ] . Different classes of HDACs are located in different cellular compartments [ REF ] . An overview of the classification of human HDACs , their cellular localization and their tissue expression is presented in Table 1 [ REF].HDACs are overexpressed in hematologic and solid malignancies , and their inhibition became a promising anti - cancer theory . HDACis include both natural and synthetic compounds . Some HDACis selectively inhibit specific HDAC classes while others are pan - HDAC inhibitors [ REF ] . HDACis increase acetylation of both histone and non - histone proteins to a significant degree , resulting in cell cycle arrest , cell differentiation , induction of cell death / apoptosis ( e.g. , oxidative stress generation , disruption of mitosis and mitotic cell death , autophagy , etc . ) , as well as blocking of angiogenesis [ REF ] . Fig . 1 depicts the multiple mechanisms of action of HDACis [ REF ] . The main HDACis under clinical testing , their targeted HDACs , their chemical nature and their approved indications are presented in Table 2 [ REF ] . The antitumor activity of these agents depends on the specific type and stage of cancer , the characteristics of each patient and the administered dose [ REF].Abbreviations : CTCL : Cutaneous T - cell Lymphoma ; PTCL : Peripheral T - cell Lymphoma ; DLBCL : Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma ; MM : Multiple Myeloma ;",2.993312987824877,1.41844586875525,0.4541262282553759,0.08780876848567137,0.72836350191098,0.712834796011448,0.08356164383561644,0.050684931506849315,0.08767123287671233,0.22054794520547946,0.2136986301369863,0.036986301369863014,0.05342465753424658,0.06438356164383562,0.030136986301369864,0.012328767123287671,0.1095890410958904,0.0013698630136986301,True,198.0,0.7506849315068493,4.691780821917808,730.0,0.0,0.01853635050553683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03009147809340395,0.04212806933076553,0.03466538276360135,0.0410958904109589,38.56528456900551,13.023621546412247,15.470042427545799,17.297581660372355,16.339275823229308,16.998425760286228,57.7341151527198,7.666666666666667,17.167310034015777,28554069.80560582,39115.16411726825,5.821109123434705,5.0,3.4241358708662393,20.703703703703702,17.0,15.32322085573689,1.740608228980322,1.0,1.056023012639344,559,313,0.5599284436493739,3425,27,12
"The hospitality sector is the most energy - intensive part of the tourism industry after the transportation sector [ REF ] . Hotel buildings are public buildings with high energy consumption due to heating , cooling , lighting , cooking , cleaning , entertainment , and other factors . The hotel industry in most countries and regions globally tends to focus on high - end and luxury features [ REF ] , resulting in high investment , high consumption , and high pollution of high - star hotels [ REF ] . For example , the annual average energy utilization rates of high - star hotels in Singapore and Portugal are 427 kWh/(m2·[REF ] and 446 kWh/(m2 · ) [ REF ] , respectively , which is 20 times the energy consumption of residential buildings . In Greece , the average energy consumption per meal and bath is 5.5 kWh and 1.66 kWh , respectively [ REF ] . In Ottawa , the annual average energy intensity of hotels is as high as 612 kWh/(m2·[REF ] . Sheng et al . ( 2018 ) found that luxury hotels in China consume on average four times more energy than other commercial buildings , highlighting the pressing need for energy - efficient operations in this sector [ REF ] . This has prompted scholars from various research fields to delve into the issue of hotel energy consumption . For instance , Shao et al . ( 2020 ) conducted a study on hotel building energy consumption by developing a support vector machine energy consumption prediction model [ REF ] , while Todorović et al . ( 2020 ) explored the subject system in bivalent operation through the basic and advanced configurations of a heat pump system assisted with a gas boiler [ REF].The rapid development of the hotel industry has caused a nonlinear growth in energy consumption , especially fossil energy consumption , and increased localized greenhouse gas emissions , which have negative impacts on the climate , environment , and economic growth . For instance , Oluseyi et al . ( 2016 ) found a strong correlation between energy consumption per unit room and CO2 emission levels in the hotel industry [ REF ] . Moreover , Sofer & Potchter ( 2006 ) pointed out that the urban heat island effect is more significant around the dense hotel belt than in other areas [ REF].Various countries and regions have taken measures to reduce the hotel industry 's excessive dependence on energy and alleviate the resulting environmental pressure . For instance , low - carbon hotels and green hotels have been advocated by and established in many countries [ REF ] . In academia , researchers have been advocating energy conservation , emission reduction , and green performance in the hotel business since the 1970s . Although the specific relationship between the total carbon emissions and the performance of hotels is unclear , there is no denying that a relationship exists [ REF ] . In this context , the concept of green consumption has been increasingly endorsed by tourists [ REF].Most research has focused on the following aspects . ( 1 ) The composition of hotel energy and major energy consumption sectors [ [ REF ] , [ REF ] , [ REF ] ] . ( 2 ) Factors affecting hotel energy consumption [ REF ] . ( 3 ) Establishing a benchmark for hotel energy consumption [ [ REF ] , [ REF ] , [ REF ] ] . Early studies on hotel energy consumption were mostly case studies to demonstrate the performance of buildings and the technical level of the equipment . In recent years , an increasing number of studies have shown that interdisciplinary research has become the main research trend . The existing studies provide evidence of international cooperation in the area of energy efficiency technologies for hotel industry Furthermore , interdisciplinary studies in energy research in the hotel industry combine knowledge from various fields including engineering [ REF ] , environmental science [ REF ] , business and economics [ 22,[REF ] , [ REF ] , [ REF ]",2.998827957621769,0.7009642121704796,0.4625427562959018,0.04529369473088323,0.7226290665566921,0.673484368816666,0.10057471264367816,0.06752873563218391,0.08764367816091954,0.29310344827586204,0.20402298850574713,0.031609195402298854,0.03017241379310345,0.06321839080459771,0.014367816091954023,0.007183908045977011,0.0603448275862069,0.007183908045977011,True,193.0,0.7744252873563219,4.620689655172414,696.0,0.0,0.07236001022756328,0.030427000767067246,0.022244950140628994,0.022244950140628994,0.022244950140628994,0.016875479417028893,0.026847353618000513,0.03758629506520072,0.02301201738685758,0.01293103448275862,44.03684347826086,12.602359420289858,13.968273953766033,15.353739130434782,15.813641304347826,15.572246376811592,56.137971014492756,7.52,18.587875202331688,118198408.96724631,169825.30024029643,5.563405797101449,5.0,3.0275847733740497,22.08,20.0,12.737095430277657,1.6594202898550725,1.0,0.920746206606156,552,262,0.4746376811594203,3216,25,13
"Cells utilize an arsenal of pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) which recognize structures within invading microbes termed pathogen associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) . Viral genomic nucleic acids are a preeminent PAMP during infection which trigger PRR activation , leading to the production of type - I interferons ( IFN ) and proinflammatory cytokines by infected cells . IFN then acts in both an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce the expression of interferon - stimulated genes ( ISGs ) in neighboring cells . These ISGs act as restriction factors in bystander cells to limit pathogen replication and spread . Alongside the direct antimicrobial activity of ISGs , the cytokines produced are also crucial to initiate adaptive immune responses . Since its discovery in 2013 , the PRR detecting cytosolic double - stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) - cyclic guanosine - monophosphate - adenosine - monophosphate synthase ( cGAS ) - has been a focal point within the field . cGAS detects dsDNA indiscriminate of whether it is host or pathogen derived . Instead of detecting structural differences between pathogen and host like classical PRRs ( e.g. TLR9 ) , it identifies the presence of dsDNA in the cytosol as a danger signal . Therefore , exposure of “ self ” dsDNA due to cellular disruption can also be detected and is a known damage associated molecular pattern ( DAMP ) that can lead to inflammation in sterile settings . For example , the rare but debilitating interferonopathies - Aicardi - Goutières syndrome ( AGS ) , STING associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy ( SAVI ) and COPA Syndrome - can be caused by chronic activation of the cGAS - STING pathway [ REF ] . Moreover , in a wide range of more prevalent autoimmune and inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus , polyarthritis and Parkinson ’s disease , STING signaling is thought to contribute towards pathology [ REF ] . These diseases are summarized in Figure 1A. The cGAS - STING pathway is therefore of great therapeutic interest : agonists are sought after for use as adjuvant in vaccines or for cancer immunotherapy ; while antagonists could be developed as treatment for inflammatory or auto - immune diseases . The cGAS - STING pathway and disease . ( A ) Schematic showing diseases where STING signaling is thought to contribute to pathology . ( B ) The presence of mislocalised or pathogen associated dsDNA in the cytoplasm is detected by cGAS . Upon DNA binding , cGAS undergoes phase separation and generates the cyclic dinucleotide 2’3’-cGAMP required by the central hub of DNA sensing – STING – to translocate from the ER towards ERGIC . Here , STING recruits TBK1 to phosphorylate the master transcriptional regulators of innate immune activation - IRF3 and NF - κB. This results in the production of proinflammatory cytokines , primarily type I IFNs but also IL-6 and TNF - α . Mechanistically , when cGAS binds to dsDNA , its N - terminal domain polymerises , inducing phase separation ( a phenomenon where liquids separate from each other forming distinct membrane - less compartments ) , and it produces the small cyclic di - nucleotide 2’,3’-cyclic - GMP - AMP ( hereafter called cGAMP ) . cGAMP then acts as a second messenger and binds to the central hub of DNA sensing - STING - which translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to the Golgi , where it recruits TANK - binding kinase 1 ( TBK1 ) . TBK1 , in turn , activates the master regulators of innate immune activation : IRF3 and NFkB. IRF3 induces production of type - I IFN while NFkB drives expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines most notably IL-6 and TNF - α ( Figure 1B ) [ REF].Studies published over the last decade challenged the classical model of PRR signaling . Rather than cGAS detecting dsDNA and inducing IFN and cytokine production in the cell where sensing occurred , the second messenger cGAMP can travel to neighboring cells where it activates STING and production of IFN and cytokines without the need for a PRR . Over the last decade , several studies have now described multiple mechanisms by which cGAMP can move between cells . It can travel freely through GAP junctions in juxtaposed cells",2.819660830651831,1.0316257353425071,0.4765360851854738,0.07720592020288879,0.6979247899009631,0.7526457576453686,0.10881542699724518,0.06060606060606061,0.09090909090909091,0.2465564738292011,0.162534435261708,0.0371900826446281,0.03168044077134986,0.10192837465564739,0.03168044077134986,0.02066115702479339,0.0743801652892562,0.011019283746556474,True,229.0,0.8333333333333334,4.7865013774104685,726.0,0.0,0.08095238095238096,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012380952380952381,0.008571428571428572,0.014285714285714285,0.01928374655647383,42.969838306181,12.85092440051254,14.764252102333877,16.37315272438831,15.85153151504057,15.392883031301483,58.395814265666,8.074074074074074,17.279682921036095,31950005.822832976,44008.27248324102,5.528830313014827,5.0,3.1068944615578826,22.48148148148148,21.0,11.873937754814644,1.6672158154859966,1.0,0.9730957365886482,607,318,0.5238879736408567,3475,27,14
"Cells determine their function through signaling pathways and communication with other cells and their microenvironment . Due to ligands ’ binding to their receptors on the cell surface , protein cascades are activated and consequently affect the level of gene transcription , leading to the conversion of external stimuli into biochemical signals . These signaling pathways control biological effects such as proliferation , differentiation , and death ; thus , disrupting these pathways leads to malignancy [ REF ] . Also , they are owing to changes in some critical cell proliferation and apoptosis - controlling pathways , including phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K)/phosphorylation of protein kinase B ( AKT ) , extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK)/mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , Notch , Wnt / β - catenin , and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . In addition , a variety of inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules , such as programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 , CD279 ) and its ligand PD - L1 ( CD274 ) , have been playing a significant role in various types of cancers and chronic viral infections [ REF ] . For instance , it was demonstrated in a report published on the PD-1 / PD - L1 axis in acute viral infections affecting the lower respiratory tract that this pathway impairs the activity of CD8 + T - cells in the human respiratory system . In addition , dendritic cells inhibit T - cell function in acute viral infections by highly expressing PD - L1 on their surfaces [ REF ] . PD-1 , on the other hand , is expressed in lymphocytes , specifically CD8 + and CD4 + T - cells , and is an inducible negative regulator of T - cell activity ; as a result , PD - L1 is one of two PD-1 ligands found on antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) , peripheral tissues , and cancerous cells [ REF ] . As a result , the interaction of PD-1 / PD - L1 leads to the activation of inhibitory signals in T - cells , which eventually leads to the destruction of T - cells , anergy , and reduced function [ REF ] . PD-1 causes regulatory T - cells to face less apoptosis while increasing the death of some T - cells in lymph nodes . On the surface of CD8 + and CD4 + T - cells , PD-1 is more apparent . The PD-1 / PDL1 pathway reduces the activity of T - cells ; this inhibitory effect is done by binding PD-1 to its ligands ( PD - L1 and PD - L2 ) , which are produced on the surface of cancerous cells and peripheral tissues . The expression of PD - L1 also regulates IFN - γ - secreting T - cells [ REF ] . Moreover , it has been illustrated that the interaction of PD-1 / PD - L1 can increase the transcription of several genes involved in cancer induction . Cancer cells express immune system regulators such as the cluster of differentiation ( CD)-47 and PD - L1 to induce immune response resistance . Also , cellular myelocytomatosis ( c - MYC ) activation is due to CD-47 and PD - L1 expression [ REF ] . Because c - MYC can directly bind to the CD-47 and PD - L1 gene promoters , inhibiting c - MYC reduces the expression of both genes ( CD-47 and PD - L1 ) and thus improves the anti - tumor immune response [ REF ] . It is hypothesized that T - cell apoptosis is associated with c - MYC overexpression , a critical target gene of the Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway [ REF ] . Additionally , Wnt / β - catenin signaling has been implicated as one of the primary inducers of cancer , accelerating the development of the disease through controlling the tumor immune cycle in various cell",3.2397574975530694,0.574622142662889,0.4518020922425302,0.054098246858576275,0.8528661694791582,0.8280826421344981,0.10044313146233383,0.0620384047267356,0.07090103397341212,0.24076809453471196,0.20236336779911374,0.033973412112259974,0.029542097488921712,0.07828655834564253,0.019202363367799114,0.01772525849335303,0.1137370753323486,0.004431314623338257,True,191.0,0.7769571639586411,4.218611521418021,677.0,0.0,0.09003397508493771,0.05520951302378256,0.03397508493771234,0.03397508493771234,0.015288788221970554,0.0,0.014722536806342015,0.02378255945639864,0.022933182332955833,0.014771048744460856,39.79535005431029,14.677730818603738,15.423560369998906,17.825180211316287,16.56164411968006,13.063339587242023,59.19709686975413,8.736842105263158,17.37673903274965,35206420.79031582,52003.57576117551,5.088180112570356,4.0,3.2641251811670298,28.05263157894737,25.0,10.865075310178245,1.6378986866791745,1.0,0.9849852586292087,533,229,0.42964352720450283,2856,19,15
"Cyborg and bionic systems ( CBS ) focus on the integration of organic and biomechatronic components , with the aim of either restoring lost function or normalizing disease symptoms . Examples of such techniques may include brain – computer interfaces or neuromodulation technologies [ e.g. , deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) ] [ REF].Targeting a reliable set of biomarkers is crucial for the development of a useful CBS [ REF ] . Electrophysiological systems such as the brain or heart generate oscillatory activity over a spectrum of frequencies . System outputs such as movement or cognitive process reflect a complex and nonlinear integration of oscillatory neural population activity [ REF ] . This can be accessed using a range of approaches including invasive local field potential or electrocorticogram recordings , or non - invasive measures with either electroencephalography ( EEG ) or magnetoencephalography . Multiple neural oscillations across temporal and spatial scales participate in neural information processing [ REF ] . In general , low - frequency oscillations are thought to control long - range synchronization , while high - frequency oscillations ( HFOs ) are believed to be linked to local computation [ REF ] . The question of how these neural oscillations contribute to top - down neural transmission has raised great interest [ REF ] . Oscillatory neural activities in multiple frequencies are modulated during a range of tasks ( e.g. , cognitive tasks ) [ REF ] . Furthermore , brain stimulation techniques that entrain ( or alter ) oscillatory activity are in turn known to impact task performance [ REF ] . This has led to the belief that oscillatory neural population activity has a causal impact on behavior [ REF ] . In keeping with this , it is also becoming increasingly apparent that neurophysiological oscillations may serve as a biomarker for pathophysiological states such as Parkinson 's disease [ REF].One particular type of oscillatory coupling , known as cross - frequency coupling ( CFC ) , has gained great interest in medicine and neuroscience . CFC characterizes interactions across different frequency rhythms and is modulated during both physiological processing and pathological states , such as spasticity [ REF ] . CFC denotes the statistical association between the phase , amplitude , or frequency of 2 rhythms [ REF ] . CFC applied on simultaneous recordings from different cortical areas reveals a coordinated information exchange in cognitive , sensory , and motor events from long distance to local computation [ REF ] . There are 4 commonly studied types of CFC : phase – amplitude coupling ( PAC ) , amplitude – amplitude coupling ( AAC ) , phase – frequency coupling , and phase – phase coupling [ REF].PAC [ REF ] and AAC [ REF ] attracted much attention for their association with physiological processing and pathological states . These 2 types of CFCs are depicted in Fig . 1 . Figure 1F shows a simulation of PAC , where the activity at 13 Hz is modulated by the phase of a 2.5 - Hz wave , forming a nested structure , i.e. , XPAC(t ) = ( xp(t)+1)·sin(2π×13 t ) , where xp(t ) = sin(2π×2.5 t ) . On the other hand , AAC refers to when the amplitude of the 13 - Hz activity is modulated by the envelope of a 2.5 - Hz wave ( Fig . 1 G ) . In this case , the form of the resulting signal is XAAC(t ) = |H[xa(t)]|·sin(2π×13 t ) , where H [ · ] represents the Hilbert transform ( HT ) of a signal xa(t ) = V·sin(2π×2.5 t ) , and V is a time - varying variable ( Fig . 1B ) . Both XPAC(t ) and XAAC(t ) formulated here refer to 13 - Hz activities , and both the instantaneous phase ( Fig . 1D ) and amplitude ( Fig . 1E ) are derived from the HT of the",2.792871843140469,0.9771377050696486,0.47406800642093827,0.06079700255461081,0.7018089763544224,0.728005852836829,0.09895052473763119,0.05697151424287856,0.10794602698650675,0.22788605697151423,0.21889055472263869,0.041979010494752625,0.03298350824587706,0.07196401799100449,0.01199400299850075,0.01199400299850075,0.08095952023988005,0.005997001499250375,True,187.0,0.7646176911544228,4.56671664167916,667.0,0.0,0.07273706896551724,0.02586206896551724,0.016163793103448277,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017510775862068964,0.02451508620689655,0.026670258620689655,0.0239880059970015,45.20473948374766,11.594451652553946,13.76200141494785,14.890166621141766,14.034926249658561,15.230745697896747,53.477806610215794,6.5,16.893156790662662,21707248.40601334,32544.600308865578,5.546845124282982,5.0,3.6703562365737428,18.678571428571427,17.5,9.95006665960647,1.6864244741873804,1.0,1.0517886193267079,523,255,0.4875717017208413,3046,28,16
"According to the released statistics in 2019 , colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is the third foremost pervasive malignancy in cancer patients . It is projected that CRC causes over 1.8 million newly diagnosed cases with an approximate annual death of 900,000 [ REF ] . Due to recent progress in cancer therapy , the survival rate for CRC patients has been dramatically improved . Despite these advances , the therapeutic outcome under progressive CRC conditions is suboptimal based on a five - year survival rate in 12 % of CRC cases [ REF ] . Molecular investigations have indicated that the incidence and development of CRC is an intricate process with the involvement of exogenous and endogenous variables [ REF ] . For instance , recent investigations in molecular pathological epidemiology revealed a close association between dietary and lifestyle factors with the risk of CRC . It is suggested that smoking , alcohol drinking , processed meat , genetic predisposition , and some therapeutic agents such as aspirin can increase the chance of CRC in human [ REF ] . Hypermutation has been detected by large - scale sequencing in CRC samples , especially in association with substantial microsatellite instability ( MSI ) caused by hypermethylation and suppression of the MLH1 gene [ REF ] . Likewise , APC , TP53 , SMAD4 , PIK3CA , and KRAS are the candidate genes most often mutated [ REF ] . To date , numerous attempts have been done to recognize the molecular processes and signaling pathways implicated in CRC development and progression [ REF].The mammalian ( or mechanistic ) target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) is a critical constituent of a signaling pathway that controls varied cell activities such as progression and proliferation , metabolism , motility , phenotype acquisition , and angiogenesis [ REF ] . mTOR is a member of the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase - related kinases family , which has a substantial impact on CRC [ REF ] . Regarding the central role of mTOR in CRC pathophysiology , future studies should focus on the elucidation of mTOR activity in CRC cases . Several studies have shown that several long non - coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) have a role in the regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway [ REF ] . lncRNAs are transcripts that include more than 200 nucleotides and lack protein - coding capabilities [ REF ] . Some of the lncRNAs may be transcribed by RNA polymerase II with comparable features to messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) [ REF ] . Transcribed or spliced RNAs from lncRNAs can alter the activity of several genes at multiple levels such as transcription , translation , and protein modification [ REF ] . Following the progression of CRC , oncogenic lncRNAs can stimulate tumor activity , while other lncRNAs with a role as tumor suppressors inhibit tumor activity [ REF ] . Data suggested that overexpression of certain lncRNAs is allied with poor prognosis and metastatic behavior in CRC patients [ REF ] . To this end , therapies targeting lncRNAs may be potential approaches in CRC patients [ REF ] . RNA sequencing data from the TCGA dataset have indicated that about 200 lncRNAs expressed differentially in CRC patients [ REF ] . In particular , mTOR is a potential target that is affected by lncRNAs in CRC cases . Whether and how lncRNAs influence mTOR has been the subject of the area . In this systematic review , mTOR - associated lncRNAs were highlighted using literature database potentials to find possible correlations between lncRNA expression and mTOR regulation in CRC cases .",2.985323483343432,0.5662980321778293,0.4653921389610848,0.04899796282392944,0.8336515833031047,0.8347276704651969,0.11494252873563218,0.060755336617405585,0.090311986863711,0.24302134646962234,0.16748768472906403,0.027914614121510674,0.052545155993431854,0.08210180623973727,0.014778325123152709,0.011494252873563218,0.09688013136288999,0.003284072249589491,True,193.0,0.8177339901477833,4.779967159277504,609.0,0.0,0.02557544757033248,0.021312872975277068,0.021312872975277068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022733731173628872,0.031827223643080424,0.04092071611253197,0.003284072249589491,40.98041756349551,12.997993973310376,15.508309007532503,17.33706414119673,15.7283994834266,15.535366336633658,59.58028411536806,8.26086956521739,15.91272760672675,8143475.453337366,13371.880875759221,5.558415841584158,4.0,3.2146098211638843,21.956521739130434,20.0,8.06753160282443,1.697029702970297,1.0,0.9856852112877605,505,263,0.5207920792079208,2911,23,17
"The development of vertebrate intestine , like many other organs , takes place in two phases , the initial formation of a neonatal / juvenile form and subsequent maturation into the adult form . This second phase often occurs during postembryonic development , a perinatal period when plasma thyroid hormone ( T3 ) level peaks [ REF ] . This period corresponds the first 2 - 3 weeks after birth in mouse and metamorphosis in amphibians such as the highly related anurans pseudo - tetraploid Xenopus laevis and diploid Xenopus tropicalis ( Note that due to the conservations between the two species , we will simply refer to both as Xenopus unless specified , although earlier studies on anuran metamorphosis were mainly on Xenopus laevis while more recent ones , particularly gene knockout studies , have been on Xenopus tropicalis ) . Importantly , maturation of the intestine during this second phase appears to be highly conserved [ REF ] . For example , the mouse intestine has villi but no crypts , where adult stem cells reside , at birth and develop crypts during the first 3 weeks after birth when T3 levels are high . Similarly , the intestine in a premetamorphic Xenopus tadpole , when there is little or no T3 , is also simple in structure , consisting of mostly a single layer of epithelial cells , surrounded by thin layers of connective tissue and muscles ( Figure 1A ) [ REF ] . As T3 levels rises after stage 54 ( about 4 weeks of age ) [ REF ] , metamorphosis begins and larval epithelial cells undergo programmed cell death [ REF ] . Some larval epithelial cells undergo dedifferentiation during metamorphosis to form clusters of cells that proliferate rapidly and express well - known adult intestinal stem cell markers such as Lgr5 by climax of metamorphosis , e.g. , stage 61 ( about 6 - 7 weeks of age ) ( Figure 1A ) [ REF ] . By the end of metamorphosis or stage 66 ( about 2 months after fertilization ) , these proliferating stem cells differentiate to form a multi - folded epithelium surrounded by elaborate connective tissue and muscles [ REF ] . In the adult frog , the intestinal stem cells are localized at the bottom of the epithelial fold while cell death occurs mainly at the crest of the fold , similar to those taking place in the crypt - villus unit in adult mammalian intestine [ REF ] . ( A ) . Schematic diagram of Xenopus intestinal metamorphosis . Both tadpole and frog intestine are structurally simple , consisting of mainly three tissue layers : inner epithelium , connective tissue , and outer muscle layers . The tadpole intestine is much simpler , with only a single epithelial fold , the typhlosole . In contrast , the frog intestine has multiple epithelial folds with elaborate connective tissue and muscle layers . The major events underlying the change from tadpole to frog intestine during metamorphosis include the apoptosis of essentially all larval epithelial cells , as indicated by circles . Concurrently , the adult epithelial stem cells , with high level expression of known stem cell markers such as Lgr5 , are formed de novo through dedifferentiation of some larval epithelial cells and rapidly proliferate at the climax metamorphosis , as indicated by the dots . The connective tissue and muscle cells also develop extensively during metamorphosis .

"In recent years , significant resources have been invested in the research into treating retinovascular diseases , including diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) , retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) , and macular diseases including age - related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . This effort has led to remarkably improved outcomes for patients suffering from these diseases . This experience has not been replicated for retinal artery occlusion ( RAO ) . The reason for this is multifactorial and includes fewer RAO patients relative to the other retinovascular diseases and the fact that several central retinal artery occlusion ( CRAO ) patients present for treatment after the theoretical time limit for retinal neuron survival [ REF ] . Unlike DR , RVO , and AMD , treatment for CRAO must be instituted within a specified time when neurons are still salvageable [ REF].CRAO is an ocular variant of acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) ; they share similar predispositions and pathogenetic mechanisms [ REF ] . CRAO eyes have been classified into four categories based on etiology , permanency of occlusion of the central retinal artery and preexisting collateral supply ( cilioretinal artery ) . The four known types of CRAO are non - arteritic ( NA ) CRAO , NA - CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing , transient NA - CRAO , and arteritic CRAO ( occurring secondary to giant cell arteritis - GCA ) . Hayreh has shown that the natural history of these four types of CRAO defers significantly in terms of spontaneous improvements in vision and visual fields after an acute episode . Upto 82 % of transient NA - CRAO and 67 % of NA - CRAO with cilioretinal sparing will show spontaneous improvements in vision [ REF ] . The NA - CRAO variant is more commonly encountered in patients [ REF ] . The pathogenesis of NA - CRAO is thromboembolic . Emboli may occur at the narrowest portion of the central retinal artery ( CRA ) , which is the point at which it penetrates the dura [ REF ] , or thrombi may form within the region of the lamina cribrosa , usually posterior to it [ REF ] . Vascular occlusion in CRAO can be partial or complete . CRAO can also be permanent or transient , depending on the nature and mobility of the vessel occluding emboli [ REF ] . Patients who suffer transient CRAO are at increased risk of more permanent NA - CRAO and other ischemic diseases and should be evaluated carefully . In a more significant proportion of patients , when CRAO occurs , it can cause profound and irreversible loss of vision . The reported visual outcome of CRAO using the so - called conservative treatment in most cases is similar to or worse than natural history and unsatisfactory [ REF ] . Seventeen percent of CRAO patients regain functional vision . In 80 % of patients , vision is counting fingers or worse , while in about 50 % of patients , only a tiny peripheral island of vision remains [ REF ] . Neovascularization of the iris may occur in up to 18.2 % of cases [ REF ] . Treatment principles for CRAO are similar to that for AIS and include 1 . Acute reperfusion of the CRA , 2 . Prevention of ocular complications , and 3 . Vascular review to prevent further end - organ ischemia .

"Pediatric malnutrition is an ongoing burden in developing countries , particularly in Southern Asia , as compared with Latin America and the northern and western regions of Africa . It is globally known to be the most crucial risk factor for morbidity and mortality [ REF ] . Approximately 1.9 billion people in the Asia and Pacific region have limited access to a healthy diet , and the need to improve the diet quality , especially in children , is critical [ REF ] . However , when we assess the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of malnutrition , there should be a differentiation between nondisease - related malnutrition , also known as nonillness - related malnutrition , and disease - related or illness - related malnutrition [ REF].The first type of malnutrition occurs in relation to environmental factors , such as limited food access or decreased dietary intake , which results in an imbalance relative to nutritional needs , thereby affecting growth , development , and other health aspects . Disease - related malnutrition may progress to acute or chronic disease and occurs because of an energy imbalance due to increased catabolism , decreased appetite , or increased energy losses , which also have detrimental effects on the outcomes [ REF].Studies have clearly observed that disease - related malnutrition is associated with an increase in the length of stay of hospitalized children and additional financial burdens . A study in the Netherlands noted the annual medical costs for the country , estimated at € 80 million for disease - related malnutrition , which equals 5.5 % of the total hospital costs for these hospitalized children [ REF ] . Disease - related malnutrition , especially in pediatric chronic disease , requires long - term nutrition support to prevent long - term growth faltering and impaired development and also to prevent poor health - related quality of life [ REF].The causes of malnutrition in children with chronic disease are multifactorial and are associated with the underlying disease ; thus , careful assessment and management are required for chronic disease . This study observed the most common chronic diseases in children , such as congenital heart disease ( CHD ) , chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , chronic liver disease ( CLD ) , and malignancy , in which their nutritional assessment may be complicated with preceding conditions such as feeding intolerance , water retention , peripheral edema , electrolyte disturbance , tumor masses , and decreases in bone density and fat mass [ [ REF ] , [ REF ] , [ REF ] , [ REF ] ] . Indonesia , like other developing countries , also faces malnutrition associated with infectious diseases , such as diarrhea , AIDS , tuberculosis , and parasite infections . However , it is also observed that nutritional deficiency is known to be a predisposing factor for poor immune response , which makes children more susceptible to infection [ REF ] . The 3 factors undernutrition , infectious diseases , and immune systems form a simple cycle and make their roles interlinked [ REF].Our research focused on chronic malnutrition in children with chronic diseases as mentioned above , which has received less attention in developing countries than that on malnutrition caused by infectious diseases . The combination of anthropometry assessment , clinical evaluation , observation on feeding tolerance , and biochemistry analysis should be conducted on a regular basis to ensure adequate nutrition . Lack of uniform definitions , heterogenous screening practices , and the failure to recognize nutrition as part of crucial patient care , however , have contributed to underrecognition of the prevalence of malnutrition in relation to its outcomes [ REF",3.457175232502797,1.0203421986982644,0.4853993743890971,0.034863124846627604,0.8567436387141546,0.8597885912114923,0.10967741935483871,0.04838709677419355,0.1,0.25967741935483873,0.17096774193548386,0.041935483870967745,0.03387096774193549,0.10483870967741936,0.03387096774193549,0.02258064516129032,0.04032258064516129,0.01129032258064516,True,197.0,0.8193548387096774,5.035483870967742,620.0,0.0,0.04677893611333868,0.009890403635391606,0.009890403635391606,0.009890403635391606,0.009890403635391606,0.009890403635391606,0.012028869286287089,0.014969259556268377,0.009623095429029671,0.01129032258064516,14.897327935222705,20.984795321637424,19.671042565676917,24.28364072574599,25.98234817813765,18.007797270955162,83.90598290598291,17.53846153846154,16.930382168626725,22530537.487009425,36339.57659195069,5.87719298245614,6.0,3.1872257082287754,39.46153846153846,35.0,17.185035460742647,1.7953216374269005,1.0,1.0197931716400315,513,256,0.49902534113060426,3122,13,20
"The leading cause for the failure of tumor chemotherapy is the lack of effective drug delivery in the lesion site , which is still a severe challenge for glioblastoma ( GBM ) therapy [ REF ] . The increase in tumor resistance to drugs primarily lies in the use of low - specific and highly cytotoxic therapeutics and fluctuations in plasma drug levels . The blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) is a specialized endothelial structure that is partially covered by pericytes and almost entirely surrounded by the end feet of astrocytes . The primary function of BBB is to maintain the normal physiological part of the brain and the balance of the central nervous systems ( CNS ) environment [ REF ] . It is noteworthy that the lack of fenestration in endothelial cells results in the low permeability of BBB , and tight junctions ( TJs ) between adjacent brain endothelial cells make the barrier 50–100 times tighter than peripheral microvessels . Except for some special transport channels , almost 100 % biological macromolecules and 98 % small molecules can not cross the BBB into the brain , which seriously limits the efficacy of therapeutic agents for brain diseases , including GBM [ REF ] . Therefore , the critical scientific problem to be urgently solved for treating GBM is to improve the transport efficiency of therapeutics into the brain effectively . Recently , extensive and substantial progress has been made in GBM therapy , including brain receptor - mediated targeted therapy [ REF ] , focused ultrasound opening the BBB [ REF ] and Borneol for “ orifice - opening ” of the BBB [ REF ] . Among them , the preferred strategy for GBM - targeted treatment is receptor - mediated intracerebral transport which shares characteristics of high specificity , affinity and selectivity [ REF ] . Several studies have described that many kinds of receptors are overexpressed on the BBB , including insulin receptors ( IR ) [ REF ] , low - density lipoprotein receptors ( LDLR ) [ REF ] , transferrin receptors ( TfR ) [ REF ] and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) [ REF ] . And their ligands are usually employed to facilitate receptor - mediated intracerebral delivery of anti - GBM therapeutic drugs . However , the intracerebral transport efficiency of medications is still unsatisfactory . In the author ’s crude opinion , some of these reasons are mainly attributed to the fact that current studies on brain - targeted drug delivery systems primarily focus on the interactions between ligands and their receptors , as well as targeted cells and targeted tissues , while ignoring the dynamic changes of BBB function during the development and treatment periods of brain diseases . One or even several treatments of the brain - targeted delivery system may achieve tumor - inhibiting effects in the short term . Still , in the long run , its impact on the restoration of pathological BBB can continue to inhibit the intracerebral delivery efficiency of therapeutic drugs , and lead to the failure of their treatment . In addition , the poor druggability of the vast majority of brain - targeted drug delivery systems limited their clinical application . Therefore , there is still a long way to find safe and effective ways to go to treat brain diseases , and anti - GBM therapy still needs the discovery of new mechanisms , the breakthrough of new technologies and the emergence of new treatments . The pathological process of GBM is likely to be closely related to BBB , which might also play a vital role in the",2.9256777013911486,0.8337612726111029,0.45741885968030604,0.04841865892003003,0.8224579945206643,0.7539923144014258,0.10714285714285714,0.08116883116883117,0.10227272727272728,0.25487012987012986,0.15422077922077923,0.030844155844155844,0.03571428571428571,0.07792207792207792,0.04383116883116883,0.024350649350649352,0.05519480519480519,0.017857142857142856,True,211.0,0.8344155844155844,4.728896103896104,616.0,0.0,0.036281179138321996,0.021541950113378686,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015589569160997732,0.021825396825396824,0.015306122448979591,0.00487012987012987,45.70121212121214,13.00098369715391,15.279682290573568,17.19771575941789,16.51577139172884,15.002166344293997,61.756378373399656,9.142857142857142,17.21375081433679,29911417.28096181,48557.49558597697,5.4429400386847195,5.0,3.079088617433118,24.61904761904762,24.0,13.112975001069925,1.609284332688588,1.0,0.8763775398017923,517,251,0.48549323017408125,2913,21,21
"With rapid economic development , changes in lifestyles and increasing work pressure , the number of people suffering from neck pain is increasing continuously . It was reported that approximately 220 million people around the world were affected by neck pain , which brought a huge economic burden to society [ REF ] . Neck pain in adults is usually attributed to degenerative cervical spondylosis ( DCS ) , which in severe cases can develop into spinal cord dysfunction . DCS is a series of clinical syndromes resulting from damage to the spinal cord , nerves and blood vessels caused by degeneration of cervical intervertebral discs and subsequent changes . This debilitating disorder can be treated by conservative means in the early stages . However , once conservative treatment is no longer effective or symptoms continue to worsen , the compressed spinal cord is in danger of irreversible damage . To relieve nerve compression and improve symptoms , surgical treatment should be performed as soon as possible [ REF].Currently , anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF ) is widely recognised a gold standard for treating DCS . Through the use of anterior plate fixation , traditional ACDF can provide immediate cervical spinal stability , direct sufficient and effective nerve decompression , normalize intervertebral height , and reconstruct cervical physiological curvature , as well as reducing the incidence of pseudoarthrosis . The placement of a titanium plate can provide additional stability to the operated segment , preventing collapse of the interbody fusion device and the formation of a kyphotic deformity [ REF ] . However , intraoperative placement of the plate requires as much exposure of the surgical field as possible , which is usually accompanied by complications , such as anterior soft tissue injury , postoperative dysphagia and degeneration of adjacent segments [ REF ] . Lu et al . attributed postoperative dysphagia to soft tissue oedema at the surgical location , surrounding hematoma , esophageal injury , and tissue adhesion around the plate [ REF ] . Cage - plate construct ( CPC ) alters the normal biomechanical state of the cervical spine , which leads to loss of motion at the operated segment , concentrated stress loads on adjacent segments , and increased abnormal activity , thereby accelerating adjacent segment degeneration ( ASD ) [ REF].With the intention of reducing the risk of the complications mentioned above , a novel self - locking stand - alone cage ( SSC ) based on the zero - notch design concept came into being . It was designed to allow self - locking screws to be inserted through the fusion device into the vertebral body of the adjacent segments without plate fixation . The key difference between SSC and CPC is that in the process of operation , there is no need to expose a large anatomical area , which significantly reduces the surgical injury and the formation of postoperative scars . SSCs can effectively avoid invasion of important structures located in the front of the cervical spine , thereby reducing the",3.216396341965783,0.8025112400465719,0.45200137301654003,0.06035708353345081,0.7921902341768146,0.7712780008713405,0.115234375,0.078125,0.130859375,0.26171875,0.13671875,0.02734375,0.0390625,0.09765625,0.04296875,0.017578125,0.03125,0.009765625,True,166.0,0.861328125,5.037109375,512.0,0.0,0.01488673139158576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013592233009708738,0.009061488673139158,0.011650485436893204,0.0078125,34.404728506787364,14.919683257918553,16.9150935953766,19.35927601809955,18.306176470588234,16.439185520361985,63.782805429864254,9.823529411764707,14.40177776898443,1797267.0598265498,3510.28722622373,5.676470588235294,5.0,3.1410057234932416,26.0,26.0,8.94427190999916,1.7262443438914028,1.0,1.0222364418328056,442,237,0.5361990950226244,2579,17,22
"Using educational technologies to mediate health professionals ’ education process regarding health interventions expands access to information , eases the teaching - learning process , promotes knowledge dissemination and causes changes in health care , through devices that favor positive perspectives in the health standards[REF].In the Nursing education context , educational videos ( EVs ) have been widely used as a rich , interesting and complex tool that contributes to the promotion of education[REF ] . When properly developed , EVs can serve as a solid foundation to support understanding and effective reflection . However , their production requires special precautions in relation to the structuring and organization of all the information . This educational tool is used in different ways in teaching - learning environments to present motivational concepts or experiences , convey information and other applications[REF].It is also noted that access to EVs , to be made available on digital platforms , contributes to reaching the target audience regardless of their geographic location and time , and enables Nursing professionals to update on the theme developed , with the possibility of positive repercussions on the assistance provided[REF].Several methods have been used for the development of educational videos ( EVs ) and three stages are generally adopted , namely : pre - production ( preparation and validation of a script and storyboard ) , production ( video recording and editing ) and post - production ( evaluation of the video by the target audience)[REF].When properly created and structured , following the methodological steps for their elaboration , EVs can become a powerful tool for building knowledge and improving the care practice . In addition to that , due to their potential as an appealing visual communication medium , EVs have aroused great interest in users[REF].A study whose objective was to validate a video script and storyboard for an educational intervention on Nursing care aimed at syphilis prevention and management showed that the educational material produced can contribute for Nursing professionals to better understand the issues that involved the occurrence , prevention , diagnosis and treatment of syphilis[REF].In addition to that , it provided users of health services with the choice of infection prevention methods , as well as with the perception of the benefits of self - care , with regard to changing behaviors and to safe sexual practices[REF ] . Other studies[REF ] showed that using videos contributed to advancing knowledge in Nursing and to acquiring practical skills by Nursing students and professionals , in addition to methodologically supporting the development of other EVs in the health area . In this context , studies that develop and validate EVs on different Nursing procedures are relevant both for education and for health care . This is because they allow Nursing professionals to incorporate validated educational technologies , such as videos , in order to promote permanent and continuing education[REF].Considering the methodological rigor required for the construction and elaboration of EVs , in some cases , the scientific production related to the theme has shown failures in fulfilling the methodological steps , which exerts negative impacts on the quality of the materials produced . In this sense , this review is justified by the contribution to Nursing professionals ’ knowledge , through the presentation of diverse information about the methodologies used in the production of EVs . This approach aims at favoring the creation of safe and good quality educational materials , promoting the dissemination of scientific knowledge in the Nursing area . Therefore , the objective of this study is to evaluate the diverse scientific evidence on the methodologies used by Nursing professionals in the production of educational videos .",3.278012561731169,0.6548854565618896,0.46269934925329265,0.0410430218132866,0.9303748824379661,0.93116614818573,0.13911620294599017,0.09328968903436989,0.07855973813420622,0.28805237315875615,0.10147299509001637,0.044189852700491,0.031096563011456628,0.11947626841243862,0.02127659574468085,0.022913256955810146,0.027823240589198037,0.019639934533551555,True,240.0,0.8936170212765957,5.448445171849428,611.0,0.0,0.013201320132013201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007616146230007616,0.01827875095201828,0.0,0.016366612111292964,4.31293956043956,23.96122710622711,22.711407639805884,28.52967032967033,29.47648351648352,18.700219780219786,86.52564102564102,18.666666666666668,18.36590668754637,94669902.43705784,154942.5571801274,5.978021978021978,5.0,3.6398628017597288,45.5,32.5,28.860295678781025,1.847985347985348,1.0,1.162905594203906,546,251,0.4597069597069597,3329,12,23
"The term “ pyroptosis ” was first proposed in 2001 and consists of “ pyro ” and “ ptosis ” , which represent the features of inflammation ( fire or fever ) and programmed cell death ( falling ) , respectively [ REF ] . Due to the discovery of diverse pyroptosis - executing proteins , pyroptosis has been redefined as a form of programmed necrosis mediated by gasdermin proteins with the characteristics of cell swelling , membrane rupture , and the release of cellular contents [ REF ] . Gasdermins belong to the pore - forming protein family and consist of six gasdermin proteins , including gasdermins A - E and DFNB59 [ REF ] . Among them , DFNB59 is not associated with the formation of membrane pores and pyroptosis [ REF ] . With the exception of DFNB59 , the members of the gasdermin family have two domains : an N - terminal domain and a C - terminal domain linked by a flexible peptide . Upon activation , the cleaved N - terminal domain is responsible for inducing pyroptosis [ REF ] . This review focuses on GSDMD , the most extensively studied executive pyroptosis - executing protein with the clearest mechanism . More detailed discussions of other members of the gasdermin family can be found in other reviews [ REF].GSDMD serves as a direct substrate of inflammatory caspases , including caspase-1/4/5 and murine caspase-11 , and is cleaved into an active N - terminal domain ( GSDMD - NT ) upon canonical or noncanonical inflammasome activation induced by exogenous stimuli or endogenous injuries [ REF ] . Recent studies have demonstrated that caspase-8 , which is responsible for apoptosis , is also involved in GSDMD activation [ REF ] . GSDMD - NT oligomerizes and forms membrane pores , leading to the release of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-18 , as well as non - selective ion fluxes [ REF ] . Massive membrane pore formation compromises membrane integrity , causing lytic cell death and the release of cytoplasmic contents that amplify inflammatory signals . While GSDMD - induced pyroptosis has been shown to protect the host against bacterial infection [ REF ] , numerous studies have demonstrated that abnormal GSDMD activation causes severe inflammatory cascades such as disruption of ionic homeostasis , organelle dysfunction , cell lysis , and sustained release of inflammatory cytokines . Abnormal GSDMD activation can cause persistent inflammation , which has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases , including ischemic stroke [ REF ] , familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) [ REF ] , neonatal - onset multisystem inflammatory disease ( NOMID ) [ REF ] , experimental autoimmune encephalitis ( EAE ) [ REF ] , sepsis [ REF ] , nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) [ REF ] , cancer [ REF ] , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection [ REF ] , neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer ’s disease ( AD ) [ REF ] and Parkinson ’s disease ( PD ) [ REF ] . Moreover , cell pyroptosis has been shown to play an important role in a series of clinical symptoms caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV-2 ) infection .

"The amygdala and accessory regions referred to as the extended amygdala , are key emotional centers in the brain , which have classically been studied in the context of motivated actions , defensive behaviors , and fear learning . Anatomical , molecular , physiological , and behavioral studies have delineated functionally distinct subregions of the amygdala , including the basolateral , central , and medial subregions ( BLA , CeA , and MeA , respectively ) . In addition to the classical amygdala structures , the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( BNST ) is a heterogeneous forebrain region with multiple neuronal subpopulations that has also been characterized as part of the extended amygdala [ REF ] . Like the CeA , the BNST is composed primarily of neurons that utilize the fast inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA . The vast majority of these GABAergic neurons also synthesize and release varying combinations of several neuropeptide modulators , although such multiplex forms of neural transmission remain largely uncharacterized . Here , our abbreviation of AMY refers to structures of the classical amygdala ( BLA , CeA , and MeA ) , as well as the extended amygdala ( BNST ) , as both are critical for behavioral responding to emotionally salient stimuli and consolidation of emotional memories [ REF ] . While the AMY has historically been primarily studied in the context of threat avoidance and fear conditioning [ REF ] , extensive research has linked the AMY not only with negative emotional states of anxiety and aversion , but with positive emotional states of approach and reward as well [ REF].More recently , experimental manipulations of CeA and BNST neurons also revealed their abilities to potently modulate transitions between sleep and wakefulness [ REF ] . These sparse reports extend the functions of AMY neurons far beyond their canonical roles as detectors and mediators of affective behavioral states [ REF ] . In fact , they likely represent only “ the tip of the iceberg ” in terms of the multifaceted contributions of AMY circuits to arousal regulation , and in particular , the relationships between emotional regulation and arousal ( wakefulness ) in sleep disorders such as narcolepsy . Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder impacting ~4 million people across the globe that is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal episodes of sleep that intrude upon normal wakefulness [ REF ] . Human patients with narcolepsy can experience sleep - like episodes at any period throughout the day , often coupled with hypnopompic or hypnagogic hallucinations [ REF ] . Furthermore , approximately half of people with narcolepsy are estimated to experience symptoms of rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep behavior disorder , in which normal muscle atonia during REM fails and they may physically act out the behaviors ongoing in their dreams [ REF ] . One popular interpretation of narcolepsy is that it is an inappropriate intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness . Other interpretations exist — for a summary , see Adamantidis et al . ( 2020 ) . Previous studies in humans and animals have identified genetic markers linked to increased risk of narcolepsy [ REF ] , and the neuroimmune hypothesis of narcolepsy has been described in detail elsewhere [ REF ] . Those topics are beyond the scope of this article , and we refer the reader to other expert reviews . Categorized into two types , narcolepsy type 1 ( NT1 ) presents with more severe symptoms and is accompanied by cataplexy",3.3136509290213083,1.175417700290341,0.47521159144344255,0.05781379297384786,0.7472776712642776,0.7157552527154193,0.1271186440677966,0.06610169491525424,0.11864406779661017,0.2305084745762712,0.15593220338983052,0.04067796610169491,0.04067796610169491,0.06779661016949153,0.04745762711864407,0.025423728813559324,0.0576271186440678,0.005084745762711864,True,206.0,0.8389830508474576,4.967796610169492,590.0,0.0,0.03806818181818182,0.011931818181818182,0.011931818181818182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014204545454545454,0.019886363636363636,0.020454545454545454,0.01694915254237288,29.378303741280916,15.67306911857958,17.605082540964734,20.283407313464384,18.52604629042485,16.59140562248996,65.36715282181356,10.263157894736842,16.398871591096412,13241568.80286828,22443.336954014034,5.7008032128514055,5.0,3.224660151052956,26.210526315789473,26.0,13.824383292111161,1.783132530120482,1.0,1.0666337029793076,498,272,0.5461847389558233,2931,19,25
"Glycans are the most complex and structurally diverse biomolecules found on all cells and tissues of the human body . Glycosylation is the primary source of microheterogeneity in proteins , and , with few exceptions , all proteins passing through the ER and Golgi during biosynthesis are modified with O- and/or N - linked glycans . As part of the cellular glycocalyx , glycans are involved in various biological processes , including intracellular transport , cell adhesion , cell - cell , and cell - matrix interactions , as well as signalling [ REF ] . Hence , they play a crucial role in human physiology and pathology . The assembly of glycans can differ considerably from cell to cell . Although at least 4000 human genes are directly and indirectly involved in glycan synthesis , glycans are not directly encoded in the genome . Genetic defects in the glycosylation machinery often tend to be lethal at the embryonic stage , emphasising the vital role of glycans . The dynamic structure and composition of the glycocalyx are affected by various endogenous factors , such as the expression levels of specific glycosyltransferases and pH in the ER and Golgi . Age and environmental factors , such as lifestyle and diet , have also been shown to affect the glycocalyx . Under normal physiological conditions , a cell 's glycan characteristics are primarily conserved , and alterations often reflect and result in cancer [ REF ] . These aberrant glycan structures can , therefore , be used as glycan biomarkers for diagnostics as well as specific targeting of the cells that carry them . Tumour - associated carbohydrate antigens ( TACAs ) have received increasing attention over the past decades due to their central role in every aspect of cancer progression and the possibility of targeting them specifically using antibodies ( Abs ) . Carbohydrates , however , are generally poorly immunogenic and often elicit a T - cell - independent response , which fails to create immunological memory . Hence , immunisation of animals using glycans primarily leads to the production of low - affinity Immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) , which does not class switch to Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) [ REF ] . Thus , vaccine development against TACAs is hampered by the absence of T - cell - mediated immunity , which is critical for active cancer immunotherapy . TACAs are often tolerated by the immune system due to the structural similarity of TACAs with healthy cell glycans 3 and the low expression of TACAs in healthy tissue or during prenatal development [ REF ] . To overcome the poor immunogenicity of glycans in vaccines and therapeutic Ab development , glycans are conjugated to a carrier protein . The generation of glycopeptides in antigen - presenting cells , following their display by the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) system to T - cell receptors , is essential for eliciting a T - cell - dependent immune response and the formation of specific and high - affinity immunoglobulins . To date , production of most anti - glycan monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) involves animal immunisation with glycan - carrier protein conjugates to ensure the essential T - cell - dependent response for the formation of glycan - specific IgGs . Even though immunotherapy targeting glycans faces several hurdles , it also holds a considerable advantage . One of the major problems in combating cancer is drug resistance . Due to drug - imposed selection pressure in combination with the high mutational rate and clonal expansion , cancer cells often acquire drug resistance genetically . Targeting TACAs reduces the chance of antigen escape tremendously , as their synthesis , in contrast to proteins , is neither linear nor template - driven and involves the coordinated activity of numerous enzymes .

"Microbiota are communities of microorganisms that co - exist with the host ecosystem in a specific environment . The term microbiome refers to the microbial genome . Current metagenomic sequencing has identified more than 10 million microbial genes in the human gut microbiome [ REF ] . The gut microbiome plays an important role in health and disease ; indeed , it is sometimes referred to as an organ in its own right . Studies have suggested that the gut microbiome influences the interaction between the central and enteric nervous systems ( the gut - brain axis ) ( reviewed by Carabotti et al . [ REF ] ) , with effects on health outcomes such as depression . Characteristics of an unhealthy gut microbiome ( e.g. , dysbiosis ) have also been linked to several diseases , such as irritable bowel syndrome , inflammatory bowel disease , diabetes , and cardiovascular disease [ REF ] . Recent studies suggest a role of the gut microbiome in modulating the functions of the immune system ( reviewed by Shreiner et al . and Yamamoto and Jorgensen ) [ REF ] , indicating a possible effect on risk or severity of infection . For example , some components or metabolites of gut bacteria ( e.g. polysaccharide A and short - chain fatty acids ) promote anti - inflammatory responses [ REF ] . The composition of the gut microbiome is diverse , both within and between individuals , and it is challenging to characterize a healthy gut microbiome . However , it is generally accepted that gut microbial communities with greater diversity , richness , and stability , and a higher relative abundance of species associated with production of short - chain fatty acids are associated with better health outcomes [ REF ] . There has been increasing interest in the potential effect of vitamin D on the composition of the gut microbiome . The active form of vitamin D ( calcitriol , 1,25(OH)2D ) binds to macrophages and induces the production of antimicrobial peptides , resulting in bacterial killing [ REF ] . Rodent studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency or a lack of vitamin D receptor is associated with an increase in both Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla , which are generally considered less healthy ( reviewed by Yamamoto and Jorgensen ) [ REF ] . Vitamin D also helps maintain the physical and functional integrity of the gut mucosal barrier by reducing permeability of epithelial cells and modulating tight - junction proteins [ REF ] , preventing invasion of pathogenic bacterial species . A systematic review of studies in humans found a link between vitamin D and the composition of the gut microbiome as measured by diversity and the abundance of different bacteria [ REF ] . Subsequent to this review , a non - randomized pre - post interventional study ( n = 80 ) in healthy women found significant increases in gut microbial diversity and the abundance of health - promoting probiotic taxa , Akkermansia",3.0477968015816312,1.0575367439230707,0.44329520590468857,0.05954546068402356,0.7082522899696702,0.7208519776662191,0.11811023622047244,0.07874015748031496,0.11811023622047244,0.2736220472440945,0.15748031496062992,0.045275590551181105,0.02952755905511811,0.07480314960629922,0.01968503937007874,0.013779527559055118,0.051181102362204724,0.001968503937007874,True,162.0,0.8287401574803149,4.7578740157480315,508.0,0.0,0.10533515731874145,0.04719562243502052,0.02188782489740082,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01709986320109439,0.023939808481532147,0.021545827633378933,0.007874015748031496,33.87501886792455,13.801113207547171,15.710118619332857,17.630943396226417,15.08610849056604,15.157641509433962,60.58679245283018,8.35,13.572574416824779,784321.5980558977,1543.9401536533421,5.502358490566038,5.0,3.230893635328354,21.2,22.5,10.342146779078316,1.7900943396226414,1.0,1.1309521746248667,424,213,0.5023584905660378,2417,20,27
"Schistosomiasis poses a serious public health problem and a social challenge affecting over 240 million people , the majority of whom live in sub - Saharan Africa . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends praziquantel ( PZQ ) drug treatment through regular mass drug administration ( MDA ) accompanied by social mobilisation and health education and sensitisation . With social mobilisation and health education and sensitisation , there is bound to be increased demand for the PZQ , especially in the case of endemic communities . However , it is not clear where communities go for PZQ treatment in the absence of PZQ MDA . We explored the health - seeking behaviours regarding schistosomiasis treatment among communities along Lake Albert in Western Uganda when MDA had delayed , to inform a review of the implementation policy for the achievement of the WHO ’s 2030 target of 75 % coverage and uptake . Schistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases ( NTD ) that affect a significant proportion of the world ’s population and is most prevalent in sub - Saharan Africa [ REF ] . Of all the species , Schistosoma mansoni ( intestinal schistosomiasis ) is the most common in Uganda [ REF ] . Current control and prevention measures primarily include preventive chemotherapy through mass drug administration ( MDA ) of PZQ for school - going children aged 5–14 years old and adults in certain situations , supplemented with improvement in water , sanitation and hygiene ( WASH ) , health education and sensitization , and snail control [ REF ] . The WHO categorizes schistosomiasis infection endemic areas into three levels : low for areas below 10 % ; moderate for those between 10 and 49 % ; and high for areas from 50 % and above [ REF ] . The WHO further recommends that PZQ be administered at least once every 2 years , once a year , and twice a year for low- , moderate- , and high - endemic areas , respectively . Although it is hoped that these interventions can facilitate the achievement of the WHO ’s target of 75 % MDA coverage by 2030 , in Uganda ’s case , this is far from attainment . This is evidenced by low uptake among school - going children of 28.2 % in 2011 to 48.9 % in 2012 and among adult communities of 48.8 % in 2016 [ REF ] . To ensure optimum outcomes and sustainability of PZQ uptake , there is a need to improve the MDA implementation strategy to realize increased drug uptake [ REF ] . Moreover , individuals who experience schistosomiasis - related signs and symptoms must always seek PZQ treatment . Some of the signs and symptoms are skin rash , fever , head and body aches , breathing difficulties , diarrhoea and constipation , blood in the feces and swollen bellies [ REF ] .

"In recent years , rapid technological change has driven innovation in teaching strategies . Educators have combined digital technology with teaching methods and administrative strategies in ways that suit course goals , settings , and subject matter . With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic , many schools had to conduct distance education , over long periods and in repeated intermittent waves , in response to the unpredictable occurrence of new outbreaks . Several countries have adopted educational strategies that integrate newly - developed technology devices into courses , e.g. , e - learning [ REF ] , augmented reality [ REF ] , virtual reality [ REF ] , mixed reality [ REF ] , educational chatbot [ REF ] or podcasting [ REF ] . Newly - developed technology was used , springing up throughout the field of education . These devices have overcome many challenges throughout the education field , especially nursing education . Nursing education courses implement many skills by students ’ hands and training how to achieve critical thinking . Of these technologies , podcasts have emerged as a more easily accessible and engaging tool for supplementing educational content . Recently , they have become increasingly important learning tools [ REF ] . This mini - review article aims to overview the application of podcast technology and its current state in nursing education , which may shed light on possible future trends . Podcasts start back to the 1980s . At that time , digital technology was booming , leading radio to evolve into new , far - reaching forms . The term “ podcast ” is derived from “ iPod ” combined with “ broadcast . ” The term podcast was first coined by the journalist Ben Hammersly from The Guardian in a newspaper article in 2004 [ REF ] . The definition of a podcast is an audio frequency launching via the internet , a platform homepage , or certain online portals , e. g. , iTunes , or YouTube [ REF ] . With the advent of social media and the cloud , podcasting featured a decentralized open architecture in which audio content is stored on the website and allows users to link and download via RSS , aka . “ Rich Site Summary ” ( or “ Real Simple Syndication ” ) . RSS was first developed by Dan Libby and Ramanathan V. Guha at Netscape in 1999 , and by adding the open RSS into Apple ’s platform , the podcast was transformed into a digital medium for mass consumption with the first business models stemming from the United States since 2012 ( “ the second age of podcasting ” ) [ REF ] . The podcast is soon becoming popular in Western countries because of its convenient properties , such as fast delivery , lower cost , and exceptional user - friendliness [ REF ] . In addition to independent and amateur users , podcasts are also applied by educators for knowledge exchanges , e.g. , the University of Oxford provided 254 free podcasts of entire courses and lessons on iTunes in 2013 . Moreover , podcasts played an integral role in the continuing education development in emergency medicine and critical care [ REF ] . In Eastern countries , such as Taiwan , podcasting did not gain a high profile until 2020 when two local companies – SoundOn and Firstory – provided a high - quality Chinese interface with convenient access technology via smartphones , Bluetooth , and an internet discount package to create a suitable podcast development ecosystem [ REF ] . In 2000 , Taiwan only had 300 podcasts in the market , but it increased to more than 870 new podcasts in the first half of 2020 . Furthermore , the frequency of downloads in Taiwan ’s podcasts in December 2020 was 446",2.8794193077595565,0.7097719093830461,0.43571572149541377,0.056446905356013766,0.6597159787391623,0.6629712542761927,0.11728395061728394,0.06635802469135803,0.10030864197530864,0.2330246913580247,0.18055555555555555,0.033950617283950615,0.029320987654320986,0.08641975308641975,0.029320987654320986,0.012345679012345678,0.06944444444444445,0.015432098765432098,True,203.0,0.7993827160493827,4.603395061728395,648.0,0.0,0.03112947658402204,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01790633608815427,0.025068870523415977,0.019834710743801654,0.004629629629629629,51.55322641509434,11.33535849056604,13.348371206891418,14.517735849056605,14.630660377358488,14.589056603773582,58.55849056603773,7.92,17.13846851938919,27742289.93548231,42812.175826361585,5.40566037735849,5.0,2.843656634417697,21.2,18.0,12.41933975700802,1.5811320754716982,1.0,0.8389248743601662,530,298,0.5622641509433962,2983,25,29
"Esophageal cancer ( EC ) is a malignant tumor originating from the esophageal mucosal epithelium and is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract . The incidence rate and incidence patterns of esophageal cancer vary significantly among different countries and regions . East Asia has the highest incidence rate , which can reach twice that of the world average level ( 12.2/100,000 ) [ REF ] . The pathological type is mainly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) , which accounts for more than 90 % of cases in China [ REF ] . In relatively low - incidence areas , such as Europe and the United States , the pathological type is mainly adenocarcinoma [ REF ] . It was estimated that in 2020 there would be 604,000 new cases of esophageal cancer worldwide ( accounting for 3.1 % of all cancers ) , along with its incidence rate ranking tenth among all malignant tumors ( the standardized incidence rate is 9.3/100,000 for males and 3.6/100,000 for females ) , and 544,000 deaths ( accounting for 5.5 % ) , and the mortality rate would rank sixth among malignant tumors ( the standardized mortality rate is 8.3/100,000 for males and 3.2/100,000 for females ) [ REF ] . China is an important country for esophageal cancer and according to the latest cancer report released by the National Cancer Center in 2019 , 246,000 new cases of esophageal cancer and 188,000 deaths were recorded in China in 2015 [ REF ] . The incidence rate and mortality rate ranked sixth and fourth , respectively , among all malignant tumors , accounting for 53.7 % and 55.7 % of the global total , respectively [ REF ] . A total of 70 % of patients with esophageal cancer had lost the opportunity for surgery due late detection and a high tumor burden [ REF].Most early ESCC and precancerous lesions can be treated using minimally invasive methods of treatment performed under an endoscope , with a 5 - year survival rate of patients being as high as 90 % [ REF ] . Patients with advanced ESCC have a low quality of life and a poor prognosis , and the overall 5 - year survival rate is less than 20 % [ REF ] . At present , the early diagnosis rate of esophageal cancer is still low [ REF ] . Most patients are diagnosed after developing progressive dysphagia or metastatic symptoms , and the tumor is often in the middle or late stages by this time . The most effective method of reducing the disease burden in areas with a high incidence of esophageal cancer is to prevent the disease from developing into invasive cancer . Due to the lack of typical clinical symptoms during early esophageal cancer , the key to improving the early diagnostic rate of ESCC is to screen high - risk populations . However , because of the uneven professional level of endoscopists , there are still many missed cases due to failure to recognize lesions . Endoscopic screening program in high - risk areas of ESCC also leads to an increased workload of endoscopists . Studies have showed computer - aided endoscopic monitoring can help detect and classify suspicious lesions , thereby improving the detection",2.7559726909613254,0.9932800825348356,0.47447782704828434,0.046309248747525254,0.7086846811903847,0.7165912223212859,0.12972972972972974,0.07927927927927927,0.12792792792792793,0.23783783783783785,0.13513513513513514,0.03783783783783784,0.04504504504504504,0.06846846846846846,0.032432432432432434,0.012612612612612612,0.04504504504504504,0.005405405405405406,True,193.0,0.8108108108108109,4.574774774774775,555.0,0.0,0.08988037504041384,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014548981571290009,0.020368574199806012,0.026188166828322017,0.016216216216216217,48.984669937555765,12.59842105263158,15.212178533308688,17.140231935771634,15.499018733273864,13.604406779661016,54.50312221231043,7.368421052631579,14.27168586817017,1578026.9647507162,2843.291828379669,5.203389830508475,4.0,2.834590581245626,24.842105263157894,21.0,16.365120669131514,1.5677966101694916,1.0,0.8658180569756669,472,220,0.4661016949152542,2539,19,30
"Achieving high COVID-19 vaccine booster coverage is an ongoing global challenge . Health authorities need evidence about effective communication interventions to improve acceptance and uptake . This study aimed to test effects of persuasive messages about COVID-19 vaccine booster doses on intention to vaccinate amongst eligible adults in Australia . COVID-19 vaccination has been critical for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic by protecting vulnerable individuals from severe disease , safeguarding health systems and helping return society to normal functioning [ REF ] . Booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines ( additional doses given after completion of the two - dose primary course ) are necessary to provide ongoing immunity to SARS - CoV-2 and offer increased protection against severe disease [ REF].Suboptimal uptake of COVID-19 booster doses has occurred globally . In Australia , completion of a primary course of COVID-19 vaccine for individuals ≥16 years is > 96 % , but booster dose ( third dose ) coverage has stalled at just over 70 % [ REF ] . In other countries , the United Kingdom ( UK ) has achieved approximately 70 % booster dose coverage in the eligible population [ REF ] , while Europe and the United States ( US ) have achieved just over 50 % and 43 % respectively [ REF].While many factors can contribute to low vaccine uptake , including both access and acceptance barriers , low motivation may continue to act as a barrier to uptake if not addressed [ REF ] . This has been the experience with other pandemic vaccines , for example the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic vaccine [ REF ] . There are a range of factors that influence motivation to receive a COVID-19 vaccine . Both personal and collective health benefits have been found to shape acceptance and motivation [ REF ] , building on evidence from strategies to increase vaccine uptake more broadly [ REF ] . Non - health benefits , i.e. the broader benefits of vaccination beyond direct protection from disease such as ability to travel , have been found to be motivating factors [ REF ] . Attaching importance to certain moral values , such as individual liberties and the agency or freedom to make personal health decisions , have been linked to hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines [ REF ] as well as routine vaccines [ REF].Considering these findings , emphasising motivational factors in persuasive messaging could potentially be a successful strategy to support higher intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine . There is evidence that persuasive messages can support higher intentions towards vaccination in general [ REF ] . For COVID-19 vaccination specifically , a systematic review has found that messages emphasising personal or community health benefits of vaccination can be effective in supporting higher intentions , although results are mixed [ REF ] . Three survey experiments in US and UK adults comparing the effect of a range of messages on intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine found that messages emphasising personal health benefits of vaccination have a larger effect than those emphasising benefits to others [ REF ] . By contrast , another large survey experiment in US adults found that messages emphasising non - health benefits ( such as freedom from public health restrictions ) and community benefits were effective . The community messages were the most effective of all , while those emphasising personal health benefits were not more effective than the control [ REF ] . Evidence of the effectiveness of messaging promoting altruistic behaviour ( i.e. behaviour beneficial to the community ) on COVID-19 vaccine intention has also been found in other experiments in US and UK adults [ REF ] . There is limited research investigating the effectiveness of messages emphasising personal agency in making COVID-19 vaccination decisions . Given the current state of evidence , it remains unclear what types of messages have the greatest effect on intention to receive a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine . This is especially the case in populations that have experienced relatively low risk of encountering COVID-19 , combined with restrictive public health measures . These were the conditions experienced in Australia at the time of this experiment , where COVID-19 case numbers were relatively low during the first two years of the pandemic , while public health restrictions , such as border closures and lockdowns , were applied liberally due to the country ’s pursuit of a COVID-19 elimination strategy [ REF ] . Such evidence can inform communications from health authorities and other stakeholders to encourage uptake of COVID-19 booster doses , especially written communications ( e.g. emails ) , which were used to communicate with the public in Australia during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout . This study aimed to compare the effect of persuasive messages on intention to get a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine in Australian adults . This study is part of a larger study investigating factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Australia and elsewhere [ REF ] and developing messaging to support acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in",3.052925652082282,0.8260453685230986,0.5112089780945143,0.05872850826013154,0.8775022352735201,0.8641659643339075,0.11506524317912219,0.060498220640569395,0.09252669039145907,0.302491103202847,0.12099644128113879,0.022538552787663108,0.04744958481613286,0.099644128113879,0.02491103202846975,0.01542111506524318,0.042704626334519574,0.028469750889679714,True,292.0,0.8623962040332147,5.118623962040332,843.0,0.0,0.09424083769633508,0.046732596470816366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015512895094046927,0.021718053131665697,0.020942408376963352,0.004744958481613286,28.512367346938817,16.586204081632655,17.98224031442509,20.95727891156463,20.229142857142854,16.849197278911564,70.76054421768707,12.16,19.76314531301547,382846741.000208,454147.9727167355,5.723809523809524,6.0,3.016718344353844,29.4,27.0,13.431306712304652,1.7551020408163265,1.0,0.9910609771028073,735,284,0.38639455782312926,4315,25,31
"The oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor ( Olig ) family of proteins , comprised of Olig1 , Olig2 , and Olig3 , are basic helix – loop – helix ( bHLH ) transcription factors that are essential regulators of neural cell fate and specification [ REF ] . The Olig genes and the proteins they encode are responsible for the development of oligodendrocytes and neural cells . Initial studies revealed that the Olig genes , primarily Olig1 and Olig2 , are expressed by oligodendrocyte precursor cells ( OPCs ) where Olig1 regulates oligodendrocyte formation and maturation in the brain and Olig2 modulates oligodendrogenesis in the spinal cord [ REF ] . It was later discovered that the Olig proteins are also involved in neurogenesis . Specifically , Olig2 is distinctly expressed in the progenitors of motor neurons ( pMN ) domain of the developing spinal cord where motor neurons are generated [ REF ] . Furthermore , Olig1/2 were also found to generate inhibitory interneurons in the brain [ REF ] . Recently , GABAergic neurons were shown to be derived in Olig3 lineage cells [ REF ] . The role of the Olig family in astrocyte specification is not well established . It was shown that Olig1/2 may promote astrocyte differentiation where astrocytes are sequentially transformed after generation of interneurons [ REF ] . However , other studies determined that Olig - expressing precursors to be negative regulators of astrocytes confirming the cellular fate to be neurons and oligodendrocytes [ REF ] . The Olig genes are also expressed in cancer and are detailed below . Gliomas are primary brain tumors derived from neuroglial stem cells or progenitor cells as well as lineage restricted precursors [ REF ] . Roughly 30 % of all primary brain tumors are gliomas and 80 % are considered malignant [ REF ] . Traditionally , gliomas are classified based on their histopathological and clinical features established by the World Health Organization [ REF ] . Over the years , technological advancement has vastly improved classification of gliomas centered on molecular and genomic changes [ REF ] . Currently , gliomas are divided into six families : ( 1 ) adult - type diffuse gliomas ; ( 2 ) pediatric - type diffuse low - grade gliomas ; ( 3 ) pediatric - type high - grade gliomas ; ( 4 ) circumscribed astrocytic gliomas ; ( 5 ) glioneuronal and neuronal tumors ; and ( 6 ) ependymomas [ REF ] . Adult - type diffuse gliomas are further separated into three different groups : ( 1 ) isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) mutant with 1p/19q co - deletion with primarily oligodendroglial morphology ; ( 2 ) IDH mutant with 1p/19q non - codeletion with mainly astrocytic histology ; and ( 3 ) IDH wildtype [ REF ] . Gliomas are also further categorized based on WHO grades I – IV . Grade I gliomas consists of pilocytic astrocytic astrocytomas and are primarily observed in the cerebellum or brain stem of children . Grade II gliomas are comprised of adult low - grade gliomas and are generally astrocytomas , oligodendrogliomas , mixed oligoastrocytomas , and diffuse astrocytomas . Grade III gliomas are malignant gliomas composed of anaplastic cells . Grade IV gliomas are glioblastoma ( GBM ) which consists of primary and secondary GBM [ REF].Success in prognosis and therapeutics of gliomas is dependent on accurate diagnosis . While there exist a multitude of histological markers to differentiate between the types of gliomas , challenges remain due to gliomas displaying similar morphological characteristics [ REF ] . Specifically , reliable markers to accurately distinguish between glioma types are lacking due to ambiguous histological features . Differentiating gliomas based on their cellular morphology can also be confusing and biased , resulting in classifications such as oligoastrocytoma or mixed glioma [ REF ] . Observer variability can also lead to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of the correct disease [ REF].CNS tumors are heterogenous and their grading based on histological features is notoriously subjective [ REF ] . With advances in diagnostic technologies , the most recent WHO 2021 classification of tumors of the CNS have adopted key molecular markers and revised grading of astrocytic tumors , oligodendroglial tumors , oligoastrocytomas , glioneuronal tumors , and neuronal tumors [ REF ] . The summary of Olig expression in gliomas presented in this review is based on",2.741459687357355,0.7735677013560542,0.4873255687252571,0.0752216162200289,0.7564068236227693,0.7137486580759287,0.08943089430894309,0.03523035230352303,0.11517615176151762,0.24119241192411925,0.1856368563685637,0.037940379403794036,0.05555555555555555,0.07723577235772358,0.04336043360433604,0.016260162601626018,0.06368563685636856,0.009485094850948509,True,208.0,0.7926829268292683,4.97289972899729,738.0,0.0,0.02541411390968913,0.010891763104152484,0.010891763104152484,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019287497163603357,0.0270024960290447,0.03471749489448604,0.044715447154471545,35.291776381909585,13.280547738693468,15.247664890283005,17.005226130653266,16.361859296482415,17.470552763819096,59.43098827470687,7.866666666666666,17.138320437469694,27738182.108092476,37585.61261259143,5.911222780569514,5.0,3.5378534046103254,19.9,18.5,8.806626293119667,1.7889447236180904,1.0,1.1263607331277694,597,278,0.4656616415410385,3670,30,32
"Calcaneal apophysitis ( CA ) or Sever ’s disease is the most common cause of heel pain in children and young people , showing an incidence of 3.7 per 1000 patients [ REF ] . It is a common musculoskeletal disease , representing between 2 % and 16 % of the consultations in sports clinics 3 4 and 5.8%–22.7 % of repetitive stress injuries in children [ REF ] . The condition is most common in girls between 7 and 12 years of age and in boys between 8 and 15 years of age [ REF ] , showing a peak in both genders between 10 and 12 years of age [ REF].CA was described by Dr Sever in 1912 , due to sporadic continuous pain in the posterior area of the calcaneus bone in paediatric patients [ REF ] . Histological studies define CA as inflammation or bone oedema due to a stress fracture in the secondary growth centre of the calcaneus , which is not related to necrosis [ REF ] . The inflammation is due to the traction forces from the triceps surae muscle on the CA , which is composed of hyaline cartilage [ REF ] . The repetition of these traction forces , combined with the vertical ground reaction force on the calcaneus , generates bending forces on the medial side of the CA . Because the number of chondrocytes is increased in the CA during the development of children , the CA is not able to tolerate these bending forces [ REF ] . The gender incidence of this condition is controversial . A previous study by Orava and Virtanen13 concluded that the CA incidence ratio was 10:1 , being more common in boys than girls . However , Micheli and Ireland [ REF ] , McKenzie et al5 and Kvist and Heinonem9 concluded that the ratio was 3:1 , 2:1 and 1:1 in their respective studies . CA is a unilateral condition in most cases [ REF ] , which may be related to the dominant leg . However , it has also been described as a bilateral condition in some cases [ REF ] . The diagnosis of CA is mainly based on its signs and symptoms , but it can also be confirmed with complementary tests , such as X - ray imaging . The pain is mainly located in the posterior and plantar side of the CA9 16 17 or in the Achilles tendon insertion [ REF ] . Various treatments have been described in the literature and the most frequently used include : stretching and lengthening of the triceps surae muscle , application of ice , restriction or limitation of physical activity , rest , topical non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , taping , and the use of foot orthoses and heel pads [ REF ] . Among the causes of CA , a rapid period of maturation due to accelerated growth that causes muscle – tendon imbalances has been described . Muscle development is slower than bone development , which causes muscular tension [ REF ] .

"The global incidence of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) has been rapidly increasing over the past decade , with more than one million curable STIs being acquired daily . Young women in sub - Saharan Africa have a high prevalence and incidence of both curable STIs and HIV . The use of doxycycline as a prophylaxis to prevent STIs is promising ; however , clinical trials , to date , have only been conducted among men who have sex with men ( MSM ) in high - income settings . We describe the characteristics of participants enrolled in the first trial to determine the efficacy of doxycycline post - exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) to reduce STI incidence among women taking daily , oral HIV pre - exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP).Global trends reveal a rapid increase in the incidence of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) over the past decade , with more than one million curable STIs acquired daily [ REF ] . In 2020 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimated 374 million new infections of four curable STIs , Chlamydia trachomatis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Treponema pallidum , and Trichomonas vaginalis [ REF ] . Young women in sub - Saharan Africa face a high prevalence of curable STIs and HIV [ REF ] and limited data from HIV PrEP trials suggests high incidence rates [ REF ] . STIs can severely affect mortality and morbidity for cisgender women by causing conditions such as tubal infertility , chronic pelvic pain , pelvic inflammatory disease , ectopic pregnancy , post - partum endometriosis , adverse neonatal outcomes , and an increase in susceptibility to HIV [ REF ] . Women are more biologically predisposed to complications from STIs than men [ REF ] . Several studies conducted in sub - Saharan Africa reveal higher STI prevalence among younger women compared to their age - matched male peers and older women [ REF ] . In the region , the cultural , economic , and social marginalization of women contributes to the risk of HIV and STIs [ REF ] , in part by rendering the negotiation of preventive measures such as condom use , abstinence , and partner notification ineffective [ REF].Taking antibiotics following sexual exposure to prevent bacterial STIs places preventive care in the hands of the user . Interventions that are individually controlled are greatly needed , especially for women , and the use of doxycycline as a post - exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) has been proposed as a novel STI prevention strategy [ REF ] . Doxycycline is already standardly used as prophylaxis to prevent infections such as malaria , lyme , and leptospirosis [ REF ] . A recent open - label clinical trial of doxycycline PEP among men who have sex with men ( MSM ) who were using HIV pre - exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) in France found a 47 % relative reduction in bacterial STIs overall and a greater reduction specifically for C. trachomatis ( 70 % ) and T. pallidum ( 73 % ) [ REF ] . Doxycycline PEP was well - tolerated in that study [ REF ] . Several clinical trials of doxycycline as PEP or PrEP among MSM are ongoing worldwide to test this initial finding . Studies among young African women have evaluated the association between HIV incidence and perception of HIV risk with disparate results [ REF ] . STI risk perception and the prevalence of STIs among women receiving HIV prevention care , which is limited to syndromic management of STIs and daily oral PrEP , have not yet been described . Although women disproportionately bear the burden of adverse sequelae of curable STIs , trials on doxycycline PEP in this population have not yet been completed . The doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis ( dPEP ) Trial is an open - label , randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of doxycycline PEP for STI prevention ( C. trachomatis , N. gonorrhoeae , and T. pallidum ) in Kisumu , Kenya , and is the first study to assess the efficacy of doxycycline PEP in cisgender women . In this paper , we describe the baseline characteristics of the dPEP Trial population .",2.933247051773369,0.7896732796626204,0.46678322022204277,0.061492714184471,0.7310971986841072,0.6903194384205908,0.1150070126227209,0.056100981767180924,0.1150070126227209,0.23281907433380084,0.17110799438990182,0.030855539971949508,0.033660589060308554,0.0729312762973352,0.03225806451612903,0.011220196353436185,0.09957924263674614,0.012622720897615708,False,212.0,0.8176718092566619,4.618513323983169,713.0,0.0,0.18701622971285892,0.12908863920099875,0.11310861423220973,0.09563046192259675,0.050436953807740326,0.050436953807740326,0.016229712858926344,0.02272159800249688,0.024719101123595506,0.0070126227208976155,39.02303904170367,14.16750961254067,16.01378924563265,18.185270629991127,16.72893522626442,14.722176870748296,58.55841467021591,8.434782608695652,17.531207686554392,41087220.178633824,57625.83475264211,5.387755102040816,4.0,3.089259382418661,25.565217391304348,25.0,14.005669929358337,1.6768707482993197,1.0,0.9833697463944728,588,249,0.42346938775510207,3293,23,34
"Neonatal encephalopathy ( NE ) remains one of the leading causes for child mortality and is a major contributor to long term morbidities , including epilepsy , cerebral palsy and neurocognitive delays [ REF ] . In industrialized countries the incidence of NE is 0.5–1.5 per 1000 live births3 ; here therapeutic hypothermia ( HT ) is standard treatment , reducing mortality and long - term morbidities by 20–25 % , with a number needed to treat of seven [ REF ] . However , the burden of NE secondary to intrapartum events is disproportionately higher amongst low- and middle - income countries ( LMIC ) . In particular , sub - Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia account for more than 85 % of all NE cases worldwide with regional estimates as high as 14.9 per 1000 live births [ REF ] . Potential therapies are limited in LMIC as the feasibility , safety and efficacy of HT in all LMIC remains uncertain [ REF ] . These differences in response to HT may originate from the timing of the HI insult ( longer intrapartum insults with early presentation of seizures within 2 h of birth ) , comorbidities such as poor nutrition and the co - existence of infection / inflammation as seen in studies in sub - Sahara Africa [ REF ] . Therefore , identifying alternative neuroprotective treatments to HT is of major global interest , as it will have a large impact on the global burden caused by NE.The pathophysiology following neonatal hypoxic - ischemic brain injury is complex and evolves through several different phases . A reduction in placental blood flow and fetal oxygen supply occurs in the first phase [ REF ] ; such vasculature chances lead to a loss of cerebral autoregulation with a reduction of systemic fetal blood pressure [ REF ] . The decrease of oxygen and depletion of energy causes increased excitotoxicity , an increase of intracellular calcium , oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction [ REF ] , leading to primary energy failure and some apoptotic and necrotic cell death . After reperfusion at resuscitation , the initial hypoxia - induced cytotoxic oedema and accumulation of excitatory amino acids partially resolves , with apparent recovery of cerebral oxidative metabolism . It is thought that the neurotoxic cascade is largely inhibited during the latent phase . Around 6–24 h after HI , a secondary phase occurs despite adequate oxygenation and perfusion . This secondary phase is associated with failure of cerebral oxidative metabolism ( secondary energy failure ) , further glutamate driven excitotoxicity , inflammation , free radical and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and mitochondrial dysfunction [ REF ] . The third phase , lasting days to weeks or months , is characterized by chronic inflammation , which may lead to epigenetic changes and impairs neurogenesis , synaptogenesis and axonal growth [ REF].Many of the putative therapies for NE target specific pathological injury processes , including excitotoxicity ,",3.2000304668569166,0.4788527852430147,0.47212512664640327,0.06406991183375488,0.8580894928712112,0.84914430975914,0.128,0.056,0.156,0.258,0.154,0.04,0.028,0.064,0.02,0.006,0.06,0.002,True,147.0,0.822,4.934,500.0,0.0,0.031355360755225894,0.024949426837491573,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015171948752528659,0.02124072825354012,0.02124072825354012,0.008,27.44843078758953,16.86591374019775,17.77360955136429,20.754244800545518,20.35543129901125,16.69470167064439,67.16007500852369,11.142857142857142,12.272386469516972,213712.40098822003,427.42480197644005,5.694510739856802,5.0,3.3028870623716506,29.928571428571427,30.5,10.187276978903537,1.7613365155131264,1.0,1.0615133650724689,419,248,0.5918854415274463,2467,14,35
"Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy ( CRT ) is a cornerstone in the electrical treatment of heart failure [ REF ] . Conventional CRT involves biventricular ( BiV ) pacing from transvenous leads in the right ventricle ( RV ) and a coronary sinus branch to provide epicardial left ventricular ( LV ) stimulation . The widespread uptake of CRT has been driven by evidence showing significant benefits in both hospitalisations and mortality for patients with symptomatic dyssynchronous heart failure , that is , those with a LV ejection fraction ( EF ) of below 35 % , and a QRS duration ( QRSd ) of greater than 130 milliseconds ( ms ) on a 12 lead electrocardiograph ( ECG ) [ REF ] . In recent years , the indications for CRT have expanded , with studies showing benefits in patients with moderate LV dysfunction who have a high burden of RV pacing [ REF ] and in those requiring an atrioventricular node ablation ( AVNA ) [ REF].Despite its success , there is a significant proportion of patients who either do not derive clinical benefit from conventional CRT [ REF ] , or who can not be treated due to failure of LV lead implantation or inadequate LV lead performance due to issues such as high thresholds and phrenic nerve stimulation [ REF ] . Conduction system pacing ( CSP ) , that is , stimulation of His - Purkinje tissue using a transvenous lead - based system [ REF ] , is becoming increasingly popular , not only as a “ bail - out ” treatment in this population , but also potentially as a first - line option in selected patients [ REF ] . Initial studies on CSP focused on His - Bundle pacing ( HBP ) , built on the attractive concept of restoring completely physiological ventricular activation . HBP achieves excellent cardiac resynchronisation , but implantation can be difficult , with success rates varying from 56%–95 % [ REF ] . Challenges such as ventricular under - sensing , rising thresholds and requirement for lead revisions have also been observed during long - term follow up [ REF ] . Left Bundle Branch Pacing ( LBBP ) is a relatively novel form of CSP which involves screwing a pacing lead deep into the interventricular septum from the RV in order to capture the left bundle system [ REF ] . This technique has shown encouraging results from observational studies , with reported success rates of 80%–94 % and significant improvements in LV function [ REF ] . Robust data from randomized trials , however , is currently lacking , and despite widespread uptake and investigation of CSP , important questions on its use remain . An area of significant clinical importance is the role of CSP both in the presence of , and in the treatment of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . AF is the most prevalent arrhythmia worldwide [ REF ] , and is very common in the heart failure population , affecting up to a third of patients receiving CRT [ REF ] . Several studies have reported an attenuation of clinical benefit achieved with CRT in the presence of AF [ REF ] . There are likely several mechanisms behind this , including the reduction in cardiac output associated with",2.9635558265746758,0.7820510509651057,0.47647827547964106,0.06158345825743948,0.7403592811897397,0.7426875233650208,0.13416815742397137,0.059033989266547404,0.1037567084078712,0.2146690518783542,0.18425760286225404,0.03041144901610018,0.03398926654740608,0.07155635062611806,0.03041144901610018,0.025044722719141325,0.09302325581395349,0.008944543828264758,True,184.0,0.8014311270125224,4.52772808586762,559.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022661055357720946,0.031725477500809326,0.029135642602784072,0.017889087656529516,39.16174522789251,14.416922477600313,15.903189008614273,18.164342293208673,17.10710557070511,14.566004415011033,59.75964160498637,8.823529411764707,13.603300856467449,808795.0742442952,1446.8605979325496,5.3532008830022075,4.0,3.313457694860214,26.647058823529413,23.0,13.292816177835164,1.6622516556291391,1.0,0.9802965079570117,453,230,0.5077262693156733,2531,17,36
"Cannabis was legalized for recreational use in Canada on 17 October 2018 . The reactions to this legislative action appear to be primarily split between two quite divergent viewpoints : positive from the groups who campaigned for cannabis legalization and disappointment from groups involved in treating individuals who experience the negative outcomes of cannabis use . Use of cannabis has quietly increased since legalization in Canada but the enormous business potential expected by the proponents of legalization have also failed to materialize [ REF ] . Cannabis use overall in Canada has increased each year since legalization from an estimated 15 % of all adults over age 15 in 2017 ( pre - legalization ) to 25.2 % of all adults over 15 in 2021 [ REF ] . This increase is similar to what has been seen in other countries that have legalized ( as opposed to decriminalized ) cannabis use [ REF ] . The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and opioid crisis have stalled what efforts were being made to attempt to inform the general public of the potential harms that cannabis use can pose for some individuals . While it is generally agreed that cannabis adverse events are not common , with increasing tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) concentration coupled with increased frequency of use , this may become a more common issue . For example , the rate of cannabis use disorder , the DSM-5 diagnosis for cannabis dependence or abuse , has increased from an estimated 10 % of cannabis users to 22 % [ REF ] . The need to communicate the risks of cannabis use is ever increasing as there are now 38 states in the United States that have legalized medical cannabis use with 19 legalizing recreational use [ REF ] . South Africa , the Seychelles and Ghana have decriminalized cannabis for personal use [ REF ] . Other countries such as Canada and Uruguay have fully legalized cannabis use for both recreational and medical use [ REF ] . One comprehensive study examined the use of cannabis pre - post legalization in 587 4 year colleges in the United States ( US ) from 2008 to 2018 comparing cannabis use in college students in states with legalized recreational cannabis to those in states with restricted cannabis approaches and found that past 30 day use increased more in colleges where recreational cannabis was legal ( OR = 1.23 ; 95 % CI 1.19–1.28 ) [ REF ] . Here we aggregate the common and uncommon psychiatric adverse events that can be experienced with cannabis use with the hope that this will serve as a resource for Emergency Department ( ED ) personnel in discussing cannabis use in relation to ED visits for those who have experienced an adverse event related to mental health . Since publishing our previous paper [ REF ] , further studies have examined adverse events related to cannabis use that can be experienced and result in an Emergency Department visit primarily based on administrative data . Papers examining cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome ( CHS ) are probably the most common and the most frequently picked up by the media as this is clearly a dramatic adverse event and the related paradoxical effect of increased nausea that can be associated with use of cannabis during pregnancy . An article on the topic in relation to ED impacts was",2.9834405899514707,1.2742058861352854,0.4876312575699854,0.0431010055183861,0.7304922235198319,0.7387088020642598,0.1335676625659051,0.06678383128295255,0.08260105448154657,0.23374340949033393,0.0984182776801406,0.02460456942003515,0.05975395430579965,0.10193321616871705,0.03163444639718805,0.0351493848857645,0.05975395430579965,0.012302284710017574,True,219.0,0.8523725834797891,4.736379613356767,569.0,0.0,0.03340484216978241,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04045357033404842,0.01930738584125038,0.022065583818571866,0.0017574692442882249,42.367301790281346,14.744322250639389,15.128267250517109,17.83473610788189,17.95179958149268,13.790830039525694,60.990002325040685,9.294117647058824,12.706865475785461,330005.7890238998,579.9750246465726,5.201581027667984,4.0,3.0037653363742796,29.764705882352942,30.0,16.00929660711773,1.5869565217391304,1.0,0.9603543411471798,506,237,0.4683794466403162,2695,17,37
"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses in humans and animals , including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS - CoV ) , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS - CoV ) , and coronavirus disease 2019 ( SARS - CoV-2 or COVID-19 ) . Last two decades , several outbreaks of coronaviruses are observed . The SARS outbreak was reported in 2003 with about 8000 cases and more than 700 deaths with an estimated case fatality rate ( CFR ) of 10 % [ REF ] . According to WHO ( Jan 2020 ) , MERS has infected about 2500 cases with more than 800 deaths ( CFR ≈ 34.3 % ) in different countries since 2012 [ REF ] . The report of WHO showed the novel coronavirus pneumonia , COVID-19 , has infected about 177,108,695 confirmed cases with 3,840,223 deaths until 18 June 2021 [ REF ] , and any protective or treatment factor is demanding for health managers . Currently , there are contradictory reports about the effect of smoking on COVID-19 infections . If smokers are protective of COVID-19 , new studies could be designed to explore the mechanism of protection . Nevertheless , if smokers are at higher risk , it will be a wake - up call for health providers to adopt separate policies to protect smokers . Currently , we know that smoking is one of the main risk factors for about 20 types and subtypes of cancers , cardiovascular diseases , Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , and diabetes . Among the various body parts , the most involvement is directly connected with the respiratory system , digestive system , and nervous system [ REF ] . According to the 2025 estimation of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , there will be about 1.1 billion smokers worldwide [ REF ] . International statistics show that there are about 8 million deaths each year , mostly ( 80 % ) in low- and middle - income countries , equivalent to a total economic cost of US$ 1.4 trillion each year [ REF].Currently , it is clear that current and former smokers had a higher percentage among COVID-19 patients in ICU ( ~ 2.4 times ) and mechanical ventilation support , and they had higher mortality rates and more severe cases ( ~ 1.4 times ) [ REF ] . Even after treatment , exacerbations of COVID-19 are associated with tobacco smoking in the smokers ’ group [ REF ] . Hospitalized smokers have more severe infections and complications , especially pulmonary fibrosis , as the central pathology of SARS , MERS , and COVID-19 [ REF ] . Like MERS , a higher CFR in hospitalized patients with smoking history is also reported for COVID-19 [ REF].Moreover , tobacco smoking is involved in more severe complications of COVID-19 infections [ REF ] . It has been shown that cigarette smoke upregulates ACE2 in a dose - dependent manner in lung epithelium , including the goblet , club , Clara cells , and alveolar type 2 ( AT2 ) cells of human and rodent lungs , and quitting smoking decreases ACE2 expression ( reversible ) [ REF ] . So , smoking history is a predictor of ACE2 expression in the lung cells . The expression of Cathepsin B , which is a protease that activates the spike protein of the virus , is also increased in mice and human cells exposed to cigarette smoke [ REF ] . So , it seems that the patients ’ positive smoking history ( current and former smokers ) can make them more susceptible to COVID-19 . Also , results regarding the effect of smoking on the expression of ACE2 are opposite ; besides up - regulation ( preprint ) [ REF ] , down - regulation [ REF ] is reported [ REF].On the other hand , based on the current epidemiological studies on COVID-19 , China [ REF ] , Italia [ REF ] , Europe , and the United States [ REF ] have reported lower incidence of infected smokers . Tajlil et al . had performed a meta - analysis on 12 reports of COVID-19 epidemiologic data ( 11,382 cases , including 3,827 cases in 10 Chinese reports and 7,555 cases in two USA reports ) . They had concluded the significantly lower proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with smoking history [ REF ] .

However , there remain several controversies about the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic TAPB compared to ultrasound - guided TAPB . Therefore , the aim of this study is to integrate both direct and indirect comparisons to identify a more effective and safer TAPB approach . Recently , minimally invasive surgery ( MIS ) has been recommended to treat colorectal diseases , such as colorectal cancer , inflammatory bowel disease , and diverticular disease , because of its equivalent efficacy and improved functional recovery [ REF ] . Compared to traditional protocols , enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS ) pathways could significantly shorten the length of hospital stay ( LOS ) and reduce the healthcare costs without compromising surgical outcomes [ REF ] . Acute postoperative pain , however , remains the most common concern of ERAS . Meanwhile , regular administration of opioids is associated with postoperative ileus ( POI ) , postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) , delayed mobilization , acute urinary retention , and early - term somnolence and delirium [ REF ] . Despite the increasing popularity of the conception of opioid - sparing multimodal analgesia , consensus on optimal pain management after MIS is lacking . Transversus abdominis plane block ( TAPB ) as a type of local anesthesia involves the injection of a local anesthetic between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles to infiltrate the segmental nerves at the level of T8 - L1 [ REF ] . TAPB is now commonly employed during laparoscopic colorectal surgery and has proven to be effective in reducing postoperative opioid consumption [ REF ] . In the ERAS Society Guidelines for Perioperative Care in Elective Colorectal Surgery 2018 , the use of TAPB is strongly recommended instead of epidural analgesia in colorectal MIS [ REF ] . Both laparoscopic ( Lap- ) and ultrasound - guided ( US- ) TAPB have allowed to reduce the risk of peritoneal penetration and facilitate the accurate identification of the tissue plane [ REF].Currently , training in the use of ultrasonography among anesthesiologists is commonplace in tertiary referral centers [ REF ] . Characterized by ability to perform dynamic maneuvers and assess long segments of nerves , lack of radiation and contraindications , and portability , ultrasonography is recognized as one of the optimal imaging modalities for peripheral nerves [ REF ] , which contributes to its widespread application in perioperative nerve blocks . Conversely , due to additional human , time , and economic costs , techniques of ultrasound - guided nerve blocks might not be available in the primary hospitals . Furthermore , despite the guidance of ultrasound , procedure - related inadvertent visceral injury still should not be ignored [ REF ] . Lap - TAPB can seemly be a potential alternative to reduce the waste of healthcare resource . Though visualization of laparoscopy minimizes intraperitoneal injection and visceral injury originated from peritoneal penetration , the precise positioning of the nerves and planes can be compromised by Lap - TAPB compared to US - TAPB [ REF].The existing systematic reviews generally aimed to",3.1910740371678745,0.8875075237541682,0.43008899740582585,0.03775397491771226,0.8460892544073217,0.8431920781731606,0.10554561717352415,0.05008944543828265,0.12164579606440072,0.23971377459749552,0.17173524150268335,0.03935599284436494,0.03935599284436494,0.08407871198568873,0.03756708407871199,0.008944543828264758,0.06976744186046512,0.017889087656529516,True,163.0,0.8264758497316637,5.202146690518783,559.0,0.0,0.04096941719561454,0.04096941719561454,0.024235429890363532,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012983266012694748,0.01817657241777265,0.0207732256203116,0.028622540250447227,25.77921226301899,16.053761699064076,17.879347455551382,20.65605951523878,20.03698584113271,18.761036717062634,69.56671466282697,11.277777777777779,15.144028742076745,3775444.726522541,6753.926165514385,6.073434125269978,6.0,3.4035628771361757,25.72222222222222,25.5,9.987801201440995,1.8315334773218142,1.0,1.0986538112815227,463,258,0.5572354211663066,2908,18,39
"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) cell wall is probably the most complex membrane of all bacteria . The architecture of this complex wall extends to a massive core comprised of peptidoglycans covalently attached via a linker unit to a linear galactofuran and to several strands of a highly branched arabinofuran , and mycolic acids . Mycolic acids are oriented perpendicular to the membrane plane and provide a lipid barrier , which is the main feature of this bacteria [ REF ] . Several immune - evasion mechanisms conferred to Mtb , such as higher hydrophobicity , depend on its cell wall by masking pathogen - associated molecular patterns with phthiocerol dimycocerosates and inhibiting toll - like receptor 2 with sulfoglycolipids [ REF ] . These strategies inhibit the detection of bacteria and the activation of cytokine responses . They also recruit naive rather than microbicidal macrophages to sites of infection , preventing detection by targeting antigen presentation pathways of the adaptive immune system [ REF ] . M. tuberculosis uses several components of the cell wall to alter the processing and availability of peptide antigens for MHC class I and MHC class II . Furthermore , these cell wall - derived molecules can inhibit innate immunity processes such as autophagy [ REF].During primary infection , the first cells to encounter Mtb are lung epithelial cells ( EpCs ) and alveolar macrophages which are capable of sensing and mounting an immune response versus Mtb , mainly through a wide variety of antimicrobial peptides . Most of these peptides display conserved properties including amphipathicity , cationicity and a small molecular size ( 12 - 50 amino acid residues ) [ REF ] . Whether or not these short cationic peptides can disrupt this thick and impermeable wall will be discussed herein . Although tuberculosis [ TB ] is a preventable and treatable disease , it remains an important threat to public health . Transcriptomic analysis has shown that MDR - Mtb is capable to modify acetylation / methylation patterns in macrophages and lymphocytes infected , leading to oxidative stress and premature cellular aging , which correlates with higher intracellular survival and dissemination . Besides , some mycobacterial products play epigenetic changes promoting DNA methylation or altering the expression of non - coding RNAs to upregulate the immune response activation [ REF].Despite the growing effort of the global health community to eradicate tuberculosis , in 2021 a total of 1.5 million people died from TB . In fact , Mtb was the second leading infectious killer after COVID-19 . Due to vaccination and management of the pandemic , TB is profiling to return as the leading cause of mortality . This time , however , it will be even stronger as all healthcare resources were directed to the containment of SARS - Cov2 during the COVID-19 pandemic and important TB control programs , including vaccination , multidrug - resistant surveillance , and direct observed therapy , were ignored ( DOT ) [ REF ] . Nowadays , drug - resistant tuberculosis is a major public health challenge , and it poses a significant threat to global efforts to control TB . The treatment of drug - resistant TB is complex , lengthy , and expensive , and it often requires the use of toxic and poorly tolerated drugs",2.9147996863451247,0.8476414775158727,0.4523862596551245,0.06700400062896633,0.6866540151991343,0.6785562377836969,0.09712230215827339,0.08273381294964029,0.12949640287769784,0.25719424460431656,0.13489208633093525,0.04316546762589928,0.03597122302158273,0.09712230215827339,0.02877697841726619,0.017985611510791366,0.039568345323741004,0.014388489208633094,True,180.0,0.8507194244604317,5.001798561151079,556.0,0.0,0.006594724220623501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00749400479616307,0.010491606714628298,0.013489208633093525,0.025179856115107913,37.80076778242679,13.924305439330542,15.774802946060372,17.760836820083682,17.154163179916317,16.211799163179908,63.43974895397489,9.45,15.015863934009733,3321290.3798487713,5973.543848648869,5.654811715481172,5.0,3.2089192946945158,23.9,22.5,13.186735759845952,1.711297071129707,1.0,0.9938713830142637,478,281,0.5878661087866108,2781,20,40
"Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) is a systemic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia with high mortality and morbidity [ REF ] . The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 10.5 % of people aged 20 to 79 years old are currently suffering with DM and the incidence will rise to 11.3 % by 2030 and to 12.2 % by 2045 [ REF ] . Long - term hyperglycemia brings a higher risk of neurovascular injury , which leads to a series of complications such as cardiovascular disease , diabetic neuropathy , diabetic kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy , in association with negative impacts on patients ’ quality of life and heavy economic burdens [ REF ] . DM can be mainly classified into type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) based on the pathogenesis [ REF ] . Additionally , DM can be the secondary disease caused by Coxsackie - viral infection [ REF ] , cystic fibrosis [ REF ] and pancreatic cancer [ REF ] . Although the etiologies of different types of DM are distinct , it is generally accepted that the progression of DM is highly associated with abnormal communications between cells , tissues and organs [ REF ] . Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) are a group of heterogenous , multi - functional lipid bilayer membrane vesicles secreted by a wide spectrum of cells into extracellular space [ REF ] . The characteristics of EVs are highly heterogenous and influenced by the parental cell types [ REF ] . EVs contain various biologically active molecules such as nucleic acids , proteins and lipids , where the bioactivity of their contents could be preserved by the membrane structure , making EVs as suitable carriers transmitting signals among cells [ REF ] . Over the last decade , EVs have garnered great interest for their critical roles in mediating intercellular and interorgan communications , which have been demonstrated to be involved in various physiological and pathological processes [ REF ] . Beside their intrinsic bioactive properties , EVs have also been confirmed with other advantages , such as abundant sources , low immunogenicity , biocompatibility , flexibility to modify , and ability to cross biological barriers [ REF ] , making EVs - based therapies as attractive strategies in the treatment of various diseases [ REF].The pancreatic islet discovered by Paul Langerhans in 1869 consist of its own vasculature and five types of hormone - producing cells known as α - cells , β - cells , δ - cells , pp - cells and rare ϵ-cells [ REF ] . The hormones produced by different endocrine cells play a crucial role in controlling blood glucose level , making pancreatic islet an important mini - organ to maintain glucose homeostasis [ REF ] . Among different cell types , insulin - secreting β - cells occupy a decisive position given that loss and failure of β - cells are highly associated with the emergence and deterioration of DM [ REF ] . Present researches indicate that EVs - mediated crosstalk between pancreatic islets and extra - islet tissues plays key roles in maintaining glucose homeostasis under physiological conditions , whereas such crosstalk is strongly involved in the occurrence and development of DM under pathological conditions [ REF ] . Under physiological conditions , pancreatic β - cells can lower blood glucose by secreting insulin to increase glucose uptake of peripheral tissues , while peripheral tissues may promote insulin secretion and growth of β - cells via EVs - mediated crosstalk [ REF ] . On the other hand , EVs containing autoantigens derived from pancreatic islets may target autoimmune cells , causing severe autoimmune response in T1DM .

"Cellular metabolism , cell cycle regulation , cellular endurance , and differentiation are the essential functions conducted by kinases [ REF ] . Nowadays , considerable attention has been given to research on kinases . The signaling pathways mediated by protein kinases have been related to a variety of diseases , such as diabetes , inflammation , and cancer [ REF ] . The kinases are categorized into a wide group lipid kinases , carbohydrates , and protein kinases . According to human genome sequencing , approximately 2 % of the human genome codes for protein kinases , which are further classified as families and subfamilies . The major kinases found in mammalian signaling pathways are lipid kinases , tyrosine kinases , serine / threonine kinases , and dual kinases ( Ser / Thr and Ty ) . Protein kinases are enzymes that use the end γ - phosphate group from ATP to phosphorylate serine , tyrosine , or threonine residues in other proteins . Phosphorylation changes target protein activity by controlling signaling pathways by amplification , cellular location , or interaction with other controlling proteins [ REF ] . The study on human kinases revealed that there are 518 protein kinases grouped into families reliant on their biological functions as well as statistical sequence evaluation [ REF].Kinase inhibitors are small molecules that inhibit kinases and are of much use in therapeutic and diagnostic fields . According to recent research , Kinase inhibitors serve as a potential target for treating various diseases like autoimmune disorders , cardiovascular diseases , cancer , and inflammatory disorders [ REF ] . As of November 24 , 2022 , the US FDA had approved 72 small molecules that are therapeutic protein kinase inhibitors . All drugs that have been approved by the FDA work best when taken orally , with the exception of temsirolimus , trilaciclib , and netarsudil [ REF ] ( https://brimr.org/protein-kinase-inhibitors/ ) . Novel biologic agents , such as monoclonal antibodies , can also be employed for targeting specific kinases . However , target non - specificity and toxicity are the principal disadvantages associated with kinase inhibitors . Small molecules from natural sources may act together with proteins and function as signaling molecules , which can be further employed for human health . The kinase inhibitors from various plant products help treat several disorders ( Table 1).In an in vivo study performed on cancer cell line 85As2 ( Gastric cancer cell line ) , the steroidal alkaloid tomatidine as well as tomatidine rich tomato leaf extract exhibited reduction in proliferation of 85As2 cells as a result of dysregulation of type 1 interferon - stimulated genes [ REF ] . As a result , several marine natural chemicals have been exercised as lead drug composites that progress in future medicines . Around 22 kinase inhibitors are synthesized from marine bacteria , for instance , Bacillus and Streptomyces species ; 16 from marine fungi sources like Penicillium , Aspergillus , etc . ; two new kinase inhibitors from deep - sea soft corals like Cladiella australis , Cladiella pachyclados ; 14 kinase inhibitors from marine animals like sea cucumber , marine echinoderm , etc . ; 10 from marine algae - like cyanobacteria ; 42 from marine sponges [ REF].Kinase inhibitors are a rapidly growing and important category of target therapeutics . To target kinases signaling , drug discovery and development initiatives have looked at a range of approaches . The role of kinases in drug designing and as delivery systems has been described as follows : Many protein kinases are part of “ cascade systems , ” where multiple protein kinases sequentially activate each other . A kinase cascade plays a vital role in amplification , diversification of signal effects , and permission for grouping signaling pathways to form networks . Because kinase cascades exist , it is possible to find and produce drugs that are not kinase inhibitors but prevent kinases from being triggered due to the subsequent “ upstream ” kinase in the cascade through attachment to them . PD98059 is certainly the first kinase inhibitor developed for the Ras - Raf MEK - ERK cascade , which acts through binding to MEK1 and then blocking its stimulation via Raf [ REF ] . The dual - specificity protein kinases ( MEK1/2 ) that block the RAS - Raf - MEK MAP kinase pathway are trametinib , binimetinib , cobimetinib , and selumetinib . Among these , binimetinib and cobimetinib are used in combination with encorafenib and vemurafenib , respectively for curing melanoma . Selumetinib is employed for Von Recklinghausen disease [ REF ] . Raf , Src , epidermal growth factor , and breakpoint cluster area are all kinase targets . Early on in the investigation of oncogenic proteins , Abelson ’s kinase ( bcr - Abl ) was discovered . Clinical usage of these inhibitors has also resulted in the growth of drug - resistant malignancies as additional consequences [ REF ] . The detection alongside subsequent exploitation of numerous configurational positions of kinases is part of the tale of developing these kinase inhibitors . Previously , selectivity had been identified as a problem during the development of kinase inhibitors that bind at the ATP ( Adenosine Triphosphate ) pocket . As ATP is a cofactor required for the functioning of the kinase , developmental pressure has been applied to keep",2.760819449607369,0.5261846732037473,0.4995369828150495,0.06090715698125765,0.8069074498489499,0.8073381945010154,0.11406423034330011,0.047619047619047616,0.08970099667774087,0.28460686600221485,0.15725359911406422,0.028792912513842746,0.05094130675526024,0.07862679955703211,0.02547065337763012,0.021040974529346623,0.0664451827242525,0.008859357696566999,True,277.0,0.8239202657807309,5.001107419712071,903.0,0.0,0.014027316352897749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008305647840531562,0.011627906976744186,0.013289036544850499,0.02547065337763012,37.49594421031509,13.713124623720649,15.227246063832183,16.99257475416416,17.258771422837647,16.92455629139072,63.14368854103954,9.212121212121213,22.6767023340091,7052883195.082085,7810501.877167314,5.785430463576159,5.0,3.3932616778994675,22.87878787878788,21.0,10.403255829983973,1.7271523178807946,1.0,1.0965287658858556,755,379,0.5019867549668874,4516,33,42
"Cognitive dysfunction , one of the most common non - motor symptoms ( NMSs ) in Parkinson ’s disease ( PD ) , is up to six times more common in PD than in the healthy aging population , worsens the prognosis of PD , and increases caregivers ’ burden and economic consequences [ REF ] . It was estimated that 40–50 % of PD presents with mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) at baseline , and 75–80 % of MCI progresses to dementia in a longitudinal study [ REF ] . Recently , the process of cognitive decline in PD patients have received growing interest . Subjective cognitive decline ( SCD ) refers to decreases in cognitive capacity without detectable impairment on neuropsychological tests , indicating intact cognitive functions , accompanied by pathological changes , and was believed to be an at - risk state of MCI and a prodromal stage for dementia in Alzheimer ’s disease ( AD ) [ REF ] . A study showed β - amyloid deposition and atrophy as well as brain activation in people with SCD , suggesting a compensatory mechanism , which might reflect early neuronal dysfunction together with memory performance preserved [ REF ] . Thus , the state of SCD was recognized as an essential course of AD pathology and a risk factor for cognitive decline [ REF ] . Similar to AD , SCD may be an intermediate state between cognitive normality and MCI in PD . Thus , a possible three - stage clinical performance related to cognition might be applicable to patients with PD , with SCD as the prodromal phase , followed by MCI , finally leading to dementia [ REF ] . Neuroimaging study focused on PD patients with SCD ( PD - SCD ) demonstrated reduced FDG metabolism in the middle frontal , middle temporal , and occipital areas and the angular gyrus of the cortex , which suggested there may be early pathological changes in PD - SCD [ REF ] . Follow - up studies showed a significantly higher risk of developing PD - MCI and dementia for patients with PD - SCD compared to PD without SCD at baseline [ REF ] . However , there are inconsistent results , results just shown a correlation between SCD and depression , anxiety and other related mood features rather than cognitive dysfunction [ REF ] . For example , in Barbosa ’s study , he regarded SCD as subjective cognitive complaints ( SCC ) , and found SCD severity was related to depression ( p = 0.026 ) rather than Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) scores ( p = 0.141 ) in PD with normal cognition ( PD - NC ) , which suggested clinician to alert affective disorder in PD - SCD [ REF ] . Study led by Baschi defined subjective memory complaints ( SMC ) as SCD , and results showed PD - SCD was significantly associated with anxiety ( OR = 3.93 ) when compared to PD without SCD [ REF].Overall , cognitive impairment in PD is a huge financial burden to society as well as caregivers , and it is time to highlight the importance of identifying cognitive decline as early as possible [ REF ] .

"Neck pain is one of the most frequently encountered disorders in clinical settings [ REF ] and is often difficult to diagnose and treat [ REF ] . Neck pain continues to increase in the general population and specific subgroups worldwide [ REF ] . Published data on the prevalence is variable , but it is estimated that 22–70 % of the general population will experience pain at some point in life [ REF].Patients with chronic mechanical neck pain ( CMNP ) are present with a wide range of symptoms ranging from mild pain and minimal functional limitation to complete disability [ REF ] . Therefore , it has great socio - economic and negative health impacts [ REF].Among the identified risk factors for the development of CMNP are a long history of neck pain , worrisome attitude , poor quality of life , and less vitality . The same clinical practice guidelines and its updated revision identified female gender and prior history of neck pain as predisposing factors for the development of a new onset of neck pain . In addition , there is low to moderate evidence that high job demands , history of smoking , low social / work support , and history of low back pain are risk factors for the development of neck pain in general [ REF].The international classification of functioning , disability , and health ( ICF ) endorses functional terminologies in describing health conditions . Therefore , the clinical practice guidelines linked to the ICF classify patients with neck pain into four categories : neck pain with mobility deficits , neck pain with headache , neck pain with movement coordination deficits , and neck pain with radiated upper extremity pain . Each category is presented with clinical findings specific to that category2,3.There is strong evidence that young individual patients with a duration of symptoms less than 12 weeks can be diagnosed with neck pain and mobility deficits when they are presented with symptoms isolated to the neck and have a limited cervical range of motion ( ROM ) [ REF ] . Moreover , the revised clinical practice guidelines of neck pain [ REF ] identified the patients with a presentation of the following symptoms as having neck pain with mobility deficits : central and/or unilateral neck pain , limitation in cervical ROM with reproduction of familiar symptoms , associated referred shoulder or upper extremity pain . College students can be a risk population for developing CMNP because of the long hours spent studying in front of computer screens [ REF ] . This can be also triggered by sustained posture and abnormal cervical spine mechanics with tenderness on palpation [ REF ] . Additional clinical examination findings of patients with neck pain and mobility deficits include limited cervical ROM , neck pain reproduced at the end of active and passive ROM , restricted cervical and thoracic segmental mobility , associated scapular / thoracic segments pain , and strength deficits in subacute or chronic neck pain [ REF].Instrument - assisted soft tissue mobilization ( IASTM ) has gained wide attention as a relatively new technique in the treatment of muscular tightness and pain . Originally described by Cyriax in 1982 , this technique can be performed using different tools . The IASTM uses the same concept by applying an adapted pressure on the tight structures using different - shaped stainless - steel tools with beveled edges to conform to different anatomical structures . Although there is some empirical evidence for its use [ REF ] , its effect has not yet been investigated in subjects with CMNP to the authors ’ knowledge . Myofascial treatment is an emerging treatment in different musculoskeletal conditions although",3.1663205326298347,0.9573515891542117,0.4989457175605552,0.06659322487552748,0.7702847672626376,0.7713882952928544,0.12540192926045016,0.05787781350482315,0.13183279742765272,0.30064308681672025,0.12057877813504823,0.03697749196141479,0.03697749196141479,0.08681672025723473,0.01929260450160772,0.01607717041800643,0.03215434083601286,0.011254019292604502,True,203.0,0.8681672025723473,4.942122186495177,622.0,0.0,0.06387009472259811,0.038430311231393774,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041407307171853855,0.017050067658998646,0.014614343707713126,0.02090032154340836,33.41470588235296,16.53372549019608,17.190840771661655,20.363947567977466,20.51931751706207,15.705340699815839,71.53601993283502,12.647058823529411,14.835733113973323,2773812.023808176,4459.504861427936,5.515653775322283,4.0,2.956285853207421,31.941176470588236,30.0,18.102552917898866,1.6666666666666667,1.0,0.9544570898697861,543,255,0.4696132596685083,3074,17,44
"This Position Statement was prepared by the Nutrition Department of the Brazilian Association for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome ( ABESO ) , with the collaboration of dietitians from research and clinical fields with an emphasis on strategies for weight loss . The preparation of this document was based on results from the main randomized controlled studies and meta - analyses that tested different nutrition interventions for the treatment of obesity . In addition , we included the analysis and interpretation of studies with interventions that are not scientifically recognized and have a low evidence level , but that are of great popularity . We also addressed the topics of intestinal microbiota , inflammation and nutritional genomics in the context of obesity , as well as the processes involved in weight regain . Aspects related to eating behavior and nutritional strategies recommended for the adoption of adequate eating habits were also included in this Position Statement . Obesity is a chronic , progressive disease resulting from multifactorial causes mainly related to lifestyle ( sedentary lifestyle , inadequate eating habits ) and to other conditions such as genetic , hereditary , psychological , cultural , and ethnic factors [ REF ] . The treatment is complex , long - lasting , and involves lifestyle changes with an emphasis on nutritional therapy , physical activity practice , psychological interventions , and pharmacological or surgical treatment . Due to the chronic character of obesity , the diet recommended for it ’s treatment must contribute to the individual ’s global health . Even a modest reduction in body weight ( 5 % ) can already improve the metabolic profile and reduce cardiovascular risk [ REF].Figure 1 shows examples of strategies for the long - term follow - up of patients with obesity , seeking global health . Fig . 1Strategies for successful long - term weight lossStrategies for successful long - term weight lossThe main diet - related cause associated with obesity observed in Brazil over the last decades was the increase in calorie intake , mostly associated with a gradual increase in the consumption of ultraprocessed foods . A cross - sectional study conducted in Brazil in 2008–2009 , with 55.970 participants , showed that these products represent from 15.5 % ( lower quartile ) to 39.4 % ( upper quartile ) of the total dietary energy intake [ REF ] . The greater household availability of these foods was positively and independently associated with a higher prevalence of excess weight and obesity in all age groups [ REF ] . According to NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ) data from the past 2 decades , the estimated proportion of energy intake from ultraprocessed foods has increased among youths in the United States and has contributed significantly to their total energy intake ( TEI ) [ REF ] . Another important investigation conducted in several countries showed that ultraprocessed foods consumption ranged from 18 % of TEI among preschool children in Colombia to 68 % among adolescents in the United Kingdom . In almost all countries and age groups , the increase in ultraprocessed foods intake was a potential determinant of obesity in children and adolescents [ REF].Low vegetable intake is known to be another relevant factor associated with obesity , as shown in a North American study conducted with 120,877 individuals followed during 4 years [ REF ] . In this investigation , there was an inverse association between weight gain and the consumption of fruits , vegetables , whole - grains , and nuts [ REF ] . In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 ( GBD ) [ REF ] , even though there was no specific analysis of the diet - related causes associated with obesity , this important study demonstrated the relationship between low intake of fiber and vegetables ( fruits , grains and vegetables ) and increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality . In this scenario , the recommendation of a balanced diet for the prevention and treatment of obesity and its comorbidities is crucial . In the last years , the term “ diet ” has been associated with food restriction and highly restrictive meal plans",3.1127945183969135,0.9529426459689634,0.4709554054439911,0.05454011348030031,0.7308481488199461,0.7357509389519692,0.14285714285714285,0.08486562942008487,0.10466760961810467,0.26308345120226306,0.13861386138613863,0.04101838755304102,0.026874115983026876,0.07213578500707214,0.024045261669024046,0.015558698727015558,0.05799151343705799,0.004243281471004243,True,248.0,0.8373408769448374,4.99009900990099,707.0,0.0,0.0273972602739726,0.015588096362777516,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00826641473783656,0.011572980632971186,0.012753897024090695,0.016973125884016973,37.78188139674896,14.809987959060809,16.52667757954773,18.995063214930763,19.00546809151114,16.464569536423834,64.20951234196266,10.090909090909092,18.89849521133391,161254627.56951767,228082.92442647478,5.670529801324503,5.0,3.176756288104667,27.454545454545453,27.0,12.741226117419258,1.6688741721854305,1.0,1.0259665402844556,604,287,0.47516556291390727,3528,22,45
"Microneedles have attracted increasing interest in recent years in biomedical areas , such as drug delivery , biosensing , and fluid extraction [ REF ] . The tips of the microneedles can penetrate the epidermis layer of skin to arrive at the top layer of the dermis that is above the blood capillaries . Thus , the microneedles would not touch the nerve endings to further avoid bleeding and pain [ REF ] . The microchannels can be formed on the skin by the microneedles where the molecules can pass through , or the microneedles can bring the devices , such as the electrodes to get the biomedical signals [ REF ] . For drug administration , the microneedle approach has the advantages of avoiding the effect of the gastrointestinal digestion , accelerating the drug absorption , prolonging the effective time , and patient self - administered without needing doctors [ REF ] . For biosensing , the microneedle approach provides possible continuous monitoring of the biomarkers in interstitial fluid [ REF].A microneedle usually has a microscale height and width , in the shape of a cone or a pyramid , and usually , a patch of microneedle arrays sticks to the skin . The concept of transdermal delivery by using microneedles was first proposed by Zhao et al . in 2020 , but due to the limitations of micromachining technology , it was not until the 1990s that microneedles were mass produced . The earliest use of hollow needles was by Mcallister et al . , 150 μm micron needles made of silicon in the 1980s [ REF].Several types of microneedles have been fabricated , including solid microneedles , coated microneedles , soluble microneedles , and hollow microneedles . The microneedle materials can be silicon [ REF ] , metals , biomaterials , and polymers [ REF ] . A variety of fabrication methods have been explored , including photolithography with selective etching , machining with chemical etching , machining with micro - milling , laser cutter , 3d printing , soft lithography , micro - injection molding , hot embossing , electrohydrodynamic atomization , laser machining , electric - discharge machining with laser machining , soft lithography , drawing lithography , centrifugal lithography , and droplet - borne air blowing [ REF].This review would focus particularly on the recent progress of the materials , fabrication methods , and biomedical applications of microneedles . The study would introduce the types of materials for constructing the microneedles , their fabrication , and related biomedical applications in drug delivery , biosensing , and body fluid extraction . Most of the published reviews on microneedles mainly reviewed the application of microneedles in drug delivery [ REF ] . In recent years , the potential of microneedles in the field of biosensors has attracted great attention because of its painless and slightly invasive , such as the sensor based on microneedles for biomarkers of human tissue fluid . This paper also summarizes other applications on body fluid extraction and nerves . In addition , due to the high precision of the structure of the microneedle , there are great difficulties in the preparation of the microneedle . At present , other reviews lacked discussion about the fabrication methods",2.878230226918021,0.6917589143053862,0.4921078756218927,0.06063225899359056,0.7824530811870799,0.8163117859512568,0.12660550458715597,0.09908256880733946,0.08073394495412844,0.30458715596330277,0.163302752293578,0.029357798165137616,0.04036697247706422,0.08073394495412844,0.02018348623853211,0.011009174311926606,0.027522935779816515,0.009174311926605505,True,191.0,0.8330275229357799,4.972477064220183,545.0,0.0,0.03564843269821758,0.019668100799016593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013829133374308543,0.01505838967424708,0.016594960049170254,0.009174311926605505,39.008508771929826,14.111929824561404,15.543283084950321,17.589473684210528,18.308837719298246,16.828684210526315,62.6140350877193,9.444444444444445,17.94957740388876,62431305.85265465,114552.85477551311,5.74780701754386,5.0,3.3898706849972,25.333333333333332,22.0,14.704496666741852,1.6798245614035088,1.0,0.9656994396901089,456,227,0.49780701754385964,2710,18,46
"Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) is a devastating , inflammatory disorder , which impacts mainly preterm infants and remains one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies in the preterm infant population [ REF ] . In the United States alone , it is estimated that up to 9 % of infants weighing less than 1,500 g at birth will develop NEC [ REF ] . The mortality rate from NEC is significant and has been reported up to 30%–50 % depending on disease severity [ REF ] . Treatment strategies have remained limited , non - targeted , and have not changed significantly in decades [ REF ] . Although NEC was formally described in 1965 by Mizrahi et al . , the specific causes have yet to be fully elucidated [ REF ] . To help clinicians with NEC diagnosis , Bell et al . published the first clinical staging system for NEC in 1978 that was designed to help clinicians know when to surgically intervene [ REF ] . Eight years later , Walsh and Kliegman published a modified version of Bell 's staging system [ REF ] . The Bell and Modified Bell staging systems have consistently been the most widely used clinical definitions and are considered the “ gold standard ” in the field . However , most researchers and clinicians now focus on Bell ≥2 and believe that Bell stage 1 or Modified Bell stage 1A and 1B are considered largely non - specific [ REF ] . This has led to the development of six newer definitions for NEC , which all propose to be superior at NEC diagnosis than the Bell and Modified Bell staging definitions [ REF].While many discoveries are being made within the NEC field , which may help prevent or treat NEC in the future , there remain fundamental limitations that clinicians and scientists in the field face . First , there is no universal definition of NEC . As discussed in the last paragraph , there now exist multiple definitions of NEC and clinicians and scientists can choose the one that suits their purposes best . This can lead to differences in what clinicians diagnose as NEC at various institutions . An added challenge is that the etiology of NEC has yet to be fully understood . Many in the field believe that NEC is a multifaceted disease and is the common end point of several pathways and pathologies . This multifaceted nature of NEC has made biomarker discovery difficult . Despite the NEC field spending ample time , resources , and research focus attempting to discover better biomarkers to aid in better prevention and mitigation strategies , all biomarkers discovered thus far have been insufficient [ REF ] . Therefore , NEC as a disease has the potential to benefit greatly from artificial intelligence ( AI ) and machine learning ( ML ) [ REF ] . So far , AI has shown promise in identification and prediction of diseases , biomarker discovery , disease risk evaluation , and development of improved treatment plans for many diseases both for adults and neonates [ REF ] . While AI and ML studies applied to the healthcare setting have rapidly increased in recent years , most instances have been applied to common and more well - defined diseases such as sepsis or cancer and only a few published studies have applied AI and ML to NEC . This review will summarize basic concepts of AI and ML ( Section 2 ) , present and summarize the current published literature on AI and ML in NEC ( Section 3 ) , as well as describe some of the limitations and pitfalls of AI and ML ( Section 4 ) .",2.850309910360719,0.649971256220599,0.45214868861550905,0.051970519462836845,0.7150073673414148,0.7093648375435309,0.09220985691573927,0.05564387917329094,0.07472178060413355,0.1891891891891892,0.13672496025437203,0.05405405405405406,0.05564387917329094,0.10333863275039745,0.05087440381558029,0.02702702702702703,0.10810810810810811,0.019077901430842606,True,238.0,0.8410174880763116,4.461049284578697,629.0,0.0,0.03814793244030285,0.0128130460104834,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01601630751310425,0.02242283051834595,0.028829353523587654,0.0047694753577106515,55.609592627013654,11.071830855018586,13.09234351052407,14.394175960346965,13.538444857496899,12.541858736059474,54.01517967781909,7.083333333333333,16.889408270376073,21626030.663277436,34381.606777865556,5.044609665427509,4.0,2.933250404097949,22.416666666666668,20.5,13.413042988905321,1.5185873605947955,1.0,0.8385619288634145,538,259,0.48141263940520446,2806,24,47
"Achilles tendinopathy is a type of degenerative tendon disease that causes functional impairment and morbidity [ REF ] . According to epidemiological data , a prevalence of 2.16 cases per 1,000 patient - years was estimated in the general population and 6.2%–9.5 % in athlete population [ REF ] . According to its anatomical location , it is divided into two primary categories : insertional , which occurs at the calcaneus Achilles tendon junction , and mid - portion , which occurs 2–6 cm proximal to the calcaneus [ REF ] . The characteristic of mid - portion tendinopathy is diffuse or localized swelling , degenerated tendon morphology and pain caused by repetitive loading without adequate compensation of the plantar flexor muscle function [ REF].In consequence , one of the most effective management strategies for mid - portion AT have been proposed to be exercise - based therapy [ REF ] . To date , several exercise interventions have been reported for AT , such as the “ Alfredson protocol ” which is also known as heavy eccentric calf training [ REF ] , concentric training [ REF ] , the “ Stanish protocol ” [ REF ] , and the “ Silbernagel protocol ” [ REF ] . These interventions can be classified as three different loading protocols : eccentric , concentric , and combined ( eccentric plus concentric ) training , respectively . Among those , eccentric loading has emerged as one of the primary conservative approaches for AT rehabilitation over the past twenty years . It is hypothesized to influence the formation in carboxyterminal propeptide of type I collagen , boosting tendon volume and tensile strength [ REF ] . Eccentric exercises may also have the potential to reduce the neovascularization and related nerve ingrowth being responsible for pain development [ REF ] . A recent meta - analysis examined the relationship between eccentric exercise treatments and tendon volume in healthy and pathological tendons [ REF ] . In healthy tendons no significant immediate volume changes following acute exercise interventions were apparent . In pathological tendons , immediate and short - term volume reductions were reported , while no long - term adaptations were found as investigated in one study only . Based on the limited number of studies examining long - term changes in tendon morphology , the proclaimed effect of eccentric training on tendon volume remains inconclusive [ REF].Research indicates that both concentric and combined exercise treatments can also be effective in improving plantar flexor functions such as power ( e.g. , height of countermovement jump ) [ REF ] in the AT population , which is believed to occur through the strengthening of the affected tendon [ REF ] . Therefore , it remains unclear whether the effects of eccentric loading are different from other types of loadings , such as slow concentric loading [ REF ] . The primary cause for these similar adaptations may be explained by the “ time - under - tension ” hypothesis , which states that positive adaptations could be achieved regardless of contraction type , as long as the mechanical strain is",3.0751990090423336,0.44224207588936154,0.4481733590496309,0.055451548003159594,0.8268338926136494,0.7824901302655538,0.10095238095238095,0.05904761904761905,0.13333333333333333,0.22095238095238096,0.18095238095238095,0.02857142857142857,0.05333333333333334,0.0761904761904762,0.022857142857142857,0.022857142857142857,0.06285714285714286,0.007619047619047619,True,171.0,0.8095238095238095,4.929523809523809,525.0,0.0,0.04562982005141388,0.014138817480719794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02249357326478149,0.031491002570694086,0.02892030848329049,0.011428571428571429,34.107889757301564,14.771112025229673,16.775130644584568,19.138406691347868,18.547367338543808,17.18312354312354,66.96023584258879,10.529411764705882,12.803524359498013,363496.28633659706,692.3738787363753,5.808857808857809,5.0,3.226610777629959,25.235294117647058,22.0,8.98711110924781,1.7389277389277389,1.0,1.0341036756668815,429,224,0.5221445221445221,2588,17,48
"Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is the most common malignant tumor of digestive tract in the world . Its incidence rate ranks the third in the incidence rate of all cancers and the second in the death caused by cancer [ REF ] . It has been reported that the incidence of CRC is positively correlated with socioeconomic development . By 2030 , the number of CRC cases in developed countries is projected to increase to 2.2 million and the number of deaths to 1.1 million [ REF ] . In recent years , although some progress has been made in the early diagnosis and systemic treatment of CRC , the five - year survival rate of patients with CRC is still only about 50 % . This is mainly because CRC often has no obvious symptoms in the early stage , and most CRC patients are diagnosed at a late stage and even have metastases . However , the mechanism of the occurrence , development and invasion of CRC is still not completely clear . Therefore , searching for detection methods and tumor markers for early diagnosis of CRC , and further exploring the exact molecular mechanism of its occurrence , development and invasion are hot topics in current research . Epidemiological studies have found that diet , obesity and diabetes are risk factors for CRC [ REF ] . A large number of studies have shown that the abnormal lipid metabolism of cells is involved in the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer , and is significantly related to the clinical treatment effect and prognosis [ REF].Lipids are hydrophobic macromolecules , which are divided into several groups according to structure of ketoacyl and isoprene : FAs ( fatty acids ) , phospholipids , TGs ( cholesterol , triglycerides ) , sphingolipids , and cholesteryl esters [ REF ] . Lipids are essential nutrients for cells , acting as the structural components of cell membranes , material transport , energy suppliers , signaling molecules , apoptosis and other aspects [ REF ] . Abnormal lipid metabolism refers to the abnormal anabolism and catabolism of lipids in the body , resulting in too much or too little lipids in each tissue , thus affecting the body function [ REF ] . Although normal cells regulate anabolic and catabolic pathways to adapt to changes in nutrient supply , tumor cells can exhibit uncontrolled proliferation even in the presence of nutrient deficiency . The tumor microenvironment is hypoxic , acidic , and nutrient deficient , resulting in metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells and adjacent stromal cells to promote tumor cell survival , proliferation , and metastasis [ REF ] . Many studies have shown that the abnormal lipid metabolism in cells is significantly related to the induction and metastasis of cancer . At the same time , clinical studies have shown that the abnormal lipid metabolism is closely related to the poor prognosis of CRC patients [ REF ] . Both malignant progression and accelerated proliferation of CRC cells require more energy , which induces changes in lipid metabolism to allow CRC cells survive . Abnormal lipid metabolism causes changes in various genes and proteins , as well as the dysregulation of cytokines and signaling pathways [ REF ] . Attentionally , lipid metabolism in CRC cells can be regulated not only by intracellular signals , but also by various components in the tumor microenvironment , including various cells , cytokines , DNA , RNA , and nutrients including lipids [ REF].In this review , we discussed the changes of lipid metabolism in colorectal cancer and its role in the genesis and development of colorectal cancer , and also discussed the remodeling of lipid metabolism pathway in CRC cells and tumor microenvironment . The review provides a summary for better understanding and targeting lipid metabolism therapy and improving prognosis .",3.367180129482608,0.7979323371913685,0.47215780895956266,0.054681254496117195,0.845382758975029,0.8436992984069022,0.11265432098765432,0.06790123456790123,0.11265432098765432,0.2716049382716049,0.1388888888888889,0.05246913580246913,0.043209876543209874,0.07253086419753087,0.040123456790123455,0.013888888888888888,0.043209876543209874,0.009259259259259259,True,235.0,0.8533950617283951,4.848765432098766,648.0,0.0,0.10029031406703616,0.06413301662707839,0.06413301662707839,0.04196357878068092,0.0,0.0,0.01583531274742676,0.0166270783847981,0.021377672209026127,0.004629629629629629,36.83757031717536,14.710479610156451,16.55564534867402,18.939864922629734,17.631204582371545,15.292064631956904,61.71231939813627,9.333333333333334,19.42148616263445,272047206.53373104,419825.9360088442,5.477558348294434,5.0,3.0768054148383515,26.523809523809526,24.0,13.351008692476235,1.6912028725314183,1.0,0.9558352341012434,557,249,0.44703770197486536,3142,21,49
"Metformin ( 1 , 1 - dimethyl biguanide ; MF ) is a renowned drug with versatile utility . MF is an orally administered anti - hyperglycemic drug and is the preferred first - line drug for lowering blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM)[REF ] . MF , a second - generation biguanide , is extracted from the French lilac ( Galega officinalis ) . In the Middle Ages , this plant extract was used to decrease blood sugar , relieve intense urination and alleviate symptoms of T2DM [ REF ] . In 1922 , guanidine was discovered as an active ingredient in G. officinalis that lowers blood glucose levels.3 MF was overshadowed by phenformin and buformin — other guanide - derived drugs that were initially deemed more effective in treating T2DM . However , because of the high toxicity of the other medications , MF became the gold standard drug for managing high glucose levels in patients with diabetes , owing to its benign , nontoxic nature [ REF ] . The drug was approved for treating hyperglycemia in 1958 in the United Kingdom , in 1972 in Canada and in 1995 in the United States [ REF ] . MF is the most prescribed drug for T2DM management worldwide and is used by more than 120 million people [ REF ] . The molecular structure of MF is illustrated in Figure 1 . As an orally administered drug , MF decreases glucose levels in the blood by inhibiting gluconeogenesis in the liver [ REF ] . This decrease is achieved by inhibition of intracellular binding of calcium in hepatocyte mitochondria , thus decreasing gluconeogenesis [ REF ] . Moreover , MF is the principal therapeutic drug for the treatment T2DM in obese patients [ REF ] . Beyond its antidiabetic effects , MF has antilipidemic , hepatoprotective , anti - neoplastic , cardioprotective and anti - obesity effects [ REF ] . It has various applications including the management of acne , hirsutism and polycystic ovarian syndrome , and as a chemo - preventive agent for neoplastic conditions [ REF ] . After oral administration , MF is gradually absorbed from the small intestine . The bioavailability of the drug has found to be approximately 50–60 % , and the plasma half - life has been calculated to be 1.5–4 h [ REF ] . Approximately 30–50 % of an orally consumed dose of MF is excreted in the urine within the first 24 h , whereas 30 % is unchanged and excreted via the feces [ REF ] . Importantly , MF can pass through the placenta , and fetal concentrations of MF are often lower than maternal concentrations of MF . The pharmacokinetics of MF in pregnant women is influenced by the high glomerular filtration rate . The plasma concentrations of MF during pregnancy are therefore lower than those in non - pregnant women [ REF ] . MF exerts anti - obesity effects by decreasing appetite and increasing secretion of glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) . The anti - hyperglycemic effect of MF decreases intestinal carbohydrate absorption (",3.0501107660982627,0.6975945669786908,0.45135183183281496,0.08527134350726039,0.8086507717768351,0.8159329503774643,0.12617702448210924,0.0696798493408663,0.12052730696798493,0.1958568738229755,0.1657250470809793,0.022598870056497175,0.04896421845574388,0.07532956685499058,0.030131826741996232,0.011299435028248588,0.096045197740113,0.005649717514124294,True,170.0,0.7909604519774012,4.531073446327683,531.0,0.0,0.03814713896457766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013283378746594006,0.02861035422343324,0.03678474114441417,0.013182674199623353,48.41089652283202,11.407783829074152,13.463846863241148,14.526853791369923,13.492138667783827,13.98276497695852,52.21575198994554,6.409090909090909,14.091788155787313,1318213.7465071941,2482.511763667032,5.320276497695852,4.0,3.3077487460305983,19.727272727272727,18.5,7.110695006191334,1.6359447004608294,1.0,1.041178947457447,434,225,0.5184331797235023,2406,22,50
"Health professions trainees in the 21st century have access to an unprecedented amount of open access educational resources that greatly exceeds the organizational capacity of an individual ’s mind [ REF ] . In response , future practitioners must be proficient in knowledge acquisition [ REF ] The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching highlighted the need to incorporate habits of inquiry and improvement in the 2010 Call for Reform of Medical Education as a learning strategy to optimize proficiency in knowledge acquisition [ REF ] . To meet the evolving needs of trainees and to foster greater student curiosity as the foundation for learning , inquiry - based learning ( IBL ) has emerged as an appealing educational strategy . IBL focuses on learner driven acquisition of knowledge through development of inquiries , and hypothesis generation . This differs from problem - based learning in that PBL is focused on learner investigation of teacher provided problems . Comparative to problem - based learning is case based learning wherein learners are provided cases around which to target their investigation and research . Through exclusion of these other teaching methods and focusing only on open inquiry , we attempt to distinguish the specific benefits of pure trainee inquiry learning and consider how this can be incorporated in areas of health profession that involve mature learners such as post - graduate medical education and nursing education . Educational philosopher John Dewey , a prominent education reformist in the early 20th century laid the foundation for inquiry as a central focus of science education , and Jerome Bruner pioneered the inquiry - based instruction in science curricula [ REF ] in the 1950s . The theory behind IBL is the constructivist , learner - driven active process of knowledge acquisition . Students formulate hypotheses and make observations in order to construct their knowledge [ REF ] . While descriptions of IBL vary widely in the literature , the framework can be divided into five general phases:[REF ] Orientation : the topic is introduced , and the student creates a problem statement , Conceptualization : the student develops an open question pertaining to the problem , and generates a hypothesis , Investigation : the student explores or observes , they may even experiment , and interpret their findings , Conclusion : the student reviews the problem , hypothesis , and their interpretation of the findings to consider whether their question has been answered , and , Discussion : the student communicates their findings to others ( external ) and reflects upon successes and areas for improvement within the inquiry process ( internal ) . Orientation : the topic is introduced , and the student creates a problem statement , Conceptualization : the student develops an open question pertaining to the problem , and generates a hypothesis , Investigation : the student explores or observes , they may even experiment , and interpret their findings , Conclusion : the student reviews the problem , hypothesis , and their interpretation of the findings to consider whether their question has been answered , and , Discussion : the student communicates their findings to others ( external ) and reflects upon successes and areas for improvement within the inquiry process ( internal).While the IBL curriculum design has evolved and taken many forms since Bruner ’s initial model , the core foundation of student -",2.9177868570582692,0.6214320477011068,0.48551914035412697,0.06534797698411787,0.8564193646113077,0.8499974310398102,0.10229276895943562,0.09171075837742504,0.059964726631393295,0.2821869488536155,0.13932980599647266,0.04585537918871252,0.03527336860670194,0.12169312169312169,0.008818342151675485,0.03350970017636684,0.042328042328042326,0.019400352733686066,False,207.0,0.8589065255731922,5.156966490299824,567.0,0.0,0.3793696275071633,0.3793696275071633,0.36103151862464183,0.36103151862464183,0.36103151862464183,0.36103151862464183,0.017191977077363897,0.02979942693409742,0.007736389684813753,0.003527336860670194,26.96069672131148,17.075901639344263,16.975882523387877,19.904918032786885,21.278913934426235,17.50942622950819,75.37704918032787,13.6875,16.025524503857568,9115843.520734873,16077.325433394837,5.829918032786885,6.0,3.1696832328420554,30.5,20.0,23.062415311497624,1.7602459016393444,1.0,1.0450397773547644,488,210,0.430327868852459,2924,16,51
"Antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) is a global security threat [ REF ] . It is driven by the inappropriate use of antimicrobials , particularly antibiotics , in humans , animals and veterinary medicine.1 The inappropriate use of antibiotics also exacts adverse clinical and economic effects on patients [ REF ] . The adverse economic effects include increased costs of healthcare borne by patients , whereas the adverse clinical effects include increased consumption of antibiotics , increased length of hospital stay , morbidity , mortality and certainly the emergence of AMR [ REF ] . AMR is considered one of the biggest threats to global health , food security and development [ REF ] . AMR accounts for an estimated 700 000 deaths per year globally [ REF ] . If AMR is not curbed , it could result in about 10 million global deaths per year and 4.1 million deaths in Africa by 2050 [ REF ] . AMR could also have devastating economic impacts as it could result in a 2 % to 3.5 % reduction in global Gross Domestic Product by 2050 , a loss of between 60 and 100 trillion US dollars ( US$ ) of economic output , increased treatment costs ( resulting in increased morbidity and mortality in poorly funded fragile health systems in many LMICs ) and a failure to achieve universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , particularly in LMICs [ REF ] . Increased morbidity and mortality ( arising from rising rates of AMR ) could result in declining labour supply and an additional 28.3 million people being pushed into extreme poverty by 2050 due to high costs of treatment and chronic infections [ REF ] . AMR related morbidity and mortality in animal husbandry could affect the livelihood of farmers and also threaten food security [ REF ] . Another danger of AMR is that it results in market failures , low return on investment and disinclination to invest in research and development in new antimicrobial agents , particularly antibiotics [ REF ] . Rather than invest in developing new antibiotics , multinational pharmaceutical companies are choosing the more profitable option of developing drugs for non - communicable diseases [ REF ] . Also , the few new antibiotics being developed are expensive and show little benefit compared to existing antibiotics [ REF ] . For example , the World Health Organization notes that only 2 out of the 12 antibiotics approved since 2017 represent a new class of antibiotics.9 The remainder are derivatives of already existing antibiotics [ REF ] . Citizens of LMICs would have to bear the unduly high costs of purchasing these newly developed antibiotics since existing and cheaper antibiotics are ineffective [ REF ] . Sadly , poverty and other factors such as weak antibiotic supply chain management systems deny many citizens of LMICs from accessing both old and new antibiotics [ REF ] .

"Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease defined as ischemia or hemorrhage , of which ischemic stroke accounts for 76 % [ REF ] , and leads to a variety of neurological defects . Statistics show that there are 2.4 million new stroke patients in China every year , about 1.1 million deaths , and 11 million stroke patients , most of which are ischemic stroke , and these statistics show an upward and younger trend year by year . China has become the country with the heaviest burden of stroke in the world [ REF ] . Data show that 29–78 % of stroke patients have dysphagia [ REF ] , and the mean incidence of the disease is 50 % [ REF ] . 91 % of patients with post - stroke dysphagia are mild [ REF ] . Although the survival rate of stroke patients has been significantly improved because of the improvement of medical skills such as first aid and thrombolysis , most survivors of stroke are affected by sequelae such as dysphagia and speech , motor , and memory impairments [ REF ] . Stroke is the most common neurological cause of dysphagia [ REF ] . Dysphagia is a process in which food can not be transported safely and efficiently to the stomach because of the damaged structure and function of organs , such as the jaw , the Soft Palate , the lips , the tongue , the throat , the esophagus , etc . Swallowing muscles mainly include the laryngeal muscles ( suprahyoid muscle and thyrohyoid muscle ) and the subglottis . These muscles experience kinematic effects and muscle strength weakens , resulting in reduced movement in the swallowing process [ REF ] . Swallowing is one of the most complex somatic reflexes . It is controlled by the cerebral cortex , cortical medulla oblongata pathway , brainstem , the swallowing center , and pairs 3rd , 4th , 5th , 6th , and 7th of the cerebral nerves and C1 , C2 , and C3 of the spinal nerves [ REF ] . Stroke disrupts the swallowing network and can lead to dysphagia . According to the location of food passing through , swallowing can be divided into four stages : pre - oral stage , oral stage , pharyngeal stage , and esophageal stage [ REF ] . The majority of post - stroke dysphagia occurs in the delivery of food and fluid from the oral cavity to the stomach , and their dysfunction occurs primarily in the oral and pharyngeal phases .

"Palliative anticancer drug use is reported to prolong survival and relieve disease - related symptoms for some patients with incurable cancer [ REF ] . Conversely , other studies have reported a marginal impact of anticancer therapy on life expectancy and showed an unclear relationship between the use of this treatment and quality of life [ REF ] . Furthermore , the potential benefits of using anticancer drugs in terminally ill cancer patients are disputed because cancer therapy might threaten patients ’ quality of life and even survival , and also imposes a significant cost on the healthcare system . Moreover , an increasing number of articles claim that near the end of life , anticancer treatment is associated with poorer quality of life [ REF ] and does not improve survival [ REF ] . In this review , the term “ end of life ” is used referring to final days , weeks , months in a person ’s life in which it is medically obvious that death is imminent or a terminal moribund state can not be prevented [ REF].Anticancer drug use towards the end of life is highly prevalent worldwide and increasing in some countries [ REF ] . A single centre study in Korea reported that , the proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy in the last month of life was 25.7 % in 2000 , 32.7 % in 2005 , and continued to increase to 44.2 % in 2010 [ REF ] . In the USA , between 1993 and 1996 , the proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy within the 2 weeks before death rose from 13.8 % to 18.5 % , while recent studies reported stagnation in the USA [ REF ] . The trend and magnitude of end of life anticancer treatment frequency may be explained in part by the rapidly evolving treatment options in oncology , like immunotherapy and newer targeted treatments , which have broadened the therapeutic landscape . Recent reviews on resource utilization in end of life cancer patients show great diversity in settings , methods , and outcomes across publications [ REF].These differences are more evident when defining the study population . While in retrospective population - based studies , which include all cancer patients in the analysis , regardless of previous treatments received or stage of cancer , they typically reported a lower frequency of end of life cancer treatment [ REF ] . Conversely , research studies that enrolled patients with advanced cancer or those who had undergone cancer treatment in the past reported substantially higher frequencies of end of life cancer treatment in the same period [ REF].The goal of this article is to explore the methods and outcomes used by the studies , and along these differences , describe the current magnitude of anticancer treatment at end of life . These objectives lend themselves to a scoping review approach because they aim to identify knowledge gaps , clarify concepts , and scope the literature related to cancer treatment at end of life . Scoping reviews are particularly useful for mapping the existing literature in a specific field , allowing researchers to compare the methods and outcomes used by various studies [ REF ] . In this case , a scoping review can provide a comprehensive overview of the current magnitude of anticancer treatment at end of life , highlighting differences in methods and outcomes across studies . Furthermore , this scoping review can inform decision - making and set research agendas to identify areas that require further investigation and inform future systematic reviews or primary research on this topic [ REF ] .",3.482296623108812,0.587708395448134,0.4657970326199686,0.042492572538670635,0.8877915058817182,0.8679783940315247,0.13486842105263158,0.0805921052631579,0.06414473684210527,0.3026315789473684,0.12006578947368421,0.03782894736842105,0.03618421052631579,0.10526315789473684,0.027960526315789474,0.018092105263157895,0.02138157894736842,0.01644736842105263,False,218.0,0.8519736842105263,4.791118421052632,608.0,0.0,0.14573863636363638,0.14232954545454546,0.06306818181818181,0.03409090909090909,0.03409090909090909,0.03409090909090909,0.02784090909090909,0.019886363636363636,0.023011363636363635,0.004934210526315789,32.86466414618778,17.43658979206049,16.15616582465906,20.0045872715816,21.436112161310653,14.86147448015123,72.3177063642092,13.066666666666666,16.233738078654866,11225943.916959075,18463.72354763006,5.357277882797732,5.0,2.9040986876191783,35.266666666666666,31.0,10.902395251605137,1.6332703213610587,1.0,0.9149611769259662,529,247,0.4669187145557656,2913,15,54
"Orofacial pain ( OFP ) is that localized below the orbito - meatal line , above the neck and anterior to the ears , including pain in structures of the oral cavity . According to the latest OFP classification , OFP can be acute , when it lasts for less than 3 months , episodic , when it occurs on fewer than 15 days per month whether or not for more than 3 months , or chronic , when it persists for more than 3 months and is present on at least 15 days per month [ REF ] . This distinction is important because chronic OFP is often accompanied by reduced quality of life , sleep and psychological disturbances and disability [ REF ] that require different management and it has less favorable prognosis . The estimated prevalence of chronic OFP in the general population is of 10 % [ REF ] . OFP can be additionally classified as primary , when its etiology is unknown ( e.g. , chronic primary temporomandibular joint pain and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia ) , or secondary , when it has an identifiable cause ( e.g. , temporomandibular joint pain attributed to arthritis and trigeminal neuralgia attributed to multiple sclerosis ) . In other words , chronic primary OFP conditions can be understood as their own disease , while chronic secondary pain syndromes represent symptoms of other underlying conditions or diseases [ REF ] . Some of the most challenging types of chronic primary OFP to manage include painful temporomandibular disorders ( pTMDs ) , idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia ( TN ) , and burning mouth syndrome ( BMS ) . These seemingly idiopathic conditions have no cure and treatment is mostly palliative , geared toward pain management and coping strategies . Often , patients living chronic pain , including pTMDs , TN , and BMS , must endure significant biological , psychosocial , and economic burdens that also affect their families , and society as a whole [ REF].The most common types of primary pTMDs are myofascial pain and temporomandibular joint pain [ REF ] . These conditions have a prevalence of about 5 % that is greater in women than in men [ REF ] and their hallmark is spontaneous masticatory muscle and/or temporomandibular joint pain that is exacerbated upon jaw function . TN has a lifetime prevalence of 0.16%–0.3 % and also affects more women than men ( 1.5:1 ) [ REF ] . TN is characterized by recurrent severe paroxysmal pain restricted to the territory of the trigeminal nerves ( which innervate the orofacial region ) lasting from a fraction of a second up to 2 min . TN pain is described as electric shock - like , stabbing , or sharp , and is triggered by innocuous stimuli ( e.g. , washing the face , eating , and brushing the teeth ) . BMS has a prevalence of 2.5%–5 % in the general population that rises to 14 % among post - menopausal women . BMS is characterized by a spontaneous burning sensation that most commonly affects the tongue , lips , and hard and soft palates and may be accompanied by an alteration of taste , a stinging sensation , dryness , and atypical odontalgia [ REF].Despite considerable scientific advances over the past decades [ REF ] , the need for greater understanding of the pathophysiology underlying these primary OFP conditions persists because treatment remains suboptimal . In this scenario , pre - clinical research has been and will continue to be an important and irreplaceable means of facilitating scientific advancement . Furthermore , we are currently experiencing a boom of both pain neuroimaging and genetic studies that find crucial complementation in animal research [ REF].The goal of this review is to describe the currently available rodent assays ( injury models ) and OFP measures ( behavior ) that can be used in support of chronic primary OFP research , in specific pTMDs , TN , and BMS . We will discuss their applicability and challenges considering our current knowledge of the etiology and pathophysiology of these conditions and possible future directions . Previous reviews have focused on other conditions linked to OFP , including migraine / headaches [ REF ] and oral cancer [ REF ] .",3.300521764607943,0.9207504085463543,0.45175577415769386,0.06089326846148019,0.6947466005620203,0.721489366557863,0.09457579972183588,0.055632823365785816,0.15159944367176634,0.19749652294853964,0.1571627260083449,0.05146036161335188,0.04728789986091794,0.08623087621696801,0.031988873435326845,0.03337969401947149,0.05146036161335188,0.006954102920723227,True,247.0,0.8178025034770514,4.700973574408901,719.0,0.0,0.020497803806734993,0.009760858955588092,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012201073694485115,0.01708150317227916,0.013177159590043924,0.016689847009735744,36.09000000000003,15.678333333333338,16.76809479433877,19.6,19.16885,15.17113333333333,65.16666666666667,10.55,19.190165058644173,215865278.11841136,300229.8722091952,5.435,4.0,3.2226968520169565,30.0,26.5,15.620499351813308,1.6583333333333334,1.0,0.9617330999583801,600,294,0.49,3380,20,55
"Promoting fruit and vegetable ( FV ) intake in children is critical to support proper brain and body development [ REF ] and to establish healthy dietary habits that persist over the life course [ REF ] . Despite the long - standing explicit guidelines and evidence regarding the importance of FV intake , average FV consumption amongst all US children ( 2–18 years old ) remains low : only 40 % and 7 % meet the recommended intake for fruits and vegetables , respectively [ REF ] . The current average intake for children is only 0.9 cup equivalents of each ( 60 % of recommended ) , with consumption levels that decline with age and are restricted in variety relative to recommended guidelines [ REF ] . Thus , in support of public health , it is important to develop strategies to improve FV intake in children . Preschool age children begin developing their own dietary habits by gaining autonomy over their food choice [ REF ] , evident in the decline in FV intake as children transition from preschool age to school age [ REF ] . Thus , preschool age ( 2–5 years old ) may be an optimal time for a dietary intervention to promote FV intake throughout the lifespan . However , there are key gaps and inconsistencies present in diet research that will be discussed below . Consideration of the measurement tool in diet research is particularly important in young children because they are unable to accurately report their own intake [ REF ] . Parent - reported measures , while most frequently used in research [ REF ] , have been repeatedly shown to be subjective and prone to recall and reporting bias [ REF ] ; this is especially problematic when parents are asked to report on periods of time for which they are not directly responsible for child feeding , such as during childcare hours [ REF ] . As such , use of objective observation measures is critical with this age group [ REF ] . An additional objective measure specific to FV intake is the skin carotenoid level [ REF ] . When FVs are consumed , the carotenoids in the FVs are absorbed and then deposited in various tissues including the skin [ REF ] , which can be quantified using reflection spectroscopy [ REF ] to objectively measure FV intake within the previous two to four weeks [ REF ] . Due to the discrepancies associated with the different techniques used to measure dietary intake , reviews should distinguish between studies with subjective and objective measures to adequately evaluate the validity of a large proportion of this body of work . The setting of dietary interventions in children is another significant consideration . In 2019 , nearly two - thirds ( 64 % ) of 3–5 year old children in the US were enrolled in childcare or preschool with 64.7 % of all enrollments being full - time [ REF ] . Thus , childcare services have a large",2.911020221619677,0.6524738143804648,0.47188018797514375,0.047457196503047736,0.8190847158432006,0.7956401833466121,0.1111111111111111,0.056530214424951264,0.09941520467836257,0.2378167641325536,0.15594541910331383,0.025341130604288498,0.050682261208576995,0.08382066276803118,0.03898635477582846,0.025341130604288498,0.050682261208576995,0.02729044834307992,True,183.0,0.8148148148148148,4.508771929824562,513.0,0.0,0.016991150442477877,0.016991150442477877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02831858407079646,0.03964601769911504,0.03185840707964602,0.003898635477582846,47.05150700934581,13.342032710280378,14.90622815163357,17.05514018691589,16.463411214953275,13.702429906542054,59.927570093457945,8.875,12.613507289317432,300591.44294653356,585.9482318645878,5.205607476635514,4.0,2.938587357729819,26.75,27.0,12.91559135308949,1.5677570093457944,1.0,0.8794579983501679,428,222,0.5186915887850467,2313,16,56
"A large amount of research on the COVID-19 pandemic around the world emphasises the disproportionate burden of the pandemic among racial / ethnic minorities , the poor , the elderly and people with disabilities , low educational attainment and comorbidities , among others [ REF ] . The word ‘ vulnerable ’ is often used to indicate these disproportionately impacted populations . Moreover , COVID-19 has broadened the definition and scope of vulnerability that include not only a population with certain socioeconomic or health characteristics but also the marginalised and disadvantaged communities that are more likely susceptible to overwhelming epidemiological outcomes ( i.e. , higher case , morbidity and mortality rates ) [ REF ] . Thus , researchers have assessed a variety of communities ’ characteristics to identify the groups at most risk during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath [ REF ] . In other words , the discourse on vulnerability to COVID-19 , or any other pandemic , is largely about the susceptibility of an individual or a community to the negative effects of disease outbreaks . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic , numerous studies have assessed vulnerability through various indices calculated using a confluence of societal factors [ REF ] . Most of these studies examine the relationship between the vulnerability index and COVID-19 outcomes and discover that highly vulnerable areas have higher COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates . Furthermore , vulnerability indices have also been used as a tool to highlight disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage and vaccine hesitancy [ REF ] . One consistent thread found in these studies is the development or modification of the vulnerability indices using simple to sophisticated statistical methods such as arithmetic mean [ REF ] , percentile ranking [ REF ] , regression analysis [ REF ] , principal component analysis [ REF ] , factor analysis [ REF ] , machine learning algorithms [ REF ] , etc . The common societal indicators used by these studies to develop the indices include age , poverty , race or ethnicity , education , population with comorbidities , overcrowded households , and hospital density , among others . Researchers have also worked to understand and convey the distinct challenges and vulnerabilities the Arctic , including Alaska , already has and could be amplified due to COVID-19 and future pandemics [ REF ] . This study , likewise , focuses partly on the vulnerability of the Arctic populations with respect to the pandemic . Pre - existing conditions that exacerbate the vulnerability of Arctic residents include geographic barriers that limit access to health services , underdeveloped civic infrastructure , larger populations with underlying medical conditions ( such as hypertension , diabetes , heart disease , tuberculosis , hepatitis , obesity ) , lower socioeconomic status , inadequate housing , poor sanitation , lack of clean water , etc [ REF ] . Due to these challenges , previous pandemics such as smallpox , cholera , the 1918 influenza , tuberculosis and the 2009 H1N1 influenza had a disproportionate impact on the Arctic and its residents",2.9925632549140806,0.6936611241902934,0.47825037412632176,0.03929633237304808,0.7622739832316127,0.7529828009697107,0.09671179883945841,0.08897485493230174,0.10251450676982592,0.2862669245647969,0.17794970986460348,0.04448742746615087,0.025145067698259187,0.06769825918762089,0.030947775628626693,0.01160541586073501,0.03868471953578337,0.013539651837524178,True,173.0,0.8143133462282398,5.154738878143133,517.0,0.0,0.016975793775542283,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020433825840930526,0.028607356177302735,0.019805092738132662,0.0,16.612000000000023,17.947952718676124,19.354372201106518,22.722080378250595,21.297446808510635,18.889078014184395,70.7531914893617,12.0,15.548493841387671,5657506.703563511,10942.953004958435,6.078014184397163,6.0,3.4258182339264325,28.2,29.0,12.634344726445716,1.9101654846335698,1.0,1.1775945033085036,423,230,0.5437352245862884,2665,15,57
"Heart failure ( HF ) incidence is increasing globally , with almost half of all HF patients being women [ REF ] . The 2022 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics report by the American Heart Association reported a projected rise in HF prevalence by 46 % from 2012 to 2030 , expecting to increase the total percentage of the population from 2.4 % in 2012 to 3 % in 2030 [ REF ] . HF causes significant morbidity and mortality among women [ REF ] , and the incidence of HF tripled between ages 65–74 and 75–84 [ REF ] . In women , HF tends to occur at an older age and usually manifests as HF with preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) . Furthermore , women are more likely to be more symptomatic than men [ REF ] . Although women are less prone than men to develop coronary artery disease ( CAD ) at premenopausal age , they reported worse quality of life and increased risk for depression [ REF ] . Guideline - directed medical therapy for HF does not differ in women ; however , women are vastly underrepresented in HF trials [ REF].Sodium - glucose transporter-2 inhibitors ( SGLT-2is ) are hypoglycemic agents which block the sodium - dependent glucose transporter-2 in the early proximal renal tubule of the kidneys . Their primary effect is increasing urinary glucose excretion and decreasing blood glucose levels . Additional effects of SGLT-2is , especially on the cardiovascular system , have been increasingly reported in the literature . In early 2022 , the US Food and Drug Administration approved empagliflozin to treat HF . SGLT-2is use is currently one of the four pillars in managing patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) [ REF ] . In patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) , empagliflozin showed a 21 % lower relative risk in the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF [ REF ] . In the recently published 2022 American Heart Association / American College of Cardiology / Heart Failure Society of America ( AHA / ACC / HSFA ) heart failure guideline , SGLT-2is received a class I recommendation for patients with HFrEF , including those at risk for HF ( Stage A ) [ REF ] . Similarly , the 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for acute and chronic HF highlighted the importance of SGLT-2is ( class IA recommendation ) in reducing HF hospitalization and mortality risk in patients with HFrEF [ REF ] . Possible mechanisms of cardiovascular benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors are changes in energy metabolism , reduction of blood pressure ( BP ) and vessel stiffness , increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit , improvement of myocardial remodeling , and weight loss [ REF].Men and women may differ in myocardial adaptation after a cardiac event [ REF ] . HFpEF is more common in women than in men . Furthermore , women with HFpEF have more comorbidities than those with HFrEF , with > 60 % having at least four comorbidities [ REF ] . White women with HFpEF had the highest proportion of hospitalization for HF [ REF ] . A meta - analysis by Singh et al . showed that the reduction in primary composite outcomes with SGLT-2is appears to be significantly less in women with diabetes than in men [ REF ] . However , to our knowledge , no study has investigated whether there are sex differences in cardiovascular ( CV ) outcomes among HF patients on SGLT-2is . We conducted a thorough systematic review and meta - analysis of all the CV outcomes studied with SGLT-2is in patients with HF with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) to study the primary composite outcomes based on the sex of the patients . This study aimed to determine the effect of SGLT-2is on primary composite outcomes among patients with HF , with or without type 2 DM , stratified by sex , through a systematic review and meta",3.068220259518125,0.6198293950585029,0.4812285312889437,0.06535688701407169,0.7550536786968057,0.7387084464232127,0.14558823529411766,0.052941176470588235,0.07058823529411765,0.23088235294117648,0.1588235294117647,0.029411764705882353,0.025,0.06911764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.014705882352941176,0.12058823529411765,0.013235294117647059,True,212.0,0.8029411764705883,4.555882352941176,680.0,0.0,0.06566057717765422,0.03653693407466243,0.016944665078104316,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018533227429176596,0.025946518400847232,0.030976965845909452,0.023529411764705882,43.34543478260872,13.305393154486588,14.921278800779998,16.759050262102992,15.733741905642923,14.081843971631208,58.209682392846126,8.26086956521739,16.344716905154833,12543546.963840036,18446.392593882407,5.287234042553192,5.0,3.127737973639881,24.52173913043478,21.0,11.853708152954725,1.6382978723404256,1.0,1.028160898526045,564,258,0.4574468085106383,3098,23,58
"Prostate cancer ( PCa ) is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies in males with an increasing prevalence in both developed and developing countries and is one of the major causes of cancer - related death in men [ REF ] . Although the standard treatment for local PCa is surgery and radiotherapy , some other treatment protocols , such as brachytherapy and androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) especially in patients with advanced PCa are commonly used [ REF].The primary purpose of ADT is to reduce circulating androgen levels and block androgen signaling , since androgen has an important role in cancer cell proliferation and consequently disease progression [ REF ] . Indeed , ADT is a powerful and useful treatment approach that causes a decrease in prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) levels and tumor volume . It provides a temporary relief to patients although some patients may experience severe to moderate side effects such as hot flashes and sexual dysfunction during treatment [ REF].The response to the ADT may be observed in three phases : early , developing , and late phases ( Fig . 1 ) . The early phase is characteristic with decreased level of PSA , tumor regression , and increased quality of life while the late phase is characteristic with castration resistance , relapse , and highly metastatic and aggressive tumors . In the intervening period , which can be considered as a developing phase , homeostatic response of the cells leads to a progressive development of alteration in various cellular signaling mechanisms leading to the late phase response ( Fig . 1 ) . The cellular responses include reactivation of androgen receptor ( AR ) signaling through alternative mechanisms , decreased adhesion , increased motility and invasion , and altered tonic cell survival signaling . Mechanisms involving re - activation of androgen signaling include intra - tumor de novo androgen production , amplification of AR gene , mutations in the ligand - binding domain of AR ( AR - LBD ) , expression of some constitutively active AR isoforms , overexpression of AR co - regulators , and androgen - independent AR activation [ REF ] . These events lead to a more aggressive phenotype of the disease called castration - resistant PCa ( CRPC ) , generally 24–36 months after the initiation of ADT [ REF ] . In this stage , metastatic spread is observed in most of the patients and the average life expectancy is 18–24 months afterward [ REF].Another altered mechanism is epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which decreases adhesion and increases motility and invasion . Growing evidence links EMT to ADT in advanced PCa despite the lack of consensus regarding the effect of androgen signaling in the regulation of EMT [ REF ] . Indeed , initial studies have reported that ADT may induce EMT in advanced PCa at least through the “ cadherin switching ” mechanism [ REF ] . These reports led to further investigation , which pointed to an aberrant activation of transforming growth factor β1 ( TGF - β ) signaling [ REF ] , a multifunctional pathway regulating proliferation and differentiation of cells and cellular signaling molecules involved in cadherin switching [ REF",3.144720906484593,1.0320057916322727,0.45933260919710117,0.07029142198288918,0.6774312600493431,0.680099256336689,0.10805860805860806,0.0641025641025641,0.08974358974358974,0.27289377289377287,0.163003663003663,0.038461538461538464,0.03296703296703297,0.09706959706959707,0.023809523809523808,0.01098901098901099,0.06776556776556776,0.003663003663003663,True,165.0,0.8241758241758241,4.871794871794871,546.0,0.0,0.031201248049921998,0.0218408736349454,0.010608424336973479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0124804992199688,0.015288611544461778,0.016848673946957878,0.007326007326007326,30.450234030837038,16.06127202643172,17.339376936956576,20.072466960352426,19.3990859030837,16.416387665198233,68.46310572687224,11.375,13.787205432991989,972091.7120884585,1780.3877510777627,5.656387665198238,5.0,3.195673174644586,28.375,25.5,15.312882648280173,1.7444933920704846,1.0,1.0047916406627608,454,235,0.5176211453744494,2660,16,59
"Wilms tumour ( WT ) , also known as nephroblastoma , is a malignant kidney tumour that accounts for 5 % of all paediatric cancers and 95 % of childhood malignant renal neoplasms [ REF ] , with an incidence of 1 in 10,000 children [ REF ] . It is caused by aberrant kidney development at the embryonic stage , during mesenchymal epithelial transition ( MET ) at the beginning of nephrogenesis [ REF ] . It typically affects children aged 0–4 years of age [ REF ] , with a median diagnostic age between 3 and 4 years [ REF ] , and an equal distribution between males and females . Whilst the majority of WT cases ( 90%–95 % ) are unilateral , 5–10 % of cases affect both kidneys ( synchronous bilateral or multifocal tumours ) [ REF ] . Approximately 98–99 % of WT cases are sporadic , whereas 1–2 % are familial [ REF ] . Metastatic forms are observed in approximately 12 % of cases [ REF ] ; they are 80 % pulmonary , 10 % hepatic [ REF ] , but lymph node or bone metastasis may be observed in rare cases [ REF ] . Up to 20 % of WTs are discovered inadvertently during routine check - up visits as tumours can become large without manifesting any specific symptoms [ REF ] . However , WT is generally characterised by the development of a palpable hard abdominal mass or swelling that may be associated with abdominal pain , intra - tumoral bleeding , microscopic haematuria ( in 25 % of cases ) , hypertension ( 25 % ) , fever ( 20 % ) and vomiting [ REF ] . Medical imaging , primarily ultrasound , helps establish the diagnosis , which may determine if the mass is intra- or extra - renal , solid or cystic . Three dimensional imaging ( CT scan and/or MRI ) are then performed , which are required for staging purposes and initial disease - monitoring [ REF].WT is an undifferentiated mesodermal tumour comprising variable amounts of embryonic kidney elements ( blastocyst , epithelium , and stroma ) . Based on prognosis , there are two distinct histopathological types - favourable ( > 90 % of cases ) and unfavourable ( 6–10 % ) . Anaplastic and sarcomatous variants are unfavourable and associated with poor clinical outcomes [ REF ] . WT is treated following either the North American NWTS protocol or the European SIOP protocol [ REF ] . In Morocco and much of Europe , the SIOP protocol is implemented , with preoperative chemotherapy , then total nephrectomy with primary ligation of the vascular pedicle and lower resection of the ureter , followed by postoperative chemotherapy [ REF ] ; usually with combination chemotherapy [ REF ] . Sometimes , chemotherapy is combined with post - operative radiation therapy , depending on the stage and histology of the tumour [ REF ] . Nevertheless , whilst maximising survival , these therapies can have adverse side effects , including short - term toxicity , particularly gastrointestinal and cardiac , and long - term toxicity , which manifests in the slowing of bone growth with a risk of scoliosis as well as an",3.1156027342867962,0.8295365308575502,0.4631461770378227,0.0510878875990386,0.7285881396383047,0.7352067589759826,0.09818181818181818,0.045454545454545456,0.12727272727272726,0.20545454545454545,0.2109090909090909,0.04363636363636364,0.04363636363636364,0.06545454545454546,0.02909090909090909,0.01818181818181818,0.06363636363636363,0.0018181818181818182,True,154.0,0.7218181818181818,4.401818181818181,550.0,0.0,0.017508417508417508,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02861952861952862,0.040067340067340064,0.03333333333333333,0.012727272727272728,38.9889459611596,13.92955530537574,15.978110994213203,18.064959189417394,16.656438221221507,15.195502392344498,60.71263720799324,8.882352941176471,13.640367950669756,839337.316610157,1526.0678483821036,5.476076555023924,5.0,3.2312250352751803,24.58823529411765,22.0,11.077581088313734,1.6889952153110048,1.0,1.0301314288684997,418,253,0.6052631578947368,2421,17,60
"Atherosclerosis is a significant cause of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) that can lead to heart attack , stroke , kidney failure , and major amputation [ REF ] . Approximately 17.9 million people die from CVD annually [ REF ] . Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process characterized by endothelial activation , accumulation of lipoproteins , and recruitment of inflammatory cells that leads to plaques that gradually enlarge and either restrict blood flow or embolize , damaging the heart or peripheral tissues [ REF ] . The current diagnostic methods for atherosclerosis are associated with rare but significant procedure - related consequences and considerable cost [ REF ] . The classical biomarkers , such as total cholesterol , low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , or serum triglyceride levels , are the gold standard diagnostic tests for atherosclerosis [ REF ] . C - reactive protein , a non - specific inflammatory marker , has emerged as a clinical marker for residual risk in atherosclerosis patients with good cholesterol control [ REF ] . Many of these biomarkers can diagnose CVD but can not definitively predict stroke or myocardial infarction ( MI ) risk . There is a need for new CVD biomarkers that are cost - effective , improve detection , and identify novel treatment targets . As we enter the era of precision medicine , we need a more granular understanding of biomarkers that can be used as reliable screening tools with metrics to guide personalized intervention to prevent devastating clinical events . The American Heart Association proposed seven metrics in 2010 to define and monitor cardiovascular health [ REF ] . Managing the disease involves non - pharmacological methods ( healthy diet , regular physical activity , and tobacco abstinence ) [ REF ] and pharmacological interventions such as statins to control lipoprotein levels [ REF ] , with newer options such as cholesterol - binding agents ( e.g. , ezetimibe ) [ REF ] and proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 , lowers LDL ) inhibitors ( e.g. , evolocumab ) [ REF ] also available . Notably , several studies have highlighted challenges in achieving therapeutic goals for serum lipids despite high - intensity statin therapy [ REF ] . In some cases , surgery or stent - based therapies are required to manage more severe atherosclerosis . While current strategies can slow the progression of atherosclerosis and/or prevent clinical events [ REF ] , further research is needed to understand the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning plaque progression to identify targets for stabilization and/or plaque regression . One area of promise includes delineating cellular communication during atherosclerotic plaque development and progression . In this regard , extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) have been identified as essential cell - cell communicators that may hold promise in improving our understanding of atherosclerotic disease — from biomarkers to disease pathogenesis [ REF ] ( Figure 1 ) . Exploring the role of extracellular vesicles in atherosclerosis : insights from biomarkers , therapeutics , pathobiology , and translational models . Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) as versatile entities for various applications . EVs , small membrane - bound particles , have emerged as promising biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in various diseases . They have also shown great potential as therapeutic agents for their ability to carry and deliver bioactive molecules . Moreover , EVs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases , including cancer , neurodegenerative diseases , and atherosclerosis . Animal studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of the biology and functions of EVs , paving",2.7755306183920005,0.602797059162488,0.46262999282225103,0.04367292173387918,0.7811230576556661,0.7601057372309945,0.08524590163934426,0.03442622950819672,0.13114754098360656,0.260655737704918,0.1885245901639344,0.04262295081967213,0.03770491803278689,0.09180327868852459,0.022950819672131147,0.021311475409836064,0.04918032786885246,0.014754098360655738,True,162.0,0.8,5.18360655737705,610.0,0.0,0.013789445770352692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01856271546009016,0.025987801644126226,0.01909307875894988,0.003278688524590164,23.705548780487817,15.045650406504066,16.27048610459338,18.525203252032522,17.960731707317073,19.135609756097555,64.19918699186992,8.958333333333334,14.79939408433406,2674823.846408627,4384.957125260044,6.186991869918699,6.0,3.5460950548660257,20.5,18.0,9.192388155425117,1.91869918699187,1.0,1.2467420693793543,492,282,0.573170731707317,3162,24,61
"Beijing initiated the nation ’s most comprehensive tobacco control program that adheres to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control . This study aimed to identify a set of indicators for the scoping of an Health Impact Assessment ( HIA ) to assess this policy . China is the world ’s biggest tobacco consumer , with an estimated consumption that exceeds that of the 39 countries combined [ REF ] . In 2018 , there were more than 300 million smokers in China , with a smoking prevalence of 50.5 % for men and 2.1 % for women [ REF ] . According to estimates , 68.1 % of the surveyed of nonsmokers in China experience SHS at least once each day [ REF ] . In China , smoking contributed to roughly 2 million fatalities in 2017 [ REF ] . China signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ( FCTC ) of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in 2005 , and it went into effect in 2006 . However , it has taken a little while to fulfill the responsibilities [ REF ] . Due to China ’s tobacco monopoly , the FCTC has made only modest national progress [ REF ] , and there is no smoking ban in public places [ REF].As seen by the 21 cities in China that have passed smoke - free regulations in recent years , there is a rising bottom - up approach to tobacco control legislation in that country [ REF ] , including Beijing . For the smoke - free Olympics , Beijing implemented a smoking ban in 11 different types of public spaces in 2008 [ REF ] . Beijing residents ’ smoking rate has fallen by 1.5 % as a result of the regulation [ REF ] however , the smoking phenomenon quickly returned to its previous status after the Olympics [ REF ] . Beijing implemented the Beijing Municipal Tobacco Control Regulation in June 2015 , seven years later [ REF ] . The National Tobacco Tax Reform was started in May 2015 almost simultaneously [ REF ] , which , by the middle of 2015 , has created the Beijing comprehensive tobacco control policy . Six MPOWER measures , including Monitoring tobacco use , Protect people from tobacco smoking , Offer help to quit tobacco , Warning about the dangers of tobacco , Enforcing tobacco advertising , promotion & sponsorship , Raising taxes on tobacco , as recommended by WHO , make up Beijing ’s comprehensive tobacco control policy . These include a ban on smoking in all indoor and four outdoor public places , a higher tobacco tax , a ban on tobacco advertising , promotion , and sponsorship , the establishment of a cessation support system , and a media campaign [ REF ] . In 2015 , this was the nation ’s most successful tobacco control strategy that followed the WHO standard.[REF ] . The introduction of the 2015 policy have decreased the amount of cigarettes sold per person between 2015 and 2017 by 1388.2 sticks [ REF ] . From 2014 to 2017 , there was a further decline in smoking prevalence and SHS exposure , with decreases of 20.3 % and 25.6 % , respectively [ REF ] . After the adoption of smoke control measures , 18,137 ( 26.7 % ) hospital admissions for stroke decreased [ REF ] and 5581 ( 17.5 % ) hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders [ REF ] were probably avoided in Beijing for 25 months . Health Impact Assessment ( HIA ) is a combination of procedures , methods and tools by which a policy , program or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the health of a population , and the distribution of those effects",3.3810641996717457,0.5726858326810323,0.46435971534322196,0.05593255820630176,0.8042902271998557,0.7681492500834994,0.12792511700468018,0.08268330733229329,0.0421216848673947,0.22152886115444617,0.17160686427457097,0.0218408736349454,0.0202808112324493,0.0748829953198128,0.0218408736349454,0.028081123244929798,0.11388455538221529,0.015600624024960999,True,215.0,0.7644305772230889,4.313572542901716,641.0,0.0,0.10044052863436123,0.018795888399412628,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024963289280469897,0.03494860499265785,0.02907488986784141,0.0093603744149766,54.54972024952016,12.122283109404993,13.348371206891418,15.33362763915547,15.5066122840691,12.915163147792708,58.48761996161228,8.45,17.80525427685856,54041037.89152231,84307.39140643107,5.076775431861805,4.0,2.813092840559575,26.05,23.0,11.218177213790124,1.4875239923224568,1.0,0.8383432454651703,521,248,0.4760076775431862,2765,20,62
"Iron in essential for various intracellular activities , and stem cells would be no exception . For example , ribonucleotide reductase is an enzyme that facilitates DNA synthesis and repair , and iron is a cofactor for this enzyme . Also , iron is essential for mitochondrial respiration . It is used in the synthesis of haem and [ Fe - S ] clusters ; specifically , cytochrome c that not only participates in the electron transport chain , but also has a role in apoptosis [ REF ] . Cytochrome P450 are a group of enzymes that utilise haem ( iron ) as a cofactor , and these enzymes play an important role in detoxification / metabolism of drugs [ REF ] . The enzyme catalase possesses haem groups ( containing iron ) and this enzyme is an important anti - oxidant as it converts hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen , and thereby prevents / reduces cell damage by free radicals [ REF ] . Amongst specific examples of the involvement of iron at cellular level include the incorporation of iron within haemoglobin in maturing erythrocytes , and thereby aiding in oxygen transport throughout the body . Iron is also a part of myoglobin found in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue . In a pathological context , specifically pertaining to stem cells , iron has been found to maintain cancer stem cells [ REF ] and iron loading has been found to inhibit self - renewal of human pluripotent stem cells [ REF ] . Also , iron and iron - related proteins play a role in Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) biology . This includes the role of iron loading on cellular components , processes and signalling pathways of the MSCs [ REF].MSCs are the most widely researched stem cell types because of their ability to support several physiological processes in the body and their exuberant reparative and regenerative properties . Located in various body tissues , these cells not only show multilineage differentiation but also secrete immune and trophic factors that stimulate endogenous repair mechanisms at the target site . Furthermore , MSCs show tropism towards tumour and inflammation / injury [ REF ] . Expectedly , these cells have shown promising results in several in - vitro , pre - clinical and clinical trials for a wide range of pathologies including COVID-19 [ REF]Despite their therapeutic potential , MSCs are not frequently used in clinical settings for amelioration of pathological conditions . Amongst the many reasons for this are the challenges encountered in pre - transplantation MSC labelling and post - transplantation MSC detection via non - invasive methods like the Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . Nanoparticles including iron oxide nanoparticles have been used to enhance MSC detection , but their usage is confounded by various challenges [ REF ] . Evidently , these processes involve multistep and complex approaches that are yet to be perfected . Therefore , it is extremely important to search for effective and non - toxic approaches that not only preserve MSC functionality during extraction and in - vitro cultivation stages but also permit the detection of transplanted MSCs non - invasively and help retain and/or enhance their reparative and regenerative potential in - vivo . Iron - related genes and proteins have shown the potential to support many of these pre - requisites for a successful MSC therapy . Thus , this review compiles and critically evaluates the usage of the iron - related genes",3.047377236652838,0.6728871281695258,0.4449855813551865,0.042052657339061,0.8352335471855966,0.8049960500664182,0.09507640067911714,0.06621392190152801,0.0933786078098472,0.28862478777589134,0.13412563667232597,0.05263157894736842,0.04074702886247878,0.09168081494057725,0.044142614601018676,0.025466893039049237,0.03225806451612903,0.02037351443123939,True,209.0,0.8522920203735145,4.8217317487266556,589.0,0.0,0.010501750291715286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010210035005834306,0.014294049008168028,0.01575262543757293,0.003395585738539898,42.66168725099604,13.544418326693233,15.447985318891476,17.450358565737055,16.949940239043826,15.267011952191229,60.55816733067729,8.9,15.025775468865875,3354373.1448722915,5695.03080623479,5.48406374501992,4.0,3.1067887720320195,25.1,24.0,11.571084650973738,1.6394422310756973,1.0,0.9401820666104512,502,244,0.4860557768924303,2840,20,63
"The use of three - dimensional ( 3D ) cell cultures has been growing due to their widespread application ranging from studying drug efficacy and toxicity to creating disease models ( Zheng et al . , 2016 ) . By using a 3D - culture model , one can mimic the in vivo environment of human physiology more accurately than two - dimensional ( 2D ) models , such as standard cell culture [ REF ] . Therefore , the quality of the conducted experiments improves . The progress of 3D devices and technologies has advanced to the development of microfluidic chips to capture organ - level function known as organ - on - a - chip ( OOC ) [ REF ] . The design of the OOC devices is made to mimic the human cellular microenvironment . It includes the flow of fluids through micro - channels to mimic the vasculature network for providing nutrients and transporting waste and metabolites . The OOC models could also simulate the physical environment of human organs ( e.g. , lung , gut , and kidney ) by mimicking the structural features [ REF ] . This can eventually facilitate the translation of the in vitro findings to the human condition . The use of OOCs has the potential to make the drug discovery process fast and cheaper ( with a cost reduction of up to 26 % ) [ REF ] . However , despite many advances , its applicability is hampered by the lack of online detection schemes , allowing the real - time observation of cellular behaviors [ REF ] . This shortage limits our understanding of cellular mechanism as a function of time and consequently unable us from correcting for the defects in the produced OOC models . The analytical techniques that have been used so far include optical imaging , electrochemical sensors , fluorescence- or label - free assays such as photonic crystal in a total internal reflection [ REF ] , capillary electrophoresis , and mass spectrometry ( MS ) [ REF].Among these techniques , MS offers high sensitivity and specificity to analyze changes in metabolites , proteins , and lipids [ REF ] . Utilizing MS for the in - situ monitoring of 3D cell systems in OOC can provide insight into the molecular composition of culture media , excreted metabolites , and waste products [ REF ] . Despite the multiple advantages of MS , it can not be directly coupled with OOC for online and real - time analysis of molecules of interest ( e.g. , cytokines , proteins , chemokines ) [ REF ] . This problem occurs mainly due to the presence of cell media in the chambers of OOC , which is rich in salts , nonvolatile buffers , and compounds that can hamper the MS analysis by creating ion suppression [ REF ] . Currently , offline sample preparation methods are used to normalise chip - to - chip variability or manipulate cell excretes before MS analysis [ REF ] . However , with these approaches , the time - resolved detection of metabolites is largely reduced , which is an essential factor for unravelling cellular mechanisms . Considering the numerous advantages offered by MS for biomedical applications , this paper focuses mainly on the investigated approaches for direct coupling of OOC with MS . The capabilities and weaknesses of each approach for real - time analysis are reviewed in detail . The review begins with an introduction to OOC and used analytical techniques to evaluate the mimetic tissue models . After a brief discussion on the techniques of phase contrast microscopy , enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) , transepithelial electrical resistance ( TEER ) , the review is mainly focused on MS . To this end , MS introduction is followed by hyphenation techniques that bridge OOC with MS , namely , electrophoresis , solid phase extraction , liquid chromatography and droplet - based chips , and their limitations are discussed . This article provides an exhaustive review of relatively new developments that would potentially enable the development of a robust and reliable interface for analyzing OOC content with MS as a rapid , sensitive , and specific analytical technique .",2.9377292551514023,0.973589824247959,0.45775332473161406,0.06256550931834606,0.6905962627094525,0.6867332234978676,0.12011173184357542,0.08100558659217877,0.08519553072625698,0.2611731843575419,0.17458100558659218,0.029329608938547486,0.03212290502793296,0.08519553072625698,0.030726256983240222,0.0223463687150838,0.05446927374301676,0.012569832402234637,True,233.0,0.8184357541899442,4.628491620111732,716.0,0.0,0.023579051873914122,0.009431620749565649,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013651030032266072,0.0191114420451725,0.022338049143708117,0.00558659217877095,43.298922902494326,12.630204081632659,14.554592549557764,16.058049886621315,14.979399092970517,14.70081632653061,56.98185941043084,7.666666666666667,20.355741519102967,692446487.7986163,967104.0332382909,5.418367346938775,4.0,3.1593403343181348,21.77777777777778,24.0,9.930623542890814,1.6717687074829932,1.0,0.9633164092482286,588,312,0.5306122448979592,3314,27,64
"Over the last several decades , a prodigious literature has amassed on depression in children and adolescents . Major and consequential epidemiological findings show that ( 1 ) depression exhibits high prevalence and is associated with substantial distress and burden around the world [ REF ] ; ( 2 ) rates surge six - fold from childhood through late adolescence with steady , persistent rates throughout adulthood [ REF ] ; and ( 3 ) rates are increasing across generations , with current prevalence rates exceeding those seen just 10 years ago [ REF ] . As such , public policy experts recommend annual screening of depression for individuals ages 12 and above [ REF ] . In an effort to better understand ( and interrupt ) the development of depression across childhood and adolescence , researchers have identified numerous risk and resilience factors that prospectively predict depression [ REF ] . Indicated or selective preventions can reduce the likelihood of future depression for youth1 with elevated symptoms or risk factors ( Cuijpers et al . , 2021a , 2021b ) . Moreover , there exist several evidence - based treatments , including psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies , each of which works generally equally well to relieve youth depression [ REF ] . Table 1 enumerates what we know regarding risk factors for youth depression , and Table 2 summarizes knowledge of evidence - based interventions ( treatments and preventions ) . The field has accumulated an impressive corpus of knowledge . At the same time , however , it is an undeniable reality that many young people across the world continue to suffer from and with depression , and there is an urgent and critical need to address this suffering for as many people as possible . Consider global data , for example , which indicate that the age - standardized prevalence of depression increased by 4.2 % from 1990 to 2013 , whereas the prevalence of anxiety decreased by 0.5 % over this same period [ REF ] . This depression rise has been accompanied by co - occurring increases in rates of treatment ; yet , no country included in this global analysis showed diminished depression rates over this time period . Even with many empirically supported treatments , there has been little sustained progress in reducing depression ’s burden , or decreasing depression - related distress and suffering since 1980s . What can be done to address clear gaps to reduce the considerable and highly consequential distress and burden associated with youth depression ? The purpose of this paper is to revisit and critically interrogate how and what we think we know about youth depression and its interventions . To this end , we review the sociohistorical context in which the phenomena termed “ depression ” were conceptualized and highlight the ways in which our academic notions and “ best practice ” assessment instruments both do and do not align with the symptoms and features of this depression construct . In a similar manner , we consider contemporary prevention and treatment strategies and provide rationale for expanding the range and scope of intervention efforts to more efficiently and effectively respond to youth depression and prioritize structural- and systems - level change . Ultimately , we strive to provide A New Hope for advancing progress on youth depression . To this end we take some positions ( admittedly ours ) for what we believe are directions and priorities that hold promise for both improving the scholarly understanding of youth depression and reducing depression - related distress and burden worldwide . We believe meaningful progress can",3.06800324043151,0.9029619047424636,0.4476151984891118,0.04853814050658625,0.7954084998682925,0.7736022108130984,0.10214168039538715,0.057660626029654036,0.08237232289950576,0.2487644151565074,0.13673805601317957,0.06260296540362438,0.03130148270181219,0.12026359143327842,0.036243822075782535,0.04942339373970346,0.0214168039538715,0.016474464579901153,True,225.0,0.8385502471169687,4.990115321252059,607.0,0.0,0.029160935350756534,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009628610729023384,0.013480055020632738,0.012379642365887207,0.009884678747940691,39.39076923076925,14.224230769230772,16.827784334635936,19.246153846153845,18.21773076923077,16.32876923076923,62.53846153846153,9.5,14.465510579742013,1915540.870730044,3155.7510226195127,5.657692307692308,5.0,3.1491968545015356,26.0,24.0,13.841965178398622,1.6673076923076924,1.0,0.9541853460183787,520,279,0.5365384615384615,3029,20,65
"The dibenzo[b , f]azepine ( 1a ) scaffold ( Figure 1 ) is featured in commercial pharmaceuticals [ REF ] and other lead compounds [ REF ] , ligands [ REF ] and in materials science with possible applications in organic light emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) [ REF ] and dye - sensitized solar cells ( DSSCs ) [ REF].Dibenzo[b , f]azepine ( 1a ) , -oxepine ( 1b ) and -thiepine ( 1c ) as examples of dibenzo[b , f]heteropines ( 1 ) with the corresponding 10,11 - dihydro derivatives ( 2).Commercial pharmaceutical agents based on dibenzo[b , f]azepine ( 1a ) , or the 10,11 - dihydro derivative thereof ( 2a ) , include imipramine ( 3 ) and clomipramine ( 4 ) ( tricyclic antidepressants ) [ REF ] , opipramol ( 5 ) ( generalized anxiety disorder ) [ REF ] and carbamazepine ( 6 ) ( seizure disorders ) [ REF ] ( Figure 2).Selected pharmaceuticals with the dibenzo[b , f]azepine skeleton.10,11 - Dihydrodibenzo[b , f]azepine - based ligand 7 and a methyl analogue thereof are known to form pincer complexes with Pd , Ir , Rh and Ln [ REF ] , whereas a copper(II ) wagon wheel complex of 8 was reported in a molecular organic framework ( MOF ) ( Figure 3 ) [ REF].Examples of 10,11 - dihydrodibenzo[b , f]azepine - based ligands.4,4'-(5-(Pyridin-2 - yl)-10,11 - dihydro-5H - dibenzo[b , f]azepine-2,8 - diyl)bis(N , N - diphenylaniline ) ( 9 ) exhibits properties suitable for the use in organic light emitting diodes [ REF ] whereas dyes 10–12 were found suitable for the use in dye - sensitised solar cells ( Figure 4 ) [ REF].The dibenzo[b , f]azepine moiety in dyes with properties suitable for the use in organic light emitting diodes and dye - sensitised solar cells . Though analogous dibenzo[b , f]oxepines 1b , with an oxygen in the heterocyclic ring as opposed to nitrogen in azepines , are known from natural sources ( compounds 13–18 as examples ) [ REF ] , the application thereof in a clinical setting is limited ( Figure 5 ) . Novartis CGP 3466 ( 19 ) , a propargylamine derivative , showed excellent neuroprotective properties for the treatment of Parkinson ’s disease in rat models ( Figure 5 ) [ REF ] . Unfortunately , the promising preclinical studies of 19 could not be replicated in human trials [ REF].Selective bioactive natural products ( 13–18 ) containing the dibenzo[b , f]oxepine scaffold and Novartis CGP 3466 ( 19).For more details on the early synthesis of dibenzo[b , f]azepine ( 1a ) , the extensive review prepared by Kricka and Ledwith [ REF ] in 1974 , is recommended . While the review is lacking modern metal catalysis , it is still an excellent work covering early syntheses and properties . An analogous review published by Olivera et al . [ REF ] covers the topic of dibenzo[b , f]oxepines ( 1b ) up to 2002.Other heteroatoms ( e.g. , O , N , S , P , B and Si ) in the heterocyclic ring result in analogues of dibenzo[b , f]azepines and -oxepines . This group of compounds will thus be broadly referred to as dibenzo[b , f]heteropines ( 1).The first section of this review will cover the synthesis of dibenzo[b , f]heteropines ( 1 ) and 10,11 - dihydrodibenzo[b , f]heteropines ( 2 ) . The following section will briefly touch on functionalisation of the scaffold . While some reports are limited to the introduction of a single heteroatom , e.g. , nitrogen in the case of azepines 1a or oxygen in the case of oxepines 1b , some approaches allow for the incorporation of a diverse scope of heteroatoms ( e.g. , O , N , S , P , B and Si ) and may give access to a range",2.8769129377274743,0.9123406382249954,0.47083045927579137,0.04989925532571293,0.7123503858844439,0.6756573468446732,0.09327217125382263,0.05963302752293578,0.06422018348623854,0.20948012232415902,0.26299694189602446,0.0290519877675841,0.02599388379204893,0.06116207951070336,0.021406727828746176,0.0015290519877675841,0.09938837920489296,0.0045871559633027525,False,152.0,0.6957186544342507,4.3547400611620795,654.0,0.0,0.15938303341902313,0.11368180519851472,0.09997143673236218,0.06341045415595545,0.06341045415595545,0.06341045415595545,0.040845472722079404,0.025992573550414167,0.015424164524421594,0.09021406727828746,44.12616807090495,13.393760805339753,14.172360316638951,16.03068169383959,17.176959185906554,15.425779625779626,62.52992668782143,9.421052631578947,16.911721322096405,22113997.169671793,33813.45132977339,5.509355509355509,5.0,3.528973601231228,25.31578947368421,23.0,16.789886152333203,1.6195426195426195,1.0,0.9202913524202537,481,240,0.498960498960499,2848,19,66
"Frailty is a dynamic state of diminished physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to adverse events . It has been recognised as a prevalent and important consideration in the individualised management of older adults with cancer [ REF ] . Routine screening for geriatric conditions has been recommended for all adults over 65 or 70 years of age with a new cancer diagnosis [ REF ] . In contrast to older adults in the community - dwelling or acute care settings , those living with cancer face the additional acute stressors of cancer symptoms and potential treatment - related toxicities . Frailty has significant implications for not only understanding the underlying health status of a potentially - vulnerable individual with cancer , but also in influencing oncological treatment decisions and discourse , and tailoring non - oncological interventions or supports . Clinicians try to determine those who are too frail for treatment , those who require modified treatment or additional supports , and those who are deemed fit for standard therapy . However , there is currently no consensus regarding the optimum frailty screening or measurement tool in this population . The frailty index ( FI ) is one way in which frailty can be quantified [ REF ] . The FI conceptualises frailty as a multi - dimensional risk state which can be measured by the number , rather than the nature , of health problems . An FI is calculated as a proportion of deficits using a well - defined method [ REF ] e.g. , someone with 6 deficits out of 40 counted has an FI of 0.15 . As a continuous variable , ranging from zero ( most robust ) to a theoretical maximum of one ( most frail ) , the FI affords great precision in risk stratification by capturing frailty gradations . In a scoping review of FI in the community and acute care settings , an FI ≥ 0.25 was the most frequently used score to diagnose people as frail , however this was used in less than half of the identified studies [ REF ] . This score was derived from work by Rockwood and colleagues , which demonstrated that FI = 0.25 had construct and predictive validity to categorise community - dwelling adults as frail or non - frail [ REF ] . It correlated with the crossing point between robust and frail groups according to Fried et al . ’s phenotype model of frailty [ REF ] , another well validated yet conceptually distinct definition of frailty in older persons [ REF ] , and was predictive of institutionalisation and death . It also presented the crossing point between Clinical Frailty Scale ( CFS ) ‘ apparently vulnerable ’ ( mean FI = 0.22 ) and ‘ mildly frail ’ ( mean FI = 0.27 ) [ REF].However , little is known regarding the validity of FI categories in the context of cancer , and variation in who is deemed frail may be used to determine trial eligibility or treatment allocation [ REF ] , and referral for additional assessments or supports [ REF ] . It is therefore important to understand how the FI has been categorised in oncology literature , and to understand the rationale for these decisions [ REF].The objectives of this scoping review were : ( i ) to evaluate which FI categories ( FI scores and labels ) have",3.246054176606782,1.0979386714209904,0.4320341790525754,0.11392192811116512,0.7260909030834833,0.7172719873487949,0.11518324607329843,0.06980802792321117,0.09598603839441536,0.21291448516579406,0.14834205933682373,0.04537521815008726,0.04537521815008726,0.09598603839441536,0.03664921465968586,0.031413612565445025,0.05235602094240838,0.015706806282722512,True,215.0,0.8254799301919721,4.5811518324607325,573.0,0.0,0.0237722865186112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01563966218329684,0.021895527056615578,0.01689083515796059,0.005235602094240838,47.009405458089674,13.056982889322075,15.069178484269955,17.06285466753303,15.956140350877192,13.749465020576135,58.70651938488196,8.473684210526315,13.974756090408537,1172625.8290230494,2046.467415397992,5.222222222222222,4.0,3.1564161580759538,25.57894736842105,25.0,10.12197083718427,1.5823045267489713,1.0,0.9731031130257121,486,241,0.49588477366255146,2625,19,67
"Under the illumination of resonant wavelength , noble metals ( such as Au and Ag ) can support the coherent oscillations of electrons in metals . These excitations , called as surface plasmon resonances ( SPR ) , can greatly increase the optical extinction cross section of the nanostructure and produce significant near - field enhancement due to the high localization of electromagnetic field beyond the diffraction limit [ REF ] . Therefore , noble metal plasmonic nanostructures can be served as SPR sensors by utilizing the high sensitivity of local electromagnetic field to the change of surrounding dielectric environment . In the past decade , benefited from the rapid development of nanofabrication technologies ( such as nanosphere lithography and nanoimprint lithography ) , SPR sensors have found wide applications for the label - free and real - time detection of bio-/chemical species in numerous fields [ REF].A typical SPR sensing process is shown in Fig . 1 , where the resonance spectrum of a SPR sensor shifts to longer wavelength as the refractive index of surrounding environment increases from n to n+Δn . The sensing performance of various SPR sensors can be evaluated by figure of merit ( FOM ) , which is defined as spectral shift ( Δλ ) per refractive index unit ( RIU ) divided by resonance linewidth ( full - width at half - maximum , FWHM ) , namely FOM = Δλ/(Δn × FWHM ) . A high FOM has therefore become an important indicator for the excellent sensing performance of a SPR sensor [ REF ] . To improve FOM , there are two main directions : 1 ) enhancing the near - field intensity of SPR sensors to obtain a large spectral shift per refractive index and 2 ) decreasing the linewidths of SPR sensors . The former can be realized through the fabrication of SPR sensors with strong near - field enhancement [ REF ] , while the latter requires reducing plasmonic loss of sensor structures [ REF ] . For the widely used propagating surface plasmon polaritons ( SPP ) sensors using prism coupling strategy , it is difficult to realize the flexible tuning of optical properties of the sensor , and the existence of optical components in the device makes it difficult to realize miniaturization and portability , which greatly limits their practical applications [ REF ] . As for localized surface plasmon resonance ( LSPR ) sensors which are usually based on metallic plasmonic nanoparticles , they do not need to meet momentum matching conditions and the preparation of nanoparticles are relatively simple with low cost [ REF ] . The resonant frequency of the sensors can also be flexible tuned by adjusting the material , shape and size of plasmonic nanoparticles . Nevertheless , owing to strong radiative damping of metallic plasmonic nanoparticles , LSPR sensors usually exhibit broad resonance spectra , which greatly limit their sensing performance [ REF].Fig . 1Illustration of the spectral shift of a SPR sensor as the environmental refractive index changes from n to n+ Δn .",3.2972324249293945,0.616653607219906,0.4513651896535414,0.05372061958947658,0.8439411520957947,0.8813590755065283,0.1262135922330097,0.07378640776699029,0.1378640776699029,0.2543689320388349,0.14951456310679612,0.017475728155339806,0.03495145631067961,0.08155339805825243,0.02524271844660194,0.021359223300970873,0.05048543689320388,0.011650485436893204,True,165.0,0.8407766990291262,4.842718446601942,515.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00997340425531915,0.013962765957446808,0.014960106382978724,0.021359223300970873,36.01150684931511,16.008688845401174,17.288020509699884,20.368166992824527,20.203884540117414,15.701278538812787,67.58708414872798,11.357142857142858,12.928825522986635,412019.3210508718,800.0375166036346,5.518264840182648,5.0,3.229909410097996,31.285714285714285,27.5,10.429549856253702,1.643835616438356,1.0,0.9890246523380409,438,228,0.5205479452054794,2494,14,68
"Stem cells have self - renewal and multidirectional differentiation potential . According to the different developmental stages , they are divided into embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) and adult stem cells ( ASCs ) [ REF ] . Stem cell therapy has prominent application prospects . For example , allogenic hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) transplantation can rebuild the patients ’ hematopoietic and immune system , and mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) can reduce transplantation rejection and severe COVID-19 - induced lung injury [ REF ] . Under the accumulation of gene mutations , cell fusion , chromosomal mutations , etc . , mechanisms regulating the self - renewal and differentiation potential of the stem cells are compromised on , which then drive tumor growth from the malignant transformation of stem cells . Numerous studies have shown that the pluripotency , differentiation ability and cell reprogramming of stem cells are regulated by various transcription factors , such as Oct4 , Sox2 , Nanog , Klf4 and c - Myc [ REF ] . However , recent studies have found that posttranscriptional modifications are critical for regulating different cellular processes and stem cell fate [ REF ] . Posttranscriptional modifications have been increasingly demonstrated to be important for both RNA biosynthesis and degradation , including N6 - methyladenosine ( m6A ) , N1 - methyladenosine ( m1A ) , inosine ( I ) , pseudouridine ( Ψ ) , 5 - methylcytosine ( m5C ) , 5 - hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5 - hmC ) , N6,2’-O - dimethyladenosine ( m6Am ) , and 7 - methylguanosine ( m7 G ) [ REF ] . The modification of mRNA widely affects key biological processes , such as its folding [ REF ] , translation [ REF ] and transport [ REF ] . In recent years , A - to - I editing , which is the most common type of RNA editing in animals , has gradually attracted attention . It is widely involved in a variety of gene regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels , including alteration of sequences coding for amino acids at the transcriptome level and mRNA splicing , mRNA stability and circular RNA formation . Its dysregulation drives aberrant transcription and translation programs that promote cancer occurrence and progression [ REF].As an enzyme acting on double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) , the ADAR protein family was discovered in 1987 [ REF ] . The ADAR family has three different members : ADAR1 , ADAR2 and ADAR3 . ADAR1 and ADAR2 have enzymatic activities that explain the existence of RNA editing in different tissues [ REF ] , while ADAR3 is only present in brain tissue and has no enzymatic activity , which may compete for dsRNA substrates and thus act as an RNA editing inhibitor in the brain [ REF ] . ADAR1 , a specific adenosine deaminase , binds to dsRNA and converts adenosine ( A ) to inosine ( I ) after RNA transcription , which is known as A - to - I editing [ REF ] . It contains three isoforms , p150 , p110 and p80 [ REF ] . P150 has been reported to be involved in the regulation of type I interferon signaling [ REF ] . The IFN - inducible p150 heterodimer of ADAR1 contains a Zα structural domain that recognizes RNA with an alternative left - handed double helix structure , termed Z - RNA . Heterozygous ADAR1 mutations in the Zα structural domain cause type I IFN - mediated disorders in humans and mice . Mutations in the ADAR1 gene are associated with Aicardi - Goutières syndrome",2.8705375651781333,1.0448541258155242,0.4547333292800104,0.06297287657334644,0.6227528148076751,0.6157556452921459,0.07617504051863858,0.04376012965964344,0.08265802269043761,0.2625607779578606,0.22690437601296595,0.03889789303079417,0.03565640194489465,0.07779578606158834,0.01620745542949757,0.029173419773095625,0.08752025931928688,0.0032414910858995136,True,161.0,0.7633711507293355,4.565640194489466,617.0,0.0,0.025633556655986017,0.010486454995630643,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020390329158170697,0.028546460821438975,0.02883775123798427,0.03403565640194489,44.177232371209385,12.238867373036175,14.921278800779998,16.513554987212274,15.396733649981726,15.826218487394957,54.3090975520643,6.956521739130435,16.274211660317057,11689618.057336008,18945.89636521233,5.621848739495798,4.0,3.6055316899226146,20.695652173913043,19.0,13.221967171303103,1.6743697478991597,1.0,1.0274870533486522,476,255,0.5357142857142857,2817,23,69
"Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with the highest incidence and mortality rates , making it the greatest threat to human health and life [ REF ] . Currently , the standard treatment for lung cancer is surgery along with postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy [ REF ] . However , most patients experience varying degrees of deterioration in quality of life after discharge from the hospital due to cardiopulmonary dysfunction , negative psychology , and adverse reactions from chemotherapy and radiotherapy , all of which harm their prognosis after surgery and may even shorten their survival period [ REF ] . In addition , chemotherapy may trigger hazardous effects in varying degrees [ REF ] . Patients suffer from long - term pain and are under tremendous psychological stress [ REF ] . They are physically and psychologically weary . Negative emotions such as anxiety and fear , in turn , affect their treatment efficacy and quality of life . To avoid being trapped in a treatment cycle , it is critical to strengthen nursing intervention during chemotherapy [ REF ] . Many studies have confirmed that lung cancer patients need additional assistance and care after being discharged from the hospital . Therefore , high - quality , efficient , continuing care should be given to patients to ensure and improve their quality of life after they return home . Surgical resection is currently the most effective and important method for treating early stage lung cancer . Surgical methods are classified as thoracoscopic surgery and thoracoscopic surgery , while thoracoscopic surgery is further classified as multi - hole thoracoscopic surgery and single - port thoracoscopic surgery [ REF ] . Thoracoscopic surgery has been reported to minimize complications , improve postoperative quality of life , reduce postoperative discomfort , improve lung functions , shorten hospital stay , and hasten the return of patients to normal life [ REF ] . In the past 20 years , the popularity of minimally invasive techniques , namely video - assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) , has been continuously increasing and has been widely used in the treatment of cancer [ REF ] . Since the first video - assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy was performed in the early 1990s . Previous studies have shown that for early non - small cell lung cancer , video - assisted thoracoscopy has significant benefits over traditional thoracotomy lobectomy , including shorter hospital stay , improved recovery , reduced perioperative complications , and improved long - term survival for selected patients [ REF ] . Thoracoscopic surgery usually includes 3–4 incisions . With the development of thoracoscopy technology and equipment , thoracoscopic surgery has progressed from being multiple - incision to double - incision surgery , and , finally , to single - incision thoracoscopic surgery , which is also known as single - port thoracoscopic surgery . Table 1 depicts the various lung cancer treatment alternatives . The therapy approaches for lung cancer . In the 1990s , enhanced recovery after surgery ( ERAS ) was proposed [ REF ] . This concept optimizes the clinical pathways through evidence - based medicine , reduces traumatic stress , shortens hospital stays , and promotes early organ function recovery [ REF ] . The concept of ERAS has been progressively expanded in",2.9649790474563202,0.908939576243731,0.4593179163555141,0.05893899597355613,0.789363218979402,0.7745836774508158,0.0990990990990991,0.03783783783783784,0.12072072072072072,0.26846846846846845,0.1783783783783784,0.03783783783783784,0.05225225225225225,0.1009009009009009,0.032432432432432434,0.01981981981981982,0.02882882882882883,0.007207207207207207,True,161.0,0.8144144144144144,5.07027027027027,555.0,0.0,0.052256532066508314,0.01840855106888361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017814726840855107,0.02494061757719715,0.032066508313539195,0.0036036036036036037,39.86774008600099,12.61312947921644,14.366763438865632,15.737219302436694,16.555677974199718,17.776967032967033,61.980410893454376,8.347826086956522,14.599656011410048,2190534.2272109557,3946.9085174972174,5.964835164835165,5.0,3.074688356453852,19.782608695652176,17.0,11.147066378508784,1.7362637362637363,1.0,0.970274288116225,455,228,0.5010989010989011,2814,23,70
"Biomarkers used for food origin authentication purposes are molecules which presence relates to a specific species . Two prominent categories of these molecules are proteomic ( proteins and peptides ) and genomic . To be considered a proper biomarker , these molecules should ideally be responsive , specific , and applicable [ REF].Collagen , a fibrous protein abundant in different animal tissues like skin , bones , and connective tissue , can be partially hydrolysed to extract gelatin , which is extensively used in food and pharmaceutical applications [ REF ] . There are two unique types of gelatin , namely types A and B , resulting from the pH of the pre - treatments used to generate these compounds . Type A gelatin is produced by using acid pre - treatments , and it has an isoelectric point at pHs 6–9 , whereas type B gelatin , generated by alkaline pre - treatments , has an isoelectric point at pHs 4.8–5.4 [ REF ] . Porcine and bovine skins and bones are currently the most commonly utilized materials worldwide to supply the demands of gelatin for multiple applications [ REF ] . However , there are currently public health concerns related to their use as they may be a source of pathogen dissemination , such as prions associated with the consumption of mammalian gelatins [ REF ] . Moreover , the religious beliefs of some sectors of the population are a limiting factor in the use of gelatins of animal origin by consumers . The dietary laws and requirements followed by Muslims ( Halal food ) and Jews ( Kosher food ) need to ensure that food products are free from porcine products and by - products , while Hindu customers demand food products of no bovine origin [ REF ] . On the other hand , gelatin is also utilized as a supplement or traditional medicine , such as donkey - hide gelatin , a traditional Chinese medicine manufactured from donkey skin [ REF].Recognizing the source of gelatin is also important for the consumers of this high - value product in order to avoid product fraud . For instance , although industrial gelatin made from leather waste can have a significant level of chromium , which can lead to kidney damage and , in extreme situations , be linked to cancer [ REF ] , some retailers have substituted industrial gelatin for edible gelatin in food products due the low cost and ease of manufacture of this product . Sausages and pork jelly are food products that are widely appreciated as a delicacy in numerous regions of China , and both items contain gelatin . The marketing expenditure allocated to the promotion of these food products exceeds $ 15 million [ REF ] . Furthermore , other cases of food fraud were reported by Demirhan , Ulca [ REF ] that discovered porcine DNA in some Halal food products , such as marshmallows , gum drops , and Turkish delights , that were declared to be made with Halal gelatin when they were tested . Due to worries about allergies , law , ethics , and the practice of certain religions , using less expensive materials in edible bird 's nests , such as porcine",3.1833008024926372,0.6246131925929296,0.484533712453645,0.05460359557463204,0.8163891434669495,0.8394078474778396,0.1170018281535649,0.0712979890310786,0.08957952468007313,0.2870201096892139,0.14442413162705667,0.03473491773308958,0.04753199268738574,0.08226691042047532,0.029250457038391225,0.02010968921389397,0.03473491773308958,0.014625228519195612,True,202.0,0.8427787934186471,4.581352833638026,547.0,0.0,0.03473132372214941,0.020314547837483616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01310615989515072,0.01834862385321101,0.017693315858453473,0.009140767824497258,44.16180459770118,14.784344827586207,14.929297964441105,17.89057471264368,18.62205459770115,13.93568965517241,64.76954022988505,10.466666666666667,14.880690115684164,2901359.8988591167,5304.131442155606,5.219827586206897,4.0,2.873623203396902,30.933333333333334,25.0,12.449721103524992,1.5517241379310345,1.0,0.8768559389621663,464,240,0.5172413793103449,2506,15,71
"Human body is composed of 30 x 10 ^ 12 eukaryote cells governing multiple and coordinated functions [ REF ] . Although endowed with very diverse and specific functions , the origin and development of eukaryotic cells is one of the most enigmatic processes of evolution . A crucial event in this process was the emergence of the mitochondria , the energy - generating organelles specific to eukaryotic cells . These organelles are thought to have begun to form when a bacterial cell related to the alpha - proteobacteria began living inside an archaeal host cell , of the phylum Lokiarcheaeota [ REF ] . This event resulted in one organism living inside another ( endosymbiosis ) and was beneficial to both protagonists , who aligned their interests and evolved in synergy , thus becoming evolutionarily stable [ REF ] . This prolonged partnership and associated coevolution have thus led to the formation of the eukaryotic cell as we know it today which constitutes the main element of animals , plants , fungi , and protists . This symbiotic event occurred billion years ago [ REF ] and this is the first of a long series . All plants and animals are home to symbiotic microorganisms whose interactions on the host can be neutral ( commensalism ) , harmful ( parasitism ) or have beneficial effects ( mutualism ) . These interactions are an integral part of coevolution and dynamically change from one to the other along a continuum depending on exterior and host factors [ REF ] . In the human body , viruses , bacteria , archaea , nanoarchaea , and eukaryotic microbes ( fungi , protozoan , and parasitic helminths ) constitute these symbiotic microorganisms and together form the microbiota . The number of microbial cells is roughly equal to the number of human cells ( about 40 x 10 ^ 12 microbial cells ) but their gene count exceeds the human genome ’s gene count by ~100 - fold [ REF ] . Host - microorganism interactions occur daily and take place in the skin and genital , respiratory ( from the nose to the lung ) and gastrointestinal ( GI ) tracts , which contains , by far , the greatest density and diversity of microorganisms . Long considered to be sterile , microorganisms have also been detected in the urine outside of any clinicopathological situation [ REF].In human , ~97 % of total microbial cells are bacteria residing in colon and ~2 - 3 % are extracolonic bacteria residing in other body sites ( gut , skin , lungs , etc ) . Therefore , bacteria largely dominate the human microbiome , where only ~0.1 - 1 % are archaea , eukaryotic microbes and viruses in the GI tract [ REF ] . The microbiota symbiotically contributes to several functions such as trophism , metabolism , barrier function , immunological processes , and signaling to virtually all organs of the body [ REF].Beyond the beneficial homeostatic roles , a growing body of evidence suggests that microbes also influence states of health and disease including cancer . Indeed , the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies 11 microbial agents ( 7 viruses , 3 parasites , and 1 bacterium ) as group 1 human carcinogens and infection - induced cancer accounts for approximately 13 % of the global burden of all human cancers [ REF ] . Furthermore , it is now clear that microorganisms in the gut microbiota may also contribute to the carcinogenesis and prognosis of patients with cancer at the systemic level through mechanisms involving microbiota - derived metabolites , genotoxins and inflammation [ REF ] . Conversely , tumorigenesis can result from the contraction of anti - tumorigenic bacteria that release anti - proliferative metabolites . An endogenous strain of the mouse microbiota ( Faecalibaculum rodentium isolate PB1 ) and its human counterpart Holdemanella biformis belonging to the Erysipelotrichaceae family , which disappear during the early phases of colorectal tumorigenesis , produce short - fatty acids that block tumor cell proliferation by reducing activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells , cytoplasmic 3 ( NFATc3 ) and calcineurin [ REF ] .

"Primary liver cancer is currently the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer - related death worldwide , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) accounts for approximately 75%-85 % of liver cancer cases [ REF ] . Due to the tumor heterogeneity , tumor metastasis , and resistance to traditional chemotherapeutic agents , current treatment options such as surgical resection , radiofrequency ablation , neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy , and liver transplantation for HCC will only benefit a few percentages of patients , novel therapeutic modalities are urgently needed for patients with advanced or unresectable HCC [ REF].The crucial role of the immune system in suppressing the growth , proliferation , and progression of tumors is widely accepted [ REF ] . The immunotherapy of tumors mainly utilizes the host immune system to fight the tumor by regulating the host ’s own immune function or enhancing the immunogenicity of the tumors [ REF ] . HCC is considered to be inflammation - induced cancer , showing good sensitivity to immunotherapies [ REF ] . Immunotherapy strategies for HCC mainly include immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) , cell - based therapies , and tumor immune vaccines . Cytokines such as interferon also show certain anti - HCC effects [ REF ] . Checkpoint inhibitors are typically monoclonal antibodies that target programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) , programmed death - ligand 1 ( PD - L1 ) or cytotoxic T lymphocyte - associated antigen 4 ( CTLA-4 ) . PD-1 is a surface receptor highly expressed by activated T cells , B cells , dendritic cells ( DC ) , and natural killer cells ( NK ) which provides inhibitory signals to the immune system to modulate the activity of immune cells in peripheral tissues and keep T - cells from attacking normal cells in the body . The interaction between PD - L1 expressed on cancer cells and PD-1 is a key mediator of cancer immune escape , which leads to the suppression of anticancer immunity and the promotion of tumor progression [ REF ] . Immune checkpoints blockade with anti - PD-1 / PD - L1 antibodies have been successfully utilized in the treatment of various cancers such as melanoma [ REF ] , non – small cell lung cancer [ REF ] , bladder carcinoma [ REF ] , Hodgkin ’s lymphoma [ REF ] , and Merkel cell carcinoma [ REF ] . CTLA-4 , another important ICIs target , competitively inhibits the binding of the B7 ligand to the costimulatory receptor CD28 , resulting in decreased peripheral T - cell activity . Specific blocking of CTLA-4 can increase the T - cell infiltration of tumors and enhance the killing effect of the immune system on tumors [ REF ] . In addition , chimeric antigen receptor T cells ( CAR - T ) and other cell therapies as well as HCC tumor immune vaccines also show good effects and application prospects . However , the unique inhibitory tumor microenvironment ( TME ) of HCC and the genetic differences of the host make existing immunotherapies challenges . Compared to unprecedented and durable responses in these T cell - inflamed cancers , the objective response rates ( ORRs ) of PD-1 and PD - L1 blockade",3.340147487557455,0.473824737479251,0.4464586246904856,0.05451799713152238,0.776732759816306,0.7863730467282809,0.09041591320072333,0.059674502712477394,0.10849909584086799,0.2911392405063291,0.1844484629294756,0.034358047016274866,0.0216998191681736,0.07775768535262206,0.034358047016274866,0.0054249547920434,0.07414104882459313,0.009041591320072333,True,141.0,0.8010849909584087,4.694394213381555,553.0,0.0,0.010165184243964422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01905972045743329,0.026683608640406607,0.022871664548919948,0.009041591320072333,28.3960536912752,16.70179865771812,16.48601715928492,19.25780760626398,19.706912751677855,15.961073825503348,64.6993288590604,10.4,13.757213657921781,943369.8193143896,1705.912873986238,5.570469798657718,5.0,3.247966220076997,29.8,27.0,14.501494175888682,1.7516778523489933,1.0,1.020413831928455,447,229,0.5123042505592841,2596,15,73
"The global sustainable development goals of optimizing human and environmental health have accelerated interest in plant - based diets recently [ REF ] . Plant - based diets have been associated with a reduced risk of a wide range of noncommunicable diseases , including cardiovascular diseases , type 2 diabetes , and cancer [ REF ] . The FAO of the United Nations and the World Health Organisation recommend that a sustainable healthy diet is one that is predominantly plant - based , which “ includes whole grains , legumes , nuts and an abundance and variety of fruits and vegetables ” and “ can include moderate amounts of eggs , dairy , poultry and fish ; and small amounts of red meat ” [ REF ] . Thus , plant - based diets can be broadly defined as dietary patterns characterized by high intakes of foods of plant origin , such as fruits and vegetables , and lower intakes of foods of animal origin , such as red meat and dairy products [ REF].Research to date has used a variety of ways to assess the continuum of inclusion of plant- and animal - based foods and the different combinations of these foods that constitutes a plant - based diet [ REF ] . Traditionally many studies have investigated the healthiness of diet type classifications , such as a vegan diet , where there is complete elimination of animal products , or a vegetarian diet , where dairy and eggs may still be consumed [ REF ] . This results in binary classifications of study populations based on whether participants consume animal foods [ REF ] . However , the foods that constitute a plant - based dietary pattern may be better described along a continuum with varying degrees of inclusion and exclusion of animal foods , such as in a flexitarian diet [ REF ] . Hence , more recently , an increasing number of studies have used diet quality indices to characterize and score a plant - based diet [ REF].Diet quality indices assess the quality and variety of foods in the diet on the basis of prior knowledge , including dietary guidelines and cultural ways of eating , and create a composite score reflecting compliance with the prespecified criteria [ REF ] . Several diet quality indices reflect a plant - based diet . For example , the Healthy Nordic Food Index has a strong plant - based focus and scores diets based on 6 components typically consumed as part of a traditional Nordic diet [ REF ] . However , more recently , specific plant - based diet quality indices have been developed to capture the continuum of plant and animal foods consumed . For example , the provegetarian food pattern by Martínez - González et al . [ REF ] positively scores 7 plant - based foods and negatively scores 5 animal - based foods . In addition to this , to acknowledge that not all plant - based foods are beneficial for health , Satija et al . [ REF ] created a series of plant - based indices to differentiate between healthy plant - based foods such as whole grains , and less healthy plant - based foods such as sugar - sweetened beverages . As such , these indices reflect an overall plant - based diet ( PDI ) , a healthful plant - based diet ( hPDI ) , and an unhealthful plant - based diet ( uPDI ) [ REF ] . With many new plant - based diet quality indices being developed , and increasing research examining their associations with health outcomes , it is imperative that these indices are reviewed . Therefore , this scoping review aimed to identify and critically evaluate diet quality indices used for assessing plant - based diets among adult populations , examining their basis for development , construction methodology , and validity . This synthesis will enable future studies to select the most suitable index for their research question and to inform this field of research going forward .",3.131096329228524,0.7151712917414533,0.45554525394235224,0.0633998095030742,0.7573165419070345,0.7472660831279225,0.09037900874635568,0.06559766763848396,0.07871720116618076,0.2755102040816326,0.17201166180758018,0.043731778425655975,0.03206997084548105,0.119533527696793,0.03206997084548105,0.014577259475218658,0.04518950437317784,0.013119533527696793,True,214.0,0.8221574344023324,4.52332361516035,686.0,0.0,0.10454065469904963,0.06599788806758183,0.018479408658922915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04065469904963041,0.06520591341077085,0.02375923970432946,0.008746355685131196,47.08752112676058,13.74691549295775,14.696529576185021,17.134647887323947,17.522376760563382,14.058802816901405,58.153521126760566,8.45,17.560689662416088,42316585.62902578,61685.98488196178,5.255281690140845,5.0,2.824061652376823,28.4,25.5,17.513994404475525,1.5475352112676057,1.0,0.8967042053312553,568,240,0.4225352112676056,3103,20,74
"The eye has been at the forefront of innovative genetic therapies due to its relative accessibility , ease of drug administration that precludes systemic administration of therapeutics as well as the availability of functional outcome measures for therapeutic evaluation . Inherited retinal diseases ( IRDs ) in particular have been at the forefront of diseases for which gene therapies are currently being developed . There is an imperative need for therapies to cure IRDs : they have a world - wide prevalence of about 1 in 2000 , affect more than two million people and cause significant economic as well as and psychological burden [ REF ] . While gene replacement therapy has proven to be a safe and effective therapy for IRDs , with an approved treatment for RPE-65 - associated IRD now available and others being evaluated in clinical trial [ REF ] , an unmet therapeutic need remains for genes too large to fit into the 4.7 kB packaging constraints of an Adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) ( e.g. , ABCA4 or USH2A ) , the gold standard delivery vehicle for most gene replacement therapies , or genes that are expressed as multiple isoforms in the human retina ( e.g. , CRB1 ) [ REF].RNA therapeutics work by reversibly changing the transcriptomic sequence without inducing permanent genomic changes , thus eschewing the risk of udesired , permanent genomic off - target effects of DNA editing techniques [ REF ] . RNA therapeutics can broadly be classified into antisense oligonucleotides ( ASOs ) , RNA interference ( RNAi ) and RNA editing therapies . ASOs are currently under clinical investigation for treatment of several IRDs , such as CEP290- and USH2A - associated IRDs [ REF ] . RNAi therapeutics for IRDs are being developed in preclinical stages with the primary therapeutic target of autosomal dominant RP ( adRP ) , where a dual RNAi suppression strategy using artificial mirtrons , atypical RNA interference effectors spliced from transcripts as short introns , is coupled with a gene replacement strategy [ REF ] . For a comprehensive review on RNA therapeutics and their use in the eye the review by Kumar et al . ( 2022 ) is recommended . The third RNA therapeutic is RNA editing , which is derived from an essential post - transcriptional modification in humans . The most common form of RNA editing in humans involves the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine ( A ) to inosine ( I ) at the C6 position ( A - to - I editing ) by a family of enzymes aptly named Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA ( ADARs ) [ REF ] . The catalytically active ADAR enzymes , ADAR1 and ADAR2 , share a C - terminal deaminase domain ( ADARDD ) and have multiple double stranded RNA binding domains ( dsRBD ) , with which they bind to double stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) and edit tens of thousands to millions of sites in the human transcriptome [ REF ] . When A - to - I deamination takes place in coding sequences , inosine is biochemically read as guanine by the translational and splicing machinery due to their structural similarity and inosine is paired with cytosine during translation [ REF ] . While only the minority of A - to - I editing takes place in coding sequences , it is a powerful and essential tool for proteome diversification , particularly in neurons , where A - to - I editing mediated protein recoding modulates receptor and ion channel properties [ REF ] . RNA editing harnesses ADAR ’s recoding ability and uses it as a programmable tool to correct pathogenic single nucleotide variants ( SNVs).Therapeutic RNA editing can broadly be divided into approaches utilising exogenous or endogenous ADAR as catalytically active deamination effectors . The first strategy facilitates editing by overexpression of the either full - length ADAR protein or , more commonly , overexpression of the catalytically active deaminase domain fused to an intermediate RNA binding protein such as deactivated Cas13b ( dCas13b ) [ REF ] . The second strategy aims to harness the cell ’s native , endogenously expressed ADAR enzymes and recruit these for deamination . Both exogenous and endogenous ADAR editing approaches require a programmable guide RNA ( gRNA ) that is antisense to the target sequence and marks the target adenosine with an",2.9009914478127286,0.9902377412283345,0.4817143024565221,0.05140498049931793,0.6504949868509644,0.6545672362877263,0.12195121951219512,0.05962059620596206,0.1016260162601626,0.26422764227642276,0.15718157181571815,0.032520325203252036,0.03523035230352303,0.08807588075880758,0.036585365853658534,0.028455284552845527,0.04742547425474255,0.009485094850948509,True,246.0,0.8373983739837398,4.749322493224932,738.0,0.0,0.06247053276756247,0.035596416784535595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011786892975011787,0.0165016501650165,0.019094766619519095,0.03523035230352303,33.67911093247591,16.287874598070744,16.52667757954773,19.513954983922833,19.7826848874598,15.285723472668806,66.63054662379422,11.05,17.25738969516783,31245617.839192875,42338.23555446189,5.448553054662379,4.0,3.2366107321936504,31.1,31.5,23.78213615300358,1.6736334405144695,1.0,0.9909133696487362,622,309,0.4967845659163987,3505,20,75
"Circadian rhythm , which runs for approximately 24 h , is present in all animate beings and acts as a regulatory mechanism that promotes optimal adaptation to various biological activities , including not only sleep and wakefulness but also various biological activities such as feeding , reproduction , and social activities [ REF ] . Normally , when circadian rhythms are synchronized with the light – dark cycle of the external world , melatonin is secreted as light exposure diminishes during the night and sleep is initiated during the downward phase of the core body temperature ( CBT ) . Among the circadian rhythm markers , dim light melatonin onset ( DLMO ) and CBT rhythms show a phase relationship with the 24 - h cycle . The relationship between the circadian rhythm markers ( i.e. , DLMO or CBT rhythm ) and sleep timing ( i.e. , sleep onset or offset ) is called the “ phase angle ” of circadian entrainment . Both Earth ’s rotation and social activity rhythms run on the 24 - h cycle , but the endogenous circadian rhythm in humans may be typically a little longer than 24 h. The length of the intrinsic circadian period is called “ tau . ” Although the length of tau varies from individual to individual , the mean period of tau is reported to be 24.15 h ( standard deviation 0.2 h ) [ REF ] , with the length of tau of women being approximately 6 min shorter than that of men [ REF ] . Endogenous circadian rhythms are entrained to follow a 24 - h cycle of the external world by various zeitgebers , which are the external factors that serve as cues for entrainment . Among these , light stimulation at a certain time of the day alters the firing rate of neurons in the brain ’s suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ; the command center of the circadian clock ) , activates the molecular signaling pathway , and alters the transcription of clock genes that determine the phase of the circadian cycle by regulating the rhythm of endogenous melatonin secretion [ REF ] . The effect of circadian phase resetting through melatonin and photic stimulation in the SCN follows the phase - response curve ( PRC ) . In the PRC , if light is applied before the minimal point of CBT ( CBTmin ) appears , the melatonin secretion phase is likely to be delayed , whereas if light is applied after CBTmin , the phase is likely to advance [ REF ] . In a normal lifestyle , evening light delays the circadian clock by delaying the sleep onset timing , whereas morning light advances the circadian clock . Light exposure is the most important entrainment factor , but other zeitgebers , such as exercise , mealtime , and social activities also contribute to circadian rhythm entrainment . However , the entrainment ability of these factors is weaker than that of light [ REF].Many adolescents and young adults worldwide exhibit a delayed sleep pattern , which can be considered a disorder when it significantly affects important areas of an individual ’s functioning . Delayed Sleep – Wake Phase Disorder ( DSWPD ) [ REF ] is a circadian rhythm disorder in which the delay of sleep phase causes difficulty in falling asleep and waking up at a desired time , resulting in daytime dysfunction . This disorder is associated with multiple factors including specific biological traits , socio - psychological backgrounds , sleep hygiene problems , and comorbid psychiatric diseases . DSWPD is prevalent during adolescence and young adulthood . The establishment of treatment strategies against this disorder is therefore important because the incidence of DSWPD during these critical developmental stages can damage an individual",2.9467478794059887,0.5180086175278137,0.46766337740053854,0.07861858130594325,0.7439180067222979,0.7458113388103598,0.10551181102362205,0.09921259842519685,0.12125984251968504,0.25354330708661416,0.14488188976377953,0.029921259842519685,0.04251968503937008,0.07559055118110236,0.02047244094488189,0.015748031496062992,0.047244094488188976,0.012598425196850394,True,217.0,0.84251968503937,4.694488188976378,635.0,0.0,0.02378976486860304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011618257261410789,0.011618257261410789,0.00995850622406639,0.015748031496062992,39.47598720558304,14.853027042744987,16.300405474201746,18.871726277018514,17.918755452166323,14.448471454880295,61.17563245129398,9.31578947368421,17.30379151390847,32729635.63304835,51542.733280391105,5.320441988950276,5.0,2.911918448305397,28.57894736842105,25.0,12.7869826467293,1.6353591160220995,1.0,0.9840356498471592,543,243,0.44751381215469616,2981,19,76
"Cardiomyopathies are disorders of the myocardium caused by genetic and environmental factors that eventually result in impaired cardiac function and heart failure [ REF ] . Depending on the specific effects in the function and morphology of the heart , and the isolated presence of arrhythmias , cardiomyopathies are divided into dilated , hypertrophic , restrictive , and arrhythmogenic [ REF ] . Dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) is the most common cardiomyopathy affecting 1 in 250 individuals , followed by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) , which affects 1 in 500 , and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy ( ACM ) encountered 1 in 5,000 , while the prevalence of restrictive cardiomyopathy is even less common [ REF ] . About 30%–50 % of cardiomyopathies are heritable , and the different types can have variable phenotypes , prognosis and causal mutations [ REF ] . HCM is primarily a disease of the sarcomere , as in up to 60 % of patients , a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant is detected in sarcomeric genes [ REF ] . Beta - myosin heavy chain ( MYH7 ) and myosin binding protein C3 ( MYBPC3 ) are the most frequently affected genes , encoding for proteins of the thick sarcomeric filaments , and patients tend to exhibit disease onset in their forties . Other commonly affected genes in the thin filaments of the sarcomere are cardiac Troponin I ( TNNI3 ) and cardiac Troponin T ( TNNT2 ) [ REF ] . In contrast to HCM , the causative genes in DCM are functionally diverse . Titin ( TTN ) mutations represent 12%–25 % of DCM patients and Lamin ( LMNA ) genetic variants represent the second most common mutations in DCM patients [ REF ] . Other genes that are associated with DCM are MYH7 , TNNT2 , Tropomyosin 1 ( TPM1 ) , Desmoplakin ( DSP ) , RNA binding motif protein 20 ( RBM20 ) , and sodium voltage - gated channel alpha subunit 5 ( SCN5A ) [ REF ] . In arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy ( ACM ) , most pathogenic variants are in genes encoding desmosomal proteins such as Plakoglobin ( JUP ) [ REF ] , DSP [ REF ] , Plakophilin-2 ( PKP2 ) , Desmoglein-2 ( DSG2 ) and Desmocollin-2 ( DSC2 ) [ REF ] . Finally , inherited restrictive cardiomyopathies are caused by mutations in sarcomeric genes such as cardiac troponin I , and less commonly by mutations in Desmin ( DES ) and Filamin C ( FLNC ) [ REF ] . It is worth noting that although cardiomyopathies are classified based on phenotypes manifested in the general population , the pathogenic mechanisms and phenotypic features among the various types of cardiomyopathies can overlap to a significant degree . With the advancement of next generation sequencing and genome wide association studies ( GWAS ) , our understanding of the genetic basis of cardiomyopathies has significantly improved . Multiple GWAS have identified susceptibility loci and variants associated with different types of cardiomyopathies [ REF ] . Most rare disease causal variants have been found within the coding region of the genome [ REF ] . For example , TTN coding variants usually lead to gene truncations and are viewed as the leading genetic causes in DCM patients [ REF ] . Contrarily , MYBPC3 truncating and MYH7 missense variants are the most pathogenic HCM mutations detected in next generation sequencing research studies [ REF ] . Although definitive causative genetic mutations have been identified for familial cardiomyopathies , in over half of the cases targeted genetic screening tests do not identify a contributing variant . This is because most of the current clinical genetic",2.816239648217934,1.0401318316912105,0.48523429748189484,0.061526909313879594,0.6374021243789921,0.6985133974389597,0.10016155088852989,0.048465266558966075,0.10662358642972536,0.1987075928917609,0.20516962843295639,0.035541195476575124,0.045234248788368334,0.07269789983844911,0.033925686591276254,0.012924071082390954,0.10823909531502424,0.004846526655896607,True,178.0,0.7705977382875606,4.7140549273021,619.0,0.0,0.04949095022624434,0.022058823529411766,0.01414027149321267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02262443438914027,0.03167420814479638,0.035633484162895926,0.0420032310177706,36.504068251533766,13.229460633946832,15.359359093739592,17.14795501022495,15.611242331288345,16.27165644171779,58.820807770961146,7.833333333333333,16.37275142512877,12900174.870964855,20840.347125952914,5.701431492842536,5.0,3.4339841932630963,20.375,21.5,10.633330067920083,1.768916155419223,1.0,1.0458678313139995,489,231,0.4723926380368098,2918,24,77
"Transactional sex is casual sex between two people to receive material incentives in exchange for sexual favors . Transactional sex is associated with negative consequences , which increase the risk of sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV / AIDS , unintended pregnancy , unsafe abortion , and physiological trauma . In Sub - Saharan Africa , several primary studies have been conducted in various countries to examine the prevalence and associated factors of transactional sex among women . These studies had great discrepancies and inconsistent results . Hence , this systematic review and meta - analysis aimed to synthesize the pooled prevalence of the practice of transactional sex among women and its associated factors in Sub - Saharan Africa . Transactional sex is defined as a sexual act ( s ) that is structured by the implicit assumption that sex is exchanged for a variety of instrumental supports such as educational expenses , transportation , a place to sleep , clothing , material items , or money . It reveals that socioeconomic factors have a great role in establishing exchange - based sexual relationships in many countries with high HIV prevalence . Commonly , in many countries , men provide and women receive material rewards [ REF].Globally , an estimated 36.7 million individuals worldwide were infected with the Hunan Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) epidemic . Young people in sub - Saharan Africa ( SSA ) are more threatened by the HIV epidemic than young people elsewhere . In total , there were 2.1 million new HIV infections worldwide , with 1.1 million occurring in sub - Saharan Africa [ REF ] . HIV infection deaths mainly affect the young and productive segments of the community . Among newly infected people in SSA , 40 % belong to the age group of 15–24 years , and more than 60 % of these infections occurred among young girls [ REF].Significant proportions of females have multiple concurrent sexual relationships and engage in risky sex . Because of their risky sexual * practices * , the girls and their sexual partners , including schoolmates , are at risk of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) [ REF ] . Among HIV - infected young people in the world , 63 % lived in sub - Saharan Africa , and among these , 59 % were female . Unprotected sex also puts women at risk of unintended pregnancy , which leads to unsafe abortions [ REF ] . Sex motivated by financial gain is a serious public health issue , particularly in sub - Saharan Africa [ REF].Assessing transactional relationships is still an important aspect of HIV prevention initiatives [ REF ] . Individual behaviours that harm people ’s chances of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) and unwanted pregnancies were identified . Among these identified risk behaviours , transactional sex ( sex in exchange for money , gifts , benefits , or other monetary rewards ) is the main one [ REF ] . The infection rate of STIs , including HIV , among young women aged 15 to 24 years old , is greater than that of young males ( 3.6 to 1 ratio ) [ REF ] . Early sexual activity , early pregnancy , unsafe",2.5305592609843077,0.6713400788071324,0.4905823178474887,0.05680270476976185,0.6868122699005264,0.7402779273688793,0.10909090909090909,0.045454545454545456,0.14181818181818182,0.23272727272727273,0.1709090909090909,0.02727272727272727,0.02909090909090909,0.08727272727272728,0.02909090909090909,0.02,0.05818181818181818,0.012727272727272728,True,157.0,0.7963636363636364,4.714545454545455,550.0,0.0,0.05792488860598345,0.015913430935709738,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01718650541056652,0.030553787396562698,0.01718650541056652,0.005454545454545455,46.201636363636396,11.89660606060606,14.291902434058311,15.64848484848485,14.890672727272722,15.328088888888889,54.01010101010101,6.863636363636363,14.20879662255446,1481842.2312939016,2694.258602352548,5.54,5.0,3.1190383133267217,20.454545454545453,21.0,10.22353467040753,1.6533333333333333,1.0,0.9751581068387493,450,219,0.4866666666666667,2593,22,78
"Diabetes is becoming an increasingly serious global public health issue . The International Diabetes Federation ( IDF ) shows that patients with diabetes mellitus are on the rapid rise worldwide , and the number of patients with diabetes worldwide is expected to reach 783 million by 2045 [ REF ] . An epidemiological investigation exhibited that the estimated prevalence of diabetes in China in 2018 was 12.4 % , and only 50.1 % of treated diabetic patients were adequately controlled [ REF ] . People living with diabetes are at risk of developing several serious and life - threatening complications , leading to an increased need for medical care , reduced quality of life , and undue stress on families [ REF ] . Diabetes and its complications , if not well managed , can lead to frequent hospital admissions and premature death [ REF ] . Despite the emergence of new antidiabetic drugs , the glycemic control achieved is far from perfect , and some drugs may cause adverse events and increase cardiovascular disease as well as ineffectively improve the clinical symptoms [ REF].Therefore , there is an urgent need for new drugs that are effective with minimal side effects and favorable hypoglycemic effects , as well as relieving clinical symptoms . Traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) has been applied in the treatment of diabetes for thousands of years . In recent years , TCM has made significant progress in modernization and globalization . Jinlida granule is a Chinese patent medicine composed of 17 Chinese herbs ( Ginseng , rhizoma polygonati , rhizoma atractylodis lanceae , sophorae flavescentis , ophiopogon japonicus , rehmanniae , polygoni multiflori , dogwood , poria perrin , eupatorium , coptis chinensis , anemarrhena , epimedium , salvia , puerariae , semen litchi , and cortex lycii radices ) . It was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration ( CFDA ) as a treatment drug for type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) in 2005 ( National Drug Approval No . Z20050845 ) and has been widely used in clinical practice [ REF ] . In the previous work , our research team conducted a randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Jinlida in T2D with a sample size of 192 subjects who received the Jinlida or placebo for 12 weeks based on using metformin . Our results showed that glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) was reduced more significantly in the Jinlida group [ REF ] . Furthermore , meta - analysis and systematic reviews of Jinlida granules showed significant reductions in fasting blood glucose ( FBG ) , 2 - h postprandial blood glucose ( 2hPG ) , and HbA1c [ REF ] . Animal experiments show that Jinlida granules could promote the thermogenesis of brown and beige adipocytes by enhancing the mitochondrial function and inhibiting the expression of miR-27a , thereby improving the metabolism of glucose and lipids [ REF ] . Jinlida granules could also reduce insulin resistance in rats fed with high fat by regulating phosphorylation of c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) and p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) [ REF ] . However , as previously reported , current studies in Jinlida put more emphasis on the effect of blood glucose levels and their potential mechanisms and largely ignore the role of improving clinical symptoms in T2D.Though the efficacy and safety of Jinlida , as well as its potential action mechanisms , were elucidated , the role of improving clinical symptoms in Jinlida has yet to be studied . Hence , in this work , we conducted a secondary analysis based on the previous randomized controlled trial",3.0850460424208497,0.7788790984033839,0.45140653712791373,0.05896644626323839,0.6967878151271079,0.664745631025118,0.10256410256410256,0.052884615384615384,0.09294871794871795,0.21794871794871795,0.16987179487179488,0.038461538461538464,0.035256410256410256,0.08974358974358974,0.041666666666666664,0.016025641025641024,0.10096153846153846,0.00641025641025641,True,191.0,0.8092948717948718,4.774038461538462,624.0,0.0,0.0421987784564131,0.0421987784564131,0.023320377568017768,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01249305941143809,0.017490283176013324,0.022487506940588563,0.05448717948717949,34.006946144430856,15.26281925744594,16.812101805928865,19.31277029783762,18.35516829865361,15.826124031007744,67.27417380660955,10.894736842105264,16.35108946917908,12623736.755877597,20230.347365188456,5.563953488372093,5.0,3.0477115365860614,27.157894736842106,26.0,15.865431332218506,1.7170542635658914,1.0,0.9948412697984664,516,296,0.5736434108527132,2979,19,79
"In 2017 , the African Union committed to “ Harnessing the Demographic Dividend Through Investments in Youth ” , prompting leaders across the continent to develop multisectoral policy roadmaps and action plans for attaining the demographic dividend [ REF ] . The demographic dividend presents countries with the opportunity to accelerate economic growth and maximize per capita gains [ REF ] . These benefits come to fruition because of a demographic transition initiated by declines in national fertility and infant and child mortality rates . These changes work in tandem to modify the population age structure , limiting the number of child dependents and increasing the number of working age adults , resulting in a lowered dependency ratio and a larger labor force [ REF ] . With a larger workforce , countries have the potential to boost their economic output and work to impart social and economic change . However , the demographic transition and subsequent dividends in economic growth are not automatic . Indeed the extent to which countries benefit from this demographic transition is highly dependent on the existence of policies that establish optimal conditions for capturing the full returns of the demographic dividend [ REF ] . Moreover , countries have a limited window of opportunity to act on maximizing the potential of the demographic dividend . Reher [ REF ] estimated the window of opportunity was open for 100 years for Spain and Sweden and only 10 to 30 years for a subset of developing countries . Eventually , the demographic age structure will shift again when the increased adult population ages and enters an older , less - productive cohort that relies on their savings and retirement funds [ REF ] . In conjunction with smaller birth cohorts due to fertility declines , the dependency ratio will subsequently rise again , but will be characterized by the need to care for elderly populations . Evidence suggests that ensuring demographic dividend - favorable policies are in place , preferably before entering the demographic transition , can assist countries to fully harness the benefits of the demographic transition . However , most of this evidence comes from Southeast Asian and European countries with limited knowledge from African countries [ REF].Bloom and colleagues have previously described that investments in health , education , and the labor - market are key to capitalizing on the demographic transition [ REF ] . More specifically , key policy areas should : expand family planning and reproductive health to facilitate rapid fertility declines ; improve maternal and child health and nutrition to reduce child mortality ; increase educational attainment to facilitate a strong labor force and productivity ; and invest in the labor and economic sectors to promote job creation and economic growth [ REF ] . Less well - documented are the specific policy investments and strategies that countries should enact to create a demographic dividend - favorable environment . The Population Reference Bureau ( PRB ) recently conducted a literature review to identify specific policy inputs conducive to achieving the demographic dividend [ REF ] . This review provided evidence that policy interventions like legalizing contraception , establishing family planning service delivery and outreach , investing in disease prevention and public health , offering free public education , reinvesting gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in working - age populations , developing open trade policies , and encouraging foreign direct investment , among others , can facilitate attainment of the demographic dividend . Similarly , the World Bank reviewed policy documents for policies that would catalyze and accelerate a demographic transition among eight West African countries [ REF ] . Their review documented achievements and opportunities for improvement in allocating financial resources , stakeholder support , institutional building and strengthening , and results monitoring to fast - track the demographic dividend . Although knowledge of evidence - based policies to realize the demographic dividend exists , the extent to which they are incorporated into national planning is not well understood . Discerning the degree to which these policies are embedded within policy frameworks requires a comprehensive review of the national policy landscape . This intensive process can be accomplished through an exhaustive review of national strategic frameworks and sector - specific policy documents . However , the scope and relevance of these policies may vary depending on which phase of the demographic transition a country is experiencing . For instance , most countries in sub - Saharan Africa are in the pre - demographic dividend phase , with total fertility rate ( TFR ) greater than four children per woman , or the early - demographic dividend phase , whereby TFR is below four children [ REF].Evidence suggests that pre - dividend countries should prioritize human development outcomes , with a goal towards accelerating the fertility decline , creating a population age structure with fewer dependents , and assisting a growing proportion of the population that is working age to develop the necessary skills to enter the labor market in the future . Conversely , early - dividend countries should prioritize accelerating job creation to ensure that the growing share of the working - age population remains employed to promote economic growth . The labor market must develop productive jobs to appropriately match",3.286678144151066,0.8574316277620335,0.4401205188850526,0.06104149659795545,0.8958916783332824,0.8866231913367907,0.09152542372881356,0.08587570621468926,0.1096045197740113,0.2745762711864407,0.12542372881355932,0.04067796610169491,0.03389830508474576,0.11864406779661017,0.02711864406779661,0.013559322033898305,0.031638418079096044,0.02937853107344633,True,291.0,0.8677966101694915,5.293785310734464,885.0,0.0,0.05315137367570479,0.018315676063925302,0.018315676063925302,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.035015263063386606,0.012569581612497755,0.014544801580175975,0.003389830508474576,29.085649661219634,16.578860103626948,17.693802365651003,20.633399760860904,21.310091669988047,18.026113989637306,70.62495017935433,12.153846153846153,23.93191808838009,24745712741.237644,27961257.334731802,5.922279792746114,6.0,3.0299320234608795,29.692307692307693,26.0,16.10725882893326,1.744818652849741,1.0,0.9499995054616922,772,353,0.4572538860103627,4685,26,80
"Breast cancer ( BC ) is the second leading cause of cancer death in women . Data from WHO ( World Health Organization ) reported about 2.3 million new cases and about 685,000 deaths from BC globally [ REF ] . Similarly , American Cancer Society ’s projections for BC incidence in the United States in 2023 ( https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html ) , estimate about 297,790 new cases of invasive BC in women , about 55,720 new diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) , and about 43,700 death from this disease . The same statistics indicate for 2023 more than 3.8 million BC survivors in the United States , and 7.8 million worldwide , including both patients currently being treated and making this type of cancer the most prevalent worldwide . The median age at the time of diagnosis is 62 years and a woman ’s lifetime risk of acquiring breast cancer in the United States is around 13 % , with incidence rates rising by 0.5 % annually in recent years . Currently , a woman ’s chance of dying from BC is around 2.5 % , death rates have been decreased due to improved therapeutic regimens , as well as earlier BC detection through screening programs and increased awareness . However , in recent years , the trend has marginally halted . The breast cancer mass is composed not only by epithelial cancer cells , but also by a plethora of heterogeneous populations coming from the host , including endothelial cells , stromal fibroblasts , and a variety of immune cells that form the so - called tumor microenvironment ( TME ) [ REF ] . The TME is a highly complex biological community embedded in a composite matrix of structural proteins constituting the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , in which immune cells ( including macrophages , polymorphonuclear cells , mast cells , natural killer cells , dendritic cells ( DCs ) , and T and B lymphocytes ) and non - immune cells ( such as endothelial cells and stromal cells ) establish subtle interactions with cancer cells . This cellular cross - talk is based on the production of specific soluble ( growth factors and cytokines ) and insoluble ( ECM proteins ) molecules , and it determines the tumor ’s natural history . BC comprises numerous subtypes that differ genetically , pathologically , and clinically . Indeed , it is currently considered a group of neoplasms originating from mammary gland epithelial cells caused by a variety of genetic alterations , with different disease courses , responses to treatments , and clinical outcomes . This was best exemplified by next - generation sequencing studies depicting comprehensive molecular BC portraits in Cancer Genome Atlas [ REF ] and identifying more than 1600 likely driver mutations in 93 BC genes [ REF ] . BC can have distinct molecular profiles from one another , leading to a complex heterogeneity of tumor cell subpopulations within single tumors , between primary tumors and their metastasis , or between independent metastasis , as a consequence of tumor clonal evolution [ REF ] .

"Arachis hypogaea ( peanut or groundnut ) is among the most important oil and food legumes with annual production of ~46 million tons ( http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home ) . It is cultivated in more than 100 countries around the world in tropical and subtropical regions , and is the principal source of digestible protein , cooking oil and vitamins in development and developing regions of Asia , Africa and America for fighting malnutrition and ensuring food security [ REF ] . Productivity levels of peanut in most of the developing countries have remained low due to several production constraints which include biotic and abiotic stresses . Breeding new cultivars to improve productivity is the best way to meet the needs of the producers , consumers and industry . As an allotetraploid species in the Arachis genus , peanut has extremely low genetic diversity because most of the other species in the genus are diploid [ REF ] . Peanut is particularly susceptible to a number of pest and pathogens due in part to the lack of gene exchange with its diploid wild ancestors that have resistance genes [ REF ] . The limited genetic diversity and the tetraploid complexity of cultivated gene pool is a barrier and challenge to create cultivars with broad resistance , excellent quality and high yield [ REF ] . On the other hand , diploid wild relatives ( Arachis spp . ) with a larger genetic diversity evolving in a variety of habitats and biotic challenges are significant sources of resistance genes and a rich source of novel alleles that can be introduced into the cultivated species by unconventional method [ REF ] . Therefore , there is an urgent need to exploit gene resources in diploid species by using Omics methods . Plant genome research has facilitated gene discovery and gene functional elucidation . With Omics , scientists can manage the intricate global biological systems based on advances in Omics technology [ REF ] . Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have promoted the rapid development of science and made any other new applications beyond genome sequencing possible [ REF ] . Particularly , the emergence of next - generation sequencing makes whole - genome resequencing for variant discovery , transcriptional regulatory networks analysis , RNA sequencing analysis ( RNA - seq ) for transcriptome and noncoding RNAome , quantitative detection analysis ( Chip - seq ) for epigenome dynamics and DNA - protein interactions become viable applications [ REF ] . Other techniques , including interactomic analysis for protein - protein interactions , hormonomic analysis for plant hormone signaling , and metabolomic analysis of metabolic products , have been developed [ REF ] . The omics technologies will help researchers to mine and screen specific genes involved in crop improvement . In addition , integrated network analysis reveals molecular connections between genes and metabolites , boots our understanding the relationships between phenotypic and genotype [ REF ] . Over the past few decades , advances in genomics , transcriptomics , metabolomics , and proteomic analysis with the development of cutting - edge technologies have greatly facilitated the increase in the study of molecular aspects of peanut - biotic factor interactions . Therefore , different omics - based studies have attempted to decipher the molecular pathways that contribute to crop defenses against diseases and pests .

In 2010 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) reported 153 million cases of non - typhoidal Salmonella ( NTS ) enteric infections worldwide , of which 56 969 were fatal and 50 % were foodborne [ REF ] . Salmonella was the second foodborne epidemic in some regions ’ illness monitoring reports from 2006 to 2010 [ REF ] . Among the 2600 Salmonella serotypes discovered , NTS serovars such as Typhimurium and Enteritidis are the most common worldwide [ REF ] . Poultry has been identified as the one cause of human salmonellosis , and avian salmonellosis affects the poultry business and can infect humans when infected poultry meat and eggs are consumed [ REF ] . Eggs are the principal source of salmonellosis and other foodborne illnesses [ REF ] . Salmonella that grows in animal farms may contaminate eggs and meat during the slaughtering process before being transmitted to people via the food chain . Indeed , multiple earlier investigations have reported the isolation of Salmonella from animal and human diets [ REF ] . Human S. Enteritidis is commonly associated with the intake of infected eggs and chicken meat , whereas S. Typhimurium is commonly associated with the consumption of pork , poultry and beef [ REF ] . In addition , Salmonella enterica serovars have been found in varying concentrations in animal products and by - products worldwide [ REF ] . The most often - reported serovars connected with human foodborne diseases are Salmonella Typhimurium and Enteritidis [ REF ] . However , untyped Salmonella of animal origin is becoming more common in Bangladesh [ REF ] . However , domestic chickens in developing countries live close to humans in urban and rural communities and are frequently housed overnight in the family home [ REF ] . As soon as a chicken becomes infected , it sheds faeces into the environment . Additionally , interacting with employees in poultry farms and slaughterhouses , the main route of human Salmonella infections , involves contaminated meat and eggs [ REF ] . One of the primary reasons for animal management is the risk of antimicrobial resistance ( AMR ) in humans and animals [ REF ] . AMR is a worldwide public health issue [ REF ] . AMR can be caused by one of three fundamental processes : ( i ) antibiotic modification by lowering absorption or enhancing efflux of the antibiotic via their enzymes ; ( ii ) alteration in the antibiotic 's target site and ( iii ) gaining the capacity to break or change the antibiotic [ REF ] . Several lines of evidence showed that using antimicrobial agents in food animals contributes to the emergence and spread of AMR in foodborne Salmonella [ REF ] . AMR has recently been a significant issue in treating Salmonella infections [ REF ] . Salmonella infections in food animals are essential in public health and , in particular , food safety because food products of animal origin are thought to be the most common source of human Salmonella infections [ REF ] . Contamination by healthy food handlers is also assessed during food processing . In recent years , it has been estimated that animals and their products can account for up to 96 % of all Salmonella infections in humans [ REF ]",3.0678059195080287,0.5705479951724565,0.47431190516020627,0.042075172579023955,0.7862580201842568,0.7985364368983677,0.11317567567567567,0.05067567567567568,0.07094594594594594,0.22635135135135134,0.16722972972972974,0.04054054054054054,0.057432432432432436,0.07263513513513513,0.04054054054054054,0.013513513513513514,0.09966216216216216,0.008445945945945946,True,196.0,0.8108108108108109,4.6858108108108105,592.0,0.0,0.09331352154531947,0.029717682020802376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.031203566121842496,0.04368499257057949,0.050817236255572065,0.0016891891891891893,40.023118317890265,12.947897362794013,15.159528703192944,16.84761225944405,14.938921062009982,14.96418032786885,55.43870277975766,7.260869565217392,15.096286511017748,3599431.6322007366,6080.1210003390825,5.469262295081967,5.0,3.068059585426248,21.217391304347824,20.0,8.4645373881097,1.7172131147540983,1.0,1.0548244064073382,488,227,0.4651639344262295,2774,23,83
"According to the updated global cancer burden estimates from Global Cancer Statistics 2020 [ REF ] , endometrial cancer ranks the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide , and the most common gynaecologic cancer in several developed regions , including North America and Eastern and Northern Europe . A worrying trend is that , since the late 1990s , the incidence of endometrial cancer has rapidly increased in several developing countries during urbanisation , including some Asian countries ( Japan , Singapore , China and the Philippines ) and South Africa [ REF ] . It is suggested that this phenomenon may be explained , at least partly , by changing environmental and lifestyle risk factors in these regions , such as the epidemic of obesity , lack of physical activity and long - time sitting [ REF ] . Although obesity is a known risk factor for endometrial cancer , the association between sedentary behaviour and endometrial cancer remains largely unclear . Sedentary behaviour includes sitting , reclining or lying behaviour characterised by low energy expenditure [ REF ] . During the past decades , technological innovation has influenced how people work and spend leisure - time , and has led to inevitably prolonged sitting time , particularly for desk - based office work and screen - based recreation . According to the WHO Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour ( 2020 ) , long sedentary time is associated with various deleterious health outcomes , including all - cause mortality , cardiovascular diseases , obesity and more recently total cancer morbidity [ REF].Three previous meta - analyses investigating the association between sedentary behaviour and several types of cancers [ REF ] , reported a 28–36 % increased risk of endometrial cancer among individuals with higher levels of sedentary behaviour by summarising 3–11 individual studies . However , some evidence on sedentary behaviour and endometrial cancer has not yet been included in existing review and meta - analyses , the level of evidence for cancer - specific incidence remains unclear [ REF ] . Given inconsistent results reported , an up - to - date review of current evidence is in urgent need to clarify the association between sedentary behaviour and endometrial cancer risk . No distinction in domains of sedentary behaviour is a likely source of the discrepancy in previous findings . The WHO Guidelines 2020 has operationalised the definition of sedentary behaviour to further include self - reported sitting that can be assessed in various domains ( including leisure - time and occupational domain ) and total sedentary behaviour [ REF ] . Meanwhile , the association with adverse health outcomes may differ in certain domains of sedentary behaviour [ REF ] . It is increasingly recognised that confounding factors may vary greatly across domains of sedentary behaviour , and contribute to varied associations with health - related outcomes [ REF ] . For example , while occupational sedentary behaviour is related to education and socioeconomic variables , leisure - time sedentary behaviour is likely linked to lifestyle factors such as diet and obesity [ REF ] . Moreover , these two domains are often inversely correlated to physical activity . However , current evidence has been derived mostly from studies that have broadly categorised",3.3498554820740947,0.72839599472836,0.45430008747415074,0.06470318755333744,0.8727202494939168,0.8638297915458679,0.10382513661202186,0.052823315118397086,0.12386156648451731,0.23497267759562843,0.15846994535519127,0.04189435336976321,0.04553734061930783,0.10200364298724955,0.04371584699453552,0.009107468123861567,0.0546448087431694,0.00546448087431694,True,170.0,0.8306010928961749,5.129326047358834,549.0,0.0,0.089179548156956,0.07669441141498216,0.039239001189060645,0.039239001189060645,0.0,0.0,0.06777645659928656,0.020808561236623068,0.02140309155766944,0.00546448087431694,27.65929297722343,16.55923942516269,16.975882523387877,19.681182212581348,20.848007049891542,17.967982646420825,72.41336767895879,12.5625,13.63852753943946,837794.0113804123,1526.0364506018439,5.917570498915401,6.0,2.969427619625865,28.8125,28.0,14.64248420692336,1.772234273318872,1.0,0.9979203958646232,461,224,0.48590021691973967,2816,16,84
"In today 's competitive world , critical thinking is one of the abilities which all individuals must have.[REF ] Critical thinking is a vast , comprehensive process that begins with a problem and continues until a solution is found.[REF ] Regarded as one of the primary skills in the twenty - first century,[REF ] critical thinking is an essential competence in all professional and academic fields.[REF ] Critical thinking consists of the two domains of disposition and skill . The importance of creativity is high in order to provide innovative solutions for decision - making and problem solving.[REF ] A critical thinker can accurately analyze data to arrive at correct conclusions or use alternative methods to solve problems.[REF ] Thus , development and evaluation of critical thinking are significant in teaching and learning.[REF ] However , due to information overload and quick advances in technology , the goal of education has moved toward mere transfer of information at the cost of raising intelligent and creative individuals.[REF ] Karakoc Najafi et al . concluded in their study that critical thinking skills should be emphasized in university education.[REF]The integration of technology into face - to - face learning has raised great interest . Due to its efficacy in allowing for flexible , timely , and continuing learning , blended learning is regarded as the most effective and popular approach to learning.[REF ] As blended learning combines classroom learning with online learning,[REF ] it has the benefits of both conventional learning and electronic learning.[REF ] Blended learning is regarded as a practical learning model for increasing the skills of learners in the twenty - first century.[REF ] This type of learning transforms students from passive learners to active learners who seek knowledge.[REF ] Blended learning consists of the subcategories of the flex model , self - blended model , enriched virtual model , and rotation model and its subcategories.[REF ] These modern , dynamic methods of learning promote students ’ ability to investigate and identify their own learning needs , to perform critical thinking , to play an active role in their learning process , to have better initiative in different situations , and to improve their problem solving skills.[REF ] According to Wahyuni , blended learning had a significant impact on improving students ’ critical thinking skills.[REF ] However , the results of the study of Hajrezayi et al . showed that the contribution of blended learning to students ’ critical thinking was not significant.[REF ] Harrington et al . suggested that there was need for more research into the effects of the flipped classroom model ( one of the subcategories of blended learning ) on students ’ critical thinking and problem - solving skills.[REF ] Teaching critical thinking is the most important effort that should be made in nursing education.[REF ] Some experts believe that education is just teaching thinking to the learner . On the other hand , there is a need to review current educational strategies and making more use of active learning strategies has been repeatedly emphasized.[REF ] Accordingly , in the present study , the researchers conducted an extensive systematic review of previous studies of the effects of blended learning and its subcategories on critical thinking ( and its subcategories ) which are among the essential skills in the twenty - first century .",2.7922554803360558,0.658466104661385,0.4606071224032927,0.06617665160363619,0.7838283655318347,0.7678401690153849,0.12926391382405744,0.07540394973070018,0.11490125673249552,0.236983842010772,0.1059245960502693,0.03770197486535009,0.03949730700179533,0.10951526032315978,0.01615798922800718,0.02872531418312388,0.03949730700179533,0.026929982046678635,True,215.0,0.8850987432675045,5.21903052064632,557.0,0.0,0.022235056309558188,0.016170950043315046,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04909038406006353,0.017326017903551833,0.012994513427663876,0.04308797127468582,42.231362672322405,12.683096500530223,14.111328628660665,15.467090844821492,16.463030222693526,16.769674796747967,65.090491339696,9.347826086956522,14.094456355199718,1321735.7001989505,2372.95457845413,5.774390243902439,5.0,3.2839710856845463,21.391304347826086,20.0,9.07811094328973,1.6890243902439024,1.0,0.8873784489158152,492,231,0.4695121951219512,2907,23,85
"Therapies that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , ‘ anti - VEGFs ’ , play a key role in reducing angiogenesis and vascular permeability [ REF ] with the aim to prevent sight loss in ocular diseases , including neovascular age - related macular degeneration ( nAMD ) , diabetic macular oedema ( DMO ) , macular oedema caused by retinal vein occlusion and myopic choroidal neovascularisation ( myopic CNV ) . Currently , anti - VEGF treatments are exclusively administered to patients via intraocular injections for local retinal delivery of the drug . Randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) and real - world studies have identified that anti - VEGF treatments , including Ranibizumab , Bevacizumab and Aflibercept [ REF ] impart visual improvement to up to 40 % of patients with nAMD , DMO and macular oedema and to about half of patients with myopic CNV [ REF].Anti - VEGF treatment regimens can differ between patients with most patients requiring continual or even indefinite treatments . Patients typically receiving either proactive or pro re nata ( PRN ) approaches . Proactive treatment protocols involve regular anti - VEGF injections at fixed intervals , usually monthly . Prevention of further sight loss is still dependent on regular monitoring and patient adherence to their treatment regimens [ REF ] . Previous studies have identified failure in adherence of patients to their anti - VEGF treatment regimens or follow up visits , with various reasons reported . These reasons include the frequency of required visits , difficulty in attending clinical and follow - up appointments , financial limitations , pain , disbelief in the benefit of the treatment , and refusal of continuance of treatment due to associated comorbid conditions [ REF].The World Health Organization ( WHO ) defines adherence to long - term therapy as ‘ the extent to which a person ’s behaviour — taking medication , following a diet , and/or executing lifestyle changes — corresponds with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider ’ [ REF ] . There are some differences to the definitions for ‘ adherence ’ and ‘ persistence ’ in the literature . Non - adherence , in patients receiving anti - VEGF therapies , would involve deviating from their prescribed therapeutic regimen . Persistence would typically define the duration of continuation with therapy [ REF ] , and non - persistence most often refers to patients choosing to stop their medication against the prescriber ’s recommendation . Non - persistence definitions reported in patients on anti - VEGF treatments would typically include ‘ discontinuation of therapy ’ and ‘ loss to follow up ’ , whereas non - adherence could refer to ‘ missed appointments , ’ ‘ irregular attendance ’ or ‘ gaps in treatment’ . Medication non - adherence may occur at different points in a patient ’s decision - making process . It may occur at the outset of their therapy or at some point during their therapy . Previous studies have reported a variation in the rates of therapy discontinuation ( non - persistence ) of anti - VEGF treatment in diseases such as nAMD to be approximately 42 % [ REF ] and 50 % [ REF ] , with factors such as patients ’ level of awareness of their disease and treatment affecting compliance to therapy . Similarly , the adherence to treatment regimen with anti VEGF therapy improves the clinical outcomes in patients with nAMD , DMO and CNV [ REF].Recently , the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic has impacted patient - led adherence to intravitreal injections [ REF ] . The governments around the world imposed strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease . This included stay - at - home advisories and a reduction in non - urgent care [ REF ] . The consensus among retinal disease experts was that for neovascular AMD , retinal vein occlusion and diabetic retinopathy patients , anti - VEGF injection regimens should continue during lockdowns or curtailed non - urgent",3.408172732027025,0.8537181224111623,0.4474368286491482,0.048668049072636214,0.7950266003608704,0.7912011356914744,0.12223858615611193,0.044182621502209134,0.12665684830633284,0.27540500736377027,0.1723122238586156,0.036818851251840944,0.023564064801178203,0.08836524300441827,0.01914580265095729,0.01914580265095729,0.045655375552282766,0.016200294550810016,True,190.0,0.7952871870397643,4.846833578792341,679.0,0.0,0.02066532258064516,0.014112903225806451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013608870967741936,0.015877016129032258,0.009072580645161291,0.016200294550810016,26.077092177958747,16.721903654163032,18.35682480154468,21.37633032858389,20.226048269845883,17.32891344383057,70.93622176989435,12.105263157894736,15.687325779950177,6500084.793601092,9573.026205598073,5.810313075506445,5.0,3.0979890842403117,28.57894736842105,19.0,18.126211870843385,1.7937384898710866,1.0,0.9527499317938904,543,264,0.4861878453038674,3291,19,86
"Digital medicine is a new method of medical treatment that involves the application of modern computing technology and information technology to medical treatment . China has gradually begun to apply computing technology in the context of hospitals since the 1960s , and the use of digital medicine has gradually evolved from a low level , involving the use of simple applications , to one of great breadth and depth . The use of digital tools upgrades the practice of medicine to a high - definition and more personalized level . A smartphone - centric approach enables each individual to generate real - world data and pay more attention to their health [ REF ] . With the development of AI technology , AI is transforming electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) into screening tools and predictors of cardiac and non - cardiac disease through the discovery of common subclinical patterns in very large data sets , often in asymptomatic individuals , without hard - coded rules [ REF ] . AI can effectively interpret the information in the ECG , and can thereby provide significant help in rapidly suggesting effective diet , exercise , and maintenance interventions , identifying potential disease hazards , and enhancing the daily protection of patients . On the other hand , the retrieval of past information is a new problem , since patients ' activity trajectories are not constant , different regional databases are not connected , and data can be lost due to system updates . The implementation of a consistent system of digital records and medical history - taking will undoubtedly improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases . At the same time , duplication of tests or delays in the diagnostic or treatment process can be avoided . Ultrasound , endoscopy , tomography , and pathology / histology already offer considerable digital potential , such as AI - supported diagnosis and treatment of visceral diseases . This helps with standardization , improvement of the detection of pathological findings , and acceleration of the diagnosis [ REF].Acute heart failure ( AHF ) is becoming a global epidemic due the high morbidity , mortality , and cost of treatment associated with it [ REF ] . Hospital admission for acute heart failure is the most common cause of hospitalization in patients over 65 years of age . Now that population aging is a global mega - trend , acute heart failure is bound to become a global public health burden . AHF is associated with significant multi - organ dysfunction , and particularly with worsening renal function and ultimately failure , which leads to a long clinical course for AHF patients and prolonged hospitalization of patients ; the management of the acute phase also poses a challenge to hospital systems . A great deal of effort is required to achieve good outcomes . Heart failure patients have nurses who closely monitor changes in their condition during hospitalization , and overall treatment compliance is high . However , after discharge , inadequate disease awareness , along with untimely treatment and index testing , predisposes patients to improper disease management , resulting in repeated admissions and a poor prognosis . Acute heart failure can be triggered again by factors external to the patient or by their own emotions or labor , so it is also necessary to maintain and observe all the patient 's basic data indicators . Therefore , certain apps and sports watches used for health monitoring and medication reminders play a very prominent role in the lives of heart failure",3.2942485234176213,0.7642396729281914,0.45073333432040114,0.06791006973260956,0.8626519011126624,0.8578048523734597,0.11932773109243698,0.07226890756302522,0.1226890756302521,0.2991596638655462,0.1226890756302521,0.052100840336134456,0.040336134453781515,0.07394957983193277,0.03697478991596639,0.01680672268907563,0.018487394957983194,0.015126050420168067,True,212.0,0.8705882352941177,4.952941176470588,595.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01412030499858797,0.005930528099406947,0.0076249646992375035,0.0016806722689075631,35.27756655151393,15.11174354805934,16.68598849955895,19.167811420443,18.288432229221705,15.681312741312745,66.25929689087585,10.631578947368421,17.400819387576533,36064493.78282883,60612.59459298963,5.538610038610039,5.0,3.1238056556980367,27.263157894736842,23.0,9.743241140525962,1.7007722007722008,1.0,1.0063693787501138,518,285,0.5501930501930502,2947,19,87
"Cancer is one of the major diseases threatening human life and health . According to GLOBOCAN 2020 , there will be approximately 19.3 million new cancer cases and at least 10 million cancer deaths worldwide in 2020 [ REF ] . It was predicted that by 2022 , there would be approximately 4.82 million new cancer cases and at least 3.21 million cancer deaths in China and approximately 2.37 million new cancer cases and at least 0.64 million cancer deaths in the United States [ REF ] . In many countries , cancer is increasingly becoming the main cause of death . At present , frequently used treatment methods that target tumors include radiotherapy , chemotherapy , surgery , and targeted therapy . In December 2013 , Science magazine named tumor immunotherapy one of the top 10 technological breakthroughs of the year [ REF ] . American scientist James P. Allison and Japanese scientist Tasuku Honjo were awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that negative immune regulation can be used to treat cancer . The current clinical applications of tumor immunotherapy include immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy , adoptive cellular immunotherapy , and cancer vaccines , among others [ REF ] . Clinically , tumor immunotherapy has shown clear efficacy in patients with different cancer diagnoses , including long - term remission after treatment [ REF ] . Moreover , tumor immunotherapy has the potential to cure a small number of patients who develop metastases and were previously thought to be incurable [ REF ] . Tumor immunotherapy is a novel treatment approach that has rapidly developed in recent years [ REF ] . Unlike traditional therapy , tumor immunotherapy primarily targets the immune system rather than tumor cells . The immune system prevents cancer progression because of its ability to recognize and destroy abnormal cells . Tumor immunotherapy can eliminate tumor cells by strengthening the body ’s innate immune defense and reshaping the immune microenvironment [ REF ] . Therefore , reactivating the body ’s immune system is conducive to killing tumor cells . Although immunotherapy has benefited many patients , these patients remain a minority [ REF ] . Two studies found that the gut microbiome had a significant impact on cancer immunotherapy in mouse models [ REF ] . Furthermore , scientists have observed that the impact of the gut microbiome on cancer immunotherapy is variable in cancer patients ; specifically , some gut microbiome metabolites can significantly strengthen cancer immunotherapy and , thus , are considered favorable . There is no consensus on what is considered favorable . Researchers from France found that Akkermansia muciniphila was beneficial for immunotherapy against epithelial tumors [ REF ] . Researchers from North America discovered that the beneficial gut microbes included Collinsella aerofaciens , Enterococcus faecium , and Bifidobacterium longum in patients with metastatic melanoma [ REF ] , while researchers from South America identified Ruminococcaceae as part of a favorable gut microbiome in patients with melanoma [ REF ] . Furthermore , researchers from China identified Bifidobacterium longum , Prevotella copri , and Alistipes putredinis as beneficial gut microbes for patients with non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) receiving immunotherapy [ REF ] . These results imply that regional differences influence what is considered a favorable microbiome . Therefore , scientists have begun to explore the relationships between microbial metabolites and enhanced cancer immunotherapy . Obesity is defined as body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 30 kg / m2 ( weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared ) and is the most important risk factor for human health . Unfortunately , the long - term effectiveness of dietary intervention is limited . No effective drugs are currently available for individuals who have morbid obesity . Therefore , bariatric surgery is widely applied and is a high - efficiency treatment option for most patients with obesity . Bariatric surgery is recommended for obese patients with a BMI > 35 to 40 kg / m2 and other comorbidities . Generally , bariatric surgery has become an option for inducing weight loss , and numerous studies have recently shown that it also alters the gut microbiota profile . Indeed , many researchers have reported that alterations in microbial metabolites after bariatric surgery are beneficial in the context of other diseases , such as type 2 diabetes [ REF ] . However , the impact of the microbial metabolites associated with bariatric surgery on cancer and antitumor immunity requires further investigation . In this review , we introduce and analyze the changes in microbial metabolites caused by bariatric surgery and the effects of the subsequent gut - derived metabolites on anticancer immunity . Furthermore , we attempt to clarify the relationship between the changes in microbial metabolites caused by bariatric surgery and the effectiveness of cancer treatment with the aim of providing strategies for cancer patients with obesity .",2.938900290449447,0.6248196815225086,0.46664648637319595,0.05974540678145152,0.800884920539278,0.7845210507512093,0.09794437726723096,0.05562273276904474,0.1003627569528416,0.2720677146311971,0.1354292623941959,0.02902055622732769,0.045949214026602174,0.08585247883917775,0.04353083434099154,0.018137847642079808,0.056831922611850064,0.010882708585247884,True,261.0,0.8391777509068924,5.172914147521161,827.0,0.0,0.058973354231974924,0.058973354231974924,0.04996081504702194,0.02821316614420063,0.02821316614420063,0.02821316614420063,0.01469435736677116,0.020572100313479624,0.02468652037617555,0.010882708585247884,34.32155981493722,13.674530733641774,14.92658621030569,16.522538003965632,16.5795348645076,17.16634831460674,59.705221414408456,8.117647058823529,20.74060641412416,1017491797.805949,1230340.7470446783,5.84691011235955,5.0,3.2016308173798893,20.941176470588236,19.0,8.868122609431884,1.7879213483146068,1.0,1.0685599647695465,712,336,0.47191011235955055,4278,34,88
"Many marine organisms are characterized by very large distribution ranges , a finding often attributed to the lack of physical barriers . Allen ( 2008 ) estimated that the average range of a teleost ( bony ) reef fish in the Indo – Pacific is 9 million km2 , roughly the size of China , compared to 350,000 km2 for a typical freshwater fish range [ REF ] . The spatial scales of population structure and dispersal in marine ecosystems are also much larger than in terrestrial and freshwater environments [ REF ] . Long - distance colonisation and range expansion , both facilitated and constrained by oceanographic and geographic processes , have shaped the distribution and genetic architecture of marine fishes [ REF].The patterns of genetic variation within species are linked to geographical processes that give rise to sub - divided populations , as indicated by quantifiable factors such as genetic connectivity and demography . The study of population connectivity is especially pertinent to management practices for commercial exploitation and conservation [ REF ] . Genetic diversity is also an important axis for species assessment in a conservation context , especially for wide - ranging marine species like sharks [ REF].Sharks and rays play a crucial role in the sea by maintaining coastal and oceanic ecosystem structure and function . Large sharks function as top predators while smaller sharks are mesopredators and prey of larger sharks and other oceanic predators [ REF ] . Unlike teleosts , most elasmobranchs ( sharks , rays , and skates ) show late sexual maturity , long gestation period , low fecundity , slow growth rate , high level of maternal investment and long - life spans [ REF ] . These extreme life histories result in elasmobranchs being among the slowest reproducing vertebrates in the ocean and make their populations extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures such as overfishing , habitat modification , pollution and climate change [ REF ] . The primary cause of declining shark and ray populations is overfishing , as harvest rates exceed their capacity to replenish , and their life history traits render them vulnerable to rapid declines [ REF ] . More than half of this fishing mortality is due to bycatch [ REF ] . The expansion of the shark and ray fishing industry is an outcome of declining commercial fish populations ( teleosts ) and/or stringent restrictions on their capture [ REF].Sharks are found in coastal , demersal , and pelagic habitats that are largely limited to continental shelves , although there are a few completely oceanic species like Carcharhinus longimanus ( oceanic whitetip shark ) . Several species in the family Sphyrnidae ( hammerheads ) , Carcharhinus falciformis ( silky shark ) , Galeocerdo cuvier ( tiger shark ) , and Carcharodon carcharias ( white shark ) migrate between coastal and oceanic waters [ REF ] . Rays are mostly marine except for a few species in the family Dasyatidae capable of living in low salinity habitats , and members of Potamotrygonidae completely adapted to a life cycle in freshwater [",3.3212687585080687,0.6184725399625991,0.4888186877220785,0.04251753046418881,0.8122941576517545,0.8308068240682284,0.1102514506769826,0.05222437137330754,0.15087040618955513,0.27852998065764023,0.15860735009671179,0.048355899419729204,0.030947775628626693,0.059961315280464215,0.029013539651837523,0.017408123791102514,0.03868471953578337,0.0019342359767891683,True,158.0,0.8336557059961315,4.988394584139265,517.0,0.0,0.012600969305331179,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014539579967689823,0.020355411954765753,0.02617124394184168,0.015473887814313346,31.70594470046086,16.538248847926273,17.693802365651003,20.78709677419355,21.157926267281105,17.061935483870972,70.40092165898618,12.214285714285714,12.764193522086487,349477.1719055117,675.9713189661735,5.751152073732719,5.0,3.1179295771138453,31.0,30.5,12.346196638178553,1.6981566820276497,1.0,0.9301138691322287,434,243,0.5599078341013825,2579,14,89
"The World Health Organization ( WHO ) adopted the “ Resolution on Digital Health ” introduced during the 71st World Health Assembly in May 2018 and recognized the need for digital technology to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable development goals [ REF ] . As such , digital healthcare ( DHC ) , in which digital technology is converging with healthcare , has become increasingly important . Along with the fourth industrial revolution , changes in demographic structure , such as population aging , and social changes , such as smart device popularization , have stimulated the demand for DHC [ REF ] . Above all , the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to dramatic changes in the healthcare sector . Enabling contactless healthcare services , DHC has spread faster than ever . Musculoskeletal disorders ( MSDs ) are a broad spectrum of chronic diseases affecting bones , joints , and soft tissues [ REF ] . Musculoskeletal pain is a typical symptom caused by MSD , and especially , low back and neck pain is the leading causative factor of disability worldwide [ REF ] . Globally , 1.71 billion people suffer from MSDs , which are also the leading cause of disability [ REF ] . Approximately one - third of the UK population has MSDs , such as arthritis and back pain , making MSD the third – largest burden of the National Health System ’s expenditure [ REF ] . According to a recent study in Korea , where national health insurance is available , one in three Koreans visits healthcare providers for musculoskeletal pain and functional decline ; MSD prevalence is also increasing among older patients [ REF ] . Rehabilitation is essential for patients with MSDs . In 2017 , when the WHO launched the “ Rehabilitation 2030 initiative ” , everyone should be able to rehabilitate at all life cycle stages , especially for musculoskeletal health [ REF ] . In addition , pain control is a major concern in MSD care and rehabilitation programs . In the MSD rehabilitation program , the specific needs of each patient are considered . An exercise program designed to increase muscle strength , flexibility and mobility is crucial , and through such rehabilitation , the patient can become independent and lead a regular life . Active participation of both patients and their families during this process is essential [ REF ] . Recently , Austria introduced a secondary preventive program for patients with MSD , aiming to prevent rehospitalization . As part of the appraisal for this program , a large observational study was conducted , and the results indicated that physical inactivity is the factor that is most associated with the need for healthcare services [ REF ] . Using DHC for health improvement is cost - effective , safe , and measurable [ REF ] . In particular , rehabilitation for MSD , which requires physical activity ( PA ) , may have great potential when combined with DHC based on the Internet , smartphone applications , augmented reality ( AR ) , and virtual reality ( VR ) . Currently , most smartphones and smartwatches already include accelerometer - based PA trackers , allowing easy access even for older adults unfamiliar with innovative technology [ REF ] . The development of sensors and wearable devices not only enhances the convenience of systematic health management but also helps healthcare providers access and manage the rehabilitation of patients with MSD in daily life outside hospitals or facilities . In addition , by making the VR and AR content more interactive and engaging , patients can become interested in rehabilitation . DHC can offer a practical and flexible rehabilitation alternative for both patients and healthcare professionals . However , the effectiveness of DHC remains inadequately assessed ; in particular , studies suggesting a relationship between MSD management and DHC are difficult to find [ REF ] . Hence , this systematic review and meta - analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of musculoskeletal rehabilitation using a DHC system .",3.040870560052212,0.6585288602250243,0.4735762367421637,0.0749696267975873,0.8375379467010498,0.8315226833025614,0.10072992700729927,0.06715328467153285,0.10948905109489052,0.22335766423357664,0.1781021897810219,0.03941605839416058,0.040875912408759124,0.07883211678832117,0.032116788321167884,0.01167883211678832,0.08613138686131387,0.01167883211678832,True,224.0,0.8145985401459854,4.881751824817519,685.0,0.0,0.005958291956305859,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016137040714995034,0.02259185700099305,0.02904667328699106,0.0,35.19098203306467,13.730310834813501,15.55451256086462,17.400437218199208,16.35184314797103,16.48376554174067,59.30926356059571,8.153846153846153,19.381495809482303,261382604.4945539,381580.4445175969,5.7229129662522205,5.0,3.2902175968077585,21.653846153846153,19.0,8.695455522602721,1.7690941385435168,1.0,1.1815501739317045,563,290,0.5150976909413855,3344,26,90
"Drosophila melanogaster is an established model organism for developmental studies and due to the remarkable conservation of the signaling regulating autophagy , it has been used to better understand the relationship of this catabolic pathway with the genetic conditions that in humans are responsible of a class of neuronal diseases called proteinopathies ( PPs ) . Autophagy is a key cellular pathway that , together with the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( UPS ) , controls protein homeostasis by degrading misfolded proteins or exhausted organelles otherwise detrimental to the cells [ REF ] . Autophagy and UPS are closely linked , in fact protein ubiquitination is a key step for the cargo recognition by the autophagic receptors and alterations in one pathway may affect the activity of the other [ REF ] . Both pathways are crucial for cell survival particularly in neurons where their perturbation causes age - associated disorders including neurodegenerative diseases [ REF ] . In this review , we will illustrate the contribution of Drosophila studies to the understanding of the role of autophagy in PPs induced by mutations in genes responsible for the most common neurodegenerative diseases ( summarized in Table 1 ) . Furthermore , we will discuss how flies could be used to further improve our understanding of the mechanisms that control these diseases , particularly those that are linked to mutations in genes that are physiologically involved in the control of the autophagic - proteostatic pathway .

"Healthcare organizations are unique , in the sense that the services provided involve risks that can range from minor nuisances to life - threatening and/or fatal consequences for patients , which puts a lot of pressure on healthcare professionals , staff , administrators , boards and policymakers . The reality of day - to - day practices in healthcare was brought into sharp focus globally during the recent COVID-19 pandemic , which highlighted the fragility of healthcare systems globally revealing the considerable stress experienced by healthcare staff [ REF ] . Both past and more recent inquiries into the failings of care have highlighted the critical role of communication and information sharing , indicating that speaking up and voicing concerns is an integral part of safe clinical practice [ REF ] . The same inquiries , however , have shown that ( a ) staff ’s voiced concerns are frequently not acted upon until a disaster point is reached , ( b ) professionals with high calling intensity ( i.e. , professions with psychological contracts that encourage presenteeism even when employees are ill ) frequently remain silent on critical issues related to patient safety and/or unprofessional behavior , and ( c ) whistleblowing is still considered the most “ successful ” channel to address systemic and organizational problems that have remained unresolved for a long time . Silence in health care has been related to concealing personal errors and covering errors made by others [ REF ] , as well as reduced patient safety [ REF].Two influential definitions of employee voice are those of Morrison [ REF ] which describes “ employee voice as informal and discretionary communication of ideas , suggestions , concerns , problems , or opinions about work - related issues , with the intent to bring about improvement or change ” ( p. 80 ) and that of LePine and Van Dyne [ REF ] with voice being a term for “ speaking out and challenging the status quo with the intent of improving the situation ” ( p. 853 ) . More recently , the research on employee voice has been enriched by the increased interest in behaviors of withholding information from colleagues or superiors in the workplace , known as “ employee silence ” . One of the most influential definitions of employee silence has been provided by Pinder and Harlos [ REF ] : “ an employee ’s intentional withholding of genuine expression about behavioral , cognitive , and/or affective assessments of organizational conditions to organizational members who seem capable of changing the situation ” . Tangirala and Ramanujam [ REF ] define employee silence as “ employees ’ intentional withholding of critical work - related information from other members of their workgroup ” ( p. 41 ) . However , it remains unclear what is included in the terms “ employee voice ” and “ employee silence ” in healthcare , as they can sometimes be discussed in terms of safety voice and safety silence ( i.e. , speaking about patient safety / patient advocacy or concealing information related to patient safety , respectively ) ; how employee voice / silence fits within the theoretical literature on organizational culture and behavior in healthcare ; and/or whether it extends to the professional culture and identity of healthcare staff . This is also related to the fact that although there is a general agreement that employee silence refers to withholding information and employee voice refers to sharing information in the workplace , any attempt to operationalize employee voice / silence reveals difficulties and challenges in identifying what should be considered voice / silence . This can in turn affect the way voice / silence are measured . For example , voice is defined as a discretionary behavior , in that individuals choose whether to engage in verbally expressing themselves or not at any particular moment with this being affected by a variety of factors [ REF ] . Similarly ,",3.2890055455155878,1.0944827071413816,0.4652660177583629,0.06029191920559409,0.8785704672336578,0.8476759466257963,0.12462462462462462,0.05555555555555555,0.07507507507507508,0.26876876876876876,0.14864864864864866,0.042042042042042045,0.04504504504504504,0.1021021021021021,0.03003003003003003,0.03153153153153153,0.024024024024024024,0.010510510510510511,True,237.0,0.8378378378378378,4.936936936936937,666.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010118897040222615,0.014166455856311662,0.006830255502150265,0.006006006006006006,17.81138626079806,21.49561497326204,19.20931577065337,24.605566982037573,26.87050596462361,16.876007130124773,82.54778554778554,17.0,16.084896877015865,9673462.572480457,14524.718577297983,5.67379679144385,5.0,3.1524839010826167,43.15384615384615,37.0,25.752807625416608,1.7165775401069518,1.0,1.0289359272487544,561,273,0.48663101604278075,3288,13,92
"Animal product industrialization has grown speedily , which also leads to development in the scale and scope of animal husbandry and breeding . The world 's trade in animal products accounted for sixteen percent of the whole agri - food market . The value of animal products that were traded internationally went from € 56 billion in 2000 to € 152 billion ( in current currency ) in 2018 [ REF ] . Animal products are becoming more and more popular , so large - scale livestock farming and the food chains that support it have become very important . Research have been carried out to analyse a range of manufacturing factors that affect the quality of livestock products , as well as attempts , were made to optimize and boost the quality from all facets . As seen over the previous decade , following food security , it is mandatory to produce adequate safe food . With the increase in the demand for food needed , the threat to food safety is growing and wants extra attention [ REF ] . World Health Organization [ REF ] stated that the safeguarding of food quality and safety continuously poses new challenges for the food sector and science and millions of people suffer every year due to contaminated foods . The manufacturing of quality products is one of the features of food security , which dictate methodical research aimed at monitoring the existing quality regulations and standards , initially from grass and fodder production , their processing , animal feeding , animal products manufacturing , transportation , and up to the purchaser 's basket . In industrialized countries , food safety is of major concern where consumers are more and more demanding superior quality and safer foods [ REF ] . The livestock products processing necessitates improvements in food quality and taste , cold chain transportation , and preservation . However , it is complicated to manage the quality of animal products in the traditional supply chain . At the same time , the nuisances raised include various types of food frauds , because fraudsters usually have a high level of cleverness and scientific knowledge , which makes it complicated to blame the perpetrators . Inadvertent contamination and residues in the end products occur repeatedly regardless of established high standards of hygiene and measures for quality assurance [ REF ] . The global economy faces massive social and economic loss due to mislabelled , misbranded , contaminated , and adulterated food products . The food supply chain , including on - farm rearing , processing , storage , shipping , and retail chain , can be contaminated by microorganisms due to improper management and pose a threat to the contamination of foods [ REF ] . An expected 600 million humans or nearly one of 10 people on the earth , fall unwell after consuming contaminated food products [ REF ] . Genomic testing and analysis are appropriate for the detection of meat speciation as well as a genetically modified ingredient or product [ REF ] . Based on Proteomics , animal species , technological processes or storage - dependent changes can be well understood . Metabolomics analyses , which are generally done by mass spectrometry ( MS ) or nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy and iso - topolomics techniques are pertinent for indication of origin or means of manufacture [ REF ] . However , comparatively huge instrumentation and laboratory infrastructure is mandatory in these testing methods and is usually time - consuming as well as expensive even though some parameters can be rapidly tested on - site with the use of rapid test kits . Such defined analytical procedures are followed in the food industry in addition to that , implement by food regulations authorities [ REF ] . Additionally , the food regulation and safety standards authorities insist on complete traceability of foods from farm to fork . So far , the intermediates / supervisors can find a way to escape from these claims by manipulating transport documentation and bill invoices . In the international food trade system , the food recall - related work and supply chain reformation process during the food safety issues are shown to be expensive",3.071384606136423,0.6704201180079036,0.47031002786613035,0.054937520620800685,0.8561668967207273,0.8557397619537686,0.1134453781512605,0.06582633053221289,0.07282913165266107,0.3011204481792717,0.13585434173669467,0.049019607843137254,0.0392156862745098,0.09243697478991597,0.047619047619047616,0.018207282913165267,0.023809523809523808,0.012605042016806723,True,248.0,0.8515406162464986,4.871148459383753,714.0,0.0,0.011214507277499404,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011930326890956812,0.016702457647339537,0.019327129563350035,0.0014005602240896359,40.81474332247561,13.667878827361566,15.328187801962898,17.25071009771987,16.747328990228013,15.32521172638436,58.43622149837134,8.32,20.0494333160674,509751197.2250102,713937.2510154204,5.498371335504886,5.0,3.1404418793562843,24.56,22.0,7.9250488957482155,1.6677524429967427,1.0,1.0509972760290183,614,321,0.5228013029315961,3478,25,93
"Artificial intelligence has been applied in various fields throughout history , but its integration into daily life is more recent . The first applications of AI were primarily in academia and government research institutions , but as technology has advanced , AI has also been applied in industry , commerce , medicine and dentistry . There is probably no human being in the world that has not , at some point in his or her life , become aware of the limits of his or her physical and/or mental abilities . In the past , these limits often meant life or death because there was no way to go beyond one 's limits and simply improve one 's abilities . The devices and machines invented and manufactured by man have undoubtedly made everyday life easier , especially in the physical sense . However , to combine the endurance and reliability of machines with intelligence and consciousness as human characteristics was the desire of many inventors , researchers and philosophers who tried to describe the process of human thinking as a mechanical manipulation of symbols . A thinking artificial creation , i.e. , a machine that has a kind of meta - consciousness and thinks like a human , is something that captures the imagination . The theoretical foundations of what we now call artificial intelligence ( AI ) were laid by Alan Turing , Claude E. Shannon , and Norbert Wiener [ REF ] . Alan M. Turing ( 1912 – 1954 ) is an English mathematician who is considered the father of theoretical computer science ; Claude E. Shannon ( 1916 – 2001 ) is an American mathematician who is known as the father of the so - called "" information theory "" ; and Norbert Wiener ( 1894 - 1964 ) is an American mathematician and philosopher , the founder of cybernetics . They are responsible for the concept of creating intelligent machines [ REF ] . However , the concept of AI itself is somewhat younger . The concept of AI dates back to 1956 , when a group of researchers participating in an eight - week Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire , USA , proposed a research project and set the goal of creating "" thinking machines "" that could mimic human intelligence and behavior . This is widely regarded as the beginning of AI as a formal field of study [ REF].In order to better understand the concept of artificial intelligence , it is necessary to clarify the difference between artificial intelligence , deep learning , machine learning and data science , Figure 1 . Artificial intelligence , deep learning , machine learning , and data science are related but distinct fields . Artificial intelligence is the broadest field , of which machine learning and deep learning are subsets . Data science uses techniques from all of these fields to gain insights and knowledge from data . Artificial intelligence is a broad field that encompasses a range of techniques and methods aimed at creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that",2.986955428740016,0.6368550321687401,0.48677367497579604,0.07117234929823461,0.8344053626060486,0.820203431447347,0.09923664122137404,0.08206106870229007,0.08396946564885496,0.23091603053435114,0.1316793893129771,0.04961832061068702,0.05152671755725191,0.07824427480916031,0.030534351145038167,0.05152671755725191,0.0648854961832061,0.01717557251908397,True,206.0,0.851145038167939,4.711832061068702,524.0,0.0,0.051470588235294115,0.03141711229946524,0.03141711229946524,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03074866310160428,0.007018716577540107,0.0,0.0019083969465648854,41.71785268089539,14.045783446121813,14.554592549557764,16.65299323269131,16.820865434669443,14.242920353982303,60.65903175429463,9.058823529411764,14.811046428304696,2706174.11124263,5164.454410768378,5.298672566371682,4.0,3.096772228937731,26.58823529411765,24.0,13.195626831418371,1.6327433628318584,1.0,0.9651394945145895,452,229,0.5066371681415929,2469,17,94
"Cancer is a leading cause of mortality in all European countries and the impact on individual health and wider society is significant . Studies have shown that nearly 40 % of cancer cases are related to known modifiable risk factors , and therefore preventable [ REF ] . These known main risk factors include ( but are not limited to ) tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption , consequences of an unhealthy diet , being overweight and being sedentary with insufficient physical activity [ REF].Alcohol consumption remains as one of the four leading causes of premature death , and the second leading cause of premature mortality in the World health Organisation ( WHO ) European region [ REF ] ( Supplementary File S4 for full list of abbreviations ) . It is well established that there exists a direct relationship between consumption of alcohol and the development of several cancers , such as those of the oral cavity , oropharynx , oesophagus , larynx and liver [ REF ] . Although the potential negative health effects e.g. , increased risk of liver disease , cardiovascular disease , road accidents of alcohol are widely known , it is less well known that it is a risk factor for cancer , and that those who routinely indulge in heavy drinking are more at risk . Younger people in adolescence and during early adulthood are particularly vulnerable to the impact of alcohol consumption in general . Effective strategies to inform and educate younger people about the risks of alcohol consumption , may have considerable positive impact on both current and future health problems , including cancer incidence . A recent WHO report stated that it is expected that most younger people tend to begin drinking alcohol between the ages of 12–16 [ REF ] with drinking behaviours during adolescence associated with a multitude of physical , psychological , and social problems that can persist into later life . Drinking behaviours amongst university and college students has also been shown to be highly concerning , with risky drinking being common place [ REF ] and heavy drinking being reported in university students in high income countries [ REF ] . Increased consumption of alcohol in younger people has been linked to increased alcohol consumption in later adulthood [ REF ] which in turn has also has been linked to increased risk of cancer [ REF].By promoting health - conscious behaviours , and increasing risk awareness around alcohol consumption , young people will be more informed and healthy lifestyle choices can be made . This could lead to substantial public health improvement with reductions in health and social problems associated with alcohol consumption , both now and in the future The increasing popularity , accessibility , and multi - functional use of digital technologies ( computer , mobile phone , tablet etc . ) make these potential tools to help facilitate communication , education , and risk awareness to elicit protective changes in behaviour , especially among children , adolescents and young adults , who are generally more familiar with new technologies throughout their formative years . young people aged between 10 and 24 years who are approaching adolescence and early adulthood may therefore be particularly suitable as recipients for such digitally delivered interventions . Mobile Health ( mHealth ) initiatives for instance , have rapidly expanded and are being utilised to deliver public health interventions , especially in the younger population who conduct many of their daily activities using smartphones and have been termed the “ phono - sapiens ” [ REF ] . The flexibility of such mHealth platforms provide opportunities for public health specialists to target a large number of people and also monitor people 's behaviour in “ real - time",3.2782842523397173,0.7684248292745435,0.48317972442735724,0.03421490679448673,0.8936263493129185,0.8751205985362713,0.11287758346581876,0.0397456279809221,0.1287758346581876,0.2591414944356121,0.1271860095389507,0.046104928457869634,0.06359300476947535,0.08744038155802862,0.03815580286168521,0.02702702702702703,0.033386327503974564,0.014308426073131956,True,226.0,0.863275039745628,5.036565977742448,629.0,0.0,0.014752370916754479,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01053740779768177,0.014752370916754479,0.009483667017913594,0.003179650238473768,28.88900000000001,18.27266666666667,18.458006810337128,22.472087912087915,23.37373626373627,16.59912087912088,71.93113553113554,12.933333333333334,15.499698997112885,5388076.405617196,8566.0992140178,5.648351648351649,5.0,2.9546274367951795,36.4,35.0,13.235306318077166,1.6666666666666667,1.0,0.9447496454362354,546,270,0.4945054945054945,3168,15,95
"For biodiversity conservation , it is necessary to monitor changes in the natural environment and ecosystems over large spatial and temporal scales . Monitoring efforts often focus on indicator species or groups , such as birds [ REF ] . Among bird monitoring methods , sound recordings are often used owing to the ability to identify species , even when they can not be easily seen in the field [ REF].Citizen science , which refers to public participation in scientific research , can be used to obtain data over long periods and at large spatial scales ( Cohn , 2008 ; Silvertown , 2009 ; Bonney et al . , 2009a ) . This approach can be used to analyze sound recordings of birds [ REF ] . Training to improve identification skills is expected to increase the data quantity and quality [ REF ] and to improve the participants ’ interest in the natural environment [ REF ] . System for automated birdsong recognition has been developed considerably [ REF ] , and a library of sounds annotated by citizens will contribute to further improving accuracy of automated birdsong recognition . In citizen science projects , the use of online training is increasing [ REF ] , particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic [ REF ] . Online training is characterized by low costs and easy accessibility [ REF ] . However , few studies have examined the effectiveness of online training for species identification in citizen science projects [ REF ] . Quiz - style training is more efficient than simple memorization due to the testing effect , in which recalling information strengthens memory more than simply writing or listening to the information [ REF ] . Online quizzes have been used for short - term birdsong identification training , including Bird Song Hero [ REF ] , Photo + Sound Quiz [ REF ] , Larkwire [ REF ] , Bird Research Birdsong Quiz [ REF ] . However , in existing quiz - based online training , participants repeatedly and/or randomly listen to full - length sound sources , irrespective of their levels of proficiency in identifying bird songs , or they have to customize the training content ( select the set of songs ) themselves . Therefore , more efficient and user - friendly quiz - based training is needed . Adaptive learning involves tailoring learning content , feedback , and interfaces to individual users [ REF ] , and the personalization is often automatic . Recently , the effectiveness of adaptive learning has been evaluated in various fields [ REF ] . In adaptive learning , memory mechanisms are important elements [ REF ] and have been a longstanding research topic . The forgetting curve hypotheses that Ebbinghaus ( 1885 ) proposed are the first theories revealed by experiments in the study of memory mechanisms . The forgetting curve can be explained as follows : the most rapid increase in memory occurs after the first learning , the content learned is exponentially forgotten after learning , repeated learning at intervals ( repetition learning and spaced learning ) increases the amount of time that memory can be retained , the more information that came in immediately before , the more it is retained in short - term memory , and the more it can be remembered ( the recency effect ) [ REF ] . Learning effectiveness of repetition learning and spaced learning is thought to be improved by setting appropriate learning intervals , as revealed by meta - analyses [ REF ] . The recency effect is that when asked to recall a list of items in any order , people tend to recall from the end of the list and tend to recall those items best [ REF ] . The memory mechanisms are qualitatively applicable in a quiz - style online training tool on birds",2.8484070673145445,0.6768723763453894,0.46398093340171015,0.05333023453331446,0.7300115898251534,0.7146445126696066,0.0950920245398773,0.05674846625766871,0.07668711656441718,0.24846625766871167,0.18251533742331288,0.029141104294478526,0.05828220858895705,0.1058282208588957,0.0352760736196319,0.019938650306748466,0.05674846625766871,0.02147239263803681,True,214.0,0.8098159509202454,4.647239263803681,652.0,0.0,0.06248302091822874,0.010323281716924749,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027166530834012496,0.038033143167617495,0.029339853300733496,0.003067484662576687,46.46327694235592,12.285451127819552,13.6886701853816,15.032080200501253,15.416679197994988,15.027819548872177,57.50501253132832,7.833333333333333,17.75994013591012,51646869.19482922,79212.9895626215,5.469924812030075,5.0,2.991378211354981,22.166666666666668,18.5,13.783041109356898,1.6296992481203008,1.0,0.9439665470127285,532,250,0.4699248120300752,3030,24,96
"Anxiety disorder is a common mental illness with persistent fear or anxiety ( typically lasting six months or more ) and related behavioral disturbances [ REF ] . For a long time in the past , the incidence of anxiety disorder could not be accurately counted until there is a clear diagnostic criterion . In recent years , demographic data in the UK shows that 3 % of the population were eligible to be diagnosed with anxiety disorder , but only 8 % of those identified were diagnosed with anxiety disorder finally and received relevant treatment [ REF ] . In particular , anxiety disorders are considered to be one of the most common psychiatric disorders , affecting 15%−20 % of young people [ REF ] . Corresponding to anxiety disorder , anxiety is a relatively widespread type of human mental illness , that has emotions of dread , apprehension , and impending disaster but not disabling as anxiety disorders [ REF ] . Anxiety can be adaptive as it is a response to danger or potential threats in the environment [ REF ] . The statistical results show that the global overall prevalence of major depression is 4.7 % [ REF ] , and about 85 % of the patients also have symptoms of anxiety [ REF ] . It is important to note that both anxiety disorder and anxiety can have bad consequences [ REF ] . It is urgent to find a suitable therapeutic schedule for anxiety disorder and anxiety . At present , the treatment of anxiety disorder is still based on drug intervention and there are a variety of drugs to choose from the clinic . The efficacy and tolerance of drugs are different , which made the drug regimen of different patients has certain differences . The first - line medication is chemical drugs , but the price of drugs is generally high , which is a great expense for many patients [ REF ] . At present , the main purpose of clinical medicine is to relieve symptoms . A total of 50 % improvement on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAMA ) or being able to live normally after stopping the drugs rather than completely curing the situation are commonly used as the endpoint indicators [ REF ] . What 's more worrying is that these patients still tend to show symptoms of chronic anxiety in the future [ REF ] . According to the survey , the lifetime prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder worldwide is about 3.7 % [ REF ] . Therefore , it is necessary to find a cheap and effective anxiolytic drug . Traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) may show unique advantages in the treatment of such psychiatric disorders . Jiawei Xiaoyao San ( JWXYS ) is a traditional Chinese medicine preparation and its composition has been derived from the Internal Medicine Abstract published in 1529 CE ( Fig . 1 ) . It is derived from the drug ‘ Xiaoyao San ’ in the world 's first drug standard Taiping Huimin Hejifang ,",2.885019238101307,0.6074340652280513,0.45739252544999676,0.05552386969678928,0.7480238129384815,0.7597257557668184,0.09477756286266925,0.07736943907156674,0.10831721470019343,0.22437137330754353,0.1450676982591876,0.03288201160541586,0.06382978723404255,0.0735009671179884,0.0367504835589942,0.025145067698259187,0.061895551257253385,0.02321083172147002,True,198.0,0.8239845261121856,4.439071566731141,517.0,0.0,0.023479188900747065,0.010672358591248666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021344717182497332,0.029882604055496264,0.035218783351120594,0.005802707930367505,55.39211701308699,10.655585615308482,12.28987398476788,13.236071703508195,12.908138128230512,12.761939953810622,55.49202683382822,7.190476190476191,14.712959822310548,2453337.308407783,4745.333285121437,5.1016166281755195,4.0,2.8542455992408677,20.61904761904762,19.0,8.243185875538947,1.5427251732101617,1.0,0.8232470835040651,433,219,0.5057736720554272,2295,21,97
"Sea cucumbers , or Holothurians , are marine invertebrates belonging to the class Holothuroidea in Phylum : Echinodermata , inhabit various environments from shallow coastal waters to deep sea . Sea cucumbers perform several significant ecological functions , as efficient ecosystem engineers by deposit feeding habit reduce organic waste , constantly rework the sediments and facilitate bioturbation [ REF ] . Sea cucumbers are dried , processed , and sold as a product known as “ Beche- de- mer ” or “ Trepang ” , an expensive Chinese delicacy with growing demand [ REF ] . Globally , sea cucumber wild stocks have declined at alarming rates due to overfishing and poor management policies [ REF ] . However , aquaculture techniques are well established for commercial species such as Holothuria scabra [ REF ] , which could potentially assist in recovering depleted population and trade in many parts of the world . Research on sea cucumbers of the Arabian Peninsula ( AP ) and Iran is scant and sporadic . Hence , a detailed and comprehensive review of the studies conducted in this region is warranted . Habitat diversity and prevailing extreme environmental conditions likely drive sea cucumber diversity in this region ; however , such correlations remain poorly studied . In this review we focus on the aspects of historical and current research trends in sea cucumbers of the AP ( which includes the following countries : Iraq , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Qatar , United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) , Oman , and Yemen ) and Iran and their marginal seas ( Arabian / Persian Gulf ( APG ) , Gulf of Oman , Arabian Sea , Gulf of Aden , and Red Sea ) , to identify gaps in research and provide recommendations to address future research priorities . The AP is surrounded by marginal seas including the APG to the east , Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea to the south , and the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea to the west . The APG is a young ( < 6000 years ) , shallow sea ( average depth 30–60 m ) , connected to the Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean by the Strait of Hormuz [ REF ] . The APG has a wide range of sea surface temperature ( SST ; 12 ○ C to > 35 ○ C ) as well as highly variable salinity levels ( > 42 to > 50 ppt ) [ REF ] . The environmental extremes of the APG influences its relatively impoverished species richness and density of this water body [ REF ] . Over 200 species of macroalgae and four species of seagrass ( Halodule uninervis , Syringodium istaefolium , Halophila ovalis , and Halophila stipulacea ) in the APG serve as nursery grounds for several species of invertebrates and vertebrates [ REF ] . Resilient Corals ( 40 hard coral and 38 soft coral species ) and coral reefs thrive in these extreme conditions [ REF ] . However , climate change - induced recurrent bleaching events have led to reef degradation [ REF ] . Furthermore , rapid coastal development in the AP threatens its biodiversity [ REF].The Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea , which surrounds Oman , consists of deep ocean waters with variable climatic conditions .",3.387539674445381,1.1362017407558358,0.4672891280153155,0.05835336968319437,0.7446256437235408,0.69458869099617,0.10265486725663717,0.061946902654867256,0.09380530973451327,0.2,0.18584070796460178,0.047787610619469026,0.019469026548672566,0.06902654867256637,0.02654867256637168,0.012389380530973451,0.1433628318584071,0.0035398230088495575,True,155.0,0.7858407079646018,4.419469026548673,565.0,0.0,0.04181639986932375,0.03332244364586737,0.020908199934661875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01633453119895459,0.022868343678536424,0.026461940542306436,0.017699115044247787,43.710815273477834,13.164040821006768,14.924444911402436,16.721981424148606,15.184045407636738,13.604531590413945,57.49122807017544,8.052631578947368,15.231320961107084,4119823.8316657892,7291.723595868653,5.209150326797386,4.0,2.963805467813331,24.157894736842106,21.0,14.094654297938398,1.6383442265795207,1.0,0.9588086534932342,459,255,0.5555555555555556,2497,19,98
"Viral Hepatitis is one of the major global public health issues , and every year millions of individuals suffer from it.[REF ] Viral Hepatitis caused 1.34 million fatalities worldwide in 2015 , with the majority of viral Hepatitis deaths owing to chronic liver disease or primary liver cancer ( mortality due to cirrhosis : 720,000 ; hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ): 470,000 ) . The death rate from viral Hepatitis has continued to climb over time.[REF ] Nowadays , viral Hepatitis can be comparable to the big three communicable diseases : tuberculosis , HIV / AIDS , and malarial infections.[REF ] Viral Hepatitis can be caused by any of the known five hepatotropic viruses , namely Hepatitis A Virus ( HAV ) , Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) , Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) , Hepatitis D Virus ( HDV ) , and Hepatitis E Virus ( HEV).[REF ] Based on the 2017 global Hepatitis report , a large number of individuals do not have access to screening and treatment for Hepatitis , consequently leading to Chronic Liver Disease ( CLD ) and cancer mortality due to Hepatitis.[REF ] The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is urging countries to take quick action to increase the knowledge , diagnosis / testing , and treatment services for Hepatitis . According to a WHO report , one in twenty individuals are living with viral Hepatitis . HAV and HEV are enterically transmitted pathogens that produce sporadic infections as well as outbreaks of Acute Viral Hepatitis ( AVH).[REF ] HAV is a single - stranded RNA virus and it is mostly transmitted through the fecal - oral pathway.[REF ] In India , HAV infection is common among children , and it generally leads to mild anicteric Hepatitis . The majority of children under the age of two ( 85 % ) and nearly half of those aged two to five years ( 50 % ) have nonspecific symptoms and are usually anicteric.[REF ] HAV infection disease severity increases with the patient 's age and the prevalence of existing chronic liver diseases.[REF]Chronic HBV affects 240 million persons worldwide and chronic HCV affects 130–150 million.[REF ] Chronic Hepatitis affects approximately 400 million individuals worldwide , with the Asia - Pacific area serving as the hub of the epidemic.[REF ] HBV and HCV are mainly transmitted through the parenteral route and are known to cause chronic Hepatitis , which can progress to serious consequences such as liver cirrhosis and HCC.[REF]HBV and HCV infections are more alike , which include distribution , hepatotropism , disease transmission , and at last leading to chronic infection which may end in liver cirrhosis and HCC.[REF ] HBV and HCV infections do not have a standard of care due to the individual category of infected subjects so it is difficult to cure.[REF ] Thus , studying the magnitude becomes a crucial component in prevention of HBV and HCV . The current review aimed to summarize the prevalence of viral Hepatitis in India from peer - reviewed articles published from February 2000 to February 2021.To study the overall prevalence of viral Hepatitis in India from peer - reviewed articles published from February 2000 to February 2021.To review the determinant factors of viral Hepatitis in the Indian region with the included article .

"Tuberculosis ( TB ) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) remains a deadly disease affecting millions of people worldwide . It is estimated to affect approximately one - third of the global population and is becoming one of the most fatal infectious diseases . MTB usually attacks the lungs , but TB bacteria can infect any part of the body such as kidney , spine , or brain [ REF ] . Worldwide , TB is the 13th leading cause of death and the second raging infectious killer after human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) [ REF ] . In 2020 , an estimated 10 million people got ill with TB worldwide , the infection being divided as 5.6 million men , 3.3 million women , and 1.1 million children . TB affects most of the countries among all age groups and can be fatal if not treated properly . Moreover , the emergence of drug - resistant strains has further complicated the problem and has become a rising obstacle against efficient therapeutics [ REF ] . Therapeutics are available but the effective control of the disease is impeded due to the lack of rapid and accurate diagnostics . Under such significant circumstances , there is an urgent need for rapid , accurate , and cost - effective diagnostic test for TB to identify new cases and reduce the time - to - treatment and prevent its further transmission . The current available methods are primarily based on smear microscopy ( acid - fast staining ) , culture , and nucleic acid amplification . Although methods based on acid - fast staining are sensitive , they pose problems in low - resource places and are time - consuming [ REF ] . The solid culture method requires around 4 - 8 weeks , while liquid - based culture methods also require around 10 - 14 days [ REF ] . Nucleic acid amplification techniques are based on polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) or loop - mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP ) . Although hemi - nested PCR based on GeneXpert for MTB detection is rapid , sensitive , and specific , it also poses challenges of high cost and high end equipment dependency , which limits its implementation in low - resource regions [ REF ] . LAMP is an isothermal DNA amplification method that relies on four or six pairs of primers to amplify minute quantities of DNA within a shorter period with simple operation , making it more suitable for low - resource regions [ REF ] . Thus , research in TB diagnostics aims to find an efficient , reproducible , cost - effective tool with minimal infrastructure requirements . LAMP is a popularly adopted new age technology for rapid nucleic acid amplification which is widely used for pathogen ( virus , bacteria , and malaria ) detection including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS CoV-2 ) [ REF ] . LAMP - based detection methods have been proved to be more sensitive than GeneXpert assay .
