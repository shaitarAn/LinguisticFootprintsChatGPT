"Being fluent in more than one foreign language has become a major educational goal in Europe [ REF ] . However , teaching foreign languages in conjunction with English as a global foreign language seems to pose a challenge , since the simultaneous learning of English is believed to lead to negative interferences with students ’ motivation to learn other languages [ REF ] . This appears to be a general European phenomenon [ REF ] , as cross - sectional research from several countries has repeatedly shown that students usually report lower value beliefs and motivation to learn languages other than English [ REF ] . Still less is known about longitudinal relations between students ’ motivation for several languages . Moreover , the motivational development might not be the same for all students . Previous studies indicate systematic individual differences in students ’ motivational beliefs depending , for instance , on their gender , language background [ REF ] , or experience with learning several languages at home [ REF ] . In order to expand previous research on language motivation , the present study focuses on upper secondary students ’ academic language learning in Switzerland , a historically multilingual country . This context provides a unique opportunity to understand how students ’ prior linguistic knowledge ( e.g. , growing up with more than one home language ) may be related to their motivation to learn several languages . To explore the longitudinal relationship between students ’ motivation for several languages in more depth , this study draws on the concept of value beliefs , which refer to the value students attribute to doing a certain task or activity [ REF ] and are particularly important for predicting students ’ language learning motivation [ REF ] . First , we investigate the longitudinal relations between Swiss German students ’ value beliefs in English ( a foreign language ) , French ( a foreign but national language ) , and German ( the native language , as data were obtained in German - speaking Switzerland ) from Grades 9 to 11 . Second , we explore potential relations between students ’ development of value beliefs in the three language subjects and their linguistic background ( monolingual vs. multilingual ) . Understanding students ’ motivation for learning new languages has been a concern of teachers and researchers in psychology and applied linguistics for more than five decades [ REF ] . The most common motivation models used are the socioeducational model [ REF ] , self - determination theory [ REF ] , the second language ( L2 ) motivational self - system [ REF ] , and expectancy - value theory [ REF ] . These models have distinct characteristics in describing language motivation but they all share some commonalities , in that they usually differentiate between motivational beliefs arising from within individuals or being influenced from outside ( e.g. , by parents ) . For instance , EVT posits that students ’ value beliefs ( beliefs about the value of engaging in a task ) can predict how they will learn [ REF ] . Some of these value beliefs , such as the intrinsic value ( pertaining to personal interest or enjoyment ) or the attainment value ( pertaining to the personal importance of doing well ) , share some intrinsic aspects , which are generally argued to be particularly important in language learning [ REF ] . If students see the value in an activity , they are more likely to engage in learning and to use effective learning strategies [ REF ] .

"The diversity of worldviews and knowledge systems held about nature by distinct communities was highlighted by a recent report on values assessment for policymakers , the Intergovernmental Science - Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services report [ REF ] . One approach for exploring variation in knowledge systems is through the lens of language — and in particular by exploring similarities and differences in the ways in which landscapes and their elements are conceptualized through language . Studies of indigenous languages have found differences in conceptualization which can have profound consequences for human – environment relations . These differences often have implications for land cover and land use classes [ REF ] and their definitions in management . For example , experts erroneously relabeled secondary rainforest as primary assuming rainforest had not previously been cultivated [ REF ] , and classified areas used for grazing as unproductive which led to the planting of forest on what was , in fact , grazing land [ REF ] . In both cases , differences in terminology relating to landscape — that did not take into consideration indigenous classifications — affected management decisions , with implications for traditional land use . The resulting importance of capturing multiple conceptualizations of our relationship with landscapes for environmental governance has recently gained traction in policy [ REF ] . Despite this , policy and management approaches often appear to take conceptual equivalence for granted . For example , the European Landscape Convention ( Council of Europe , 2000)—which commits signatories to protecting , monitoring , and managing landscapes of all types — has two official languages , English and French , and is then translated into 41 additional languages . It ostensibly assumes straightforward equivalence between languages . However , a closer examination of the term “ landscape ” and presumed translation equivalents in seven European languages found the superordinate concept landscape may not be so similar across languages after all [ REF ] . Similarly , other international policy initiatives , such as the UN ’s Sustainable Development Goals [ REF ] , are based around targets and indicators . For example , indicator 15.1.1 aims to measure “ Forest area as a proportion of total land area ” although in a diverse sample of languages , linguistic terms related to “ forest ” vary considerably , suggesting that there is no unitary underlying concept ( Burenhult et al . , 2017 ; Burenhult , this issue ) . These differences may be one reason why more formal definitions of “ forest”—for instance , based on tree cover and tree height — vary with profound consequences for measurements at global scales [ REF ] . Related to these issues is a privileging of the English language , and the concepts captured therein , as a dominant language in both science and policy across many countries [ REF ] , especially as the importance of global initiatives increases . This raises a series of important challenges for future work in this area . While previous research has highlighted cross - linguistic differences in isolated concepts , such as “ landscape ” or “ forest , ” it remains unclear whether a more systematic exploration of an entire semantic field would also yield such mismatches across languages . It could be the case that researchers have focused specifically on terms which are vague or ill - defined but these are , in fact , the minority when considering the larger vocabulary in this domain . For example , superordinate concepts , such as landscape , are in any case more abstract , and , therefore , potentially less likely to be comparable across languages [ REF ] . Moreover , studies reporting substantive differences across languages have often focused on case studies based around introspection and dictionary definitions [ REF ] , whereas quantitative corpus - based studies are divided over whether semantic domains related to the physical world ( such as landscape ) show substantive similarities across languages [ REF ] . This highlights the need for further empirical study using speaker judgments to clarify the matter . In this paper , we , therefore , examine multiple terms within a single semantic field related to “ waterbodies ” in two related languages , English and German , with both lay people and experts . Specifically , we explore how speakers mentally represent the domain of “ waterbody ” terms through sensory , motor , and emotion associations . In doing so , we assume this provides insight into the meaning of these terms , although we remain agnostic for present purposes as to whether the concepts themselves are stored in neural systems for perception and action [ REF ] or amodal brain regions [ REF ] . To illustrate ,",3.216616541160218,1.2730575748450068,0.4938365575381232,0.07563199938359541,0.8467066946129004,0.8391631815744482,0.03598014888337469,0.08933002481389578,0.1315136476426799,0.009925558312655087,0.24441687344913152,0.09057071960297766,0.05459057071960298,0.04838709677419355,0.16377171215880892,0.03722084367245657,0.011166253101736972,0.018610421836228287,0.02977667493796526,0.034739454094292806,True,293.0,0.8300248138957816,5.023573200992556,806.0,0.010712814173877214,0.010712814173877214,0.0,0.0,0.01442109600329625,0.02018953440461475,0.014833127317676144,0.007444168734491315,35.656264285714315,14.963735714285715,15.487659770458691,17.716285714285714,19.449955357142855,17.35505952380952,67.05857142857143,10.8,20.182510189456128,582308066.453255,722466.5836889021,5.825892857142857,5.0,3.2123805944748365,26.88,29.0,11.618330344761247,1.7008928571428572,1.0,0.9946878730088572,672,341,0.5074404761904762,4049,25,2
"Bosnian / Croatian / Montenegrin / Serbian ( BCMS ) is one of the most widespread heritage languages1 in Switzerland . At least 2.4 % of the Swiss population speaks BCMS on a daily basis , which corresponds to 173,546 individuals.2 However , the BCMS spoken in Switzerland is still under - investigated , despite the increasing body of research on heritage languages [ REF ] and on heritage BCMS spoken in other German - speaking countries [ REF ] . One of the main challenges in the research on heritage varieties is the difficulty in obtaining and redistributing authentic data , which often limits the research settings to case studies based on online communication between peers [ REF ] . What is particularly lacking for facilitating the research on ( BCMS ) heritage varieties are corpora of spoken language , since heritage speakers use their heritage language predominantly in oral communication . In order to provide a resource which would enhance the study of heritage BCMS , we created a map task corpus of this variety spoken by second - generation speakers in Switzerland . The corpus consists of data that have been collected by students during the courses “ Corpus linguistics ” and “ BCMS as heritage language in Switzerland ” at the Department of Slavonic Languages and Literatures at the University of Zurich in 2019 and 2020 . The aim of the exercises was to train the students to conduct an empirical study on spoken language . The task included fieldwork , transcription of speech , linguistic annotation and analysis of selected phenomena found in the collected data . At the end of the courses , we obtained 30 short transcripts and recordings of BCMS heritage speakers having parents born in former Yugoslavia . In order to present this data to a broader audience , and to present a prototype for a corpus access of this type of spoken data , we created an interactive platform on which users can preselect the transcripts according to particular metadata and frequency distribution of pre - annotated features , sort and filter corpus counts , search the annotated turn - aligned transcripts , and add and export their own custom annotations . Hence , in addition to providing a first publicly available resource for heritage BCMS in German - speaking diaspora , with this corpus , we also present an example for visualising , structuring , and accessing spoken language data . With the corpus architecture used for this prototype , we address the need of user - group specific differentiation when accessing spoken language corpora [ REF ] . The map task corpus of heritage BCMS is primarily tailored for linguists investigating heritage BCMS in interaction , and teachers and learners of BCMS living abroad . The migration from the countries of former Yugoslavia to Switzerland started in the 1960s , when the name of the official language was Serbo - Croatian . However , Serbo - Croatian as standard language has never been entirely uniform : there was an Eastern and a Western variety , as well as two other ( sub- ) varieties : Bosnian – Herzegovinian standard - language expression and Montenegrin standard - language expression [ REF ] . Following the break - up of Yugoslavia , new standard languages have been codified from what was former known as Serbo - Croatian : Bosnian , Croatian , Serbian and Montenegrin . All these standard languages are almost completely mutually understandable , since they are all based on the Štokavian dialect , which is spoken in all of these countries.3 While the denomination BCMS is widespread in the linguistic community , Bosnian , Serbian , Croatian and Montenegrin are also seen as separate languages , depending on the definition and approach one adopts when dealing with them . There is an extended body of literature about the controversy of BCMS and whether and under which aspects it can be considered one language [ REF ] . For reasons of consistency , in this paper we use the term BCMS to denominate these language(s ) , although the variety from Montenegro is not included in our data .",3.207535305890904,0.8173640343048519,0.472911881107306,0.05108412265736594,0.8545887470245361,0.8468345824409934,0.03566333808844508,0.07845934379457917,0.12981455064194009,0.014265335235378032,0.21968616262482168,0.09985734664764621,0.0898716119828816,0.07275320970042796,0.1326676176890157,0.03138373751783167,0.011412268188302425,0.014265335235378032,0.034236804564907276,0.03138373751783167,True,273.0,0.8530670470756063,4.807417974322396,701.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008845208845208846,0.010319410319410319,0.011056511056511056,0.007132667617689016,40.496732128829535,15.495162782578337,15.631368783578527,18.731221087544736,19.99583398795496,15.173399668325043,68.22108754473248,11.578947368421053,19.130879618487022,203439580.79377517,290213.38201679767,5.42620232172471,5.0,3.005651394291739,31.736842105263158,27.0,13.415788441287566,1.5854063018242124,1.0,0.8794235027981228,603,266,0.44112769485903813,3370,19,3
"Framing is one of the most popular contemporary theoretical approaches in communication research [ REF ] . Many studies refer to the concept but sometimes fail to provide definitions , resulting in a diversity of phenomena subsumed under this conceptual umbrella [ REF ] . This complicates attempts to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights — which has often been described as a problem for communication research [ REF ] . Systematic reviews aim to help overcome such problems by identifying common trends , locating research gaps , and guiding future research ( e.g. , for framing : Borah , 2011 ; Matthes , 2009 ) . However , the reviews available have not made much use of one of the unique characteristics of the framing approach : its bridging potential [ REF ] . This relates to the fact that framing is able to consider the entire communication process , with all its aspects , and thus bridges different ( interdisciplinary ) perspectives : strategic communication by a variety of actors ( including their cognitions ) ; journalistic cognitions , processing of information , and subsequent reporting ; frames of audiences ; framing effects ; as well as the broader cultural contexts in which frames emerge and compete for attention [ REF ] . Entman ( 1993 ) refers to frame locations in the communication process : the communicator , the text / message , the receiver , and the culture . Here we argue that by systematically reviewing how framing has been applied across frame locations and by elucidating the most salient frames at each location , we gain indications about the cultural framing repository — that is , the ( competitive ) environment of salient and culturally / cognitively available frames [ REF ] . Reviewing the literature and assessing a cultural framing repository is best performed when selecting one specific topic for which many studies are available . Here we focus on the framing of climate change [ REF ] for a number of reasons . ( 1 ) Since climate change is one of the most important contemporary global problems [ REF ] , exploring its communication is highly relevant . Audiences continue to rely on a set of different sources to obtain information about the issue but nevertheless find the topic difficult to engage with and understand ; in this context , frames also affect ( the support for ) actions audiences are willing to undertake [ REF ] . Furthermore , climate change is a special topic due to its unobtrusiveness , complexity , and scientific ( un)certainty [ REF ] , as well as the required connections between experts , policy , sources of information , and audiences for combating it : framing is able to “ break through the communication barriers ” ( e.g. , Nisbet , 2009 , p. 15 ) . Certainly , many scholars also share the normative expectation that studying framing helps develop communication strategies ( for target audiences ) , build consensus , and support actions to fight climate change [ REF ] . To do this effectively , framing needs to be explored across frame locations . ( 2 ) Since research on framing in climate change communication is growing steadily [ REF ] , future research will benefit from a systematic review . Systematic reviews can take stock and guide future research more thoroughly when many studies are published in a",3.1032993921474312,0.982536847295036,0.47548598369676803,0.0758246080191525,0.7268366647117278,0.7215940856840461,0.03298611111111111,0.08506944444444445,0.0954861111111111,0.015625,0.2222222222222222,0.11458333333333333,0.0642361111111111,0.027777777777777776,0.1892361111111111,0.05381944444444445,0.022569444444444444,0.013888888888888888,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,True,196.0,0.7951388888888888,4.751736111111111,576.0,0.051932367149758456,0.01932367149758454,0.0,0.0,0.018115942028985508,0.025362318840579712,0.021739130434782608,0.005208333333333333,33.79223118279572,14.963709677419356,15.760457277294734,17.903225806451612,18.085505376344088,16.260387096774192,66.26344086021506,10.444444444444445,15.798855404383598,7267009.409207417,12616.335779873987,5.647311827956989,5.0,3.1384398356011314,25.833333333333332,22.0,14.686539566706804,1.735483870967742,1.0,1.0518437638277347,465,239,0.513978494623656,2737,18,4
"Francoprovençal is a non - standardized and highly endangered Gallo - Romance language spoken today by about 110,000 to 160,000 speakers in France , Switzerland , and Italy [ REF ] . It was never the official language of an administrative entity and never saw standardization . Nowadays , all speakers of Francoprovençal are bilingual , and for Swiss varieties , most of them are older than 70 years , with the notable exception of Evolène in the canton Valais in Switzerland where the local variety of Francoprovençal is still transmitted to the next generation [ REF ] . In the Aosta Valley , in Italy , due to successful language policy promoting the use of Francoprovençal , we also still find competent native speakers of all ages . Not only geographically , but also typologically , Francoprovençal can be considered a ‘ bridge ’ between French , Occitan and Italian dialects , but it is relatively underresearched in terms of its morphological or syntactic properties ( but see e.g. , Diémoz 2007 for subject pronouns and subsequent publications ) . Since 2018 , a binational project focusing on so - called ‘ partitive articles ’ ( henceforth PA ) in Francoprovençal varieties and Northern Italian Dialects ( NIDs ) has contributed to a better understanding of the nominal morphosyntax of Francoprovençal varieties . In an important antecedent study to this project , Kristol [ REF ] has already shown a subdivision of French , Swiss and Italian varieties into two types according to their determiner systems : “ Francoprovençal A ” , which comprises the Western varieties of the Valais ( Switzerland ) and the Northern varieties ( in France and Switzerland ) , and “ Francoprovençal B ” , which comprises Southern Francoprovençal , that is , the Southern varieties spoken in France , the Eastern varieties in the Swiss canton of Valais and the Aosta Valley in Italy . Francoprovençal A varieties have a gender distinction on plural definite articles ( masc . lu(z)—fem . le(z ) ) , like in Ibero - Romance systems , and they possess a fully - fledged PA , like French [ REF ] . In contrast to French , however , PAs in Francoprovençal A are also attested after quantifiers / quantity expressions like Fr . beaucoup ‘ a lot ’ and under the scope of sentential negation [ REF ] . Francoprovençal B varieties do not show , like French and unlike Italian , any gender distinction on the plural definite article ( le(z ) , with a sort of liaison consonant [ z ] realized only in front of vocalic onsets of the following word ) ; correlated with this morphology , these varieties only have an obligatory [ REF ] invariable DE for indefinite mass singulars and indefinite plurals ( with an optional allomorph de-[z ] in the plural before vocalic onset ) . In addition , definite articles in some localities of the Francoprovençal B area ( e.g. , eastern Valais , Switzerland ) exhibit the remains of an older subject vs oblique case system when they are singular , as illustrated in Table 1 [ REF ] . In sum , the two main types of Francoprovençal are",3.165733455308805,1.1325219056350257,0.4259375044869253,0.07005404042167948,0.7086900272406638,0.6872411544124285,0.02578268876611418,0.09576427255985268,0.13075506445672191,0.014732965009208104,0.15469613259668508,0.053406998158379376,0.08103130755064457,0.13259668508287292,0.19337016574585636,0.04604051565377532,0.0055248618784530384,0.007366482504604052,0.01841620626151013,0.03683241252302026,True,187.0,0.7937384898710865,4.624309392265193,543.0,0.011791680314444808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011464133639043564,0.01604978709466099,0.01473960039305601,0.04419889502762431,45.809433301924884,13.25588908332212,14.803905376888956,16.781208776416747,17.344108224525506,15.408695652173915,60.030825144703186,8.823529411764707,15.295657268289592,4393590.218687723,8091.326369590651,5.503432494279176,5.0,3.4506142627169156,25.705882352941178,26.0,18.842270082676134,1.5949656750572083,1.0,0.8811643593067163,437,223,0.5102974828375286,2511,17,5
"Imitation is ubiquitous in humans . It has been argued to be a fundamentally important capacity for human culture [ REF ] and a developmental basis for language and cognitive skills [ REF ] , representing a powerful learning mechanism for human beings , whether infants or adults . The present study expands on previous research on imitative abilities and investigates the role played by different types of imitation skills ( language - based multimodal imitation vs. object - based imitation ) that have thus far rarely been assessed together . It also contributes to the literature on the imitation abilities of young preschoolers , an age group in whom important linguistic and social developmental advances take place and which has hitherto not been actively studied in the field of imitation abilities . To our knowledge , this is the first time that the relationship between different types of imitation is investigated in relation to linguistic and pragmatic skills in preschool children . We will start by briefly reviewing the previous literature on the relationship between imitative behaviors and language and sociopragmatic abilities , making the case that language - based imitation should be assessed from a socially relevant multimodal perspective . Imitation skills , understood as the ability to intentionally replicate others ’ behaviors or actions , play a fundamental role in the development of language and how it is used in social contexts ( i.e. , social communication ) . Numerous empirical and longitudinal studies have shown that spontaneous imitative behaviors which naturally occur in language interactions during the first and second year of life ( specifically between 9 and 24 months ) , as well as elicited imitation behaviors , are key for language production and comprehension [ REF ] , the acquisition of vocabulary [ REF ] , and social communication behaviors such as interactive actions like requesting or greeting [ REF ] . In relation to language production and comprehension skills , Bates et al . ( 1979 ) performed a correlational study with 9- to 13 - month - old infants and reported a strong link between vocal imitation ( i.e. , imitation of sounds and words ) and language production and comprehension at this stage of development . Hanika and Boyer ( 2019 ) demonstrated that motor imitation behaviors ( like clapping hands or pushing a toy car across a table ) in infants between 15 and 18 months have a unique relationship to language comprehension skills . In relation to the acquisition of vocabulary , in a study with children from 9 through 15 months , Carpenter et al . ( 1998 ) observed a positive relationship between the age when infants began to imitate arbitrary actions involving physical objects ( e.g. , hitting the side of a box or patting the top of a box with one hand ) and the age when they began to use referential language ( i.e. , words used to refer to specific actions or objects ) . Masur and Eichorst ( 2002 ) showed that infants that imitated more novel words at 13 months had larger lexicons at 17 months and 21 months , demonstrating that a higher frequency in the imitation of novel words at 13",3.6060444254043778,0.9163175305266673,0.44426010984642056,0.051447872848648,0.8391036437107966,0.8454224814971288,0.02952029520295203,0.1033210332103321,0.12361623616236163,0.03136531365313653,0.25830258302583026,0.08487084870848709,0.06826568265682657,0.027675276752767528,0.12730627306273062,0.02952029520295203,0.014760147601476014,0.01845018450184502,0.02214022140221402,0.055350553505535055,True,194.0,0.8413284132841329,4.856088560885609,542.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00787897888433659,0.011030570438071227,0.008509297195083518,0.0018450184501845018,27.074322033898312,17.858571428571427,18.473206523352868,22.045036319612592,20.99286319612591,15.23847457627118,69.0956416464891,11.928571428571429,13.878230546834285,1064728.6616110578,1964.4440251126528,5.427966101694915,5.0,3.156091382138709,33.714285714285715,36.0,14.51810973247143,1.7203389830508475,1.0,1.078570878212359,472,226,0.4788135593220339,2632,14,6
"German - speaking Switzerland ’s linguistic situation has been used as a textbook case for outlining ‘ diglossia ’ [ REF ] . Specifically , two context - dependent varieties are used ; Alemannic ( ALM ) dialects , commonly referred to as Swiss German1 or Mundart ( verbatim ‘ mouth kind ’ ) , for oral communication , and Swiss Standard German ( SSG ) , also called Schriftdeutsch ( verbatim ‘ script German ’ ) , for written communication . In other words , in German - speaking Switzerland , everyone is a native speaker of a local dialect while SSG is learned at school . To a certain extent , both ALM and SSG can also be used in the other variety ’s domain , and Swiss people generally code - switch quite quickly , indicating that we are not dealing with a standard - dialect continuum [ REF ] . Given this state of affairs , contact between the two varieties is inevitable , so it is not surprising that research has reported interferences on the phonetic , morphological , syntactic , and lexical level for a long time [ REF ] . Regarding the specific topic of this study , i.e. vowels , there are only four acoustic studies on ALM dialects [ REF ] . Regarding SSG , vowels have been described in [ REF ] ] ; [ REF ] provided formant charts based on acoustic measurements . Only one study has compared ALM and SSG in Bern , St Gallen , and Zurich [ REF ] ; however , only the SSG vowels were transcribed auditorily . The current study will thus , for the first time , systematically investigate the vowel qualities of four ALM dialects and their respective SSG varieties with an instrumental phonetic approach , providing a comparative acoustic analysis of the long vowels produced by the same speakers from Bern ( BE ) , Chur ( GR ) , Brig ( VS ) and Zurich ( ZH).2 In particular , it will analyse to which extent SSG vowel qualities are determined by the speakers ’ dialect . After a short description of ALM dialects and the SSG varieties spoken in Germanspeaking Switzerland , each variety ’s long vowels will be illustrated , followed by a presentation of the research questions and hypotheses that have guided the current study . Swiss ALM dialects can be put into three subgroups : Low ALM , which can only be found in the city of Basel , High ALM , comprising the dialects of the northern half , and Highest ALM , spoken in the alpine southern half of German - speaking Switzerland [ REF ] . As High and Highest ALM make up most of the dialects in Germanspeaking Switzerland , this study will focus on these two . High and Highest ALM are defined by an average of multiple isoglosses that tend to divide German - speaking Switzerland into a northern and southern half . The most famous isogloss is hiatus diphthongisation . The northern half , i.e. High ALM , has developed a diphthong in Old High German ( OHG ) hiatus positions whereas the southern half , i.e. Highest ALM , maintained a monophthong [ REF ] . For instance , the ALM equivalents of the standard German verb bauen ‘ to build ’ are traditionally pronounced with a diphthong as e.g. [ » b8ou9 . ´ ] in the northern half , and with a monophthong as e.g. [ » b8u˘. ´ ] in the southern half . However , either dialect group is not as homogeneous as their names might suggest . Rather , along with the north – south divide , which itself is not a clear divide but a transition zone , there exists also an east – west",3.2306513282637637,1.1059211348765088,0.427877031982865,0.05648282854228868,0.7232869389025789,0.7298932804001702,0.05116279069767442,0.08682170542635659,0.09147286821705426,0.010852713178294573,0.16434108527131783,0.07596899224806201,0.08062015503875969,0.12248062015503876,0.19689922480620156,0.03565891472868217,0.015503875968992248,0.009302325581395349,0.021705426356589147,0.02945736434108527,True,228.0,0.7984496124031008,4.262015503875969,645.0,0.02475685234305924,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013262599469496022,0.01856763925729443,0.015915119363395226,0.013953488372093023,55.906340909090915,11.883376208897484,12.161744961471694,14.208471953578337,15.37296905222437,12.864371373307542,54.67011605415861,7.45,17.551088811820637,41912254.479977205,64980.23950384063,5.06963249516441,4.0,2.884458867745865,25.85,23.0,14.633096049708687,1.4738878143133463,1.0,0.7779573082681804,517,239,0.4622823984526112,2749,20,7
"Reference is ubiquitous in conversation : as speakers interact , they refer to entities relevant to their interaction . A commonly used form of reference is a referring expression with a noun phrase – in its wide variety of forms ranging from pronouns , definite and indefinite descriptions , to proper nouns [ REF ] – at its centre , here referred to as NP REs . As interlocutors are engaged in interactive communication , some changes can typically be observed in the NP REs they produce over the course of their interaction – what I will call changes - in - interaction.1 Firstly , their contributions generally tend to become more similar , both lexically and in terms of the grammatical constructions employed . This convergence on forms of expression has been argued to be linked with the cognitive process of speakers aligning on their linguistic representations , as outlined by the Interactive Alignment Model [ REF ] , and is well - documented in psycholinguistic research , especially for lexical convergence . It has been proposed that speakers form conceptual pacts in interaction on which they lexically entrain , and that they establish referential precedents [ REF ] . The second change - in - interaction that has been widely observed in the use of NP REs is that interlocutors tend to shorten their contributions [ REF ] , a phenomenon with has been referred to as “ referential contraction ” [ REF ] . The present chapter will predominantly be concerned with this latter process of change - in - interaction – though the two processes generally occur in parallel . In observing the shortening process , this chapter especially aims to describe central trends of structural change - in - interaction in the NP REs produced over multiple rounds of interactive dialogue . Specifically , the following research questions are addressed : 1 . What is the degree to which speakers ’ NP REs ( produced in a repeated referential communication task ) are shortened over the course of a dialogic interaction ? Which elements of the NP REs are subject to shortening ? 2 . What structural changes can be observed in the production of NP REs across four rounds of an interactive referential communication task ? To investigate change - in - interaction in the use of NP REs , a referential communication task was devised that elicited spoken dialogic conversation over four rounds of interaction , during which interlocutors repeatedly referred to the same sets of visual stimuli . A typical shortening process is illustrated in Example ( 1 ) , taken from the resulting corpus of spoken interactive dialogue , with the initial first - round NP RE produced for a visual stimulus in ( 1a ) and a selection of subsequent references to that same stimulus in ( 1b – d ) . In line with previous research , the initial NP RE in ( 1a ) is longer and gets shortened over the course of the interaction , with interlocutors also converging on a particular NP RE , namely the green dress shirt . The focus of this study is on how speakers , as they converge on forms of expression and shorten their NP REs , change in terms of their preferred grammatical structure for the NP REs they produce . Particularly , the aim is to describe general tendencies regarding the types and forms of modifying and descriptive elements in the NP RE construction preferred throughout the interaction . Example ( 1 ) illustrates a typical trajectory of change observed in the present study : the structure of the NP RE changes from the initial presence of post - head clausal elements ( e.g. it ’s green ) in rounds 1 and 2 , to a relatively greater frequency of phrasal ( pre-)modification ( e.g. green )",3.096849816348162,0.9360875573280794,0.45778375133951105,0.05565533171515927,0.8050154745578766,0.7844943640863195,0.04776579352850539,0.08628659476117104,0.1448382126348228,0.01386748844375963,0.2110939907550077,0.09399075500770417,0.0847457627118644,0.04930662557781202,0.14329738058551617,0.032357473035439135,0.01078582434514638,0.01848998459167951,0.040061633281972264,0.015408320493066256,True,256.0,0.8459167950693375,4.671802773497689,649.0,0.075,0.026630434782608695,0.017391304347826087,0.0,0.016304347826086956,0.009510869565217392,0.014130434782608696,0.0030816640986132513,39.9971266002845,14.937240398293032,16.62248984368584,19.32385016595543,18.108560455192034,14.313585585585585,63.62494073020388,10.052631578947368,17.359290576968313,34597451.352008216,53308.8618675011,5.293693693693694,4.0,3.3166595394720635,29.210526315789473,29.0,13.640415749831632,1.6216216216216217,1.0,1.0049790823340066,555,224,0.4036036036036036,3032,19,8
"The Insular Celtic languages have often been described as having a ‘ sentence word ’ [ REF ] , having a strong group accent which leads to individual word losing their ‘ phonological autonomy’1 [ REF ] , or even ‘ weakly polysynthetic ’ [ REF ] . All these characterisations relate to the fact that , compared with other European languages , the ( early ) Insular Celtic languages sport a rather large set of phonologically and morphologically bound formatives — including , among others , incorporated adjectives or adverbs [ REF]—and a lot of phonological and morpho - phonological interaction between the elements of a phrase . What these broad descriptions usually lack is a set of criteria that define ‘ wordhood ’ or ‘ phonological autonomy ’ , and a detailed study of the morphological and phonological boundaries , interdependencies and processes that could define a form of ‘ word ’ in the respective languages . In this , they concur with contemporary native grammars which do not give a definition of wordhood . Early Irish grammars had no concept corresponding to the modern ‘ word ’ , the basic unit of description being the focal which refers to any kind of syntactic group [ REF ] . The Middle Welsh grammars have even less to say about words : the unit usually equated with the modern concept , a geir , ‘ is made out of syllables ’ and geireu ‘ are the parts of a correct utterance ’ [ REF ] . The last decades of typological research on wordhood have shown that languages may lack a unified word domain , that is a single phonological , morphological and syntactic entity that could unambiguously be called a word — having no or several conflicting domains is possible . Based on current work [ REF ] , this study will provide a detailed investigation of the potential word - like properties of the verbal complex of Middle Welsh prose , focusing on the manuscripts of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries . Poetry will be used to illustrate interesting differences between the two genres or to gain additional insights that can not be found in prose . The restriction to finite verbal structures is based on Dixon and Aikhenvald 's ( 2002 : 14 ) observation that wordhood patterns may vary between different parts of speech within the same language . The Middle Welsh verbal complex , defined for the purposes of this study as the finite verb and its satellites , as exemplified in ( 1)2 can contain a variety of more or less grammatical markers , including conjunctions , polarity markers and P- and T - markers . In his particular example , the verbal complex consists of eight markers , starting with a subordinating conjunction can- , followed by a negative marker ny- , an object marker -yand a resultative marker ry- . The lexical root wel- ‘ to see ’ is then followed by elements familiar from most Indo - European languages , such as a TAM marker -s- and an agreement and TAM marker -ei . The final slot is occupied by a bound pronoun -ef . All of these markers will be discussed in more detail in Section 3 . The study is organised into three main parts : Section 2 explains the approach taken in this study , Section 3 discusses the morphological structuring of the verbal complex , and Section 4 discusses the phonological and prosodic processes that operate inside the verbal complex and how they map onto the morphological structure outlined in Section 3 . The final Section 5 , sums up and discusses the findings and discusses further possible avenues of study .",3.0908801975518534,0.8993658486431765,0.45343736923274147,0.05684115173019376,0.7467846423387527,0.7650965387001634,0.0430622009569378,0.12280701754385964,0.10047846889952153,0.019138755980861243,0.20893141945773525,0.09728867623604466,0.10845295055821372,0.03508771929824561,0.14832535885167464,0.02073365231259968,0.012759170653907496,0.007974481658692184,0.028708133971291867,0.03987240829346093,True,240.0,0.8405103668261563,4.588516746411483,627.0,0.021410219811590067,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011418783899514702,0.011989723094490437,0.0077076791321724234,0.02711323763955343,41.62320612668745,14.837554517133956,14.554592549557764,17.272066458982348,17.940718587746623,13.802093457943926,60.00259605399792,9.0,16.73808420838995,18589067.71056824,29647.635902022714,5.20373831775701,4.0,3.06770714809541,29.72222222222222,30.5,13.847605310648703,1.5962616822429907,1.0,0.9828363716263062,535,270,0.5046728971962616,2877,18,9
"Working memory ( WM ) is a core function of the cognitive system responsible for holding information briefly available for further processing . It has long been shown that the phonological similarity between items in a to - be - remembered list induces confusion errors ( Baddeley , 1966 ) . When participants study lists such as “ rat , fat , mat ” and are asked to recall them in serial order , they confuse the order of these words more often compared to lists such as “ wall , dig , bend ” . Semantically similar lists such as “ leopard , cheetah , lion ” , by contrast , do not reliably lead to such confusion errors compared to semantically dissimilar lists , such as “ sky , pen , pillow ” . In this work , we comprehensively tested the boundary conditions in which semantic similarity could induce confusion errors . Based on our results , we arrived at the conclusion that semantic and phonological information play different roles in the short - term maintenance of serial / positional information . This study is motivated by models postulating an item ’s position in WM is maintained through item - context binding , as implemented in many computational models of serial recall . In these models , serial position is temporarily maintained by binding items – such as words – to contexts – such as a word ’s serial position in a list ( e.g. , binding the word “ wall ” to “ Position 1 ” ) . We illustrate this assumption in Fig . 1 . Suppose the to - be - remembered sequence is “ wall , dig , bend ” . If asked to recall the item that was presented in the third position , one can re - activate the context of third position and use it as cue to retrieve the word “ bend ” that is bound to it ( Fig . 1 , top ) . Likewise , if asked to recall where “ dig ” was presented , one can retrieve “ Position 2 ” ( Fig . 1 , bottom ) . The generic associative model in Fig . 1 allows this flexibility : Retrieving an item when cued with a context / position , but also retrieving a context / position when cued with an item . It is this item - context binding that we assume is responsible for maintaining the item ’s serial order in a list . This assumption is supported by modelling work that has identified item - context bindings as an essential component of working memory for lists as well as for visual - spatial arrays . It has long been established that the item - context bindings are subject to confusion errors . In the serial - recall literature , these errors are typically referred to as order errors , which is a specific type of confusion error appearing in tasks where people need to recall the items in their serial position of a list . When recalling lists of words in their serial order , people often recall the correct words from the list but in wrong list positions . For instance , when trying to recall the sequence “ wall , dig , bend ” people sometimes retrieve “ wall , bend",2.9632850996981346,0.6882075363355408,0.4344889269321334,0.08718291768933799,0.7478428192436695,0.7273050766242178,0.04609929078014184,0.0797872340425532,0.1099290780141844,0.010638297872340425,0.23049645390070922,0.12588652482269502,0.07446808510638298,0.012411347517730497,0.18262411347517732,0.031914893617021274,0.01773049645390071,0.024822695035460994,0.03723404255319149,0.008865248226950355,True,203.0,0.7978723404255319,4.156028368794326,564.0,0.05675954592363261,0.02304781561747506,0.02304781561747506,0.01582387340901273,0.014447884416924664,0.01238390092879257,0.015479876160990712,0.0,51.64513493800146,11.462131916223822,13.333152626285301,14.569094508700637,12.506247785766384,11.622231947483588,48.02011045118266,5.714285714285714,15.418629195124247,4968503.246770192,8809.402919805305,4.894967177242888,4.0,2.770964814913249,21.761904761904763,22.0,10.169537901683972,1.5733041575492341,1.0,0.9211760045395173,457,189,0.4135667396061269,2344,21,10
