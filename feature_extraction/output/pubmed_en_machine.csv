"Furthermore , abnormal lipid metabolism has been found to be associated with the development and progression of tumors . Lipids play a crucial role in various cellular processes , including cell membrane formation , energy storage , and signaling pathways . Dysregulation of lipid metabolism can lead to the accumulation of lipids , such as cholesterol and triglycerides , which can promote tumor growth and metastasis . Cholesterol , a major component of cell membranes , has been shown to affect tumor cell proliferation and migration . High levels of cholesterol have been observed in various types of cancer , including breast , prostate , and colon cancer . Cholesterol metabolism is regulated by several key enzymes and pathways , such as the mevalonate pathway and the sterol regulatory element - binding protein ( SREBP ) pathway . Targeting these pathways with lipid - lowering drugs , such as statins , has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy . Triglycerides , another type of lipid , are the main storage form of energy in the body . Abnormal accumulation of triglycerides can lead to the formation of lipid droplets , which have been observed in several types of cancer cells . These lipid droplets provide a source of energy for tumor cells and contribute to their survival and proliferation . Targeting lipid droplet formation and metabolism may therefore be a potential strategy for cancer therapy . Sphingolipids , a class of complex lipids , have also been implicated in tumor development and progression . Sphingolipids are involved in regulating cell growth , apoptosis , and angiogenesis . Alterations in sphingolipid metabolism have been observed in various types of cancer , and targeting these pathways may have therapeutic potential . Lipid rafts , specialized membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids , have been found to play a role in tumor cell signaling and migration . Disruption of lipid rafts can inhibit tumor growth and metastasis , making them potential targets for cancer therapy . Adipocytes , cells specialized in lipid storage , are not only a source of energy but also play a role in tumor microenvironment . Adipocytes can secrete various factors , such as adipokines and inflammatory cytokines , which can promote tumor growth , angiogenesis , and metastasis . Targeting the interaction between adipocytes and tumor cells may provide new therapeutic opportunities . In conclusion , abnormal lipid metabolism is closely associated with tumor development and progression . Understanding the intricate pathways and mechanisms involved in lipid metabolism in tumors can provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies for cancer treatment . Additionally , interventions targeting lipid metabolism abnormalities may offer new avenues for improving the prognosis and survival of cancer patients . Overall , abnormal lipid metabolism has been found to be associated with the development and progression of tumors . Lipids , such as cholesterol , triglycerides , sphingolipids , lipid rafts , and adipocytes , play crucial roles in various cellular processes and can contribute to tumor growth , metastasis , and drug resistance . Targeting lipid metabolism pathways and abnormalities may provide new opportunities for cancer treatment and improving patient outcomes .",2.5598588929991832,0.2559526883550355,0.4642691618524649,0.05231080396870821,0.8925190220276514,0.8910258697426837,0.014925373134328358,0.13246268656716417,0.09514925373134328,0.3451492537313433,0.07276119402985075,0.10074626865671642,0.011194029850746268,0.10634328358208955,0.04477611940298507,0.05970149253731343,0.009328358208955223,False,180.0,0.8675373134328358,5.324626865671642,536.0,0.1581587488934789,0.11448804957214517,0.09560342283859545,0.09560342283859545,0.09560342283859545,0.0678666273236943,0.03304809678371201,0.013278253172027146,0.023900855709648863,0.007462686567164179,33.12890322580648,13.259268817204305,15.220704757020467,17.074408602150537,16.059096774193556,17.800086021505376,59.03010752688172,7.52,16.16736616521404,10505044.887465099,19598.96434228563,5.98494623655914,5.0,3.2298655465394215,18.6,18.0,3.97994974842648,1.8301075268817204,1.0,1.0302713857149077,465,163,0.35053763440860214,2854,25,1
"Introduction : The pursuit of global health equity is facing unprecedented challenges due to various factors such as economic inequality , climate change , mass migration , racialized violence , and global pandemics . In order to address these complex issues , interdisciplinary fields such as social medicine , collective health , and structural competency have emerged , each with their own unique histories and fragmented implementation within the health equity movement on both local and global levels . This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the historical backgrounds , theoretical foundations , and contemporary contributions of these three fields to the global health equity discourse . Furthermore , we argue that fostering intentional dialogue and collaboration between these fields can lead to a more productive and inclusive discourse , grounded in a shared understanding of their historical roots and theoretical frameworks . To facilitate this dialogue , we also propose the integration of pedagogical tools that align with critical and transformative pedagogies , which have the potential to bridge the gaps between these traditions and contribute to the realization of the human right to health . Historical Backgrounds : Social medicine , collective health , and structural competency have all evolved as responses to the social injustices and health inequities prevalent in different historical contexts . Social medicine emerged in the late 19th century as a critique of the biomedical model that focused solely on individual health outcomes , neglecting the social determinants of health . Its proponents argued for a more holistic approach that recognizes the impact of social , economic , and political factors on health disparities . Similarly , collective health emerged in the mid-20th century as a response to the growing recognition of the importance of collective action in addressing health inequities . It emphasized the role of communities and social movements in advocating for health rights and mobilizing for social change . Structural competency , on the other hand , emerged more recently as a framework that aims to equip healthcare professionals with the tools to understand and address the social and structural determinants of health . It emphasizes the need to critically examine the underlying structures and systems that perpetuate health inequities , and to advocate for policy changes that promote health equity . Theoretical Underpinnings : Each of these fields is grounded in distinct theoretical frameworks that inform their approaches to addressing health inequities . Social medicine draws upon social determinants of health theory , which emphasizes the importance of addressing the structural determinants of health such as poverty , education , and housing , in order to achieve health equity . Collective health is informed by theories of social justice and equity , highlighting the need for redistributive policies and the empowerment of marginalized communities . Structural competency draws upon critical theory and intersectionality , recognizing the ways in which multiple social identities and power structures intersect to shape health outcomes . By integrating these theoretical perspectives , an integrated framework can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between social , economic , and political factors that contribute to health inequities . Contemporary Contributions : In recent years , social medicine , collective health , and structural competency have made significant contributions to the global health equity movement . Social medicine has influenced the development of community - based participatory research approaches , which prioritize the involvement of communities in the research process and aim to address health inequities through community - driven interventions . Collective health has contributed to the rise of social movements and advocacy campaigns that seek to challenge the social and political determinants of health , such as the fight for universal healthcare coverage . Structural competency has informed the development of educational programs and curricula that aim to equip healthcare professionals with the knowledge and skills to address the social determinants of health in their practice , such as cultural humility and trauma - informed care . By recognizing and building upon these contributions , an integrated framework can harness the strengths of each field to create more effective strategies for advancing global health equity . Pedagogical Tools : To facilitate the integration and dialogue between social medicine , collective health , and structural competency , the use of pedagogical tools grounded in critical and transformative pedagogies can be instrumental . These pedagogical approaches emphasize critical thinking , reflexivity , and social transformation , and can help bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application . For example , problem - based learning exercises can encourage students to critically analyze real - world health disparities and propose solutions that address the underlying social determinants . Community engagement projects can provide opportunities for students to collaborate with marginalized communities and develop a deeper understanding of their health needs and aspirations .",3.082649329949203,0.529657184243025,0.47606497058541236,0.0477295611542881,0.9385433888435364,0.9315759763121605,0.014814814814814815,0.10123456790123457,0.14320987654320988,0.28888888888888886,0.020987654320987655,0.11358024691358025,0.022222222222222223,0.11234567901234568,0.08148148148148149,0.05308641975308642,0.0345679012345679,True,285.0,0.8987654320987655,5.671604938271605,810.0,0.11178974643716454,0.07884508606329817,0.06329816768461966,0.04812141402924301,0.04812141402924301,0.025171201184527113,0.01110494169905608,0.024430871737923375,0.02072922450490468,0.0012345679012345679,23.16005494505498,16.984945054945054,18.367666899608576,21.364835164835167,21.761648351648354,19.585934065934065,69.75824175824175,11.692307692307692,23.79532850036416,21586382227.00108,26649854.6012359,6.197802197802198,6.0,3.311550814352563,28.0,27.0,5.890017630899562,1.835164835164835,1.0,1.097086413735488,728,282,0.3873626373626374,4594,26,2

"Section 1 : Introduction Migraine is a common and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of intense headache accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea , vomiting , and sensitivity to light and sound . It affects a significant portion of the population , with an estimated global prevalence of 14.7 % ( Steiner et al . , 2018 ) . The impact of migraine on individuals ' quality of life , daily functioning , and productivity is substantial , making it an important public health concern . Therapeutic exercise , including various forms of physical activity and movement , has been proposed as a non - pharmacological approach for managing migraine symptoms and improving patients ' overall well - being . Exercise has the potential to alleviate pain , reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks , and enhance the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments ( Varkey et al . , 2011 ; Chaibi et al . , 2019 ) . However , the optimal type , intensity , and duration of exercise for individuals with migraine have not been clearly defined . To address this gap in knowledge and provide evidence - based recommendations , this clinical practice guideline aims to guide healthcare professionals , including neurologists , physical therapists , and exercise physiologists , in prescribing exercise for patients with migraine . The guideline was developed following rigorous methodologies recommended by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation ( AGREE ) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN ) . In this guideline , we present the results of a systematic literature review that evaluated the current evidence on the effectiveness of different types of exercise for migraine management . The quality of the identified studies was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development , and Evaluation ( GRADE ) methodology . Based on the evaluation of the evidence , we have assigned grades of recommendation to different exercise modalities , taking into account their impact on migraine symptoms , disability , and quality of life . The findings of this guideline provide healthcare professionals with valuable insights into the role of exercise in migraine management and offer evidence - based recommendations to support clinical decision - making . By implementing these recommendations , healthcare professionals can optimize the care provided to patients with migraine and improve their outcomes and quality of life . Please note that the complete guideline , including detailed recommendations and supporting evidence , can be accessed in the online version of this article , which also includes supplementary material ( 10.1186 / s10194 - 023 - 01571 - 8) .

"Current therapies for GBS include intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) and plasma exchange ( PE ) , which have shown effectiveness in improving patient prognosis . However , there is a need for new treatment strategies to further enhance outcomes . Recent developments in GBS immunotherapy have focused on targeting various components of the immune system involved in the disease pathogenesis . One approach to new immunotherapies for GBS is the targeting of antibodies . This involves the use of monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to and neutralize the pathogenic antibodies involved in the disease . By blocking the harmful effects of these antibodies , this strategy aims to alleviate symptoms and improve patient outcomes . Another area of research is focused on targeting the complement pathways , which are part of the immune system 's response to infection . Dysregulation of the complement system has been implicated in the development and progression of GBS . Modulating the complement pathways through targeted therapies may help to mitigate the immune - mediated damage to the peripheral nerves and improve patient prognosis . Immune cells , such as T cells and B cells , play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of GBS . Targeting these immune cells through immunotherapies aims to regulate their function and prevent their aberrant activation , which can lead to nerve damage . By modulating the activity of these cells , it is hoped that the progression of GBS can be halted or reversed . Cytokines , which are signaling molecules involved in immune responses , have also emerged as potential targets for GBS immunotherapy . Inflammatory cytokines , such as interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , have been found to be elevated in GBS patients . Blocking the action of these cytokines or modulating their levels may help to reduce inflammation and improve patient outcomes . Although these new immunotherapies hold promise , they are still in the early stages of investigation and have not yet been approved for the treatment of GBS . Clinical trials are ongoing to assess their safety and efficacy . Further research is needed to fully understand the complex pathogenesis of GBS and identify the most effective strategies for immunotherapy .

"In addition to PD - L1 tumor expression , there are several soluble biomarkers that show promise in predicting clinical outcomes in non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICI ) . These biomarkers can be measured through liquid biopsy , offering a less invasive and more accessible method of analysis compared to tumor - biopsy specimen analysis . One group of biomarkers is based on non - tumoral blood cell count . Studies have shown that certain ratios , such as absolute neutrophil counts , platelet to lymphocyte ratio , neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio , and derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio , can provide valuable information about the patient 's immune response and potential response to ICI . Another group of biomarkers is derived from immune checkpoint - related products . One such marker is soluble PD - L1 ( sPD - L1 ) , which can be detected in the blood and may indicate the level of immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment . Additionally , circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) can be detected , counted , and analyzed for marker expression , providing insight into tumor heterogeneity and potential treatment response . Circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) can also be analyzed for specific mutations or genetic alterations that may influence ICI response . Implementing liquid biopsies into clinical practice has the potential to revolutionize lung cancer management . By utilizing these biomarkers , clinicians can make more informed decisions about which patients are likely to benefit from ICI therapy and avoid unnecessary treatment for those who are unlikely to respond . Liquid biopsies also offer the opportunity for real - time monitoring of treatment response and the detection of minimal residual disease . In conclusion , the use of soluble biomarkers obtained through liquid biopsy has shown promise in predicting clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with ICI . These biomarkers offer a less invasive and more accessible method of analysis , providing valuable information about the patient 's immune response and potential treatment response . Implementing liquid biopsies into clinical practice has the potential to improve patient selection for ICI therapy and optimize lung cancer management . Furthermore , ongoing research and advancements in the field of liquid biopsies may lead to the discovery of additional biomarkers that can further enhance the prediction of ICI response and guide treatment decisions .

"Introduction : Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) is a highly aggressive brain tumor that is difficult to treat due to its resistance to standard therapies . Immunotherapies , which harness the body 's immune system to target and destroy cancer cells , have shown promise in other types of cancer but have been less successful in GBM . This resistance is attributed to various immunosuppressive factors present within the tumor microenvironment . To overcome these barriers , researchers have focused on developing combination immunotherapies that target multiple immune processes simultaneously . In this review , we will discuss the unique immunosuppressive factors in GBM and summarize the current evidence and outcomes of engineered and non - engineered treatments aimed at overcoming resistance to immunotherapy . We will also highlight the most promising strategies for targeted GBM immunotherapy combinatorial treatments and their potential to improve patient prognosis and clinical care . Immunosuppressive factors in GBM : GBM creates a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment that prevents immune cells from effectively attacking the tumor . One major contributing factor is the expression of immune checkpoint molecules such as programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD - L1 ) on tumor cells . These molecules interact with immune checkpoint receptors on T cells , leading to their inactivation and preventing an effective anti - tumor immune response . Additionally , GBM tumors recruit suppressive immune cells , such as regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) and myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) , which further dampen the immune response . The presence of these immunosuppressive factors poses a significant challenge to the success of immunotherapies in GBM . Engineered treatments to overcome immunotherapy resistance : Researchers have developed various engineered treatments to overcome immunotherapy resistance in GBM . One approach involves genetically modifying immune cells , such as T cells , to express chimeric antigen receptors ( CARs ) specific to GBM antigens . These CAR T cells can recognize and kill GBM cells , bypassing the immunosuppressive mechanisms employed by the tumor . Another strategy involves the use of oncolytic viruses , which selectively infect and destroy tumor cells while simultaneously stimulating an anti - tumor immune response . These engineered treatments have shown promise in preclinical studies and early - phase clinical trials , but further research is needed to optimize their efficacy and safety . Non - engineered treatments to overcome immunotherapy resistance : In addition to engineered treatments , non - engineered approaches are also being explored to overcome immunotherapy resistance in GBM . These include the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors , which block the interaction between immune checkpoint molecules and their receptors , thereby reactivating T cells and enhancing the anti - tumor immune response . Other approaches involve targeting the immunosuppressive factors within GBM , such as Tregs and MDSCs , using small molecule inhibitors or antibodies . These non - engineered treatments have shown some efficacy in early - phase clinical trials , but their effectiveness in overcoming immunotherapy resistance in GBM remains limited . Combinatorial immunotherapies : Given the complexity of immunosuppressive factors in GBM , combinatorial immunotherapies targeting multiple immune processes have emerged as a promising strategy . These combinations may include immune checkpoint inhibitors , CAR T cell therapy , oncolytic viruses , and agents targeting immunosuppressive cells . Preclinical studies and early - phase clinical trials have shown encouraging results , with improved overall survival and tumor regression rates compared to single - agent immunotherapies . However , challenges such as treatment - related toxicities and identifying the optimal combination and sequence of therapies still need to be addressed . Conclusion : Overcoming immunotherapy resistance in GBM is a major challenge due to the unique immunosuppressive factors present within the tumor microenvironment . Engineered and non - engineered treatments , as well as combinatorial immunotherapies , hold promise in improving patient outcomes . Further research is needed to optimize these approaches and develop personalized treatment strategies that take into account the individual characteristics of each patient 's tumor microenvironment . With continued advancements in immunotherapy , there is hope for overcoming barriers to effective GBM treatment and improving patient prognosis and clinical care .",2.8445115361220235,0.6403641072987921,0.4669706258959755,0.06364241957727225,0.8277120217680931,0.8383801491172226,0.025604551920341393,0.11379800853485064,0.14793741109530584,0.27880512091038406,0.032716927453769556,0.12802275960170698,0.01991465149359886,0.08961593172119488,0.059743954480796585,0.03982930298719772,0.025604551920341393,False,215.0,0.8748221906116643,5.638691322901849,703.0,0.17402486069438491,0.13844834976425205,0.07522503214744963,0.02957565366480926,0.0,0.0,0.011573081868838405,0.006858122588941277,0.030861551650235748,0.001422475106685633,23.86096091205212,15.191019880939013,16.034658225177566,18.1106593283163,18.866027743457266,19.89192182410424,65.30922161069302,9.344827586206897,16.986429178631212,23829364.451801542,33896.67774082723,6.307817589576548,6.0,3.597144740755462,21.17241379310345,22.0,5.272367560294353,1.9087947882736156,1.5,1.1758235786806228,614,248,0.40390879478827363,3964,29,11
"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla and extra - adrenal sympathetic ganglia , respectively . Currently , surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for localized disease . However , for patients with metastatic disease or unresectable tumors , there is a lack of effective systemic therapies . Recent studies have shown that epigenetic alterations play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas . Specifically , aberrant histone acetylation and deacetylation have been implicated in the dysregulation of gene expression , leading to tumor initiation and progression . Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) are enzymes that remove acetyl groups from histones , resulting in chromatin compaction and transcriptional repression . In contrast , histone acetyltransferases ( HATs ) add acetyl groups to histones , leading to chromatin relaxation and transcriptional activation . Given the pivotal role of HDACs in tumorigenesis , HDAC inhibitors ( HDACis ) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for various malignancies , including pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas . HDACis function by inhibiting the activity of HDAC enzymes , thereby promoting histone acetylation and altering the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation , apoptosis , and differentiation . Preclinical studies utilizing both in vitro cell lines and in vivo mouse models have demonstrated the efficacy of HDACis in suppressing tumor growth and inducing apoptosis in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma cells . Furthermore , several clinical trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of HDACis in patients with advanced or metastatic disease . These trials have shown promising results , with some patients experiencing disease stabilization or even partial responses to HDACi treatment . Importantly , HDACis have shown a favorable toxicity profile compared to traditional chemotherapeutic agents , making them attractive candidates for combination therapies or as alternative treatment options for patients who are not candidates for surgery or have failed other systemic therapies . Furthermore , the development of selective HDACis that target specific HDAC isoforms may further enhance the therapeutic efficacy and reduce off - target effects . In conclusion , the emerging evidence from preclinical and clinical studies supports the use of HDACis as a novel therapeutic approach for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas . These agents have demonstrated antitumor activity and offer a potential treatment option for patients with advanced or metastatic disease . Further research is needed to optimize their use , identify predictive biomarkers , and develop rational combination strategies to improve patient outcomes . Overall , histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDACis ) have shown promise as a therapeutic approach for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas . These rare neuroendocrine tumors have limited treatment options , particularly for patients with metastatic or unresectable disease . Epigenetic alterations , specifically aberrant histone acetylation and deacetylation , have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these tumors .

Additionally , several clinical trials have shown promising results , with some patients experiencing disease stabilization or partial responses to HDACi treatment . One of the advantages of HDACis is their favorable toxicity profile compared to traditional chemotherapeutic agents . This makes them attractive candidates for combination therapies or as alternative treatment options for patients who are not suitable candidates for surgery or have failed other systemic therapies . Furthermore , the development of selective HDACis that target specific HDAC isoforms may further enhance their therapeutic efficacy and reduce off - target effects .

"Title : cGAMP as a Travelling Messenger : Mechanisms , Disease Implications , and Therapeutic Applications Introduction : The cGAS - STING pathway plays a crucial role in the detection of microbial invasion , cellular damage , and the subsequent induction of immune responses . The cyclic dinucleotide 2’3’-cGAMP , produced by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS , acts as a second messenger to activate STING , the central hub of DNA sensing . This activation leads to the production of type - I interferons and pro - inflammatory cytokines , which are essential for mounting effective immune responses against infections , cancer , and cellular stress . Traditionally , it was believed that pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) detect pathogens or danger signals and induce the production of interferons and cytokines within the same cell where sensing occurs . These soluble mediators then signal in an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce responses in neighboring cells . However , recent studies have challenged this dogma by revealing alternative mechanisms by which 2’3’-cGAMP can travel to neighboring cells and activate STING independently of DNA sensing by cGAS . The ability of 2’3’-cGAMP to traverse cellular boundaries and modulate immune responses in remote cells has significant implications in various diseases . The dysregulation of the cGAS - STING pathway has been implicated in the pathology of numerous inflammatory diseases , while its proper activation is crucial for effective immune responses against microbial invaders and cancer . Therefore , understanding the mechanisms underlying the transport of 2’3’-cGAMP and its effects on distant cells is of utmost importance in both basic and translational research . In this review , we aim to provide an overview of the rapidly evolving discoveries regarding the transport mechanisms of 2’3’-cGAMP . Furthermore , we will discuss the diseases in which these mechanisms play a crucial role and explore the potential applications of this change in perspective in vaccine design , cancer immunotherapies , and the treatment of cGAS - STING associated diseases . By shedding light on these new findings , we hope to contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the cGAS - STING pathway .

"The Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway has been found to play a critical role in HPV - induced cervical cancer . HPV oncoproteins expressed in HPV - positive cancers lead to the activation of this pathway , which in turn promotes the expression of genes involved in tumor cell markers . This activation allows the transformed cells to evade detection by the immune system , specifically T lymphocytes and dendritic cells . One of the key consequences of Wnt / β - catenin signaling in cervical cancer is the upregulation of programmed cell death - ligand 1 ( PD - L1 ) on the surface of tumor cells . PD - L1 acts as an inhibitory immune checkpoint , controlling the inflammatory function of T - cells . When PD - L1 is expressed at high levels on tumor cells , it prevents T - cells from recognizing and attacking these cells . This disruption in immune cell recognition of tumor cells contributes to the development and progression of cervical cancer malignancy . Furthermore , tumor - infiltrating T CD4 + cells with elevated levels of PD-1 and CD39 release significant amounts of cytokines , further promoting tumor growth and immune evasion . The dysregulation of the Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway in HPV - related cervical cancer thus not only affects the expression of PD - L1 but also influences the production of cytokines that contribute to tumor progression . Based on these findings , it is hypothesized that targeting the Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway could be a promising approach for immunotherapy and cancer prevention in HPV - induced cervical cancer . By blocking this pathway , it may be possible to restore the immune system 's ability to recognize and eliminate tumor cells , thereby halting the development and progression of cervical cancer . In conclusion , the Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway plays a significant role in the dysregulation of the PD-1 / PD - L1 axis in HPV - related cervical cancer . Further understanding of the mechanisms involved in this pathway and its interaction with the immune system could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment and prevention of cervical cancer . Overall , the dysregulation of the Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway in HPV - related cervical cancer leads to the upregulation of PD - L1 on tumor cells , preventing immune cell recognition and promoting tumor progression . Targeting this pathway could potentially restore immune cell recognition and eliminate tumor cells , offering a promising approach for immunotherapy and cancer prevention . Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms involved and develop effective therapeutic strategies . Furthermore , the interaction between the Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway and the PD-1 / PD - L1 axis in HPV - related cervical cancer highlights the potential for combination therapies . Current immunotherapies targeting PD-1 / PD - L1 have shown promising results in various cancers , including cervical cancer . However , resistance to these therapies can develop , emphasizing the need for alternative approaches . Combining PD-1 / PD - L1 blockade with inhibition of the Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway may offer a synergistic effect , enhancing the immune response against tumor cells . By blocking the Wnt / β - catenin pathway , tumor cells may become more susceptible to immune recognition and elimination . Additionally , inhibition of this pathway could reduce the expression of PD - L1 on tumor cells , further enhancing the anti - tumor immune response . In conclusion , targeting both the Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway and the PD-1 / PD - L1 axis holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy for HPV - related cervical cancer . Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms involved and to develop effective combination therapies that can overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes .",3.04773025741102,0.667789065623195,0.42841003320770116,0.06622080305368987,0.8432235510452933,0.8487657579508695,0.02384500745156483,0.12071535022354694,0.08345752608047691,0.26825633383010433,0.028315946348733235,0.12071535022354694,0.013412816691505217,0.10432190760059612,0.08792846497764531,0.03129657228017884,0.010432190760059613,False,200.0,0.8524590163934426,4.846497764530551,671.0,0.3018867924528302,0.280979092299847,0.25854156042835286,0.17720550739418664,0.11295257521672616,0.10224375318714941,0.04589495155532891,0.01963284038755737,0.022947475777664456,0.0014903129657228018,35.40082787958116,14.252838132635254,15.247664890283005,17.089267015706806,16.424829842931935,15.315602094240834,62.26941535776614,9.166666666666666,17.411295571954987,36444298.04532013,54313.40990360675,5.50261780104712,5.0,3.150458032933425,23.875,25.0,6.125850281117444,1.7399650959860384,1.0,0.9510303031581935,573,200,0.34904013961605584,3252,24,15

"Introduction : Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is a major public health concern worldwide , with significant morbidity and mortality rates . It is well - established that dysregulation of cellular processes plays a crucial role in the development and progression of CRC . Non - coding RNAs , particularly long non - coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) , have emerged as important players in various cellular processes , including tumorigenesis . Recent studies have indicated that lncRNAs can interact with the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling pathway , which is known to be dysregulated in CRC . However , the specific role of mTOR - associated lncRNAs in CRC tumorigenesis remains poorly understood . Therefore , this systematic review aims to explore the potential impact of abnormal mTOR - associated lncRNAs in colorectal tissue and their role in CRC development . Methods : The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines were followed to conduct a comprehensive search of seven databases , including PubMed , Embase , and Web of Science . The search strategy included keywords related to colorectal cancer , lncRNAs , and mTOR signaling . Articles were included if they reported on the association between lncRNAs and the mTOR signaling pathway in CRC . A total of 200 articles were initially identified , and after applying the inclusion criteria , 24 articles were included for further analysis . Results : The analysis of the included articles revealed that 23 lncRNAs were found to be associated with the mTOR signaling pathway in CRC . Among these , 79.16 % of lncRNAs were up - regulated , while 20.84 % were down - regulated in CRC tissues . These findings suggest that dysregulation of mTOR - associated lncRNAs may play a significant role in CRC tumorigenesis . The specific mechanisms by which these lncRNAs interact with the mTOR pathway and their functional implications in CRC require further investigation . Conclusion : This systematic review highlights the potential importance of abnormal mTOR - associated lncRNAs in CRC tumorigenesis . Understanding the dynamic interplay between lncRNAs and the mTOR signaling pathway can provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC development . Moreover , targeting these dysregulated lncRNAs may offer novel therapeutic strategies for the management of CRC . Further research is warranted to elucidate the functional roles of specific lncRNAs in CRC and to explore their potential as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers . Ultimately , unraveling the complex interplay between lncRNAs and mTOR signaling could pave the way for the development of personalized therapeutic interventions in CRC.In summary , this systematic review focused on examining the association between long non - coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) and the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling pathway in colorectal cancer ( CRC ) .

"The activation of the cell cycle is a crucial step in thyroid hormone - induced apoptosis and stem cell development during intestinal metamorphosis . Amphibian metamorphosis , similar to postembryonic development in mammals , is characterized by the maturation of various organs into their adult forms and the peak concentration of plasma thyroid hormone ( T3 ) . T3 is known to play a causative role in amphibian metamorphosis , and its independence from maternal influence makes it an ideal model for studying the regulation of adult organ development . One specific aspect of metamorphosis that has been extensively studied is intestinal remodeling . This process involves the degeneration of the larval epithelium through apoptosis , followed by the formation of new adult stem cells and their subsequent proliferation and differentiation to form the adult epithelium . Through investigations into intestinal remodeling , researchers have gained valuable molecular insights into how T3 regulates cell fate during development . Evidence has emerged suggesting that T3 - induced activation of the cell cycle program is crucial for both larval epithelial cell death and the de novo formation of adult intestinal stem cells . The activation of cell cycle machinery allows for the controlled progression of cells through the different phases of the cell cycle , including DNA replication and cell division . This activation is likely necessary for the efficient elimination of larval epithelial cells and the subsequent formation of new adult stem cells . Furthermore , studies have shown that T3 can directly affect the expression of cell cycle - related genes and proteins in the intestinal epithelium . These changes in gene expression may lead to the upregulation of cell cycle progression , facilitating the transition from larval epithelium to adult stem cells . In conclusion , the activation of the cell cycle program is a critical component of T3 - induced apoptosis and stem cell development during intestinal metamorphosis . Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process will provide valuable insights into the regulation of cell fate during development and may have implications for regenerative medicine and cancer research . Additionally , further research is needed to fully elucidate the specific molecular pathways through which T3 regulates the cell cycle during intestinal metamorphosis . This knowledge could potentially lead to the development of therapeutic interventions that target these pathways to promote tissue regeneration and repair in various contexts . Overall , the study of cell cycle activation in thyroid hormone - induced apoptosis and stem cell development during intestinal metamorphosis has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms by which T3 regulates adult organ development . This research has the potential to contribute to our understanding of developmental biology and may have implications for various fields , including regenerative medicine , cancer research , and tissue engineering .

The guidelines for the care of CRAO patients by the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association are a good starting point . Advances in neuroprotection for retinal diseases and AIS have shown promising results with newer drugs and therapies such as Uric acid , Nerinetide , Otaplimastat , Angiopoietin , KUS 121 , gene therapy , and hypothermia . By extrapolating findings from AIS , there is potential for improving outcomes in NA - CRAO . Combining neuroprotection with thrombolysis can extend the therapeutic window for NA - CRAO treatment , providing more opportunities for effective intervention . Efforts should be directed towards developing better imaging techniques , such as high - definition optical coherence angiography and electrophysiology , to accurately identify the penumbra after an acute episode of NA - CRAO . Additionally , a deeper understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in NA - CRAO is necessary to develop targeted neuroprotective interventions . Bridging the gap between preclinical and clinical neuroprotection is crucial for advancing the field of neuroprotection for NA - CRAO and improving patient outcomes .",2.9343618135081324,0.5817917119618982,0.4662286654100377,0.051890598052763234,0.8504413479850406,0.853172168135643,0.006896551724137931,0.14310344827586208,0.12586206896551724,0.22241379310344828,0.03620689655172414,0.09310344827586207,0.010344827586206896,0.13793103448275862,0.05862068965517241,0.032758620689655175,0.005172413793103448,False,172.0,0.8517241379310345,5.389655172413793,580.0,0.9225371120107962,0.9225371120107962,0.9087719298245615,0.8960863697705803,0.8812415654520918,0.8812415654520918,0.019433198380566803,0.04129554655870445,0.045344129554655874,0.056896551724137934,28.322933510151813,14.921058167184928,16.854830134578368,19.25769160417048,18.703543076641665,18.891428571428573,66.45408816535577,9.909090909090908,15.369117956777517,4728497.02738124,8152.581081691794,6.122736418511066,5.0,3.703691420430198,22.59090909090909,23.0,7.407975376143857,1.8390342052313884,1.0,1.114313980311351,497,128,0.2575452716297787,3126,22,19

"The blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) is a highly regulated system that controls the transport of molecules between the blood and the brain . In normal physiological conditions , the BBB is impermeable to most drugs and therapeutic agents , which limits their effectiveness in treating diseases of the central nervous system ( CNS ) . However , during the development of glioblastoma ( GBM ) , a type of aggressive brain tumor , the BBB becomes pathologically disrupted , leading to increased permeability . This pathological fenestration of the BBB in GBM offers a unique opportunity to enhance drug delivery to the brain . However , current therapeutic strategies for GBM still face challenges due to the obstacles posed by the BBB . Systemic toxicity and limited intracerebral transport of therapeutic agents are major concerns in GBM treatment . Chemotherapy , one of the main treatment modalities for GBM , can paradoxically promote the restoration of BBB function , further hindering the delivery of therapeutic agents to the tumor site . This phenomenon , known as the "" chemotherapy - induced BBB rebound , "" can significantly reduce the efficacy of GBM chemotherapy and contribute to treatment failure . To overcome these challenges , researchers have been investigating strategies to regulate the pathological BBB and enhance the transport of therapeutic agents across the barrier . These strategies include the use of BBB disruption techniques , such as focused ultrasound and osmotic disruption , to temporarily increase BBB permeability . Additionally , nanotechnology - based drug delivery systems and targeted therapies are being explored to improve the specificity and efficacy of GBM treatment . This article provides a comprehensive review of the structure and function of the BBB in both physiological and pathological states . It also discusses the underlying mechanisms of BBB disruption in GBM and the potential therapeutic strategies that target the BBB to enhance drug delivery to the brain . By understanding the complexities of BBB regulation and its role in GBM pathogenesis , we can develop novel approaches for the effective and safe treatment of this devastating disease . In conclusion , the regulation of the pathological blood - brain barrier is crucial for enhancing drug delivery and developing effective therapeutics for glioblastoma . The disruption of the BBB in GBM provides an opportunity to improve drug transport to the brain , but current strategies face challenges such as systemic toxicity and limited intracerebral transport . Overcoming these challenges requires the exploration of techniques to temporarily increase BBB permeability , as well as the development of targeted drug delivery systems and therapies . Understanding the structure , function , and mechanisms of BBB disruption in GBM is essential for developing novel approaches to effectively treat this aggressive brain tumor while minimizing side effects . By regulating the pathological BBB in GBM , researchers can potentially improve the delivery of therapeutic agents to the tumor site and increase treatment efficacy . Techniques such as focused ultrasound and osmotic disruption can temporarily increase BBB permeability , allowing for enhanced drug transport . Additionally , nanotechnology - based drug delivery systems and targeted therapies can improve the specificity and effectiveness of GBM treatment . Understanding the complexities of BBB regulation and its role in GBM pathogenesis is crucial for the development of new approaches to treat this devastating disease . By overcoming the challenges posed by the BBB , researchers can enhance drug delivery to the brain and improve the overall outcomes for patients with GBM . Continued research and innovation in this field hold promise for the effective and safe treatment of this aggressive brain tumor .",2.910213213936073,0.49950476347888806,0.43633050306399596,0.056713082230421416,0.9143608730772267,0.9101690406149084,0.029459901800327332,0.10310965630114566,0.09492635024549918,0.27168576104746317,0.029459901800327332,0.10147299509001637,0.016366612111292964,0.12438625204582651,0.10801963993453355,0.044189852700491,0.01309328968903437,False,219.0,0.8968903436988543,5.343698854337152,611.0,0.26270967741935486,0.19974193548387098,0.17290322580645162,0.14761290322580645,0.1047741935483871,0.07793548387096774,0.014451612903225806,0.012387096774193548,0.010064516129032258,0.0,35.30040754257911,14.008065693430655,15.956303952927545,17.965450121654502,17.507506082725058,17.26087591240876,64.62165450121654,9.541666666666666,18.848770886948618,153432438.33311275,251116.92034879336,5.843065693430657,5.0,3.3993622334526985,22.833333333333332,22.0,3.901566636906542,1.7536496350364963,1.0,1.0267789447256812,548,188,0.34306569343065696,3265,24,21
"In summary , this systematic review and meta - analysis compared the long - term effectiveness of self - locking stand - alone cages ( SSC ) with cage - plate constructs ( CPC ) in monosegmental anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF ) . Ten trials with 979 patients were included in the analysis . The results showed that SSC had several advantages over CPC . SSC significantly reduced operative time , intraoperative blood loss , duration of hospitalization , cervical Cobb angle at final follow - up , 1 - month postoperative dysphagia rate , and incidence of adjacent segment degeneration ( ASD ) at final follow - up . However , there was no significant difference between SSC and CPC in terms of 1 - month postoperative cervical Cobb angle , JOA scores , NDI scores , fusion rate , and cage subsidence rate at final follow - up . Both SSC and CPC showed similar long - term effectiveness in terms of JOA scores , NDI scores , fusion rate , and cage subsidence rate in monosegmental ACDF . However , SSC was found to be superior to CPC in reducing surgical duration , intraoperative bleeding , duration of hospitalization , as well as rates of dysphagia and ASD after surgery . On the other hand , SSC was inferior to CPC in maintaining cervical curvature at long - term follow - up . It is important to note that the impact of radiological changes on clinical symptoms still needs to be confirmed in trials with longer follow - up periods . Additional research is necessary to further evaluate the long - term effectiveness and outcomes of SSC and CPC in monosegmental ACDF . Supplementary material is available in the online version of the article . The supplementary material is available at 10.1186 / s13018 - 023 - 03885 - 4 . This systematic review and meta - analysis provide valuable insights into the comparison of SSC and CPC in monosegmental ACDF , but further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the potential impact of radiological changes on clinical symptoms over a longer follow - up period . Overall , this study suggests that self - locking stand - alone cages ( SSC ) may be a better option than cage - plate constructs ( CPC ) in monosegmental anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF ) . SSC showed advantages in reducing surgical duration , intraoperative bleeding , duration of hospitalization , dysphagia rates , and the incidence of adjacent segment degeneration ( ASD ) . However , CPC was superior in maintaining cervical curvature at long - term follow - up . It is important to continue studying the long - term effectiveness and outcomes of both SSC and CPC in monosegmental ACDF , as well as to investigate the potential impact of radiological changes on clinical symptoms . This will provide further evidence to guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes in this surgical procedure .",2.981664840675758,0.7356692699930366,0.4650458415174772,0.07206914887882722,0.8011332224397099,0.7876044362783432,0.02564102564102564,0.17159763313609466,0.1341222879684418,0.252465483234714,0.029585798816568046,0.0650887573964497,0.015779092702169626,0.11439842209072978,0.045364891518737675,0.03747534516765286,0.009861932938856016,False,154.0,0.8126232741617357,4.658777120315582,507.0,0.496513249651325,0.4686192468619247,0.42677824267782427,0.3716875871687587,0.3054393305439331,0.2601115760111576,0.019525801952580194,0.02684797768479777,0.03486750348675035,0.015779092702169626,36.82380734553172,13.905994431185363,15.396364500830384,17.234738796075312,15.771036860249268,14.840381861575175,57.88398302837444,8.055555555555555,13.175015506038967,527031.4515161322,1039.5097663040083,5.427207637231503,4.0,3.16021276319756,23.27777777777778,23.5,9.987801201440995,1.730310262529833,1.0,1.1420839509390424,419,164,0.3914081145584726,2362,18,22

"Introduction : Gasdermin D ( GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis is a cellular process that plays a crucial role in host defense against stimuli and infections . It functions by inducing cell death and triggering inflammation to eliminate pathogens . However , dysregulated GSDMD activation has been implicated in the development of various inflammatory diseases , highlighting the need for understanding its mechanisms and exploring potential therapeutic inhibitors . This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of GSDMD activation , its role in disease pathogenesis , and the development of GSDMD inhibitors . Mechanisms of GSDMD Activation : GSDMD activation involves several intricate steps . It is initially cleaved by inflammatory caspases , such as caspase-1 , -4 , or -5 , releasing the N - terminal fragment . This fragment then forms oligomers and binds to phosphoinositides on the plasma membrane , leading to the assembly of GSDMD pores . These pores disrupt the membrane integrity , causing cell swelling and eventual rupture , accompanied by the release of pro - inflammatory cytokines , including interleukin ( IL)-1β and IL-18 . The precise molecular details of GSDMD activation , including the regulation of caspase - GSDMD complexes and the formation of GSDMD pores , are areas of active research . GSDMD - Mediated Diseases : Abnormal GSDMD activation has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases . Sepsis , a life - threatening condition resulting from systemic infection , is characterized by excessive inflammation and organ dysfunction . GSDMD - mediated pyroptosis has been identified as a major contributor to sepsis pathogenesis . Similarly , COVID-19 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV-2 ) , triggers an exacerbated immune response , partly mediated by GSDMD - induced pyroptosis . Neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's , have also been linked to GSDMD activation , suggesting a potential role in neuronal cell death . Furthermore , GSDMD - mediated pyroptosis has been implicated in NASH , IBD , and malignant tumors , highlighting its involvement in chronic inflammatory conditions and cancer progression . Inhibitors of GSDMD Activation : Given the detrimental effects of dysregulated GSDMD activation , inhibiting its activity has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy . Understanding the structure of GSDMD and its pores has provided valuable insights into the development of inhibitors .

"The amygdala is a key component of the brain 's emotional regulation system and plays a crucial role in sleep / wake cycles and narcolepsy with cataplexy . Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden episodes of sleep during wakefulness . Type 1 narcolepsy is believed to be caused by the loss of neurons containing the arousal neuropeptide Orexin . Patients with type 1 narcolepsy often experience cataplexy , which is the sudden paralysis of voluntary muscles triggered by strong emotions . The amygdala has been identified as a critical node in the neural network connecting emotional regulation to cataplexy . Studies using functional neuroimaging in humans and behavioral paradigms in rodents have provided evidence supporting the involvement of the amygdala in narcolepsy . Specifically , the central nucleus of the amygdala ( CeA ) , basolateral amygdala ( BLA ) , and the extended amygdala , including the bed nucleus of stria terminalis ( BNST ) , have been implicated in narcolepsy with cataplexy . These regions of the amygdala are involved in regulating transitions between emotional arousal states . Further research into the neurocircuitry of the amygdala and its role in emotional arousal states may greatly contribute to our understanding of the underlying causes of narcolepsy with cataplexy . This knowledge could lead to improved treatment options for individuals with this sleep disorder .

"1 . Introduction Glycans , which are attached to proteins , lipids , or form long , complex chains , play a crucial role in various biological processes . These versatile post - translational modifications surround all human cells and contribute to cell signaling , adhesion , and immune recognition . The immune system constantly monitors the unique glycan structures on cell surfaces , enabling it to differentiate between self and non - self as well as healthy and malignant cells . Aberrant glycosylations , known as tumour - associated carbohydrate antigens ( TACAs ) , are highly prevalent in cancer cells and are associated with various aspects of cancer biology . TACAs have been extensively studied as potential targets for monoclonal antibodies in cancer diagnosis and therapy . However , the dense and thick glycocalyx surrounding tumour cells , along with the complex tumour microenvironment , pose significant challenges for the effective targeting and delivery of conventional antibodies in vivo . To overcome these limitations , researchers have turned their attention to small antibody fragments . These fragments , derived from full - length antibodies , offer several advantages over their larger counterparts , including increased tissue penetration , enhanced binding affinity , and improved pharmacokinetics . In this review , we will explore the recent advances in small antibody fragments specifically targeting glycans on tumour cells and discuss their benefits compared to conventional antibodies .

"The D - Health Trial aimed to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the gut microbiome in older Australians . This study utilized a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial design , with a total of 21,315 participants aged 60 - 84 years . The participants were randomly assigned to receive either 60,000 IU of vitamin D3 or a placebo on a monthly basis for 5 years . Stool samples were collected from a subset of 835 participants , with 417 in the placebo group and 418 in the vitamin D group , approximately 5 years after the randomization . The gut microbiome was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing . The primary outcome of interest was the alpha diversity indices , including the Shannon index , richness , and inverse Simpson index . The ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was also examined . Linear regression was employed to compare the alpha diversity indices and the Firmicutes - to - Bacteroidetes ratio between the two groups . Beta diversity , which assesses the differences between samples , was analyzed using principal coordinate analysis with the Bray Curtis distance and UniFrac index . PERMANOVA was utilized to determine if there was significant clustering based on the randomization group . Furthermore , the abundance of the 20 most abundant genera was evaluated using a negative binomial regression model , accounting for multiple testing . The analysis included approximately an equal number of male and female participants , with a mean age of 69.4 years . The results indicated that vitamin D supplementation did not significantly alter the Shannon diversity index , with mean values of 3.51 in the placebo group and 3.52 in the vitamin D group ( p = 0.50 ) . Additionally , there were no substantial differences observed between the groups for other alpha diversity indices , the abundance of different genera , or the Firmicutes - to - Bacteroidetes ratio . There was also no evidence of clustering of bacterial communities according to the randomization group . In conclusion , the findings from the D - Health Trial suggest that monthly doses of 60,000 IU of vitamin D supplementation for 5 years do not have a significant impact on the composition of the gut microbiome in older Australians . These results contribute to the limited evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and the gut microbiome . These findings highlight the need for further research to fully understand the potential effects of vitamin D on the gut microbiome and its implications for overall health . Additional studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow - up periods may provide more conclusive evidence . Nevertheless , the results of this study suggest that vitamin D supplementation alone may not be sufficient to significantly alter the gut microbiome composition in older Australians . Future investigations should explore other potential factors that may influence the gut microbiome and consider the potential benefits of combined interventions .",3.023601228705429,0.8184099665121872,0.45926145670343116,0.08688181183793914,0.8509369254112243,0.8444367960879677,0.029644268774703556,0.1007905138339921,0.07905138339920949,0.2845849802371542,0.03162055335968379,0.09288537549407115,0.017786561264822136,0.11462450592885376,0.11462450592885376,0.025691699604743084,0.01383399209486166,True,182.0,0.8636363636363636,5.061264822134388,506.0,0.08349641226353555,0.05348988910632746,0.05348988910632746,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023483365949119372,0.03522504892367906,0.021526418786692758,0.005928853754940711,40.848054331864915,12.93261799874135,14.823464454727755,16.400923012376758,15.409017201594295,15.326255506607925,57.96265995384938,7.857142857142857,14.460399982253627,1905776.2850534867,3766.3562945721083,5.526431718061674,5.0,3.2600852733986834,21.61904761904762,21.0,6.945201772763632,1.7026431718061674,1.0,1.0440273050274131,454,206,0.45374449339207046,2561,21,27
"The study aimed to investigate the health - seeking behavior of communities along Lake Albert in Western Uganda regarding schistosomiasis treatment in the absence of a mass drug administration ( MDA ) program . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends regular MDA with praziquantel ( PZQ ) accompanied by social mobilization and health education . However , it is unclear where communities seek treatment when MDA is not available . The study conducted a qualitative investigation in two endemic communities and interviewed local leaders , village health teams , health workers , and community members . The findings revealed that participants rarely seek medication for schistosomiasis - related signs and symptoms from government hospitals and health centers II , III , and IV . Instead , they rely on alternative sources such as community volunteers , private clinics and drug shops , and traditional healers . Several factors contribute to this behavior , including the absence of PZQ drugs in government facilities , negative attitudes of health workers towards patients , long distances to government hospitals and health centers , poor and inaccessible roads , medication costs , and negative perceptions of the PZQ drug . The study highlighted the challenges of availability and accessibility of PZQ , as well as the impact of health systems and socio - cultural factors on its uptake . As a result , the study emphasized the need to bring schistosomiasis treatment and services closer to endemic communities by stocking nearby facilities with PZQ and encouraging community members to take the drug . It also stressed the importance of contextualized awareness - raising campaigns to address myths and misconceptions surrounding PZQ . Overall , the study provides valuable insights into the health - seeking behavior of communities in the absence of MDA for schistosomiasis treatment . These findings can inform the review of implementation policies to achieve the WHO 's 2030 target of 75 % coverage and uptake of PZQ.Furthermore , the study suggests that a comprehensive approach is needed , which includes not only the provision of PZQ drugs but also addressing the underlying factors that influence health - seeking behavior . This includes improving the availability and accessibility of healthcare facilities , addressing negative attitudes of health workers , improving infrastructure such as roads , and addressing the cost barriers associated with medication . By addressing these factors , it is hoped that communities will be more likely to seek treatment for schistosomiasis and ultimately contribute to the reduction of the disease burden in endemic areas . In conclusion , this study sheds light on the health - seeking behavior of communities in the absence of MDA for schistosomiasis treatment . The findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve the availability , accessibility , and acceptability of PZQ treatment in endemic communities . By addressing these factors , it is hoped that the goal of achieving 75 % coverage and uptake of PZQ by 2030 can be realized , leading to improved health outcomes for individuals affected by schistosomiasis .",2.8820259443388068,0.4123932776018181,0.4853974551734154,0.04475962926098166,0.8383817207068205,0.8525653600692749,0.0234375,0.115234375,0.056640625,0.310546875,0.01953125,0.11328125,0.01953125,0.123046875,0.08203125,0.044921875,0.01953125,False,178.0,0.873046875,5.25390625,512.0,0.16869728209934395,0.1218369259606373,0.1049671977507029,0.09122149328334896,0.09122149328334896,0.09122149328334896,0.00937207122774133,0.01999375195251484,0.031240237425804437,0.01953125,28.43935294117648,15.868640522875818,17.05364977622574,19.566013071895426,19.30122745098039,17.407911111111115,67.13725490196077,10.764705882352942,15.03104204550191,3372085.809717956,6586.105097105383,5.837777777777778,5.0,3.3846574675791796,26.470588235294116,24.0,9.450288803920685,1.791111111111111,1.0,1.1684409788207766,450,204,0.4533333333333333,2690,17,28

"Title : Effects of Persuasive Messages on Intention to Vaccinate with COVID-19 Booster Doses in Australian Adults : A Randomized Controlled Trial Introduction : Achieving high coverage of COVID-19 booster vaccines is crucial in mitigating the ongoing global pandemic . However , vaccine acceptance and uptake remain challenging , necessitating effective communication interventions to address hesitancy and improve vaccination rates . This study aimed to evaluate the impact of persuasive messages on the intention to vaccinate with COVID-19 booster doses among eligible adults in Australia . Methods : This online randomized controlled trial involved adult participants who were randomly assigned to receive one of four intervention messages or a control message . The control message provided information regarding eligibility for booster doses . The intervention messages supplemented the control message by employing different persuasive strategies , including emphasizing personal health benefits , community health benefits , non - health benefits , and personal agency in choosing vaccination . Following the intervention , participants responded to items regarding their intention to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccine and their beliefs . Proportional differences between the intervention groups and the control group were examined using appropriate statistical tests , with differences of ≥5 percentage points considered clinically significant . A subgroup analysis was conducted among hesitant participants . Results : Out of the 487 participants who consented and were randomized , 442 ( 90.8 % ) completed the experiment and were included in the analysis . Participants who received messages emphasizing non - health benefits exhibited the highest intention to vaccinate compared to those who received the control message ( percentage point difference : 9.0 , 95 % CI -0.8 , 18.8 , p = 0.071 ) . Among hesitant individuals , the intention was even higher in this intervention group compared to the control group ( percentage point difference : 15.6 , 95 % CI -6.0 , 37.3 , p = 0.150 ) . Conversely , hesitant individuals who received messages emphasizing personal agency had a lower intention compared to the control group ( percentage point difference : -10.8 , 95 % CI -33.0 , 11.4 , p = 0.330 ) , although the evidence supporting these findings is weak . Conclusion : To enhance COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake , health authorities should emphasize non - health benefits in their communication strategies . However , caution should be exercised when using messages emphasizing personal agency . These findings provide valuable insights for the development of effective communication messages and strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake .

"The Olig gene family plays important roles in brain cancer , specifically in gliomas . Gliomas are aggressive brain tumors that arise from glial cells . Olig1 and Olig2 , in particular , have been extensively studied and have been found to have significant implications in glioma development and progression . Olig1 and Olig2 are expressed in both the developing and mature central nervous system ( CNS ) and are involved in cellular specification and differentiation . However , dysregulation of these genes can lead to the development of gliomas . Olig2 overexpression , in particular , has been shown to drive glioma proliferation , as well as confer resistance to radiation and chemotherapy . This makes targeting Olig2 an attractive therapeutic strategy for glioma treatment . Studies have shown that inhibition of Olig2 can lead to reduced glioma cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy . Additionally , targeting Olig2 has been found to promote differentiation of glioma cells into more mature and less aggressive phenotypes . These findings suggest that targeting Olig2 may not only inhibit glioma growth but also enhance the efficacy of existing treatment modalities . Furthermore , Olig1 and Olig2 have also been implicated in the maintenance of glioma stem cells ( GSCs ) , which are thought to drive tumor recurrence and resistance to therapy . Targeting Olig1 and Olig2 could therefore potentially eliminate or disrupt GSCs , leading to improved patient outcomes . In conclusion , the Olig gene family , particularly Olig1 and Olig2 , plays crucial roles in glioma development and progression . Targeting these genes holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for brain cancer treatment . Further studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action of the Olig genes and to develop effective and specific therapeutic agents targeting these genes . Overall , the Olig gene family , specifically Olig1 and Olig2 , have significant implications in the development and progression of gliomas , aggressive brain tumors that arise from glial cells . Dysregulation of these genes can drive glioma proliferation and confer resistance to radiation and chemotherapy . Targeting Olig2 has been shown to reduce glioma cell proliferation , increase sensitivity to treatment , and promote differentiation of glioma cells into less aggressive phenotypes . Additionally , Olig1 and Olig2 are involved in the maintenance of glioma stem cells , which are associated with tumor recurrence and therapy resistance . Targeting Olig1 and Olig2 could potentially eliminate or disrupt these stem cells , leading to improved patient outcomes . However , further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action of the Olig genes and develop effective therapeutic agents targeting these genes . Furthermore , it is important to consider the potential challenges and limitations of targeting the Olig gene family in brain cancer therapy . One challenge is the specificity of targeting these genes , as they are also involved in normal cellular processes in the CNS . Therefore , it is crucial to develop therapeutic agents that selectively target cancer cells without affecting normal brain function . Another challenge is the heterogeneity of gliomas , as different subtypes may have varying levels of Olig gene expression and dependence . It is important to identify specific subtypes of gliomas that are most dependent on Olig gene activity for their growth and survival in order to maximize the efficacy of targeted therapies . Additionally , the development of resistance to targeted therapies is a common problem in cancer treatment . It is possible that glioma cells may develop mechanisms to bypass the inhibition of Olig genes or activate alternative pathways to promote tumor growth . Therefore , combination therapies targeting multiple pathways and molecules may be necessary to overcome resistance and improve patient outcomes . In conclusion , the Olig gene family , particularly Olig1 and Olig2 , have significant roles in glioma development and progression . Targeting these genes has the potential to inhibit glioma growth , increase sensitivity to treatment , and disrupt glioma stem cells . However , further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action of the Olig genes and develop effective and specific therapeutic agents targeting these genes . Additionally , addressing the challenges and limitations of targeting the Olig gene family will be crucial for the successful translation of these findings into clinical practice .",2.835210789912736,0.3805703597781939,0.4470673904156479,0.0495195730890511,0.8643566314131021,0.8757799171632336,0.046511627906976744,0.1012311901504788,0.07387140902872777,0.28317373461012313,0.058823529411764705,0.12722298221614228,0.024623803009575923,0.09575923392612859,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.019151846785225718,False,260.0,0.8987688098495212,5.3105335157318745,731.0,0.35711188204683436,0.35039028620988727,0.28252385082393755,0.21335646140503037,0.21335646140503037,0.16435385949696443,0.01756287944492628,0.0292714657415438,0.02168256721595837,0.030095759233926128,40.99165628891657,12.48778746367788,15.227246063832183,16.97429085374291,15.823906185139059,16.793972602739718,56.89539227895392,7.363636363636363,21.462456020065638,2094238877.609031,2864895.865402231,5.796042617960426,5.0,3.0631779119989324,19.90909090909091,20.0,4.987035533859566,1.721461187214612,1.0,0.9977351805477743,657,197,0.2998477929984779,3882,33,32
"In this systematic review , the aim was to identify the risk factors ( RFs ) , associated factors ( AFs ) , and consequences of developing calcaneal apophysitis ( CA ) , also known as Sever 's disease . The researchers conducted a thorough search of several databases including Cochrane Library , Embase , Medline Ovid , PubMed , Web of Science , and Evidence , from inception to April 2021 . The inclusion criteria for this review were cohort , case - control , and cross - sectional studies that involved patients under the age of 18 who were either exposed to RFs or presented with factors associated with developing CA . Studies in languages other than English or Spanish were excluded from the analysis . After screening the identified studies , a total of 736 studies were initially identified . However , only 11 observational studies fully met the inclusion criteria , totaling 1265 participants with an average age of 10.72 years . Among these studies , four identified extrinsic factors , ten identified intrinsic factors , and three identified both types of factors . The extrinsic and intrinsic RFs , AFs , and consequences of CA included various factors . These factors included limitation of ankle dorsiflexion , foot alignment , stiffness and mobility of the midfoot , plantar pressures and ground reaction force , body mass index , age , gender , presence of other osteochondroses , and participation in sports activities . The risk of bias in the included studies varied , with some studies having a moderate risk while others had a low risk . The researchers used the adapted version of the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale to evaluate the risk of bias in each study . In terms of the factors and consequences associated with CA ( Sever 's disease ) , ankle dorsiflexion limitation was found to be the most frequently studied intrinsic factor . Peak plantar pressures and foot malalignment were also commonly studied factors . However , there were disagreements among the investigators of the included studies , with some studies not reaching a consensus on which factors should be considered RFs , AFs , or consequences of CA . In conclusion , this systematic review identified several intrinsic and extrinsic RFs , AFs , and consequences of developing CA . However , further research is needed to establish a consensus on the factors associated with CA and their significance . The review is registered with the protocol number CRD42021246366.Overall , this systematic review provides valuable insights into the risk factors , associated factors , and consequences of calcaneal apophysitis ( Sever 's disease ) . It highlights the importance of factors such as ankle dorsiflexion limitation , foot alignment , plantar pressures , and body mass index in the development of CA . However , the lack of consensus among studies regarding these factors emphasizes the need for more research in this area .

"Introduction : Sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) have become a global health concern , with a rapid increase in incidence over the past decade . More than one million curable STIs are acquired daily , highlighting the urgent need for effective prevention strategies ( 1 ) . In sub - Saharan Africa , young women face a particularly high burden of both curable STIs and HIV , making them a vulnerable population that requires targeted interventions ( 1,2 ) . The use of doxycycline as a prophylaxis to prevent STIs has shown promise in previous studies . However , these clinical trials have primarily focused on men who have sex with men ( MSM ) in high - income settings , leaving a gap in knowledge regarding the efficacy of doxycycline post - exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) among women in sub - Saharan Africa ( 3,4 ) . To address this gap , we conducted the first trial to determine the efficacy of doxycycline PEP in reducing STI incidence among Kenyan women . In this open - label randomized clinical trial , we compared the effectiveness of doxycycline PEP with the standard of care , which included quarterly STI screening and treatment ( 5 ) . In this section , we present the baseline characteristics , STI prevalence , and STI risk perception of the participants enrolled in the trial . Understanding the characteristics of the target population is crucial for designing effective interventions and ensuring their successful implementation . Methods : Between February 2020 and November 2021 , we enrolled a total of 449 Kenyan women aged ≥18 and ≤30 years who were taking daily , oral HIV pre - exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) . The median age of the participants was 24 years ( interquartile range [ IQR ] 21 - 27 ) . The majority of the participants were never married ( 66.1 % ) and reported having a primary sex partner ( 82.4 % ) ( 6 ) . We assessed the participants ' sexual behaviors and risk factors , including condom use , engagement in transactional sex , and suspicion of their male partners having sex with other women . Additionally , we explored the participants ' perception of STI risk and their recent concerns about being exposed to STIs . STI prevalence was determined through laboratory testing , focusing on three common bacterial STIs : Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Chlamydia trachomatis , and Treponema pallidum . We also assessed the association between STI risk perception and the detection of an STI among the participants . Results : The results showed that 33 % of the participants had engaged in sex with new partners in the three months prior to enrollment , and 67.5 % did not use condoms consistently . Additionally , 36.7 % reported involvement in transactional sex , and 43.2 % suspected their male partners of having sex with other women . Approximately 45.9 % of the participants expressed recent concerns about being exposed to an STI ( 7 ) . The prevalence of STIs among the participants was found to be 17.9 % , with Chlamydia trachomatis accounting for the majority of infections . Interestingly , the perceived risk of STIs was not significantly associated with the detection of an STI among the participants ( 8) . Discussion : The high prevalence of curable STIs among young cisgender women in Kenya who were using HIV PrEP highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions to prevent STIs in this population . Understanding the characteristics and risk factors of this population can inform the development and implementation of effective STI prevention strategies . In this study , we aimed to assess the efficacy of doxycycline PEP in reducing STI incidence among women taking HIV PrEP , providing valuable insights into a previously understudied population .

"In conclusion , the role of conduction system pacing ( CSP ) in patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is still not well understood . While CSP has shown promising results in patients with sinus rhythm ( SR ) , its efficacy in the presence of AF remains uncertain . The mechanistic evidence suggests that the optimal electrical response achieved by adjusting atrioventricular delays ( AVD ) may be compromised in AF patients , potentially attenuating the effectiveness of CSP compared to conventional biventricular epicardial ( BiV ) pacing . Currently , the largest clinical body of evidence in this field comes from studies involving patients who have undergone atrioventricular nodal ablation ( AVNA ) for AF and subsequently received CSP . These studies have provided some insights into the potential benefits of CSP in this specific population . However , more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of CSP in AF patients who have not undergone AVNA . Future research should focus on designing studies that specifically evaluate the efficacy of CSP in AF patients . These studies should aim to compare the outcomes of CSP with conventional BiV pacing in AF patients , taking into account factors such as patient selection , AVD adjustment , and long - term follow - up . However , conducting such studies may face hurdles such as patient recruitment , ethical considerations , and logistical challenges . In summary , while CSP holds promise as a novel delivery method for cardiac resynchronization therapy , its role in patients with AF is still uncertain . Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness and potential limitations of CSP in this specific population . This research should aim to compare the outcomes of CSP with conventional BiV pacing in AF patients and address important questions regarding patient selection , AVD adjustment , and long - term follow - up . Overcoming challenges such as patient recruitment , ethical considerations , and logistical hurdles will be crucial in conducting these studies . Once the efficacy and limitations of CSP in AF patients are better understood , it can potentially become a valuable treatment option for this population , contributing to improved outcomes in the management of heart failure . Additionally , it is important to consider the potential benefits of CSP in AF patients , such as improved hemodynamic function , reduced symptoms , and better quality of life . By targeting the conduction system rather than relying solely on biventricular pacing , CSP may provide a more tailored and efficient approach to cardiac resynchronization therapy in this specific population . Furthermore , the use of CSP in AF patients may have implications for anticoagulation management , as it may reduce the risk of thromboembolic events associated with atrial fibrillation . This aspect should be explored in future research to fully understand the overall impact of CSP on patient outcomes . In conclusion , while there is still uncertainty regarding the role of CSP in patients with atrial fibrillation , further research is needed to determine its efficacy and potential limitations in this specific population . By addressing important questions and overcoming challenges , we can gain a better understanding of the benefits of CSP and potentially improve outcomes for AF patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy .",2.9848002550067556,0.5870661077884282,0.48969685259628337,0.04635927207121072,0.9091624837172659,0.9044478800561693,0.036101083032490974,0.11732851985559567,0.12454873646209386,0.2509025270758123,0.04693140794223827,0.10469314079422383,0.016245487364620937,0.13357400722021662,0.06678700361010831,0.023465703971119134,0.019855595667870037,False,199.0,0.8826714801444043,5.15884476534296,554.0,0.27059513339196717,0.19495749047200234,0.17883318674875404,0.12899442978598652,0.12899442978598652,0.12899442978598652,0.022867194371152155,0.03283494576370566,0.01759014951627089,0.009025270758122744,31.156900306748497,14.987626789366058,16.647925096878797,18.94155419222904,17.696901840490796,16.57390593047035,65.55429447852761,10.05,14.782028927166284,2628776.0803977484,4745.0831776132645,5.711656441717792,5.0,3.3336432038840123,24.45,25.0,6.280724480503822,1.7832310838445808,1.0,1.0401180667679153,489,194,0.3967280163599182,2858,20,36
"In recent years , there has been a significant increase in the legalization of cannabis for recreational use across the globe . With this change in legal status , there has been a growing interest in understanding the adverse effects of cannabis use , particularly in relation to mental health . As a result , there has been a surge in research examining the types and frequencies of adverse events associated with cannabis use that present in the Emergency Department . However , it is important to acknowledge the challenges inherent in studying the mental health adverse events specifically related to cannabis use . One major challenge is distinguishing the effects of cannabis from those of other recreational substances , as many individuals who present with mental health issues may also use multiple substances . This complicates the process of accurately attributing adverse events solely to cannabis use . Since our previous review , there have been advancements in our understanding of the frequency of cannabis - associated adverse events in the Emergency Department . The changing legal climate has provided clearer information on the prevalence of these events . However , as we delve into the current state of the literature , it becomes evident that there are biases and limitations in the research designs that may affect the accuracy of our findings . Both clinician and researcher biases can impact the validity of data in this field . Clinicians may have preconceived notions or stigmatization surrounding cannabis use , which could influence their identification and reporting of adverse events . Similarly , researchers may have their own biases that can affect the interpretation of data . Additionally , many studies in this area rely on administrative data , where front - line clinicians attribute cannabis use to specific admissions . This method may introduce inaccuracies and subjective judgments . This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge regarding mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use in the Emergency Department . It specifically focuses on the mental health impacts for individuals with and without a history of mental illness . Furthermore , this review highlights the potential differential effects of cannabis on genders and sexes . The review identifies the most common mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use , as well as highlighting the rare but concerning events that have been reported in the literature . By outlining the existing evidence , this review aims to contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between cannabis use and mental health in the Emergency Department setting . Additionally , this review suggests a framework for critically evaluating future studies in this field . It emphasizes the importance of addressing biases , utilizing rigorous research designs , and employing standardized assessment tools to accurately assess the interaction between cannabis use and mental health . In conclusion , our current understanding of mental health adverse events related to cannabis use in the Emergency Department is expanding . However , it is essential to critically evaluate the existing literature and address potential biases that may impact the validity of the data . By doing so , we can improve our understanding of the complex relationship between cannabis use and mental health , and ultimately provide better care for individuals presenting with cannabis - associated adverse events in the Emergency Department .",2.6807415122194764,0.5739950260701157,0.4690554749991202,0.05381334481112294,0.9096021496731302,0.9149446893822063,0.03716814159292035,0.08849557522123894,0.11150442477876106,0.26017699115044246,0.04601769911504425,0.1079646017699115,0.008849557522123894,0.13097345132743363,0.09911504424778761,0.02654867256637168,0.05132743362831858,False,229.0,0.911504424778761,5.3097345132743365,565.0,0.17255892255892255,0.1394500561167228,0.09764309764309764,0.06902356902356903,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.04040404040404041,0.026936026936026935,0.045454545454545456,0.0,40.495568365695846,12.941856796116507,14.613946157001845,16.117313915857604,16.278778317152103,16.5021359223301,59.9049352750809,8.25,16.48172554586927,14385417.040163022,25460.91511533278,5.728155339805825,6.0,3.125200342338558,21.458333333333332,20.5,6.855527980315512,1.7087378640776698,1.0,0.959683078363065,515,211,0.4097087378640777,3000,24,37
"Title : The Controversial Effect of Smoking and Nicotine in SARS - CoV-2 Infection Introduction : The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant attention to the potential effects of smoking and nicotine on the susceptibility and severity of SARS - CoV-2 infection . While the current basic data suggests a higher risk of COVID-19 infections in smokers due to the overexpression of host receptors involved in viral entry , there have been conflicting reports regarding the actual incidence of COVID-19 disease in smokers . This controversy may be attributed to the complex nature of nicotine and its dual role as both inflammatory and anti - inflammatory agent . In order to gain a better understanding of the effects of nicotine on COVID-19 infection , a systematic investigation focusing on various cells involved in the pathogenesis of the disease is crucial . Moreover , it is important to differentiate between the effects of nicotine and those of cigarette smoke , as they have been shown to have distinct impacts on health outcomes . Generalizing the effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke without differentiation can introduce significant bias in research findings . Furthermore , the dose - dependent response of nicotine should be considered when studying its effects . Different doses of nicotine may elicit different responses in cells and organs , which could potentially affect the course of COVID-19 infection . Therefore , a comprehensive assessment of nicotine dosage and its impact on disease outcomes is necessary . In addition to studying the role of nicotine in COVID-19 infection , it is essential to account for underlying diseases and comorbidities . The presence of pre - existing conditions in individuals who smoke may influence their susceptibility to COVID-19 and the subsequent progression of the disease .

"Introduction Transversus abdominis plane block ( TAPB ) has emerged as a popular technique for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal surgery . This includes procedures such as colorectal cancer resection , diverticular disease surgery , and inflammatory bowel disease resection . TAPB offers the potential for reduced opioid consumption and improved pain control , leading to enhanced patient outcomes and satisfaction . However , there is ongoing debate regarding the most effective and safe approach for administering TAPB in this patient population . Two commonly used techniques are laparoscopic TAPB and ultrasound - guided TAPB . Laparoscopic TAPB involves the direct visualization and injection of local anesthetic into the transversus abdominis plane using laparoscopic instruments . On the other hand , ultrasound - guided TAPB involves the use of ultrasound imaging to guide the precise placement of the local anesthetic into the transversus abdominis plane . To date , there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding which approach is superior in terms of pain control , opioid consumption , and postoperative outcomes . Therefore , this meta - analysis aims to comprehensively evaluate the existing evidence by integrating both direct and indirect comparisons of laparoscopic TAPB and ultrasound - guided TAPB . Through systematic electronic literature surveillance , we will identify relevant studies published up to July 31 , 2023 , in the PubMed , Embase , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL ) , and ClinicalTrials.gov databases . The methodological quality of the selected studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias version 2 ( RoB 2 ) and Risk of Bias in Non - randomized Studies of Interventions ( ROBINS - I ) tools . The primary outcomes of interest in this meta - analysis will be opioid consumption at 24 hours postoperatively and pain scores at 24 hours postoperatively at rest , during coughing , and during movement , as measured by the numerical rating scale ( NRS ) . Additionally , we will analyze secondary outcome measures , including the probability of TAPB - related adverse events , overall postoperative 30 - day complications , postoperative 30 - day ileus , postoperative 30 - day surgical site infection , postoperative 7 - day nausea and vomiting , and length of stay . Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings . Data analyses will be performed using RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 17.0 , with a significance level set at a p - value of less than 0.05 . The certainty of evidence will be evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations , Assessment , Development , and Evaluation ( GRADE ) working group approach . As this study involves a secondary analysis of existing data , no ethical approval will be required . The results of this meta - analysis are expected to provide a comprehensive summary of the available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of different TAPB approaches for minimally invasive colorectal surgery . The findings will be disseminated through high - quality peer - reviewed publications and presentations at international conferences , with the aim of informing future clinical trials and guiding anesthesiologists and surgeons in selecting the optimal tailored clinical practice for perioperative pain management .",3.081550926445638,0.6077802167883614,0.4470000916193241,0.06146526109769231,0.8531855311658647,0.8369459159233991,0.018148820326678767,0.14156079854809436,0.10707803992740472,0.2613430127041742,0.036297640653357534,0.09437386569872959,0.007259528130671506,0.1088929219600726,0.07441016333938294,0.041742286751361164,0.009074410163339383,True,172.0,0.8348457350272233,5.219600725952813,551.0,0.09573847051955633,0.05896088733216579,0.05896088733216579,0.028021015761821366,0.0,0.0,0.014302393461762989,0.016637478108581436,0.021015761821366025,0.02722323049001815,27.927518638032723,15.54854567708913,16.812101805928865,19.17565372204295,18.879059752976524,17.793742071881606,67.60086792032936,10.631578947368421,14.843682551398018,2795950.145142337,5074.319682653969,5.915433403805497,5.0,3.3921365778355215,24.894736842105264,24.0,8.49702571394129,1.8160676532769555,1.0,1.067487898773417,473,251,0.5306553911205074,2876,19,39
"We examine the structure and composition of the Mtb cell wall , which is composed of a unique combination of lipids , polysaccharides , and proteins . This complex cell wall acts as a barrier , protecting the bacilli from external threats and contributing to its virulence and drug resistance . Antimicrobial peptides , on the other hand , have been shown to have potent antimicrobial activity against a wide range of pathogens , including drug - resistant bacteria . These peptides have diverse mechanisms of action , including membrane disruption , pore formation , and intracellular targeting . However , the effectiveness of antimicrobial peptides against Mtb is still a matter of debate . The unique composition and architecture of the Mtb cell wall pose challenges for the interaction and penetration of antimicrobial peptides . The hydrophobic nature of the cell wall components , such as mycolic acids , can hinder the access of peptides to the bacterial membrane . Additionally , the presence of cell wall - associated proteins and polysaccharides may also interfere with the activity of antimicrobial peptides by sequestering or neutralizing them . Despite these challenges , there is evidence suggesting that certain antimicrobial peptides can still exert their antimicrobial activity against Mtb . Some peptides have demonstrated the ability to disrupt the cell wall integrity , leading to membrane damage and bacterial death . Others have shown intracellular targeting , where they can penetrate the cell wall and inhibit essential bacterial processes . To enhance the effectiveness of antimicrobial peptides against Mtb , researchers have explored various strategies . These include modifying the peptides to improve their stability , bioavailability , and cell wall penetration . Combination therapies , where antimicrobial peptides are used in conjunction with existing antibiotics , have also been investigated to overcome drug resistance and enhance bacterial killing . In conclusion , while the complexity of the Mtb cell wall presents challenges for the efficacy of antimicrobial peptides , they still hold promise as potential therapeutics against drug - resistant Mtb strains . Further research is needed to better understand the interaction between antimicrobial peptides and the Mtb cell wall and to optimize their use in clinical practice .

These students were randomly assigned to receive either IASTM on the upper trapezius and levator scapulae muscles or MRT . To assess the effectiveness of the treatments , researchers measured the participants ' pain levels using a visual analog scale ( VAS ) , their neck function using the neck disability index ( NDI ) , and their pain pressure threshold ( PPT ) using a pressure algometer . These measurements were taken before and after the eight therapy sessions that were conducted over a four - week period . The results of the study , analyzed using unpaired t - tests , showed no statistical significance between the two groups in terms of improvement in pain , function , and PPT . This suggests that both IASTM and MRT were equally effective in reducing chronic neck pain in these college students . However , it is important to note that this study did not include a control group . Therefore , it can not be concluded with certainty that the observed improvements in pain and function were solely due to the interventions . In conclusion , this quasi - experimental clinical trial supports the use of both IASTM and MRT as viable treatment options for college students with chronic mechanical neck pain . Further research with a control group is needed to confirm these findings and better understand the effectiveness of these interventions . Additionally , the study highlights the impact of the COVID-19 restriction on college students , as they were participating in distance learning . This may have influenced their pain levels and overall well - being , and should be considered when interpreting the results . Future studies could explore the effects of different interventions on chronic neck pain in individuals affected by similar circumstances . Overall , this study provides valuable insights into the use of IASTM and MRT in the management of chronic neck pain and warrants further investigation . Furthermore , the study findings suggest that both IASTM and MRT can be effective treatment options for individuals with chronic mechanical neck pain . This is particularly relevant for college students who may experience high levels of stress and prolonged sitting due to distance learning . The inclusion of these interventions in their treatment plans may help alleviate their pain and improve their overall well - being . It is worth noting that the study had some limitations . Firstly , the lack of a control group limits the ability to attribute the observed improvements solely to the interventions . Additionally , the small sample size and the specific population of college students participating in distance learning may limit the generalizability of the findings . Future research should aim to address these limitations by including a control group and expanding the sample size to include a more diverse population . Additionally , long - term follow - up assessments could provide valuable information on the sustainability of the treatment effects . In conclusion , this randomized clinical trial suggests that both IASTM and MRT are effective treatment options for individuals with chronic mechanical neck pain , particularly college students . However , further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the long - term effects of these interventions .",2.920806688270436,0.4958681835950805,0.44290732633989516,0.06151119994402071,0.8551820317904154,0.8539074400196904,0.03257328990228013,0.10912052117263844,0.07980456026058631,0.28827361563517917,0.04560260586319218,0.09771986970684039,0.017915309446254073,0.10097719869706841,0.10912052117263844,0.03745928338762215,0.029315960912052116,False,240.0,0.8876221498371335,5.052117263843648,614.0,0.16204576043068641,0.08963660834454913,0.06244952893674294,0.0414535666218035,0.0414535666218035,0.0414535666218035,0.034454912516823685,0.017496635262449527,0.030148048452220726,0.014657980456026058,44.69111926605507,12.441541284403673,13.475323542916517,14.738348623853211,15.681798165137614,15.565211009174309,59.23119266055046,8.16,17.11655163832885,27140880.05476437,44203.38771134263,5.565137614678899,5.0,3.020400852757367,21.8,20.0,6.118823416311343,1.655045871559633,1.0,0.9741132159707246,545,221,0.4055045871559633,3102,25,44

Lipid metabolism , as a crucial cellular process , has been increasingly recognized to play a significant role in CRC pathogenesis . Dysregulated lipid metabolism in CRC cells not only supports their aberrant growth and survival but also affects the immune microenvironment , leading to immune evasion and tumor progression . CRC cells and lipid metabolism : Lipid metabolism in CRC cells is dysregulated at multiple levels , including uptake , synthesis , storage , and breakdown of lipids . Enhanced lipid uptake is observed in CRC cells , facilitated by upregulated expression of fatty acid transporters . Additionally , de novo lipogenesis is increased in CRC cells , characterized by elevated expression of key enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis , such as fatty acid synthase ( FASN ) . This elevated lipogenesis provides a constant supply of lipids for membrane biogenesis , energy production , and signaling molecules required for CRC cell proliferation and survival . Moreover , dysregulated lipid storage and breakdown pathways , such as altered lipid droplet dynamics and impaired lipolysis , further contribute to the abnormal lipid metabolism in CRC cells . Tumor microenvironment and lipid metabolism : The tumor microenvironment , composed of various cell types , extracellular matrix components , and signaling molecules , profoundly influences lipid metabolism in CRC cells . Immune cells , including tumor - associated macrophages ( TAMs ) , myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) , and T cells , secrete cytokines and chemokines that modulate lipid metabolism in CRC cells . For example , TAM - derived cytokines , such as interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF - α ) , promote lipogenesis and lipid uptake in CRC cells , contributing to tumor growth . Conversely , immune cells can also exert anti - tumor effects by modulating lipid metabolism . T cells , through the release of interferon - gamma ( IFN - γ ) , suppress lipogenesis and promote lipolysis in CRC cells , inhibiting tumor growth . Furthermore , the extracellular matrix components , such as collagen , fibronectin , and hyaluronic acid , can remodel lipid metabolism in CRC cells . These matrix components interact with cell surface receptors , such as integrins , to activate signaling pathways that modulate lipid metabolism . Additionally , nutrients within the tumor microenvironment , including lipids , can directly influence lipid metabolism in CRC cells . For instance , exogenous fatty acids present in the tumor microenvironment are taken up by CRC cells and utilized for energy production and lipid synthesis . Implications and therapeutic potential : Given the critical role of lipid metabolism in CRC progression , targeting lipid metabolism has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy . Several inhibitors of key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism , such as FASN and acetyl - CoA carboxylase ( ACC ) , have been developed and tested in preclinical and clinical studies . These inhibitors have shown promising anti - tumor effects , including inhibition of CRC cell proliferation , induction of apoptosis , and suppression of tumor growth in animal models . Furthermore , strategies aimed at modulating lipid metabolism in immune cells within the tumor microenvironment , such as reprogramming TAMs towards an anti - tumor phenotype , have shown potential for",3.080739276547485,0.9843726609320808,0.45307069379204756,0.06890505529639754,0.8309723262985548,0.8002863380572071,0.025039123630672927,0.16588419405320814,0.11267605633802817,0.3082942097026604,0.025039123630672927,0.09389671361502347,0.004694835680751174,0.1111111111111111,0.03755868544600939,0.04538341158059468,0.009389671361502348,True,168.0,0.8325508607198748,5.136150234741784,639.0,0.11275510204081633,0.041581632653061223,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0653061224489796,0.036734693877551024,0.04693877551020408,0.004694835680751174,27.167378947368434,14.756568421052638,16.599557052379478,18.963127819548873,17.319492481203007,17.901127819548865,60.753684210526316,8.4,17.133069915613124,27592923.851204954,43181.414477629034,5.9680451127819545,5.0,3.3235480087379345,21.28,24.0,6.0697281652476,1.868421052631579,1.0,1.07149452375829,532,225,0.42293233082706766,3282,25,49

"Some of the drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use in low- and middle - income countries include : 1 . Limited access to healthcare : In many LMICs , there is a lack of healthcare facilities and trained healthcare professionals , leading to limited access to appropriate medical care . This can result in self - medication with antibiotics , inappropriate prescribing by non - specialists , and over - the - counter sales of antibiotics without a prescription . 2 . Lack of public awareness and education : In LMICs , there is often a lack of public awareness about the appropriate use of antibiotics and the dangers of antimicrobial resistance . This can lead to patients demanding antibiotics for viral infections or using antibiotics for non - bacterial illnesses , contributing to inappropriate use . 3 . Weak regulatory frameworks : Many LMICs have weak regulatory systems for controlling the sale and distribution of antibiotics . This can lead to the availability of substandard or counterfeit antibiotics , as well as the unrestricted sale of antibiotics without a prescription . 4 . Overuse in agriculture and veterinary medicine : In LMICs , antibiotics are often used in agriculture to promote growth in livestock or prevent diseases . Similarly , antibiotics are frequently used in veterinary medicine without proper diagnosis or prescription . This overuse can contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance and the spread of resistant bacteria to humans . 5 . Limited laboratory capacity : In LMICs , there may be limited laboratory capacity for accurate diagnosis of bacterial infections . This can result in the empirical use of antibiotics without confirmation of the presence of a bacterial infection , leading to inappropriate use . 6 . Financial incentives : In some LMICs , healthcare providers may have financial incentives to prescribe antibiotics , such as receiving commissions or kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies . This can lead to overprescribing and inappropriate use of antibiotics . Addressing these drivers requires a comprehensive approach that involves strengthening healthcare systems , improving public awareness and education , implementing and enforcing robust regulatory frameworks , promoting responsible use of antibiotics in agriculture and veterinary medicine , enhancing laboratory capacity , and addressing financial incentives for inappropriate prescribing . Overall , addressing the drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use in low- and middle - income countries requires a multifaceted and comprehensive approach . This includes strengthening healthcare systems to improve access to appropriate medical care , increasing public awareness and education about the appropriate use of antibiotics and the dangers of antimicrobial resistance , implementing and enforcing robust regulatory frameworks to control the sale and distribution of antibiotics , promoting responsible use of antibiotics in agriculture and veterinary medicine , enhancing laboratory capacity for accurate diagnosis , and addressing financial incentives for inappropriate prescribing . By tackling these drivers , it is possible to curb inappropriate antibiotic use and mitigate the rise of antimicrobial resistance in LMICs .",2.337229882526166,1.2015738730069738,0.4652067384376505,0.06923808620450121,0.5324232286463181,0.5153372495070748,0.014141414141414142,0.11515151515151516,0.14545454545454545,0.2909090909090909,0.026262626262626262,0.10101010101010101,0.010101010101010102,0.14545454545454545,0.05454545454545454,0.05454545454545454,0.024242424242424242,False,169.0,0.8626262626262626,5.583838383838384,495.0,0.39134438305709024,0.29772866789441377,0.2489257213014119,0.21332105586249234,0.21332105586249234,0.17065684468999387,0.042971147943523635,0.03314917127071823,0.027624309392265192,0.0,17.124484064665126,15.173575981524252,16.453399486276943,19.4915103926097,16.6212702078522,19.183279445727482,64.20221709006928,8.12,14.58575028567853,2160284.0716774333,4364.210245812997,6.240184757505774,6.0,3.6444208317812334,17.32,18.0,14.399222201216286,2.0346420323325636,1.0,1.3077141609788077,433,155,0.3579676674364896,2764,25,52

"Introduction Chronic primary orofacial pain ( OFP ) conditions , such as painful temporomandibular disorders ( pTMDs ) , idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia ( TN ) , and burning mouth syndrome ( BMS ) , pose a significant burden on individuals and society . These conditions are characterized by persistent or recurrent pain in the orofacial region , often without a clear identifiable cause . Although they are seemingly idiopathic , evidence suggests that they have a complex and multifactorial etiology and pathophysiology . Over the years , preclinical studies have played a crucial role in identifying important factors contributing to the development and maintenance of chronic primary OFP . These studies have provided insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets . However , despite these advances , there is a gap between preclinical findings and their translation into improved pain care for chronic OFP patients . One of the challenges in bridging this gap is the development of preclinical assays that better simulate the etiology , pathophysiology , and clinical symptoms of OFP patients . Existing rodent assays have provided valuable information , but there is a need for more sophisticated models that can accurately replicate the complexities of these conditions . Additionally , it is essential to have OFP pain measures that align with the clinical symptoms experienced by patients . Currently available measures may not fully capture the multifaceted nature of chronic primary OFP . In this review , we aim to provide an overview of the existing rodent assays and OFP pain measures that can be utilized in the study of chronic primary OFP , focusing on pTMDs , TN , and BMS . We will discuss the suitability and limitations of these assays and measures in light of the current understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of these conditions . Furthermore , we will propose potential directions for future research , with the goal of developing innovative animal models that have greater translatability and hold the potential to improve the care of patients living with chronic primary OFP . By addressing these challenges , we can enhance our understanding of these complex conditions and ultimately advance the development of effective treatments for chronic OFP.Introduction Chronic primary orofacial pain ( OFP ) conditions , including painful temporomandibular disorders ( pTMDs ) , idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia ( TN ) , and burning mouth syndrome ( BMS ) , are characterized by persistent or recurrent pain in the orofacial region , without a clear identifiable cause .

"The systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of interventions conducted in childcare or preschool settings to increase fruit and vegetable ( FV ) intake in preschool - aged children in the United States . The review also aimed to evaluate the use of theoretical frameworks and behavior change techniques ( BCTs ) in these interventions . The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses guidelines and included randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) published between 2012 and 2022 . The search was conducted in September 2022 , using specific search terms related to FV consumption , preschool - aged children , US childcare or preschool settings , and RCTs . Studies that used objective measures of FV consumption or skin carotenoids as a proxy for FV intake were included . Six studies , reporting on nine interventions , met the inclusion criteria . Of these , six interventions were found to increase FV intake . Five of the effective interventions used nutrition education , while one manipulated the feeding environment . Among the three interventions with no measured effect , two manipulated the feeding environment , and one used peer modeling . Effective studies generally utilized at least three BCTs , although no consistent pattern was observed between the use of theory or BCTs and intervention effectiveness . While the reviewed studies showed promising results , the limited number of studies identified highlights important gaps in the field . There is a need for more studies that test FV interventions in US childcare settings , use objective measures of FV intake , directly compare intervention components and BCTs , are theory - based , and assess long - term behavior change . Overall , this systematic review emphasizes the potential of childcare and preschool settings as opportune times and settings for interventions to improve FV intake in preschool - aged children . Further research is needed to better understand the most effective approaches and mechanisms for behavior change in this population . Additionally , the online version of this review includes supplementary material for further information . The findings of this review support the importance of promoting FV consumption during the early years of life , as dietary habits established during preschool - age tend to persist into adulthood . By implementing interventions in childcare and preschool settings , we can target a large portion of the preschool population and potentially have a lasting impact on their dietary habits . In conclusion , while there are some interventions that have shown success in increasing FV intake in preschool - aged children , there is still a need for more research in this area . Future studies should focus on testing interventions in US childcare settings , using objective measures of FV intake , comparing intervention components and BCTs , and assessing long - term behavior change . By addressing these gaps , we can develop more effective strategies to promote FV consumption in preschool children and improve their long - term health outcomes .",2.9263150330733145,0.44176313528195044,0.44672725793316825,0.0695154021560685,0.8805125387091386,0.8703143033716414,0.019569471624266144,0.12133072407045009,0.0821917808219178,0.29354207436399216,0.019569471624266144,0.11937377690802348,0.015655577299412915,0.10567514677103718,0.07632093933463796,0.043052837573385516,0.021526418786692758,True,179.0,0.87279843444227,5.140900195694717,511.0,0.13133567102327065,0.10041440867070449,0.024226968441185846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01721389862926363,0.020401657634682817,0.031877590054191905,0.0,41.415287861915374,13.05993207126949,14.696529576185021,16.28512249443207,16.701792873051225,16.47216035634744,61.20278396436525,8.7,13.579144333894419,789491.4901963568,1544.9931314997198,5.712694877505568,5.0,3.0939043594294735,22.45,24.0,7.1026403541218395,1.6859688195991092,1.0,0.9517556202725744,449,201,0.44766146993318484,2627,20,56
"This study focuses on the incorporation of resilience when assessing pandemic risk in the Arctic , specifically in the case of Alaska . The traditional approach to assessing vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19 has often overlooked the unique socioeconomic , cultural , and demographic factors that exist within Arctic communities . By categorizing these communities solely based on universal indicators of vulnerability , their true capacity to withstand and recover from pandemic exposure is underestimated . To address this issue , the study recognizes vulnerability and resilience as separate yet interconnected dimensions . A pandemic vulnerability - resilience framework has been developed specifically for Alaska to evaluate the potential community - level risks of COVID-19 or future pandemics . This framework takes into account both the vulnerability and resilience indices to provide a more comprehensive understanding of each community 's situation . The analysis of the vulnerability and resilience indices revealed that not all highly vulnerable census areas and boroughs in Alaska experienced COVID-19 outbreaks with similar severity . The areas that demonstrated higher levels of resilience also exhibited lower cumulative death rates and case fatality ratios . This insight emphasizes the importance of considering both vulnerability and resilience when identifying at - risk populations and communities . By doing so , public officials and concerned parties can allocate resources and services more efficiently and effectively before , during , and after a pandemic . The resilience - vulnerability - focused approach presented in this study can be applied beyond Alaska . It can be utilized to assess the potential impact of COVID-19 and similar health crises in remote regions or regions with significant Indigenous populations worldwide . By incorporating resilience into pandemic risk assessments , policymakers and stakeholders can better understand the specific needs and vulnerabilities of different communities , enabling them to implement targeted measures and support systems . This approach ultimately contributes to more effective and equitable pandemic response strategies . Furthermore , by recognizing the interplay between vulnerability and resilience , this study highlights the importance of not solely focusing on vulnerability when assessing pandemic risk . Resilience plays a crucial role in determining a community 's ability to withstand and recover from the impacts of a pandemic . Therefore , it is essential to incorporate resilience into the assessment process to gain a more accurate understanding of a community 's overall risk . In conclusion , this study emphasizes the need to incorporate resilience when assessing pandemic risk in the Arctic , specifically in Alaska . By considering the unique socioeconomic , cultural , and demographic factors of Arctic communities and evaluating both vulnerability and resilience , a more comprehensive understanding of each community 's situation can be achieved . This approach allows for the identification of at - risk populations and communities and facilitates the efficient allocation of resources and services . By applying this resilience - vulnerability - focused approach to other remote regions or regions with significant Indigenous populations , policymakers and stakeholders can enhance their pandemic response strategies and ensure more equitable outcomes .",2.943392885197525,0.6150244131591822,0.49363547045244904,0.060272805673674684,0.8881565749645233,0.8801434604745162,0.04678362573099415,0.0935672514619883,0.09746588693957114,0.2787524366471735,0.02729044834307992,0.11306042884990253,0.031189083820662766,0.1111111111111111,0.0935672514619883,0.06237816764132553,0.015594541910331383,False,194.0,0.9064327485380117,5.754385964912281,513.0,0.25894919168591224,0.19861431870669746,0.151270207852194,0.151270207852194,0.11374133949191687,0.040993071593533485,0.029445727482678985,0.04849884526558892,0.02424942263279446,0.0,17.00496023138109,16.341059807871087,17.879347455551382,20.928457803945875,19.134390042351,19.789761388286333,67.93936576799918,10.095238095238095,14.054591097087071,1270080.8236601443,2475.7910792595408,6.281995661605206,6.0,3.454488910275675,21.952380952380953,22.0,4.8351509601310525,1.9804772234273318,2.0,1.1900020005915173,461,205,0.44468546637744033,2952,21,57
"The results of this systematic review and meta - analysis suggest that sex differences may exist in the cardiovascular outcomes of sodium - glucose transporter-2 inhibitors ( SGLT-2is ) in patients with heart failure ( HF ) . Previous research has shown that SGLT-2is are effective in reducing the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for HF in both men and women . However , this study found that the reduction in primary composite outcomes was less pronounced in women compared to men . To conduct this study , we searched the medical database from 2017 to 2022 and identified five randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) that evaluated the use of SGLT-2is in patients with HF and reported cardiovascular outcomes . These RCTs included a total of 21,947 patients , of which 35.7 % were females . We evaluated the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool . The meta - analysis of the primary composite outcomes showed that both males and females taking SGLT-2is had significantly lower rates of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for HF compared to those taking placebo . The hazard ratio ( HR ) for males was 0.77 ( 95 % CI 0.72 to 0.84 ; p = 0.00001 ) , while the HR for females was 0.75 ( 95 % CI 0.67 to 0.84 ; p = 0.00001 ) . This indicates that SGLT-2is are effective in reducing primary composite outcomes in both sexes . However , when we pooled the data from four of the RCTs ( n = 20,725 ) , we found that the occurrence of primary composite outcomes was greater in females compared to males . The odds ratio ( OR ) for primary composite outcomes in females versus males was 1.32 ( 95 % CI 1.17 to 1.48 ; p = 0.0002 ) . This suggests that although SGLT-2is reduce the risk of primary composite outcomes in both sexes , the benefits may be less pronounced in women . These findings highlight the importance of considering sex differences in the use of SGLT-2is for HF treatment . Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and factors contributing to these observed differences in outcomes . This will help inform clinical decision - making and optimize treatment strategies for both male and female patients with HF.In conclusion , this systematic review and meta - analysis suggest that there may be sex differences in the cardiovascular outcomes of SGLT-2is in patients with heart failure . While SGLT-2is are effective in reducing primary composite outcomes in both men and women , the benefits appear to be less pronounced in women . These findings emphasize the need for further research to better understand and address these sex differences in order to optimize treatment approaches for patients with heart failure . Additionally , healthcare providers should consider these sex differences when prescribing SGLT-2is to patients with heart failure , taking into account potential variations in treatment response and outcomes . This study highlights the importance of personalized medicine and tailoring treatments based on individual patient characteristics , including sex . Furthermore , future research should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the observed sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes . Factors such as hormonal differences , genetic variations , and differences in treatment adherence may play a role in these disparities . By gaining a better understanding of these factors , healthcare providers can develop more targeted and effective treatment strategies for both male and female patients with heart failure . In conclusion , this systematic review and meta - analysis provide evidence of potential sex differences in the cardiovascular outcomes of SGLT-2is in patients with heart failure . While SGLT-2is are effective in reducing primary composite outcomes in both sexes , the benefits may be less pronounced in women . Further research is needed to better understand and address these sex differences , ultimately leading to improved treatment outcomes for all patients with heart failure .",2.872741238035776,0.7239388377218469,0.49127332257300005,0.05794600744353964,0.8204487885038058,0.8126439076402913,0.020771513353115726,0.10534124629080119,0.09643916913946587,0.28041543026706234,0.03857566765578635,0.09792284866468842,0.008902077151335312,0.13353115727002968,0.08011869436201781,0.032640949554896145,0.02373887240356083,False,240.0,0.8531157270029673,5.032640949554896,674.0,0.36555965559655595,0.3161131611316113,0.3052890528905289,0.2688806888068881,0.2088560885608856,0.13603936039360393,0.028782287822878228,0.05116851168511685,0.04649446494464945,0.02373887240356083,43.53997395659434,13.138707178631055,14.439760564264141,16.12824040066778,16.631919866444072,15.525475792988306,62.85816360601002,9.32,16.829925128082255,20377158.05072137,30233.172182079183,5.537562604340567,5.0,3.0375790051769376,23.96,23.0,6.999885713352755,1.642737896494157,1.0,0.9313191945585418,599,213,0.3555926544240401,3392,25,58
"The TGF - β pathway is a crucial signaling pathway involved in various cellular processes , including cell growth , differentiation , and migration . It has been shown to play a significant role in the cadherin switching observed in advanced prostate cancer under androgen deprivation therapy . The TGF - β pathway regulates the expression of key transcriptional factors , such as Snail , Slug , and Twist , which are known to be involved in the repression of E - cadherin and induction of N - cadherin . Studies have demonstrated that androgen deprivation therapy promotes the activation of the TGF - β pathway , leading to an increase in the expression of these transcriptional factors . This , in turn , results in the downregulation of E - cadherin and upregulation of N - cadherin , facilitating the epithelial - mesenchymal transition process . Additionally , the TGF - β pathway has been shown to interact with other signaling pathways , such as the Wnt / β - catenin pathway , further amplifying the cadherin switching effect . Furthermore , the role of androgen receptor signaling in the regulation of cadherin switching can not be disregarded . Androgen receptor signaling has been implicated in the modulation of E - cadherin and N - cadherin expression levels . Androgen deprivation therapy disrupts androgen receptor signaling , leading to altered expression patterns of these cadherins . The loss of androgen receptor signaling not only affects the cadherin switch but also contributes to the acquisition of a more aggressive and invasive phenotype by the tumor cells . Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying androgen deprivation therapy - induced cadherin switching is of utmost importance for developing novel therapeutic strategies . Targeting the TGF - β pathway and its downstream effectors , as well as restoring androgen receptor signaling , could potentially reverse the cadherin switch and inhibit tumor progression in advanced prostate cancer . Further research is needed to elucidate the intricate interplay between these pathways and identify potential therapeutic targets to improve the outcomes of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients . In conclusion , androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer leads to cadherin switching , particularly from E - cadherin to N - cadherin , through the activation of the TGF - β pathway and disruption of androgen receptor signaling . This cadherin switch promotes epithelial - mesenchymal transition and facilitates tumor progression and metastasis .

"Introduction Wilms tumour ( WT ) is a type of kidney cancer that primarily affects children . It arises from abnormal development of the embryonic kidney and is characterized by dysregulated expression of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) , which are short , non - protein - coding RNAs involved in the regulation of gene expression . Currently , there are no reliable circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of WT , highlighting an unmet clinical need . Circulating biomarkers , such as miRNAs , have the potential to aid in the diagnosis , subtyping , prognostication , and monitoring of WT . By analyzing the dysregulated miRNA profiles in the circulation of WT patients , it may be possible to develop non - invasive tests that can accurately detect and classify the disease . In this systematic review and meta - analysis , we aimed to identify and analyze the existing literature on dysregulated circulating miRNAs in WT . Our objective was to establish a comprehensive list of dysregulated miRNAs associated with WT and evaluate their diagnostic accuracy . Methods To identify relevant studies , we conducted a comprehensive search of the PubMed , Scopus , Web - of - Science , and Wiley online library databases . Our search included English and French studies on circulating miRNAs in WT . The search strategy was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) guidelines and was registered in the PROSPERO database . To ensure the quality of the included articles , we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies ( QUADAS ) tool . Results After screening the identified articles , we included a total of five studies comprising 280 samples in our qualitative analysis . These samples consisted of 172 WT patients and 108 healthy controls . From the analysis of these studies , we identified a total of 301 dysregulated miRNAs in the circulation of WT patients . Among these , 144 miRNAs were up - regulated , 143 miRNAs were down - regulated , and 14 miRNAs showed conflicting results . Next , we performed a meta - analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the significantly dysregulated miRNAs identified in two studies . The pooled sensitivity , specificity , and area under the curve ( AUC ) values were calculated . The results showed a sensitivity of 0.67 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 0.62 - 0.73 ) , specificity of 0.95 ( 95 % CI : 0.92 - 0.96 ) , and AUC of 0.77 ( 95 % CI : 0.73 - 0.81 ) for the significantly dysregulated miRNAs . These findings suggest a strong potential for the diagnostic use of circulating miRNAs in WT . Conclusion Circulating miRNAs hold promise as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of WT . However , further research is needed to validate these findings and determine associations with tumor stage and subtype . The findings of this systematic review and meta - analysis provide a comprehensive overview of the dysregulated circulating miRNA profiles in WT , highlighting the potential for developing non - invasive diagnostic tests for this childhood cancer .

"In this scoping review , the researchers aimed to examine how the frailty index ( FI ) has been applied to older adults with cancer in oncology studies . The FI is a measure of frailty that is typically used as a continuous variable , but different studies have used various cut - off points to categorize participants as either frail or non - frail . These cut - off points have mostly been validated in acute care or community settings for older adults without cancer . To conduct the review , the researchers searched multiple databases for studies that measured and categorized the FI in adults with cancer . Out of the 1994 studies screened , 41 met the inclusion criteria . The researchers extracted data on the oncological setting , FI categories used , and the references or rationale provided by the study authors for their categorization choices . The results showed that the FI scores used to categorize participants as frail ranged from 0.06 to 0.35 , with 0.35 being the most commonly used cut - off point . This was followed by 0.25 and 0.20 . While most studies provided a rationale for their chosen FI categories , the relevance of these rationales was not always clear . Interestingly , three studies that used an FI cut - off point of 0.35 to define frailty were frequently referenced as the rationale for subsequent studies , but the original rationale for this categorization was unclear . The review also found that few studies sought to determine or validate the optimal FI categories specifically for older adults with cancer . The variability in how the FI has been categorized in this population is significant . While an FI ≥ 0.35 was most frequently used to categorize frailty in older adults with cancer , this range has often represented at least moderate to severe frailty in other highly - cited studies . In contrast , a scoping review of highly - cited studies categorizing the FI in older adults without cancer found that an FI ≥ 0.25 was most common . Given these findings , the researchers suggest that maintaining the FI as a continuous variable would be beneficial until further validation studies can determine the optimal FI categories for older adults with cancer . The differences in how the FI has been categorized , as well as how older adults have been labeled as "" frail , "" limit the ability to synthesize results and understand the impact of frailty in cancer care . The complete version of this article with supplementary material is available online at the provided link . In conclusion , the categorization of frailty using the frailty index in oncology studies for older adults with cancer is highly variable . Different studies have used different cut - off points to define frailty , and few studies have sought to determine or validate the optimal cut - off points specifically for this population . The most commonly used cut - off point in these studies was an FI ≥ 0.35 , but this range has often represented moderate to severe frailty in other studies . Maintaining the frailty index as a continuous variable until further validation studies are conducted would be beneficial . The differences in categorization and labeling of frailty in older adults with cancer limit our ability to synthesize results and understand the impact of frailty in cancer care .",2.9130987288843584,0.582460527080757,0.43812649806796417,0.051465267508610725,0.8410696756272089,0.8371844947338104,0.03986135181975736,0.09185441941074524,0.09532062391681109,0.2322357019064125,0.060658578856152515,0.11785095320623917,0.02079722703639515,0.1317157712305026,0.10398613518197573,0.02772963604852686,0.012131715771230503,False,248.0,0.8821490467937608,4.748700173310225,577.0,0.2192400482509047,0.17973462002412546,0.13751507840772015,0.05006031363088058,0.05006031363088058,0.05006031363088058,0.032569360675512665,0.037997587454764774,0.04342581423401689,0.0,54.59248870154704,11.550579697549107,13.676956848237424,15.245228576394926,14.645770902138018,13.153116634799236,53.983052320528415,7.181818181818182,15.022193568946616,3342379.6086218636,5792.6856301938715,5.135755258126195,4.0,2.830238717533842,23.772727272727273,25.0,7.507159117570969,1.5143403441682601,1.0,0.8598128297130013,523,173,0.33078393881453155,2740,22,67

"The use of programmable RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes is a potential option for the treatment of inherited retinal diseases ( IRDs ) . RNA editing has the advantage of not creating permanent off - target edits in the genome and offers innovative delivery options . ADAR enzymes are responsible for the most common form of posttranscriptional RNA editing in humans , specifically the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine in double stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) . This enzymatic activity has been utilized to correct pathogenic single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) in the human genome at a transcriptional level . Previously , the most successful editing rates were achieved through the exogenous delivery of the catalytically active ADAR deaminase domain ( ADARDD ) fused to an RNA binding protein . However , this approach has limitations , including the risk of immune response against foreign proteins and transcriptome - wide off - target effects . More recently , it has been demonstrated that endogenous ADARs can be recruited to specific target sites using an ADAR - recruiting guide RNA , without the need for exogenous ADARDD . This approach offers advantages such as reduced packaging space requirements and decreased immune response risks . Despite these advantages , the editing efficiency of endogenous ADAR recruitment has been relatively low . However , recent advancements in the development of circular ADAR - recruiting guide RNAs and the optimization of ADAR - recruiting antisense oligonucleotides have shown promising results in vitro and in vivo . Comparable target editing efficiency to exogenous ADAR editing has been demonstrated in both wild - type and disease mouse models , as well as in wild - type non - human primates ( NHP ) immediately after and up to 6 weeks following application . Given these encouraging findings , RNA editing with endogenous ADAR has the potential to be a valuable option for the treatment of IRDs . In the field of IRD treatment , gene replacement therapy has proven to be safe and effective . However , there is still a need for treatment options for genes that exceed the packaging capacity of adeno - associated viruses ( AAV ) or are expressed in multiple retinal isoforms . RNA editing with endogenous ADAR could address these challenges . In conclusion , the recent advancements in RNA editing with endogenous ADAR have shown promising target editing efficiency and offer advantages such as decreased off - target effects and reduced immune response risks . This approach could be a viable option for the treatment of inherited retinal diseases , particularly for genes that can not be effectively targeted using other therapeutic strategies . Further research and development in this field could lead to significant advancements in the treatment of IRDs . Overall , programmable RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes has the potential to be a feasible and attractive option for the treatment of inherited retinal diseases . The ability to correct pathogenic single nucleotide variants without creating permanent off - target edits in the genome and the availability of innovative delivery options make RNA editing a promising therapeutic approach . While exogenous delivery of ADAR enzymes has shown promising results , the use of endogenous ADARs has advantages such as reduced immune response risks and transcriptome - wide off - target effects . Although the editing efficiency of endogenous ADAR recruitment has historically been low , recent developments in circular ADAR - recruiting guide RNAs and ADAR - recruiting antisense oligonucleotides have significantly improved target editing efficiency . Comparable editing rates to exogenous ADAR editing have been demonstrated in both animal models and non - human primates , indicating the potential for effective treatment in humans . In the field of inherited retinal diseases , gene replacement therapy has been established as safe and efficacious . However , there is still a need for treatment options for genes that exceed the packaging capacity of adeno - associated viruses or are expressed in multiple retinal isoforms . RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes could offer a solution to these challenges . In conclusion , the recent advancements in RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes show promise for the treatment of inherited retinal diseases . Further research and development in this field could lead to significant improvements in the treatment options available for patients with these conditions .",2.947476989634154,0.579139022239378,0.4617174130056908,0.0570073425337369,0.8801767517019201,0.8745553974921887,0.031420765027322405,0.1051912568306011,0.1366120218579235,0.30327868852459017,0.05191256830601093,0.10109289617486339,0.01092896174863388,0.12431693989071038,0.08060109289617487,0.0273224043715847,0.00819672131147541,False,256.0,0.8907103825136612,5.219945355191257,732.0,0.4283831282952548,0.3815905096660808,0.32403339191564146,0.2827328646748682,0.211115992970123,0.19046572934973638,0.024165202108963092,0.02460456942003515,0.04152021089630931,0.009562841530054645,36.50647588055131,13.961099868737694,15.43852017318444,17.291817982935903,17.22125027346314,16.62597243491577,63.29080070006563,9.321428571428571,18.33389326679783,91687193.11606553,125255.72830063598,5.730474732006126,5.0,3.078494180744477,23.321428571428573,23.5,6.563174163622416,1.7335375191424196,1.0,0.9240992703470877,653,222,0.33996937212863704,3821,28,75

"Noncoding genetic variants , once considered to have little or no functional significance , are now recognized as key players in the development of cardiomyopathies . While coding variants in protein - coding genes have been extensively studied , noncoding variants have received less attention despite their potential contribution to disease pathogenesis . Noncoding genetic variants refer to DNA sequence variations that do not affect the protein - coding regions of the genome . Instead , they occur in regions of the genome that regulate gene expression and function . These regions include transcriptional enhancers , promoters , intronic sites , and untranslated regions . Emerging evidence suggests that noncoding variants in these regions can disrupt gene regulatory elements , leading to aberrant gene expression and ultimately contributing to the development of cardiomyopathies . Several studies have reported associations between noncoding variants and various types of cardiomyopathies , including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , dilated cardiomyopathy , and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy . For example , variants in transcriptional enhancers have been found to affect the expression of key cardiac genes , leading to altered cardiac structure and function . Similarly , variants in promoters can affect the initiation of gene transcription , leading to dysregulation of important cardiac genes . Intronic variants may disrupt splicing and alter the balance of isoforms , while variants in untranslated regions can affect the stability or translation efficiency of mRNA . Despite these findings , the role of noncoding variants in cardiomyopathies remains largely understudied . One reason for this is the technical challenges associated with studying noncoding regions of the genome . However , with the advancements in DNA sequence technologies and the decreasing costs of genetic testing , more patients are now undergoing genetic testing , leading to the identification of a growing number of noncoding variants . As a result , there is a need for further research to validate and understand the functional consequences of these variants in the context of cardiomyopathies . In conclusion , noncoding genetic variants play a significant role in the development of cardiomyopathies . While coding variants have traditionally received more attention , noncoding variants are now recognized as important contributors to disease pathogenesis . Future research should focus on understanding the functional consequences of these variants and their impact on gene regulation in order to improve our understanding of cardiomyopathy development and potentially incorporate noncoding variants into genetic screening tests . This will not only enhance our ability to diagnose and predict disease risk but also facilitate the development of targeted therapies for patients with cardiomyopathy . It is clear that noncoding genetic variants are an important piece of the puzzle in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiomyopathies , and further investigation in this area will undoubtedly lead to important advancements in the field . Furthermore , the incorporation of noncoding genetic variants into genetic screening tests has the potential to improve our ability to diagnose and predict disease risk . By identifying individuals with these variants , healthcare providers can offer early interventions and personalized treatment strategies . Additionally , understanding the functional consequences of noncoding variants can guide the development of targeted therapies that specifically address the underlying molecular mechanisms of cardiomyopathies . In conclusion , the role of noncoding genetic variants in cardiomyopathies is an area of ongoing research . While traditionally overlooked , these variants are now recognized as important contributors to disease pathogenesis . Future studies should focus on validating and understanding the functional consequences of noncoding variants in the context of cardiomyopathies . By doing so , we can enhance our understanding of cardiomyopathy development and potentially improve patient care through personalized treatment strategies .",2.7577791395786653,0.4587277616441709,0.4742517471615738,0.05154147039712807,0.8865536236763001,0.8957241028547287,0.035830618892508145,0.09446254071661238,0.0993485342019544,0.2980456026058632,0.043973941368078175,0.12866449511400652,0.014657980456026058,0.13192182410423453,0.0732899022801303,0.03257328990228013,0.026058631921824105,False,225.0,0.9055374592833876,5.851791530944626,614.0,0.2736566809320019,0.20470756062767476,0.17261055634807418,0.0932001902044698,0.07037565382786495,0.04089396100808369,0.023537803138373753,0.029957203994293864,0.028530670470756064,0.004885993485342019,20.342205312672945,15.734532374100723,16.89633530985517,19.41715550636414,19.208081073602656,20.20035971223022,71.20475926950748,10.653846153846153,17.646163148514525,46092608.02194918,75069.39417255567,6.357913669064748,6.0,3.6094837062439407,21.384615384615383,20.5,6.569609068552669,1.9478417266187051,2.0,1.1054861638224036,556,216,0.38848920863309355,3593,26,77
"Introduction : Transactional sex , defined as casual sex between two individuals in exchange for material incentives , is a widespread practice in Sub - Saharan Africa . This practice has been associated with various negative consequences , including an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV / AIDS , unintended pregnancies , unsafe abortions , and psychological trauma . Numerous primary studies have been conducted in different countries within Sub - Saharan Africa to examine the prevalence of transactional sex among women and its associated factors . However , these studies have yielded inconsistent and often contradictory results , making it challenging to draw definitive conclusions . To address this issue , we conducted a systematic review and meta - analysis to synthesize the pooled prevalence of transactional sex among women in Sub - Saharan Africa and to identify the factors associated with this practice . By analyzing a comprehensive range of studies conducted between 2000 and 2022 , we aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and determinants of transactional sex in this region . Methods : We conducted a thorough search of multiple databases , including PubMed , Google Scholar , HINARI , the Cochrane Library , and grey literature sources , from March 6 to April 24 , 2022 . We included studies conducted between 2000 and 2022 to ensure that we captured the most recent and relevant data . The pooled prevalence of transactional sex and its associated factors were estimated using a Random Effect Model . We used Stata ( version 16.0 ) for data analysis . Heterogeneity was assessed using the I - squared statistic , and publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger 's test . Additionally , we conducted subgroup analyses based on study years , source of data , sample sizes , and geographical locations to explore potential sources of heterogeneity . Results : The pooled prevalence of transactional sex among women in Sub - Saharan Africa was found to be 12.55 % ( 9.59%–15.52 % ) . Additionally , several factors were significantly associated with transactional sex . These factors included early sexual debut , substance abuse , history of sexual experience , physical violence abuse , orphanhood , and sexual violence abuse . Discussion : The high prevalence of transactional sex among women in Sub - Saharan Africa underscores the urgent need for interventions and strategies to address this issue . The identified factors associated with transactional sex highlight the importance of targeting specific vulnerable populations and addressing underlying social determinants . By understanding the prevalence and determinants of transactional sex , policymakers and public health practitioners can develop targeted interventions to mitigate the negative consequences associated with this practice . In conclusion , this systematic review and meta - analysis provide valuable insights into the prevalence and associated factors of transactional sex among women in Sub - Saharan Africa . The findings emphasize the need for comprehensive interventions that address the underlying drivers of transactional sex and provide support to vulnerable populations . By addressing these issues , we can work towards reducing the negative consequences and improving the overall well - being of women in the region .",2.9255975161950745,0.4425975106927501,0.4661481711117607,0.05010670947633523,0.813493911921978,0.8089021977625395,0.014814814814814815,0.12962962962962962,0.10925925925925926,0.2462962962962963,0.025925925925925925,0.11851851851851852,0.022222222222222223,0.10555555555555556,0.07407407407407407,0.04259259259259259,0.022222222222222223,False,174.0,0.8462962962962963,5.296296296296297,540.0,0.20741394527802295,0.1891732862606649,0.11032656663724624,0.07972933215651662,0.07972933215651662,0.07972933215651662,0.05501618122977346,0.0529567519858782,0.0353045013239188,0.005555555555555556,29.998361945636645,14.587890864500306,16.497647041470138,18.74743511138361,17.81405783772737,18.00729613733905,63.82137747802984,9.238095238095237,14.594930198480593,2180206.594688087,4037.419619792753,5.976394849785407,5.0,3.30130041465248,22.19047619047619,23.0,6.306603097578401,1.8240343347639485,1.0,1.0559161100386478,466,219,0.4699570815450644,2860,21,78
"In conclusion , this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial found that Jinlida granules , when combined with metformin , improved the standard - reaching rate of blood glucose and clinical symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes .

Furthermore , several symptoms exhibited significant improvements in the symptom disappearance rate and symptom improvement rate in the treatment group compared to the control group . These symptoms included thirst , fatigue , increased eating with rapid hungering , polyuria , dry mouth , spontaneous sweating , night sweat , vexing heat in the chest , palms , and soles , and constipation . The total symptom score also showed a significant decrease in the treatment group compared to the control group , indicating an overall improvement in clinical symptoms . However , no significant correlations were found between symptom improvement and HbA1c levels . Based on these findings , Jinlida granules can be considered an effective adjuvant treatment for T2D patients experiencing the aforementioned symptoms . The combination of Jinlida granules with metformin improved the standard - reaching rate of blood glucose and clinical symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes . Additionally , the study suggests that Jinlida granules may have a synergistic effect with metformin , as the combination treatment resulted in greater improvements compared to the control group . This highlights the potential of Jinlida granules as an adjuvant therapy for T2D patients . In conclusion , this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial provides evidence for the efficacy of Jinlida granules in improving the standard - reaching rate of blood glucose and clinical symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes . The findings support the use of Jinlida granules as an adjuvant treatment for T2D patients experiencing symptoms such as thirst , fatigue , increased eating with rapid hungering , polyuria , dry mouth , spontaneous sweating , night sweat , vexing heat in the chest , palms , and soles , and constipation . Further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms underlying the effects of Jinlida granules and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of treatment .",2.95467285568009,0.5669074078074398,0.45427757370562166,0.07475192593470502,0.8274276392026381,0.821307890471958,0.01938610662358643,0.12439418416801293,0.08562197092084006,0.3150242326332795,0.01615508885298869,0.1050080775444265,0.008077544426494346,0.10823909531502424,0.09693053311793215,0.035541195476575124,0.004846526655896607,False,184.0,0.8416801292407108,5.064620355411955,619.0,0.6893152144950706,0.6893152144950706,0.6426858513189448,0.6290967226219025,0.6069810818012257,0.6069810818012257,0.04263256061817213,0.026112443378630428,0.04289901412203571,0.0210016155088853,40.4039956278844,13.424032062181201,14.678114977759865,16.340992632175535,17.021622540684966,16.361713221601487,66.73702534207757,10.130434782608695,17.797663287645406,53632366.0300765,86643.56386118982,5.685288640595903,5.0,2.9940393236598326,23.347826086956523,24.0,9.243605054551868,1.687150837988827,1.0,0.8984171273911694,537,158,0.2942271880819367,3135,23,79

"Introduction : Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease , characterized by genetic and phenotypic diversity both within and between tumors . This heterogeneity plays a critical role in tumor progression and response to treatment . In addition to cancer cell diversity , the tumor microenvironment also contributes to tumor heterogeneity by creating a dynamic and interactive ecosystem . The tumor microenvironment consists of various cellular and non - cellular components , including immune cells , endothelial cells , and stromal cells , which interact with cancer cells and influence their behavior . Impact of the tumor microenvironment on drug resistance : The tumor microenvironment has been shown to play a crucial role in the development of drug resistance . Various components of the microenvironment , such as immune cells and stromal cells , can promote resistance to therapies through different mechanisms . For example , immune cells within the microenvironment can create an immunosuppressive environment , allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and resist immunotherapy . Endothelial cells can contribute to drug resistance by promoting angiogenesis and facilitating tumor vascularization , providing nutrients and oxygen to cancer cells . Additionally , stromal cells , such as cancer - associated fibroblasts , can secrete factors that promote cancer cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy . Deciphering the interactions within the tumor microenvironment : Understanding the complex interactions between different cell types within the tumor microenvironment is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies . Spatial organization and communication between cancer cells and various microenvironmental components influence tumor growth , invasion , and response to treatment . However , deciphering these interactions remains a major challenge due to the complexity and dynamic nature of the microenvironment . Emerging technologies for unraveling the impact of the tumor microenvironment : Recent advances in technology have provided new tools to study the tumor microenvironment and its role in drug resistance . Preclinical models , such as patient - derived xenografts and organoids , allow researchers to recreate the complexity of the tumor microenvironment in vitro or in vivo . These models enable the investigation of interactions between cancer cells and various microenvironmental components and provide a platform for testing novel therapeutic strategies . Additionally , emerging technologies , such as single - cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics , provide unprecedented insights into the heterogeneity and spatial organization of cells within the tumor microenvironment . These technologies allow researchers to identify distinct cell populations and characterize their gene expression profiles , helping to unravel the contribution of specific cell types to drug resistance . Conclusion : The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in breast cancer heterogeneity and drug resistance . Understanding the interactions between cancer cells and the microenvironment is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies . Emerging technologies , such as preclinical models and advanced sequencing techniques , offer promising avenues for unraveling the impact of the tumor microenvironment on drug resistance . By deciphering the complex interactions within the microenvironment , we can develop personalized treatment approaches that target both cancer cells and the surrounding ecosystem , ultimately improving patient outcomes .",2.6548174573900187,0.4263057708821099,0.47467620916939735,0.060131905469447036,0.8882795192978599,0.8788225395338876,0.009578544061302681,0.10727969348659004,0.12260536398467432,0.3486590038314176,0.0210727969348659,0.10727969348659004,0.011494252873563218,0.11685823754789272,0.08237547892720307,0.05747126436781609,0.013409961685823755,True,169.0,0.8908045977011494,5.942528735632184,522.0,0.13883521943141044,0.11012972674579079,0.08308032017664918,0.030361578802097708,0.0,0.0,0.0728677891250345,0.06458735854264422,0.032017664918575765,0.0038314176245210726,14.567251051893408,16.250051425899954,16.918120490482874,19.613838242169237,19.521598877980367,21.240430107526887,64.08835904628332,8.869565217391305,14.686720165006088,2389799.824608516,4578.160583541218,6.548387096774194,6.0,3.824977697685373,20.217391304347824,20.0,5.3075542696369835,2.0301075268817206,2.0,1.249153256972783,465,187,0.4021505376344086,3102,23,81

"The findings of this systematic review and meta - analysis suggest that sedentary behavior , particularly in the domains of occupation and leisure - time , is associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer . The pooled relative risks ( RRs ) indicate that individuals with high levels of overall sedentary behavior have a 28 % higher risk of developing endometrial cancer compared to those with low levels of sedentary behavior . Specifically , the RR for occupational sedentary behavior was 1.22 , indicating a 22 % increased risk , while the RR for leisure - time sedentary behavior was 1.34 , indicating a 34 % increased risk . The RR for total sedentary behavior was even higher at 1.55 , indicating a 55 % increased risk . It is worth noting that the extent of heterogeneity among the included studies varied , with the I2 statistics ranging from 0.0 % to 53.7 % . This suggests that there may be some variability in the results across studies . Furthermore , the meta - analysis found that studies adjusting for physical activity and body mass index tended to have larger pooled RRs . This suggests that the association between sedentary behavior and endometrial cancer may be stronger in individuals who are physically inactive and/or overweight or obese . However , it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the included studies . Most of the studies relied on self - reported measures of sedentary behavior , which may introduce measurement error and bias . Additionally , there was limited objective quantification of sedentary behavior , which may have affected the accuracy and reliability of the results . In conclusion , this study provides evidence that higher levels of sedentary behavior , particularly in the domains of occupation and leisure - time , increase the risk of endometrial cancer . Future research should focus on objectively quantifying sedentary behavior and investigating the interaction between physical activity , adiposity , and sedentary time in relation to endometrial cancer risk . The findings of this systematic review and meta - analysis have important implications for public health . Given the increasing prevalence of sedentary behavior in modern societies , it is crucial to raise awareness about the potential health risks associated with prolonged sitting and promote strategies to reduce sedentary time . Interventions targeting occupational and leisure - time sedentary behavior could be implemented in workplace settings and community programs to encourage individuals to engage in more active behaviors throughout the day . This could include promoting standing or walking meetings , providing opportunities for active breaks , and encouraging employees to use active transportation for commuting . Furthermore , healthcare professionals should incorporate discussions about sedentary behavior into routine patient consultations , emphasizing the importance of reducing sedentary time and encouraging patients to find opportunities for physical activity throughout the day . Overall , this study reinforces the need for a comprehensive approach to cancer prevention , which includes addressing sedentary behavior alongside other established risk factors such as smoking , poor diet , and insufficient physical activity . By implementing strategies to reduce sedentary behavior , we can potentially reduce the burden of endometrial cancer and improve overall population health .",3.044294435757302,0.6445626331147007,0.4681465686577524,0.04725871673726694,0.9039393883002432,0.8905317816469405,0.024029574861367836,0.10720887245841035,0.133086876155268,0.266173752310536,0.038817005545286505,0.1256931608133087,0.0166358595194085,0.11460258780036968,0.07208872458410351,0.036968576709796676,0.025878003696857672,True,181.0,0.8650646950092421,5.371534195933457,541.0,0.1363900174114916,0.10098665118978525,0.08183401044689495,0.08183401044689495,0.08183401044689495,0.08183401044689495,0.08357515960533952,0.02901915264074289,0.01567034242600116,0.0,24.778193396226413,15.728271488469606,16.52667757954773,18.764318658280924,18.55751572327044,17.992368972746323,66.40765199161424,10.15,15.01878625993173,3331010.468536397,6157.135801361177,5.9580712788259955,6.0,3.1487115682438596,23.85,23.5,6.551908119013881,1.8658280922431867,1.0,1.1002315345268106,477,226,0.47379454926624737,2906,20,84

"I. Introduction Obesity has emerged as a major public health concern worldwide , with a significant impact on various aspects of human health , including the development and progression of cancer . The association between obesity and cancer has been extensively studied , and it is now well - established that obesity is strongly linked to an increased risk of several types of cancers , including breast , colorectal , pancreatic , and liver cancer , among others . In addition to altered adipose tissue physiology and chronic inflammation , obesity is also characterized by significant changes in the gut microbiota and metabolic dysregulation . The gut microbiota , which refers to the diverse community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract , plays a crucial role in maintaining host health and modulating various physiological processes , including metabolism and immune function . Recent studies have shown that obesity - associated alterations in the gut microbiota composition and function can have profound effects on the immune response to tumors . These alterations may impair the immune system 's ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells , thereby promoting tumor growth and metastasis . Additionally , obesity - induced changes in the gut microbiota can impact the tumor microenvironment , potentially leading to immune cell dysfunction and further compromising antitumor immunity . Bariatric surgery , which involves the alteration of the gastrointestinal tract to induce weight loss in individuals with severe obesity , has gained significant attention as an effective long - term weight loss strategy . Beyond its primary role in weight management , bariatric surgery has been shown to modulate the gut microbiota composition and function . Emerging evidence suggests that these changes in the gut microbiota following bariatric surgery may have beneficial effects on various aspects of health , including metabolic regulation and immune function . Microbial metabolites , such as short - chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) , inosine , bile acids , and spermidine , have recently emerged as key mediators of the host - microbiota interaction and have been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes , including cancer . Several studies have demonstrated that these microbial metabolites can modulate antitumor immunity and influence tumor growth , metastasis , and response to therapy . In this review , we aim to explore the impact of microbially modified metabolites associated with obesity and bariatric surgery on antitumor immunity . Specifically , we will discuss the changes in microbial metabolites induced by bariatric surgery and their effects on anticancer immunity . By elucidating the relationship between alterations in microbial metabolites due to bariatric surgery and the effectiveness of cancer treatment , this review seeks to provide insights into potential strategies for harnessing microbial metabolites to improve therapeutic outcomes in cancer patients who have not undergone bariatric surgery . I. Introduction Obesity has become a global health concern and is known to significantly influence the development and progression of various types of cancer . Extensive research has established a strong association between obesity and an increased risk of cancers such as breast , colorectal , pancreatic , and liver cancer , among others . In addition to adipose tissue - related physiological changes and chronic inflammation , obesity is characterized by alterations in the gut microbiota and metabolic dysregulation . The gut microbiota , which consists of a diverse community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract , plays a critical role in maintaining overall health and regulating various physiological processes , including metabolism and immune function . Recent studies have highlighted the impact of obesity - associated changes in the gut microbiota on the immune response to tumors . These alterations may hinder the immune system 's ability to identify and eliminate cancer cells , thereby promoting tumor growth and metastasis . Moreover , changes in the gut microbiota induced by obesity can influence the tumor microenvironment , potentially leading to dysfunction of immune cells and further compromising the effectiveness of antitumor immunity . Bariatric surgery , a procedure aimed at inducing weight loss in individuals with severe obesity by modifying the gastrointestinal tract , has gained recognition as an effective long - term weight management strategy .

"Overall , the phylogeography of sharks and rays is influenced by a combination of life history traits and biogeographic partitions . The late maturity and low fecundity of these species make them highly susceptible to anthropogenic stressors , emphasizing the need for conservation efforts . In this review , we examined data for 40 shark species and 19 ray species to understand patterns of genetic diversity and structure across the Indian , Atlantic , and Pacific Oceans . We constructed haplotype networks for each species based on mtDNA COI and conducted an AMOVA to analyze genetic variation . Most species showed shallow coalescence in their haplotype networks , similar to findings in marine teleosts . Sharks exhibited star topologies , indicating greater dispersal , while rays had more complex mutational topologies , suggesting limited dispersal in their early life stages . Population structuring varied among species groups , likely due to differences in reproductive philopatry , site fidelity , pelagic habitat , migratory habits , and dispersal ability . Pelagic and semi - pelagic species showed lower levels of structure between and within ocean basins compared to reef - associated and demersal species . While there are variations between taxa and groups , there are also broad patterns that can inform management and conservation strategies . Understanding the genetic structure and connectivity of shark and ray populations can help identify priority areas for protection , guide the design of marine protected areas , and inform sustainable fisheries management practices . Furthermore , the phylogeography of sharks and rays is influenced by a combination of life history traits and biogeographic partitions . The late maturity and low fecundity of these species make them highly susceptible to anthropogenic stressors , highlighting the need for conservation efforts . By understanding the genetic diversity and structure of these populations , we can develop effective management strategies to ensure their long - term survival . Additionally , our review highlights the importance of considering both life history traits and biogeographic partitions in conservation efforts for sharks and rays . The late maturity and low fecundity of these species make them particularly vulnerable to human activities such as overfishing and habitat degradation . Therefore , it is crucial to identify and protect key areas that support high genetic diversity and connectivity among populations . Furthermore , our findings suggest that different species and groups of sharks and rays exhibit varying levels of population structuring , which can be attributed to factors such as reproductive philopatry , site fidelity , habitat preferences , and dispersal abilities . Understanding these patterns can help prioritize conservation efforts and design effective management strategies . In conclusion , our review provides a comprehensive understanding of the phylogeography of sharks and rays based on life history traits and biogeographic partitions . This knowledge can inform conservation initiatives aimed at protecting these vulnerable species and their habitats . By considering the genetic diversity and connectivity of populations , we can ensure the long - term survival of sharks and rays in our oceans .",2.7187421025976013,0.3895580427424842,0.4746691852985241,0.0708234654474952,0.8842907428741456,0.8905479029605263,0.021526418786692758,0.10371819960861056,0.11545988258317025,0.31702544031311153,0.021526418786692758,0.10567514677103718,0.007827788649706457,0.1095890410958904,0.05675146771037182,0.0684931506849315,0.0410958904109589,False,171.0,0.8904109589041096,5.5088062622309195,511.0,0.2469172932330827,0.2469172932330827,0.1756390977443609,0.1606015037593985,0.1606015037593985,0.1606015037593985,0.01804511278195489,0.02706766917293233,0.02706766917293233,0.0019569471624266144,35.16942377826405,13.760162550797123,16.55564534867402,18.857934771282693,17.90677294988017,18.364288840262578,63.993852245493386,9.19047619047619,13.82087650820436,1005380.3727363355,1967.4762675857837,6.041575492341357,6.0,3.2253814476450597,21.761904761904763,22.0,5.098130020430571,1.7680525164113785,1.0,1.009163232833232,457,194,0.424507658643326,2815,21,89

"Introduction : Proteinopathies are a diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins , leading to the formation of aggregates that are particularly toxic to neurons . These diseases can be caused by both genetic mutations and sporadic events , resulting in alterations to the structure of proteins . One essential cellular mechanism for clearing these aggregates is autophagy , which has been closely linked to the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( UPS ) . Mutations in both autophagy and UPS pathways have been implicated in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases , especially those associated with protein misfolding and aggregate accumulation . To better understand the molecular and cellular events underlying the role of autophagy in neurodegenerative proteinopathies , numerous studies have utilized Drosophila models . Despite the physiological and morphological differences between the fly and human brain , essential aspects of protein homeostasis , including autophagy , are conserved between these two species . Therefore , Drosophila has served as a valuable model organism for investigating the mechanisms involved in proteinopathies and elucidating the specific role of autophagy in these diseases . In this review , we will provide an overview of the most common neurodegenerative proteinopathies , such as PolyQ diseases ( Huntington ’s disease , Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 , 2 , and 3 ) , Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( C9orf72 , SOD1 , TDP-43 , FUS ) , Alzheimer ’s disease ( APP , Tau ) , Parkinson ’s disease ( a - syn , parkin and PINK1 , LRRK2 ) , and prion diseases .

Introduction : Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by the progressive degeneration and loss of neurons in the central nervous system . Proteinopathies , a subset of neurodegenerative diseases , are characterized by the abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins , leading to the formation of aggregates that are particularly toxic to neurons . These diseases can be caused by both genetic mutations and sporadic events , resulting in alterations to the structure of proteins . One essential cellular mechanism for clearing these aggregates is autophagy , a highly regulated process by which cells degrade and recycle their own components . Autophagy plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been closely linked to the ubiquitin - proteasome system ( UPS ) , another major pathway for protein degradation . Mutations in both autophagy and UPS pathways have been implicated in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases , especially those associated with protein misfolding and aggregate accumulation . To better understand the molecular and cellular events underlying the role of autophagy in neurodegenerative proteinopathies , numerous studies have utilized Drosophila melanogaster , commonly known as the fruit fly , as a model organism . Despite the physiological and morphological differences between the fly and human brain , essential aspects of protein homeostasis , including autophagy , are conserved between these two species .

"Introduction : Communication and information sharing play a critical role in healthcare , as evidenced by inquiries into the failings of medical care . As a result , research on employee voice and silence in healthcare has been extensive . However , the outcomes of interventions aimed at promoting speaking up in healthcare have been disappointing , primarily due to a lack of support from the professional and organizational culture . This suggests a gap in our understanding of employee voice and silence in healthcare , particularly in relation to their impact on healthcare outcomes such as patient safety , quality of care , and worker wellbeing . This integrative systematic review aims to address two key questions concerning employee voice and silence in healthcare . Firstly , how is voice and silence conceptualized and measured in the healthcare context ? Secondly , what is the theoretical background behind employee voice and silence ? By examining quantitative studies published in peer - reviewed journals between 2016 and 2022 , this review aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the existing literature on this topic . Methods : To conduct this review , an integrative systematic literature search was performed using multiple databases , including PubMed , PsycINFO , Scopus , Embase , Cochrane Library , Web of Science , CINAHL , and Google Scholar . The search strategy focused on identifying studies that measured either employee voice or employee silence among healthcare staff . The inclusion criteria were limited to studies published in peer - reviewed journals during the specified time frame . A total of 209 studies were initially identified for full - text screening . After applying the inclusion criteria , 76 studies were selected for the final review . The included studies had a combined sample size of 122,009 participants , with a majority of participants being female ( 69.3 % ) . The review protocol for this study was registered on the PROSPERO register ( CRD42022367138 ) . Results : The results of the review revealed several key findings . Firstly , the concepts and measures of employee voice and silence in healthcare were found to be heterogeneous , indicating a lack of consistency in how these constructs are defined and operationalized . Additionally , the review identified a lack of a unifying theoretical background for employee voice and silence in healthcare . Furthermore , the review highlighted the need for further research to distinguish between safety voice , which pertains specifically to speaking up about safety concerns , and general employee voice , which encompasses a broader range of employee suggestions and opinions . Lastly , the review emphasized the importance of understanding how both voice and silence can coexist and operate in parallel within the healthcare context . Limitations : Several limitations of the reviewed studies were discussed . Firstly , there was a high reliance on self - reported data from cross - sectional studies , which may introduce biases and limit the generalizability of the findings . Secondly , the majority of participants in the included studies were nurses and female staff , which may limit the applicability of the findings to other healthcare professionals and genders . These limitations underscore the need for future research to employ more robust study designs and include a diverse range of healthcare staff . Conclusion : In conclusion , the reviewed research indicates a lack of sufficient evidence on the links between theory , research , and practical implications for the healthcare sector . This highlights the need to improve the assessment approaches for employee voice and silence in healthcare . However , the optimal approach to achieve this improvement has yet to be established . Ultimately , enhancing our understanding of employee voice and silence in healthcare can inform strategies and interventions that promote effective communication , patient safety , and worker wellbeing in the healthcare sector .",2.636796298721027,0.573834810100454,0.4655892001086397,0.0595523772198431,0.8056935747819287,0.7900205658817733,0.02599388379204893,0.12538226299694188,0.0672782874617737,0.3012232415902141,0.03363914373088685,0.11009174311926606,0.013761467889908258,0.12385321100917432,0.0963302752293578,0.045871559633027525,0.019877675840978593,True,239.0,0.863914373088685,5.186544342507645,654.0,0.10605686032138442,0.10605686032138442,0.096168108776267,0.052904820766378244,0.03016069221260816,0.0,0.034610630407911,0.042027194066749075,0.05142150803461063,0.0045871559633027525,40.911295971979,12.444482154719491,13.947489324950684,15.161326167039073,15.709731263965217,16.77183887915937,62.24657286067999,8.379310344827585,19.862100965057262,422669439.6919829,646283.5469296376,5.795096322241681,5.0,3.158128607927033,19.689655172413794,18.0,8.234089980813206,1.725043782837128,1.0,0.9812889356942671,571,264,0.46234676007005254,3392,29,92

"In summary , this overview of systematic reviews examined the effectiveness of digital interventions in reducing alcohol consumption in young people . The review included sub - populations of school - aged children , college / university students , young adults , and both adolescents and young adults . A total of 27 systematic reviews were included , but most were assessed as low quality . The definition of "" digital intervention "" varied across the reviews , and the available evidence was limited in terms of both sub - population and type of intervention . None of the reviews reported on the incidence of cancer or the influence of digital interventions on cancer - related outcomes . In school - aged children , eHealth multiple health behavior change interventions delivered through digital methods were found to be ineffective in preventing or reducing alcohol consumption . There was no effect on the prevalence of alcohol use . In adolescents and/or young adults who were identified as risky drinkers , computer or mobile device - based interventions were effective in reducing alcohol consumption compared to no or minimal intervention . The reduction was approximately 13.4 grams per week . In university / college students , various e - interventions were found to reduce the number of drinks consumed per week compared to assessment - only controls . However , the overall effect was small . Web - based personalized feedback interventions showed a small to medium effect on alcohol consumption in university / college students . Stand - alone computerized interventions were also effective in reducing short - term and long - term alcohol consumption in risky drinkers compared to no intervention . In young adults and adolescents , SMS - based interventions did not significantly reduce the quantity of drinks per occasion or the average number of standard glasses per week . However , these interventions increased the risk of binge drinking episodes . Overall , the evidence suggests that digital interventions , particularly those with feedback , have some potential in reducing alcohol consumption in certain sub - populations of young people . However , the effect is often small , inconsistent , or diminished when only methodologically robust evidence is considered . There is currently no systematic review evidence to support the claim that digital interventions reduce cancer incidence through alcohol moderation in young people . Further research is needed to explore the full potential of digital interventions and to inform evidence - based public health initiatives aimed at reducing alcohol consumption , a major risk factor for cancer . The findings of this overview highlight the need for more methodologically robust research to fully understand the effectiveness of digital interventions in reducing alcohol consumption in young people . It is crucial to determine the most effective types of interventions for different sub - populations and to establish the impact of these interventions on long - term health outcomes , including cancer incidence . Despite the limitations of the current evidence , digital interventions hold promise as a tool for behavior change in young people . They offer a convenient and accessible way to deliver interventions and have the potential to reach a wide audience . However , more research is needed to identify the most effective strategies and to optimize the design and delivery of digital interventions . In conclusion , the evidence suggests that digital interventions can have a modest impact on reducing alcohol consumption in certain sub - populations of young people . However , further research is required to fully understand their effectiveness and to develop evidence - based strategies to reduce alcohol - related harm , including the risk of cancer .",2.6558312278365857,0.5293017808128171,0.4854382093382642,0.06713813524838357,0.8493273162841797,0.8563780983289083,0.03231017770597738,0.11631663974151858,0.1147011308562197,0.308562197092084,0.030694668820678513,0.11147011308562198,0.027463651050080775,0.1147011308562197,0.07754442649434572,0.033925686591276254,0.012924071082390954,True,212.0,0.8739903069466882,5.205169628432956,619.0,0.13151041666666666,0.11822916666666666,0.11822916666666666,0.0921875,0.0921875,0.0921875,0.04921875,0.051041666666666666,0.03229166666666667,0.0,34.35424245643861,13.655920810313077,15.952225998937053,18.003938234877463,16.300815979600507,16.849871086556167,61.21610709732256,8.423076923076923,16.907786092714844,22027144.522893205,35585.047694496294,5.793738489871086,6.0,3.20419232485079,20.884615384615383,22.0,6.669834060194642,1.7882136279926335,1.0,1.0269342950958995,543,211,0.3885819521178637,3222,26,95
"Overall , this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a quiz - style online training tool called TORI - TORE for learning birdsong identification and improving attitudes towards birds and natural environments in the context of citizen science biodiversity monitoring projects . The researchers hypothesized that by utilizing memory mechanisms in adaptive learning , TORI - TORE could enhance participants ' skills and interest in bird identification . To test this hypothesis , the researchers conducted a randomized control trial in Fukushima , Japan . Participants were randomly assigned to either the TORI - TORE group or a control group . The TORI - TORE group received training using the online tool , while the control group did not receive any training . Test scores and questionnaires were used to measure the effectiveness of TORI - TORE on bird identification skills and participant attitudes . The results of the study showed that TORI - TORE had positive effects on test scores and trainees ' attitudes towards birds . Participants in the TORI - TORE group performed better on the bird identification tests compared to the control group . Additionally , participants in the TORI - TORE group reported more positive attitudes towards birds and natural environments compared to the control group . However , the researchers also found unexpected results regarding adaptive training . Adaptive training , which focused on unmastered bird species based on individual trainees ' answer history , led to lower scores and satisfaction in TORI - TORE . This suggests that a different approach may be needed when utilizing adaptive learning in online training tools for species identification . Furthermore , the researchers found that certain factors positively influenced test scores . Focusing on species that are relatively easy to remember , having short lag times between training and testing , and longer question intervals all had a positive impact on participants ' scores . In conclusion , TORI - TORE showed promise as a quiz - style online training tool for learning birdsong identification and supporting citizen science . It effectively improved test scores and attitudes towards birds and natural environments . However , there is still room for improvement , particularly in the implementation of adaptive learning . Despite this , TORI - TORE has the potential to contribute to online capacity building and increase interest in natural environments . Overall , the study found that the quiz - style online training tool , TORI - TORE , was effective in improving participants ' bird identification skills and attitudes towards birds and natural environments . The researchers recommend further development of TORI - TORE , particularly in the implementation of adaptive learning techniques . By utilizing memory mechanisms and focusing on species that are easy to remember , TORI - TORE has the potential to enhance online capacity building and engage more individuals in citizen science biodiversity monitoring projects . Additionally , the study highlights the importance of short lag times between training and testing , as well as longer question intervals , in order to optimize learning outcomes . These findings provide valuable insights for the design and implementation of quiz - style online training tools in citizen science projects . Overall , the results of this study support the use of quiz - style online training tools , such as TORI - TORE , in citizen science biodiversity monitoring projects . By improving participants ' bird identification skills and attitudes towards birds and natural environments , these tools can contribute to data acquisition and analysis on a large scale . Furthermore , they have the potential to increase interest in natural environments and engage more individuals in citizen science efforts . Further research and development in this area are warranted to continue enhancing the effectiveness of online training tools for species identification and citizen science participation .",2.8587836514819482,0.49909898746616,0.4633422896017113,0.058584906689599064,0.8873486060362595,0.8841662383079529,0.032507739938080496,0.11764705882352941,0.07120743034055728,0.34520123839009287,0.017027863777089782,0.1021671826625387,0.02631578947368421,0.10371517027863777,0.07120743034055728,0.043343653250773995,0.01393188854489164,False,200.0,0.8730650154798761,5.281733746130031,646.0,0.3532166625585408,0.3076164653684989,0.2124722701503574,0.13261030317968941,0.05126941089474982,0.05126941089474982,0.02218387971407444,0.040670446142469806,0.023416317475967462,0.0,36.6827777777778,13.332198581560288,15.222703865037271,16.9371158392435,16.823486997635932,17.49999999999999,63.08747044917257,8.814814814814815,17.396085972492592,35894188.94368605,55563.759974746215,5.904255319148936,5.0,3.1252885787986973,20.88888888888889,20.0,6.573421981221796,1.7606382978723405,1.0,1.0199135777363706,564,194,0.34397163120567376,3412,27,96
"Introduction : Anxiety disorders are common mental health conditions that can significantly impair a person 's daily functioning and quality of life . While there are several treatment options available , including psychotherapy and medication , some patients may not respond well to these interventions or may experience undesirable side effects . Jiawei Xiaoyao San ( JWXYS ) , a traditional Chinese herbal formula , has shown promising results in the treatment of anxiety disorder . However , its potential has not been fully recognized or explored . Methods : In this review , we conducted a comprehensive search of the literature in PubMed and CNKI to identify studies on JWXYS and its effects on anxiety disorder . Only articles written in English or with English abstracts were selected for inclusion . We reviewed animal experiments , clinical trials , and mechanism studies to gain a better understanding of the therapeutic potential of JWXYS in treating anxiety . Results : The findings of this review suggest that JWXYS has demonstrated excellent clinical efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms . In clinical trials , JWXYS was found to be effective as a standalone treatment for anxiety disorder . Additionally , when used in combination with other medications , it not only reduced anxiety symptoms but also minimized adverse reactions . Preclinical studies further supported the anxiolytic effects of JWXYS , showing therapeutic benefits in reducing anxiety - like behavior . Mechanisms underlying the anxiolytic effects of JWXYS were also explored . It was found that JWXYS may improve the function of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis and regulate hormone levels , contributing to the attenuation of anxiety . Furthermore , JWXYS was found to increase neurotransmitter content , promote neurogenesis , and regulate the synthesis of related enzymes , all of which play crucial roles in anxiety regulation . Conclusion : This review provides evidence that JWXYS can effectively treat anxiety disorders by modulating the central nervous system . However , further research and collaboration among researchers are warranted to fully understand the mechanisms of action and develop innovative drugs based on JWXYS for the treatment of anxiety disorders . By exploring the potential of JWXYS , we may be able to offer new therapeutic options for individuals suffering from anxiety disorders . Overall , this review highlights the potential of Jiawei Xiaoyao San ( JWXYS ) as a treatment for anxiety disorders . It summarizes the findings of animal experiments , clinical trials , and mechanism studies , demonstrating the efficacy of JWXYS in reducing anxiety symptoms . The review also discusses the mechanisms underlying the anxiolytic effects of JWXYS , including its impact on the HPA axis , neurotransmitter content , neurogenesis , and enzyme synthesis . The review concludes by emphasizing the need for further research and collaboration to fully understand the therapeutic potential of JWXYS and develop innovative drugs based on this traditional Chinese herbal formula . By harnessing the potential of JWXYS , new treatment options may be available for individuals with anxiety disorders .",2.7799001361936666,0.4779405123878825,0.46100368308972295,0.07947701928078921,0.8507515646162487,0.8539927661418915,0.03313840155945419,0.12280701754385964,0.09551656920077972,0.2651072124756335,0.04093567251461988,0.11695906432748537,0.021442495126705652,0.1111111111111111,0.07407407407407407,0.03313840155945419,0.025341130604288498,False,178.0,0.8771929824561403,5.288499025341131,513.0,0.18170542635658915,0.1144186046511628,0.037209302325581395,0.037209302325581395,0.037209302325581395,0.0,0.01984496124031008,0.022325581395348838,0.023255813953488372,0.03508771929824561,32.37010680299659,13.814534318687997,15.308715981407026,17.072322332455965,16.552006479044344,17.427260579064583,65.62067220085038,9.227272727272727,14.351717683096087,1709510.5904444426,3332.379318605151,5.897550111358575,6.0,3.1037326852621465,20.40909090909091,19.5,5.613774381814552,1.8173719376391981,2.0,0.9843140567575697,449,201,0.44766146993318484,2713,22,97

"Introduction : Tuberculosis ( TB ) continues to be a significant global health problem , affecting one - third of the global population . The diagnosis of Mycobacterial spp . , the causative agent of TB , is often hindered by long turnaround times and poor sensitivity of conventional diagnostic methods . These limitations can result in treatment delays and the onset of drug resistance . Consequently , there is a need for faster and more accurate diagnostic techniques to facilitate early detection and prevent the development of drug resistance . Molecular diagnostics have been developed to address the limitations of conventional methods . These techniques offer improved sensitivity , but they typically require sophisticated infrastructure , skilled manpower , and are often expensive . In contrast , loop - mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP ) assay , recommended by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in 2016 for TB diagnosis , provides a promising alternative . LAMP assay allows for visual readouts and has the potential to overcome the challenges associated with conventional diagnostics . The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta - analysis to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of LAMP assay for the detection of a panel of Mycobacterium spp . The review follows the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) to ensure a comprehensive and transparent analysis of the available scientific literature . By synthesizing the evidence from relevant studies , we aim to provide insights into the diagnostic efficiency of LAMP assay and its potential to prevent treatment delays and the onset of drug resistance . Methods : To identify relevant studies , a comprehensive search of scientific databases was conducted . A total of 1600 studies on the diagnosis of Mycobacterium spp . were initially identified . From this pool , 30 articles were selected based on predetermined inclusion criteria to meet the criteria of LAMP - based diagnosis for further analysis . Results : The majority of the selected studies were conducted in high disease burden countries such as India , Thailand , and Japan . Sputum was the most commonly used specimen for LAMP assay in these studies . The IS6110 gene was the most frequently targeted gene , and fluorescence - based detection methods were commonly employed . The accuracy and precision rates of LAMP assay varied across the selected studies , ranging from 79.2 % to 99.3 % and 73.9 % to 100 % , respectively . To assess the quality of the included studies , a bias and applicability assessment was conducted using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies ( QUADAS-2 ) tool . Conclusion : Based on the findings of this systematic review and meta - analysis , LAMP technology shows promise as a feasible alternative to current diagnostic methods for Mycobacterium spp . detection . Its potential for rapid testing in low - resource settings , where the burden of TB is high , makes it particularly valuable .",2.5997960093825445,0.9235799698398306,0.4742365010393201,0.06535833293466772,0.7802370475686115,0.7854339907115157,0.025490196078431372,0.13333333333333333,0.09019607843137255,0.25098039215686274,0.03137254901960784,0.09803921568627451,0.023529411764705882,0.11176470588235295,0.09607843137254903,0.03529411764705882,0.011764705882352941,True,173.0,0.8450980392156863,5.02156862745098,510.0,0.05732899022801303,0.05732899022801303,0.03322475570032573,0.03322475570032573,0.03322475570032573,0.0,0.008143322475570033,0.01758957654723127,0.019543973941368076,0.0058823529411764705,37.46056506849317,12.568139269406394,14.848354935788365,16.523744292237446,14.460273972602742,15.992054794520548,57.976027397260275,7.25,15.197567999114394,3983088.172450222,7809.976808725925,5.6826484018264845,5.0,3.189196993108706,18.25,18.5,8.252524866164698,1.7831050228310503,1.0,1.0230170452220988,438,219,0.5,2561,24,100
