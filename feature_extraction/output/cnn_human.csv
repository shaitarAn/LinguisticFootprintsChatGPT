""" Talk of the NSA 's reported spying on Germany and other allies dominated Merkel 's news conference in Brussels , Belgium . It illustrated the anger over this story in Europe and the challenges facing Washington because of it . The Chancellor insisted she is n't the only one concerned ; other European leaders , she said , voiced similar sentiments during the first day of the summit Thursday . Her comments echoed some she 'd made upon arriving Thursday in Belgium , when she said that discussions of "" what sort of data protection do we need and what transparency is there "" should now be on European leaders ' agenda . "" We need trust , ... "" she said . "" Spying among friends is never acceptable . "" Germany : U.S. might have monitored Merkel 's phone U.S. President Barack Obama understands it 's a "" necessity "" for change from his nation 's perspective , according to Merkel , who spoke with the American leader on Wednesday after Germany 's government said it had information the United States might have monitored her phone . She told Obama that eavesdropping among friends is "" never acceptable , no matter in what situation , "" she said . On Thursday , White House spokesman Jay Carney repeated what he said Wednesday -- that Obama assured Merkel that the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor her communications . And in a USA Today op - ed published online Thursday night , Obama 's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco conceded that recent "" disclosures have created significant challenges in our relationships . "" To address them , the President has ordered a "" review ( of ) our surveillance capabilities , including with our foreign partners , "" she wrote . "" We want to ensure we are collecting information because we need it and not because we can , "" said Monaco . The German allegation comes in the same week that French daily newspaper Le Monde reported claims the NSA intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in France over 30 days . And The Guardian newspaper -- citing a document obtained from U.S. government contractor - turned - whistleblower Edward Snowden -- reported Thursday that the NSA monitored phone conversations of 35 world leaders . The confidential memo is from 2006 , which is before Obama became president . None of the monitored world leaders is identified . The phone numbers were among 200 handed over to the NSA by a U.S. official , the memo states . Others were encouraged to share their "" rolodexes "" with the agency , according to the document , even though tracking until then had yielded "" little reportable intelligence . "" Like Carney , NSA spokeswoman Caitlin Haden refused "" to comment publicly on every specific intelligence activity .

""" It is unacceptable that children are killed while they play football . Israel hosting the UEFA Under-21 European Championship , in these circumstances , will be seen as a reward for actions that are contrary to sporting values , "" the statement said . CNN has found no evidence that anyone was killed while playing football . But on November 10 as reported by CNN , four Palestinians were killed when Israeli tank fire hit a building east of Gaza City where mourners were gathered for a funeral , according to Palestinian medical sources . Israel said militants were targeted at several sites after an Israeli Defense Patrol came under attack , wounding four soldiers . The statement on Kanoute 's site adds : "" Despite the recent ceasefire , Palestinians are still forced to endure a desperate existence under occupation , they must be protected by the international community . All people have the right to a life of dignity , freedom and security . We hope that a just settlement will finally emerge . "" Tel Aviv will host the European Under-21 Championship next June , when eight nations will compete in Israel . European football 's governing body UEFA has already rejected calls to move the tournament from pro - Palestine groups including the disputed territory 's football association . Refugee United : Palestinians debut at Homeless World Cup "" UEFA is an apolitical organization and ( Israel ) earned the right to host this competition through a fair , democratic vote , "" UEFA president Michel Platini said in June . "" I am sure that it will be a beautiful celebration of football that , once again , will bring people together . "" World football 's governing body FIFA also says it does not interfere in countries ' political affairs , but said it would help rebuild the stadium in Gaza -- as it did in 2006 following a similar attack . "" We see it our mandate to rebuild football infrastructure which has been destroyed , "" FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said last week . "" Football brings people together and we will support any reconstruction necessary when football infrastructure is destroyed through disasters . "" Palestine : A national soccer team without a nation Valcke 's statement was criticized by Israeli media , which reported that the stadium was used by Hamas militants to fire rockets at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv . Palestine 's bid for recognition was boosted last week when the U.N. general assembly voted to upgrade its status to that of a non - member observer state -- a move which was opposed by Israel and the U.S. "" We came to the United Nations not to confront the U.S. and not to isolate Israel or to discriminate Israel . We came to preserve the two - state solution , "" Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat told CNN 's Piers Morgan .",2.628831116310048,1.1899070408407302,0.3765690543491581,0.1668494683330166,0.6162152394652367,0.652701702557112,0.11717171717171718,0.1717171717171717,0.0707070707070707,0.07474747474747474,0.13131313131313133,0.04242424242424243,0.13333333333333333,0.01818181818181818,0.06464646464646465,0.046464646464646465,0.03232323232323232,0.06666666666666667,0.012121212121212121,0.01818181818181818,True,193.0,0.8727272727272727,4.626262626262626,495.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00646551724137931,0.0,0.0,0.00202020202020202,56.82008587041378,10.38543325526932,12.540900571622839,13.472911787665886,13.14704137392662,13.218360655737701,51.949258391881344,6.428571428571429,12.675900832610692,319943.86343163496,646.3512392558282,5.182669789227166,4.0,2.7663720678702877,20.333333333333332,19.0,13.37849494465379,1.5292740046838407,1.0,0.8525812507263173,427,241,0.5644028103044496,2290,21,2
""" The card is not only a means of certifying your identity , but also a personal database repository and payment card , all in your pocket . "" The card could also be used for voting in the future , while Chris Onyemenam , director general and CEO of the Nigerian Identity Management Commission ( NIMC ) , said that citizens will have "" the potential to use it as an international travel document . "" Earlier this week , finance minister Ngozi Okonjo - Iweala said 3,000 people had received cards . In order to get the document , Nigerians have to register at one of the NIMC enrollment centers around the country and provide 10 fingerprints , a picture of their face and iris , as well as information about their age and place of birth . Once registered , the NIMC official issues an I.D. number and then the card . Growth opportunity Nigeria produces more oil than any other African nation , but the World Bank says only about 30 % of the population have a bank account . Given 170 million people live in the country , Mastercard claims to have spotted an opportunity for growth . Research conducted by MasterCard 's consultancy arm says that cash dependency in a country like Nigeria can cost up to 1.5 % of Gross Domestic Product . Given Nigeria has recently recently re - calculated it 's 2013 GDP to a figure of $ 488 billion , making it Africa 's biggest economy , that 's certainly an amount the government is keen to keep a hold of . Card controversy But not everyone is happy with this pocket - sized one - stop - shop . Human Rights Activist Shehu Sani attacked the scheme on Facebook : While Eze Onyekpere , lead director at the non - governmental organisation Centre for Social Justice , said the collaboration was not appropriate . "" There should be difference between everyday credit or payment cards and an identity card issued by a sovereign authority , "" he says . "" Even if Mastercard was needed to ensure a good payment system , there is nothing that says it must be heavily embossed on the card . It could guarantee the card without necessarily getting this free advert from 170 million Nigerians . "" Onyekpere has also criticised the way the Nigerian government partnered with the international payments provider . "" The choice of Mastercard did not undergo a competitive selection process , "" he claims . "" It was clearly an abuse of Nigeria 's public procurement process and the selection should have been open to all companies that can provide the service . A MasterCard spokesperson denied the payments company was turning the I.D. card project into a branding exercise . In an emailed statement the company said "" the brand mark is not MasterCard 's corporate logo , nor is it an advertisement for the company . The MasterCard brand displayed on the card is what makes the electronic payment component of the eID card accepted as a means of payment . "" NIMC spokesperson Umar Abdulhamid rejected any allegation of foul play in partnering with MasterCard . "" It 's a level playing field , "" he said In a phone interview . "" Other payment providers have been invited to get involved , but were apprehensive . "" And Daniel Monehin , president of MasterCard 's Sub Saharan Africa division , joined Abdulhamid in dismissing this claim . In a phone interview he said that "" the collaboration went through all the highest levels of government .

""" That automatically , in my opinion and according to the book , would nullify him as a trusted informant . "" "" You may call him an informant by name . According to the bureau , according to the file , he is an informant , "" Fitzpatrick , who spent more than 20 years with the FBI , said before a federal jury in Boston on Monday . He ultimately recommended that Bulger 's file be closed . On cross - examination , prosecution attorney Brian Kelly asked Fitzpatrick rhetorically , "" You would n't go to close a window if it was n't open right ? "" Much of Bulger 's trial has been focused on whether he was an open informant for the FBI in Boston for two decades during the time prosecutors say he reigned over crime in South Boston , participating in 19 murders , racketeering , extortion and money laundering -- all of which he has been charged with . The prosecution previously introduced a 700 - page document that suggests Bulger was an informant . That assertion has been the crux of the prosecution 's case , which wrapped up Friday . The defense argues that Bulger had FBI agents on his payroll to protect him from wiretaps and indictments , but he never fed any information to the FBI . Defense attorney Hank Brennan 's line of questioning indicated that Bulger 's counsel is attempting to shift the pendulum , and put the FBI on trial for corruption . The defense called Fitzpatrick , 73 , to testify about being called in 1981 to "" stop the leaking in Boston . "" "" Inside and outside FBI , "" there was a "" leaking of information , causing lots of investigations to go south , "" Fitzpatrick said . He was assistant special agent in charge , head of the drug task force and white collar crime section of the FBI in Boston . Describing himself as a whistle - blower , he detailed instances when he tried to report leaks and corruption within the FBI in Boston . In one instance , Fitzpatrick testified , the FBI and government strike force attorneys were resisting his efforts to get an FBI informant into the witness protection program . "" I was getting the impression that people were stonewalling our trying to get Halloran out of harm 's way , "" Fitzpatrick said Monday . Brian Halloran , one of Bulger 's former associates , agreed to cooperate with the FBI and implicate Bulger in the murder of a wealthy Oklahoma businessman . Two days after Fitzpatrick complained to his superiors that not enough was being done to put the man in witness protection , Halloran was shot to death , along with a friend , Michael Donahue , who was driving him home .

""" They are horrible to look at , and they illustrate apparent actions that would be serious international crimes . "" A preliminary session for the peace talks , dubbed Geneva II , will begin Wednesday in Montreux , Switzerland , and the formal international talks will commence Friday in Geneva between the Syrian government and opposition delegations . Even as U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki - moon arrived Tuesday in Switzerland , controversy roiled over how the U.N. rescinded an invitation to Iran to join the talks , with Russian officials saying it was a mistake but "" not a catastrophe . "" Iran , accused of supporting the al - Assad regime , announced Monday it would not attend the conference because it objected to preconditions seeking a transitional government . The Syrian Coalition , however , said Iran 's attendance would have been "" a deal - breaker . "" "" Continued Russian and Iranian support for the regime is the main obstacle to finding a solution to the violence in Syria , "" the coalition said in its Tuesday statement . Meanwhile , in Geneva , delegations to the conference continued arriving Tuesday as media outlets awaited their reaction to photographs purporting to show "" systematic torture and killing "" of detainees by the al - Assad regime . Could photos be a game changer ? That assertion is being made by a team of internationally recognized war crimes prosecutors and forensic experts , who analyzed thousands of digital photos taken and provided by a Syrian defector codenamed "" Caesar , "" who , along with his family , is now living outside Syria in an undisclosed location . The experts ' report was partly sponsored by the government of Qatar , which funded the British law firm Carter - Ruck to write it . Qatar and Saudi Arabia provide most of the outside support for Syria 's rebel forces . The experts advancing the report are David Crane , the first chief prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone ; Sir Desmond de Silva , the former chief prosecutor of the same special court ; and Professor Sir Geoffrey Nice , former lead prosecutor against former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic . They shared their findings in a joint exclusive this week with CNN 's "" Amanpour "" and The Guardian newspaper . The experts contend their analysis -- based on thousands of photographs of the dead bodies of alleged detainees killed in Syrian government custody -- would stand up in an international criminal tribunal . In the photos , lifeless bodies show signs of starvation , brutal beatings , strangulation and other forms of torture and killing , according to the report . 4 things to know about Syria In one group of images of 150 individuals examined in detail by the experts , 62 % of the bodies showed emaciation -- severely low body weight with a hollow appearance indicating starvation . The majority of all of the victims were men most likely between ages 20 and 40 . Stomachs , faces and even legs are concave -- sunken , rather than convex . On some torsos , bruising and bleeding is so severe that the victims ' skin is a mosaic of black , red , purple and pink . Oblong and parallel wounds , a mix of bruises and torn skin , line one man 's chest and torso , covering every inch of the victim 's body from neck to pelvis . The forensics team identified the neck bruising as consistent with strangulation with a rope , piece of rubber , or other such object , as opposed to the marks that would be left by a hanging . De Silva likened the images to those of Holocaust survivors . The emaciated bodies were the product of starvation as a method of torture , "" reminiscent of the pictures of those ( who ) were found still alive in the Nazi death camps after World War II , "" de Silva said in a CNN interview .

The president also called for Congress to vote on a package of gun proposals aimed at decreasing shootings like ones that occur daily on streets and in homes , as well as mass killings in recent months at a school , a movie theater and even a place of worship . According to the Centers of Disease Control , there were 11,078 homicides by firearm in the United States in 2010 , and 7,220 of the victims -- 65 % -- were aged 15 - 34 . In addition , 6,151 -- or 56 % -- were African American , a demographic that comprises about 13 % of the total U.S. population . "" This is not just a gun issue , "" he continued . "" It 's also an issue of the kinds of communities that we 're building , and for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it . "" It all starts at home , the president said , calling "" strong , stable families "" and "" loving , supportive parents "" the most important ingredients for reducing violence . Noting he was raised by a single mother , he called for promoting marriage and encouraging fatherhood , saying he wished he had a father around and involved when he was a boy . "" By the way , that 's all kinds of parents , "" he added , drawing applause when he specified "" it includes gay or straight parents . "" He acknowledged the challenge , saying "" it will not be easy , but it can be done . "" "" No solution we offer will be perfect , "" he said . "" But perfection has never been our goal . Our goal has been to try and make whatever difference we can . "" Obama headed to his hometown after a White House ceremony Friday morning to award the Presidential Citizens Medal -- the nation 's second - highest civilian honor -- to 18 people . They included posthumous honors for six educators killed along with 20 first - graders in December 's Connecticut school massacre . The president hugged family members of the slain teachers and administrators from Sandy Hook Elementary School in presenting the medals , saying : "" We could not be more grateful to your loved ones , who gave everything they had "" for the children in their care . In his remarks later at Chicago 's Hyde Park Academy High School , Obama mentioned Hadiya Pendleton , 15 , who was killed by gunfire in the city last month after returning from taking part in inaugural activities in Washington . Pendleton 's parents were in the crowd Friday , just as they were at the State of the Union as guests of first lady Michelle Obama , who attended Hadiya 's funeral . The president said his package of gun measures was intended to save young lives and that "" they deserve a vote , "" repeating the phrase a few times as he did in Tuesday 's address at the Capitol . Chicago 's record murder rate : Do n't blame guns alone Fierce opposition by the National Rifle Association makes passage of any significant gun legislation uncertain . In response to Obama 's State of the Union address , the NRA has sought to discredit the motives and impacts of legislation proposed by the president and Democrats .

"Rubio largely kept to his prepared remarks , except when he abruptly stopped talking about halfway through to reach for a drink of water . The son of Cuban immigrants referred emotively to his personal story and that of his family , though his policy criticisms and proposals were largely in line with prevailing mainstream and , in some cases , conservative Republican thinking . On immigration , for instance , on which Rubio has been one of his party 's most outspoken proponents of efforts to "" modernize "" the current system , he did n't mention his past support of a route to citizenship for undocumented immigrants now in the United States . The senator did generally advocate "" a responsible , permanent solution to the problem of those who are here illegally . "" But he added that first , "" we must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws . "" Speaking about gun control measures , one of the most emotional parts of Obama 's State of the Union speech , Rubio said he was for "" effectively "" dealing with such violence , then added , "" but unconstitutionally undermining the Second Amendment rights of law - abiding Americans is not the way to do it . "" CNN Fact Check : Rubio says Obamacare needs a check up He sharply criticized Obama on many fronts . The president , Rubio claimed , had unfairly cast Republicans as opposing the environment and seniors , and only caring about rich people . He contended that it was Obama who , if his plans are enacted , would hurt the majority of Americans by preventing the economy from growing . "" The tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle class families , "" Rubio said , referring to Obama . "" It will cost them their raises . It will cost them their benefits . It may even cost some of them their jobs . "" His remarks often reflected the sharp partisan divide on budgetary matters . Top Democrats , including Obama , have consistently said that increased government revenues should be paired with spending cuts to bring down the deficit . Congress already raised tax rates on top income earners as part an agreement in January to avert the worst aspects of the so - called fiscal cliff . And now , Obama and Democrats want to eliminate some tax breaks and loopholes to further raise revenue . Republican leaders have sought to reduce the size of government and , therefore , generally oppose any increase in tax revenue . 5 things we learned from the State of the Union They have called for aggressive spending cuts and steps to overhaul entitlement programs , while rejecting any new attempts to increase revenue as part of further steps to reduce the deficit .

"As day broke on Tuesday , four people were killed across Syria , opposition activists said . At least 144 people were reported killed Monday , including 64 who died in a "" horrifying massacre "" at a checkpoint in Homs province . Those killed at a checkpoint in the Abel area were attempting to flee shelling in the Baba Amr neighborhood in the city of Homs , said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria , a network of opposition activists . "" Reports said security members and thugs kidnapped the women among them , "" the network said in a statement . Residents found 47 corpses in one area and 17 in a second one , it said . A total of 68 corpses were found in the area , in farmland in western Homs province , said the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , apparently referencing the same incident . The bodies were found after an injured survivor reported the attack , the group said . All the bodies had been either shot or stabbed . In all , 104 people were killed Monday in Homs , an opposition stronghold , according to the LCC . They included four defected soldiers , three woman and three children . The deaths came on a day when Syrian officials announced that the nation 's new draft constitution received approval and the European Union imposed new sanctions on the country amid ongoing clashes . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said earlier explosions rocked Homs and shelling was occurring in Baba Amr . Twenty people were wounded when a large shell struck an anti - government gathering in Homs , the group said . Meanwhile , Interior Minister Mohammed al - Shaar announced that 89.4 % of voters approved the draft constitution , and 57.4 % of eligible voters cast ballots . President Bashar al - Assad 's regime has touted the constitutional referendum as a move toward reform . Syria announced the referendum amid intense international cries to stop the bloodshed and open its regime to change . But analysts and protesters widely describe the effort as a farce , a superficial attempt to pacify al - Assad 's critics . "" We dismiss it as absolutely cynical . ... Essentially , what he 's done here is put a piece of paper that he controls to a vote that he controls so that he can try and maintain control , "" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said of the referendum and al - Assad . She cited the ongoing violence in such cities as Homs and Hama and asked : "" How could you possibly have any kind of a democratic process in conditions like that ? "" Aid efforts were under way in the midst of the violence . The Syrian Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross entered the province of Hama on Monday to provide aid to civilians , said Simon Schorno , spokesman for the Red Cross . A one - month supply of food , along with blankets and hygiene kits , were distributed to 12,000 people , he said . Beatrice Megevand - Roggo , the Red Cross ' head of operations for the Middle East , said a handful of aid workers were also able to go into Baba Amr . "" There were four ambulances that entered Baba Amr , belonging to the Syrian Red Crescent . They were loaded with medical goods .

"It 's not clear whether Pedro Hernandez -- described by police as an off - the - books former stock boy turned 51 - year - old murder suspect -- was ever interviewed in the initial case . But more than three decades after Etan vanished , authorities say Hernandez confessed to the boy 's killing after being brought in for questioning last week . Hernandez has since been charged with second degree murder and is currently awaiting trial . But attorney Harvey Fishbein said his client -- who is currently on suicide watch at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan -- has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation . According to police , the former stock clerk claims he lured Etan to the store 's basement with the promise of a soda before choking him to death . He then allegedly disposed of the body using a plastic bag , placing the boy inside a trash bin located a block and a half away from his work . "" The detectives thought ( that confession ) was a feeling of relief on his part , "" said Police Commissioner Ray Kelly , who described Hernandez as remorseful . Prosecutors are now confronted with the task of corroborating that confession and piecing together a murder mystery that for decades has been littered with false positives . The image of Hernandez , meanwhile , has gradually come into focus as attention homes in on the reclusive suspect who , according to his attorney , apparently suffers from a "" long psychiatric history "" that includes schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and hallucinations . The Hernandez family -- a large clan consisting of 11 brothers and sisters -- moved from Puerto Rico to southern New Jersey in the early 1970s , a relative told CNN . Pedro Hernandez attended high school in the Camden , New Jersey , area before moving to Manhattan at the age of 18 , sharing an apartment in the city 's SoHo neighborhood with his older sister . Sometime after his 19th birthday , Hernandez took a job as a stock clerk at a corner convenience store . He worked in the Lower Manhattan bodega for roughly a month before returning to his mother 's south Jersey home in the summer of 1979 , according to family members and police . Etan disappeared roughly a month earlier on May 25 . Describing Hernandez as having been a quiet young man , relatives say his demeanor changed upon his return to New Jersey . He grew further withdrawn while also frequently becoming ill , they said . Though his whereabouts after 1979 remain murky , family members say at one point he returned to New York .

"The threat surfaced in recent weeks with fliers offering a reward for information on the identity of the administrator or his family . "" I think what is happening to me is the least relevant thing that is happening in my state , "" the blogger said . "" There are hundreds of families waiting for their missing ones , who at their moment of filing complaints were filled with fear by authorities who told them to assume they are dead . "" Tamaulipas has one of the highest levels of violence in Mexico . It is among the states with the highest levels of homicide , extortion and kidnapping , according to official statistics . "" The criminals truly think that they are in the right and that everyone else should obey them , "" the blogger said . "" They think that crime is a job and causing damage is a right . "" Criminals lower their profile The violence in Tamaulipas persists , despite the reduction in the intensity of shootouts between groups , the administrator said . "" ( Organized crime ) has only lowered its profile . It carries out its activities like always , kidnapping , executing , disappearing people , terrorizing , "" he said . "" What has declined in the past years are the illegal roadblocks and the very large shootouts , but the criminal control remains the same , or stronger . "" The administration of former President Felipe Calderon , who left office in 2012 , attributed the violence in Tamaulipas to a turf war between the Gulf cartel and the Zetas cartel over control of drug smuggling routes to the United States . To combat them , in 2010 he launched an operation that sent additional security forces to Tamaulipas and the neighboring Nuevo Leon state . The threat The offers of reward money in exchange for information about Courage for Tamaulipas first surfaced between February 8 and 10 . During those days , anonymous fliers began to circulate in Ciudad Victoria -- the capital -- and the border cities of Reynosa , Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo .

"The unrest has centered in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions , where separatists have claimed independence following a disputed referendum earlier this month -- and many there did not get to cast ballots Sunday . As of 3 p.m. ( 8 a.m. ET ) , some 528 polling sites out of 2,430 were open in the Donetsk region , the regional administration said . Local officials said there was 11.8 % turnout at these polling stations . Outside the country 's restive east , voting was progressing more normally . The Central Election Commission put voter turnout at nearly 38 % as of 3 p.m. local time , not including the Donetsk and Luhansk regions , Ukraine 's official Ukrinform news agency reported . In the city of Donetsk , the regional capital where pro - Russia militias are concentrated , there were no open polling stations , local officials said earlier . A CNN team driving through the city Sunday morning was not able to see a single polling station in operation . However , there were signs some voters were trying to go to polling stations in areas west and south of the city . Besides the presidential race , candidates are also running in municipal elections in some cities . The Organization for Security and Co - operation in Europe deployed 900 observers for the election -- the largest such mission in its history . Oleksandr Turchynov , Ukraine 's acting President , called the polls open and transparent . "" The voting was free , without artificial restrictions and administrative pressure , "" Turchynov said in a statement . U.S. President Barack Obama congratulated Ukrainians for casting their ballots Sunday and criticized Russian - backed separatists , whom he accused of trying to block voting . "" Despite provocations and violence , millions of Ukrainians went to the polls throughout the country , and even in parts of eastern Ukraine , where Russian - backed separatist groups sought to disenfranchise entire regions , some courageous Ukrainians still were able to cast their ballots , "" he said in a written statement . "" We commend the resolve of all those who participated , as well as the efforts of the Ukrainian government to conduct these elections in the face of those threats . "" Intimidation in eastern Ukraine appears widespread Increasing violence in the east has led the authorities in Kiev to accuse Russia , which they say is backing the armed separatists , of seeking to disrupt the vote . Russia denies having direct influence over the militants , and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will respect the Ukrainians ' choice . Amid heightened tensions , instances of intimidation in eastern Ukraine appear widespread . A large separatist rally was held in a central Donetsk city square around lunchtime . The protesters , who chanted pro - Russia slogans as they were addressed by separatist leaders , were joined by a substantial number of militants on trucks , some firing guns into the air . On the back of some of the trucks were armed men who appeared to be",2.8601355357352443,0.6498310706826527,0.45462528298455096,0.05349952582971305,0.8220081627368927,0.8143023660308436,0.1157495256166983,0.20683111954459202,0.10815939278937381,0.09867172675521822,0.08538899430740038,0.03225806451612903,0.11764705882352941,0.020872865275142316,0.08918406072106262,0.03795066413662239,0.011385199240986717,0.03795066413662239,0.015180265654648957,0.022770398481973434,True,197.0,0.857685009487666,4.700189753320683,527.0,0.0,0.02197802197802198,0.02197802197802198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007992007992007992,0.0,0.0,0.0,54.79218088986144,11.023182244451394,12.94502277883236,14.131457747212671,14.206794831718241,13.745207877461702,56.11639053871001,7.476190476190476,14.853140417476435,2822519.3129390073,5355.8241232239225,5.256017505470459,5.0,2.79537205528772,21.761904761904763,21.0,9.175042555524831,1.536105032822757,1.0,0.8821773676564737,457,245,0.5361050328227571,2477,21,12
"In remarks to business leaders on Wednesday , Obama said Boehner and Republicans have to take the first step . "" I think there is recognition that maybe they can accept some rate increases as long as it is combined with serious entitlement reform and additional spending cuts , "" the president said . "" And if we can get the leadership on the Republican side to take that framework , to acknowledge that reality , then the numbers actually are n't that far apart . "" He added that "" we can probably solve this in about a week -- it 's not that tough . "" The statements reflected how negotiations on the automatic spending cuts and tax hikes set to occur on January 1 -- the fiscal cliff -- have evolved since Obama 's re - election , and Democratic gains in both houses of Congress , last month . Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told CNBC Wednesday the Obama administration is "" absolutely "" prepared to go off the fiscal cliff "" if there 's no prospect to an agreement that does n't involve those rates on the top 2 % . "" Republicans opposed to any new revenue in their quest to shrink government now realize Obama 's victory and public support for the president 's campaign theme of higher taxes on the wealthy leave them with little negotiating leverage . Read more : The road to fiscal cliff paved with good intentions Less than four weeks from the fiscal cliff , GOP leaders face a choice : Agreeing to Obama 's demand to hold down tax rates on most Americans while allowing higher rates on top earners , or being blamed for everyone 's taxes going up in 2013 . Polls show that more Americans will blame Republicans , instead of Obama and Democrats , if there is no deal and the nation goes over the fiscal cliff . A Washington Post / Pew Research Center survey released Tuesday put the margin at 53%-27 % in citing Republicans or Obama . A CNN / ORC International poll released last week showed 45 % would blame congressional Republicans compared to 34 % who would hold Obama responsible . Economists warn that the fiscal cliff 's automatic tax hikes and spending cuts would invite recession . Republican Sen. Tom Coburn , a leading deficit hawk , said Wednesday that to avoid the crisis , he would support higher tax rates on wealthier Americans as part of a broader deal with Obama and congressional Democrats . Homes , cars , jobs : Americans already making big decisions over fiscal cliff "" I know we have to raise revenue , "" the senator from Oklahoma told MSNBC . "" I do n't really care which way we do it . Actually , I would rather see rates go up than do it the other way , because it gives us a greater chance to reform the tax code and broaden the base in the future . "" Despite the public stance softening of some Republicans in each house , signs point to a continuing standoff . Obama and Boehner spoke on the phone Wednesday afternoon , for the first time in a week , according to a source familiar with the call . But the source said the conversation did n't lead to any breakthrough .

"Bang . Nawroz falls to the ground . Two more shots ring out . The warlord ordered the man to pull the trigger twice , but he kept on , unable to deliver a swift fatal shot . "" Stop shooting , you donkey , "" the spectators say . "" He 's still alive , "" says one . But not for long . This is not a video taken before 2001 , in the days when the Taliban ruled and Kabul 's stadium was reserved not for soccer , but public executions . It 's from last month . After a decade of the U.S.-led war to defeat extremism in Afghanistan , feudal justice still exists . In remote Kand , outside the reach of NATO or the Afghan government , warlord Mullah Mustafa and his men rule by the gun . Mustafa helps keep the Taliban at bay , the people say , so the government lets him run his own fiefdom . It 's not the sort of compromise the United States imagined a decade ago , bringing a type of justice that 's swift and brutal . Human Rights Watch has said that in large parts of Afghanistan , no formal judicial system is in place and only tribal and other customary forms of justice are practiced . And a scathing report issued last year by the International Crisis Group described Afghanistan 's judicial system as being "" in a catastrophic state of disrepair . "" A growing majority of Afghans have been forced to accept the rough justice of Taliban and criminal power brokers in areas of the country that lie beyond government control . "" The report went on to say that the United States has not paid the same attention to justice reform as it has to other aspects of nation building . "" Its investment in judicial institutions is modest , as opposed to the billions invested in standing up the Afghan army and police , "" the report said . The U.S. Agency for International Development allocated only 1 % of its Afghanistan budget between 2002 and 2007 -- $ 64 million -- to supporting the establishment of rule of law , the report said . Human rights monitors have pressed President Hamid Karzai 's government to prioritize the establishment of a professional judiciary . But Nawroz 's execution is more evidence that Afghanistan has a long way to go . There have been other cases that have sparked outrage . In 2006 , Abdul Rahman was arrested and threatened with death for converting to Christianity . Last year , the Taliban ordered the first public executions by stoning since their fall from power -- a young couple who had eloped died in horrific fashion . Jalaludin , who witnessed Nawroz 's execution , said Mustafa gathered local mullahs to reach a verdict according to sharia , or Islamic law .

""" The letter , published in German by Der Spiegel , was written on Friday in Moscow and provided to Der Spiegel through a "" locked channel , "" the news magazine said . It was published in German and has been translated by CNN . Snowden , 30 , has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified NSA documents , which revealed the existence of top - secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e - mails and telephone calls in the United States and monitor the cell phone and Internet activity of overseas residents . He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges . A recent report by Der Spiegel , citing documents provided by Snowden , alleged the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's cell phone . Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens . The allegations have prompted some European countries to call for investigations . It also has prompted congressional hearings in the United States , where some are calling for more transparency and more oversight of American spy programs . Opinion : Do n't underestimate risks of government spying ' Witch hunt ' The letter also accused governments of trying to squash debate about mass surveillance "" with a never before seen witch hunt "" that threatens journalists and criminalizes the publication of details about the programs . In the letter , Snowden purportedly writes that his actions were bringing about change . "" The debate they wanted to avoid is now taking place in countries around the world , "" the letter said .

"Michael suggested that Uber use its vast collection of consumer data to "" dig up dirt "" on Sarah Lacey , the founder of the Silicon Valley news site Pando . Over a dinner attended by leading technology pundits , Michael suggested that Uber could spend "" a million dollars "" to hire a crack team of researchers and journalists . This investigative team might , he said , snoop into the personal and family life of a critic like Lacey who has relentlessly exposed many of Uber 's creepiest features -- particularly what she calls the "" asshole "" misogyny of its CEO , Travis Kalanick . Earlier this week , Michael 's outrageous and perhaps even criminal idea was leaked by the Buzzfeed Editor - in - Chief Ben Smith , who attended the dinner . This , of course , has generated a massive storm of outrage amongst the technorati . Peter Thiel told CNN that Uber was the most "" ethically challenged "" company in Silicon Valley . While The Guardian 's Dominic Rushe rhetorically asked whether Uber is Silicon Valley 's "" worst company . "" All over social media , people said the same thing : Emil Michael was the ultimate creep ! The crowd had spoken . Michael 's reviews were universally abysmal . He should be yanked , dismissed , fired . But that 's exactly what has n't happened . In spite of the popular outrage over Michael 's behavior , Travis Kalanick wrote an unapologetic 12 part Twitter "" apology "" which rejected the idea of firing his most senior business executive . Uber investors have mostly remained conveniently silent with a few -- like the normally outspoken Jason Calacanis -- explicitly defending Kalanick and , by implication , Michael . In The Circle , his brilliant satire of technology companies like Uber , Dave Eggers coined the Orwellian phrase "" Sharing is caring "" to describe the hypocrisy enveloping Silicon Valley . But , of course , in the sharing economy of multi - billion dollar start - ups like Uber , sharing is only caring when it comes to dismissing lowly drivers or customers . Trust is only the convenient new currency of this economy when it suits Uber . Otherwise the "" new "" economy appears to be ominously old , with a rejection of transparency , democratization , openness , accountability and all the other buzzwords of the Internet revolution . We the people , however , may have the last laugh . The New York Times ' Farhad Manjoo wrote that Uber 's "" toughest challenge "" now is improving its dubious ethical behavior . While Dov Seidman , the CEO of LRN and a deep thinker about business ethics , notes that the principle challenge now of a successful startup like Uber is to scale its morality . "" In the past , technology entrepreneurs created and sold devices , "" Seidman says . "" Today , they create and sell platforms for human behavior , which in turn raises real questions about the social and moral implications of the behavior -- and their underlying values -- on their platforms and about the responsibility that they have for these behaviors . Tech entrepreneurs are obsessed about scaling their business models and products . But they should",2.7485077843211894,0.9318941990098478,0.43864500761372105,0.08527908653862998,0.7457522278030714,0.7469717030939849,0.15480427046263345,0.18683274021352314,0.09074733096085409,0.08362989323843416,0.11209964412811388,0.02491103202846975,0.09430604982206406,0.028469750889679714,0.0693950177935943,0.04804270462633452,0.017793594306049824,0.042704626334519574,0.005338078291814947,0.04092526690391459,True,203.0,0.8416370106761566,4.519572953736655,562.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011609158336020638,0.0,0.0,0.0017793594306049821,58.96374193548391,9.65582795698925,12.197803567765352,12.859354838709681,12.463290322580647,13.31105376344086,49.56774193548387,5.76,16.41840118696789,13502713.010621525,24026.179734202004,5.221505376344086,5.0,2.6664724174828622,18.6,15.0,10.647065323364933,1.5247311827956989,1.0,0.8650509232295642,465,272,0.5849462365591398,2540,25,16
"The warning said an "" ongoing risk of kidnapping "" exists , and the U.S. government is worried about possible terrorist attacks on Americans and Western facilities . However , there are no plans for a U.S. government - sponsored evacuation of American citizens at this time , the State Department said . "" U.S. government - facilitated evacuations occur only when no safe commercial alternatives exist , "" it said . The message from the British Foreign Office was similar . The security situation continues to deteriorate , it said , and "" we now judge that our Embassy staff and premises are at increased risk . "" It too asked British nationals to leave immediately . The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement to its citizens in Yemen . "" Given the recent political developments , and for security reasons , the Embassy invites you to temporarily leave Yemen , as soon as possible , via commercial flights at your convenience , "" the statement said . "" The Embassy will temporarily be closed as of Friday , February 13 , 2015 , until further notice . "" It was n't immediately clear how the embassy closures will affect the work of United States and its allies work in combating Isliamist groups in the country , but the Pentagon says the U.S. military remains active in Yemen . "" They are still capable of conducting counterterrorism operations in Yeman and frankly ... there 's some counterterrorism training that 's still ongoing ... with Yemeni security forces , "" said Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby . "" I 'd be less than honest if I said that there had n't been some adjustments already made because of the political uncertainty , "" he said . "" We 're just going to have to watch this closely going forward . "" Yemen 's government has been a key ally in the fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , the Yemen - based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at French magazine Charlie Hebdo . "" They are a very dangerous group , "" said Kirby . "" They do want to threaten Western interests , including U.S. interests and we do consider them a threat to the United States of America . We 're watching them very closely . "" Late last month , Meda Al Rowas , a senior analyst at IHS Country Risk , told CNN that unless Hadi is reinstated , the chances of the country avoiding armed conflict are slim . "" Our forecast is really civil war in Yemen because we have a lot of nonstate armed groups who are likely to compete over territory and have a lot of competing agendas , "" she said . The Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- have taken control of Sanaa and the northern provinces of Amran and Sadaa . But there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen , particularly in the south , where there 's a long - running secessionist movement , and in the oil - rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa . There are currently no talks with the Houthis , but there are discussions about whether to talk to them , U.S. officials said last month .",2.339921380137546,1.2511999014077733,0.37052732598785226,0.1824978820957615,0.531247088547658,0.7025647811018504,0.1445993031358885,0.15331010452961671,0.09581881533101046,0.08188153310104529,0.10801393728222997,0.01916376306620209,0.10975609756097561,0.02613240418118467,0.078397212543554,0.06445993031358885,0.01916376306620209,0.04878048780487805,0.003484320557491289,0.047038327526132406,True,231.0,0.8519163763066202,4.425087108013937,574.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012528107934468359,0.007709604882749759,0.0,0.006968641114982578,64.39320539419089,8.5542768227623,11.561104654884861,11.9479549496147,10.912806757557796,12.112282157676347,46.67486662714879,5.071428571428571,16.91607878217121,22210568.279006336,38694.36982405285,5.039419087136929,4.0,2.697105809108682,17.214285714285715,16.5,12.20467458118622,1.4771784232365146,1.0,0.8022905003820766,482,260,0.5394190871369294,2540,28,17
"And then you see people who are a little bit older than you saying , ' oh Pele , he plays like Pele .

Read this : Cameroon 's outspoken football star Like his namesake , the Ghanaian "" Pele "" displayed a nimble athleticism on the pitch , dazzling defenders with his spectacular technique and blistering pace . He signed his first contract in 1978 with Ghana 's Real Tamale United but it was n't long before he attracted the attention of foreign scouts , becoming a pioneer for African football at a time when few players from his continent enjoyed major international careers . He spent several years honing his talent abroad -- including spells in teams in Qatar and Benin -- before heading to France to play in the country 's second division . In 1987 , he made his move to France 's top league after being signed by Marseille . But his first spell at the club in the south of France proved to be a short one as Ayew grew frustrated with the racial abuse he suffered from his teammates .

"" So in 1990 he rejoined Marseille , where he enjoyed three golden years , culminating in the 1993 Champions League triumph over mighty Italian giants AC Milan .

The 42 - year - old then tried to poison Haynes some two dozen times over several months , secretly sprinkling small amounts of the chemicals on an apartment doorknob , car door handles , and a mailbox .

"Cuomo 's office did not respond Saturday to CNN 's requests for comment on the matter . Medical marijuana is hardly unprecedented in the United States . Twenty states and the District of Columbia now allow it in some form -- among them Colorado , where as of January 1 it 's legal to sell marijuana to those 21 or older -- according to info compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures . ( In addition , Maryland has a limited program for research . ) The momentum has picked up of late , with most of these efforts taking effect over the past decade . The states where there is medical marijuana include Connecticut , Vermont and New Jersey , each of which border New York . And yet the Empire State has not joined them . Versions of the Compassionate Care Act pushed by Gottfried have passed the state Assembly , only to stall in the Senate . Cuomo is acting without the legislature 's OK , though what he 's doing is legal , according to Gottfried , whose district includes much of Midtown Manhattan . He explained that the governor is acting on powers granted through a law passed in 1980 in setting the stage for a highly regulated system that 's less liberal than many other medical marijuana setups nationwide . Here 's how it would work , according to Gottfried : Under Cuomo 's directive , the state health department would take charge by setting up the guidelines and picking hospitals that would take part . These hospitals would then have panels of people who decide , on a person - by - person basis , which patients qualify for medical marijuana . It has yet to be determined where the medical marijuana -- or the elements of it that might be dispensed -- will come from , including who might produce it . Gottfried estimated that tens of thousands of people could get medical marijuana by virtue of this policy change , though he insisted it is no substitute for a more complete , far - reaching program . "" ( Cuomo ) can take ( this step ) without the need for further legislation , "" the Manhattan legislator said . "" But to have a truly comprehensive and well - working system will take legislation . "" Gabriel Sayegh -- the New York state director for the Drug Policy Alliance , which describes itself as a "" national advocacy leader of drug law reform "" -- agrees , saying that it too will push for broader medical marijuana laws in the state . He learned about this latest measure in a call Saturday from the governor 's office , saying the proposal originated there and describing it the same basic way as Gottfried .

""" Instead the senator will seek a second term in the Senate , where he thinks he can "" play the most constructive role . "" Bush is "" thinking "" Jeb Bush reiterated that he 's still considering a presidential run , revealing more details Monday about his decision - making process .

"" Son says Jeb Bush ' more than likely ' eyeing 2016 run With Bush considered a potential frontrunner , the rest of the GOP field is eagerly awaiting his decision . Those perhaps most interested include Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida , who was mentored by Bush , and other candidates who appeal to moderate Republicans , like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey . "" I do n't know if I 'd be a good candidate or a bad one , "" Bush said . "" I kind of know how a Republican can win . "" Ben Carson on the verge of becoming a political phenomenon A renowned neurosurgeon who 's become popular in conservative circles , Ben Carson is still climbing up the charts , according to a new CNN / ORC International Poll . Carson came in second place behind Mitt Romney in the survey , which measure support for potential 2016 contenders . Carson rose to political fame after publicly chiding the direction the country was going during his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 2013 . President Barack Obama was sitting just a few feet away . Since then , he 's been likened to a rockstar among conservatives , and he 's become the only African - American Republican expressing interest in a 2016 presidential run . His abhorrence for political correctness has also made him a favorite among radio talk shows . "" I try to talk about what I actually see that 's going on and this is what we need in America , "" he told CNN 's Mark Preston for a profile piece . "" We need people who are not afraid to express themselves and who are not afraid to debate issues .

Rand Paul has been saying for more than a year that he plans on running for a second term in the Senate , the Kentucky Republican made it official Tuesday . But he has a bumpy road ahead . Kentucky election law allows candidates to appear on a ballot only once at a time , making it difficult for Paul if he also runs for president â€ ” a decision he told the Lexington Herald - Leader that he 's about "" four to six months "" away from making . His allies in the state Senate tried to help him by passing a bill that tweaks the law , but the measure stalled in the Democratic - controlled state House . Still , Paul has other options , including a possible court challenge or convincing the state GOP to change its nominating system in 2016 from a primary to a caucus . That way , his name would n't appear on a ballot . Or , he could just not appear on the ballot at all and forego Kentucky 's delegates .",2.8122064585526525,1.2255573435913585,0.36614927696521626,0.14108431092440601,0.6551674392360908,0.6060765400528908,0.11846153846153847,0.13230769230769232,0.1,0.08461538461538462,0.11846153846153847,0.027692307692307693,0.12461538461538461,0.018461538461538463,0.05846153846153846,0.08307692307692308,0.02,0.05692307692307692,0.013846153846153847,0.04153846153846154,True,288.0,0.8661538461538462,4.090769230769231,650.0,0.0,0.03023888720895071,0.017538554581191412,0.017538554581191412,0.0,0.0,0.008164499546416692,0.0060477774417901425,0.0,0.0,66.59137518384811,9.06853991175291,11.429527900616531,12.32293087311138,10.43234590185854,9.726859205776172,41.63765209252574,4.333333333333333,18.662717931472415,127384156.29440619,195975.62506831723,4.586642599277979,4.0,2.5542281628006114,20.51851851851852,21.0,11.726419586716618,1.4115523465703972,1.0,0.7434018608277889,554,291,0.5252707581227437,2659,27,21
"Brown 's attorney , Shannon Jones , says that her client signed the waiver but did n't quite understand it . Soon after the girl was born , Brown -- a U.S. Army soldier -- headed off on a 1 - year deployment . It was then that the baby moved on as well , to the Charleston , South Carolina , home of Matt and Melanie Capobianco . It was an open adoption , family friend Jessica Munday said . That meant the girl 's birth mother could and did maintain a relationship with the girl . But Brown , the biological father , was n't on board . Four months after Veronica 's birth , he began legal proceedings seeking custody of her . "" My client has been fighting for custody of his daughter since shortly after her birth , "" Shannon Jones , Brown 's Charleston - based lawyer , said by e - mail . "" He loves this child with all his heart . "" Brown appeared to win that battle late last year . On New Year 's Eve , he arrived in South Carolina , picked up Veronica from her adoptive parents , and headed west to his home in Oklahoma . "" It 's awful , "" Matt Capobianco said days later to CNN affiliate WCIV . "" Everyone keeps saying how bad they feel for us . But , I mean , she 's a 2 - year - old girl that got shoved in a truck and driven to Oklahoma -- with strangers . "" Key to Brown 's case is a 1978 federal law called the Indian Child Welfare Act . Its aim is to "" promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and Indian families by the establishment of minimum federal standards to prevent the arbitrary removal of Indian children from their families and tribes and to ensure that measures which prevent the breakup of Indian families are followed in child custody proceedings . "" Brown is enrolled in the Cherokee Nation , a "" federally - recognized government "" of Indians that has "" inherent sovereign status , "" based near Tahlequah , Oklahoma . That means young Veronica has Indian blood , as well . Chrissi Ross Nimmo , assistant attorney general for the Cherokee Nation , says that the protections inherent in the Child Welfare Act are clear and important . Applied as she sees it , Brown -- as an Indian and the biological father of Veronica -- is entitled to custody of the girl . "" There 's a placement preference . If children are removed by the state or if they 're placed in private adoption , the first preference is for a family member , "" Nimmo told CNN affiliate KOTV . Others disagree . CNN legal analyst Avery Freedman , for one , said the law was misused in this case . "" It 's a wonderful law which seeks to protect the integrity of ... Native American families , "" she said . "" But it can not be used as a bludgeon to destroy existing families . "" Jones insists that Brown "" would still be entitled to custody of his daughter under South Carolina law . "" "" It is important to understand that the Indian Child Welfare Act was not used as a loophole in this action , "" the lawyer said . Whatever the legal arguments , the emotions are still raw . The Capobiancos have spoken to Veronica once since she left , on New Year 's Day . "" She said , ' Hi Mommy ! Hi Daddy ! She sounded really excited to hear us . And she said , ' I love you ! ' numerous times , "" Melanie Capobianco told WCIV . She added that her husband felt like he 'd failed as a father , sending her off with people she did n't know and not knowing what the little girl must think of them and the whole situation . Melanie Capobianco said she is worried about what 's next ,",2.4049941013829708,1.1284645371792286,0.4002107964750792,0.1500088252859204,0.5744759632592521,0.5415702195139602,0.16546762589928057,0.1539568345323741,0.08776978417266187,0.07050359712230216,0.11223021582733812,0.030215827338129497,0.11079136690647481,0.025899280575539568,0.058992805755395686,0.0776978417266187,0.02158273381294964,0.051798561151079135,0.007194244604316547,0.02158273381294964,True,273.0,0.8287769784172662,3.9913669064748203,695.0,0.0,0.016147635524798153,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01124567474048443,0.014705882352941176,0.0,0.0014388489208633094,73.12735468564651,6.383731570920187,10.451354775682146,10.263412980850703,7.159461955600744,9.326761565836296,36.51262497881715,3.0952380952380953,21.43026852565677,2027903881.1242187,2917847.3109700987,4.649466192170818,4.0,2.3531401144690096,13.380952380952381,11.0,10.394486590203622,1.4199288256227758,1.0,0.760334255434798,562,268,0.47686832740213525,2774,42,22
"For Bruce , giving brief history lessons to out - of - towners came easy , since growing up in the area gave him the chance to witness history firsthand . "" I was at the Lincoln Memorial with my family to hear firsthand Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his ' I Have a Dream ' speech , "" Bruce said over the loudspeaker as the bus drove past the newly dedicated memorial to the civil rights leader . Bruce became a tour guide for the company in the summer of 1972 -- when Tourmobile was in its third year of business-- but he left after four years to try his luck on Broadway . After a 33 - year absence , he returned in 2006 . Much remains the same , he said . "" Everyone in the world is still eager to see the sights that they have only seen up to now in paintings , books and magazines . "" According to the company 's website , Tourmobile , which started operations in 1969 . employs 300 seasonal workers and serves "" upwards of 2 million riders annually . "" The tour buses take visitors to many of the capital 's most famous sites , including the Lincoln Memorial , the Washington Monument and the National Mall . What 's next for the company is unclear . "" We are currently unable to provide any information regarding future tour services , "" a message on the company 's website said . Bruce blamed the company 's demise on the sagging economy and more competition in the area offering similar services . Starting Tuesday , wlth Tourmobile no longer running , there will be no bus tours for visitors at Arlington National Cemetery until a new contract is awarded through bidding that will be overseen by the National Park Service . The cemetery covers 624 acres and has 4 million visitors a year , many of whom may find walking the sprawling hallowed grounds too difficult . The park service hopes to have a new tour bus company in place before the end of the year . "" This is a bittersweet time for the ( National Park Service ) and Tourmobile , as they have faithfully served the needs of millions of visitors for over 42 years , "" said Steve Whitesell , regional director of the park service 's National Capital Region . "" Times change , and we are ready to enter a new era for visitors to access our national parks in greater Washington . "" Tourist Gretchen Neu , from Racine , Wisconsin , was visiting Washington for the first time and could not imagine touring the cemetery on foot . "" Absolutely not . I mean , you have to have some mode of transportation other than your own car , "" Neu said , sitting on the Tourmobile bus as it left the cemetery . Families with loved ones buried at Arlington National Cemetery and those with disabilities will still be able to drive their own cars on the property . Another thing that set Tourmobile apart from other tour operators was the type of buses it used -- more like trams that are common at theme parks . The red , white and blue Tourmobile trams that many Washingtonians have become used to seeing came from Universal Studios in California . "" They are truly relics of a whole other era , "" Bruce said just before making his final trip of the day . "" It seemed that that operation worked so well in California that they wanted to try it out here , and that 's how it was born . "" What was born over 40 years ago is coming to an end , but Bruce said he 's not ready for retirement and wants to keep showing off the place where he grew up . "" I greet the world every day , and it 's a privilege for me to show the world my hometown , "" he said .",2.517095783655696,1.19249574293287,0.3978345644064098,0.16749264653347992,0.6113466326069708,0.5807465850777025,0.12408759124087591,0.17226277372262774,0.10802919708029197,0.08905109489051095,0.08613138686131387,0.032116788321167884,0.11824817518248175,0.021897810218978103,0.061313868613138686,0.07007299270072993,0.01897810218978102,0.043795620437956206,0.01897810218978102,0.035036496350364967,True,303.0,0.8598540145985402,4.109489051094891,685.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011146041726207487,0.012003429551300371,0.0,0.01167883211678832,71.51488518316022,8.01258064516129,10.807276698888536,11.409513395297978,9.712213778020775,9.642915254237288,42.08310552214324,4.387096774193548,21.132446221672907,1505583280.2204292,2197931.7959422325,4.591525423728814,4.0,2.3780627449344474,19.032258064516128,21.0,11.624456618497838,1.3711864406779661,1.0,0.7103474555545018,590,303,0.5135593220338983,2815,31,23
"Investigations into this have targeted top clubs such as Napoli , and involved a raid on the Italy team headquarters ahead of Euro 2012 .

US and allied vehicles being destroyed in Iraq and Afghanistan by IEDs ( Improvised Explosive Devices ) ; video cameras slaved to the sights of Dragunov sniper rifles blasting the heads off GIs and then murdering those who came to their assistance ; suicide bombers driving explosive - laden trucks through fences and into buildings or crowds immediately followed by massive explosions .

"The gun was created with a Stratasys Dimension SST printer , which can be purchased online for as little as $ 8,000 . Wilson fired the gun Saturday and the video was posted to YouTube on Sunday . The group 's self - described "" Wiki Weapon Project "" is about a year old . Until now , the group had only reported being able to make plastic , interchangeable parts for firearms , but not entire weapons . The Liberator is comprised of 16 interchangeable pieces , with a nail for a firing pin . According to the group , the barrel can be changed out to fire different kinds of ammo . Not surprisingly , reports of the test - firing have reignited calls to ban 3 - D - printed guns , which critics fear could easily fall into the wrong hands and create safety concerns because they 'd be invisible to metal detectors . New York Sen. Charles Schumer is one of several politicians pushing for stricter legislation that would ban firearms created with 3 - D printers . "" Passing this law would not only prevent people from making these parts , it would raise awareness on the issue , "" Schumer said Sunday during a news conference . "" We 're facing a situation where anyone -- a felon , a terrorist -- can open a gun factory in their garage . "" Schumer is joined by U.S. congressman Steve Israel of New York , who has introduced legislation to renew a ban on plastic guns that is set to expire later this year . "" I do n't want to make it easier for criminals and terrorists to bring plastic guns through metal detectors and onto airplanes , "" he told CNN 's Jake Tapper on Monday . It 's an argument unlikely to sway Wilson , who has made no secret of his disdain for the U.S. government in particular and all governments in general . ( Defense Distributed makes and sells components with names like "" The Cuomo "" and "" The Pelosi , "" to tweak politicians who support gun control ) . "" For me , it 's important as a symbolic political statement , "" he told CNN Monday . "" And that statement is something like , ' No , the future we imagine is one of personalized manufacture and access to objects . It does n't matter what the decision is on the Hill ... in this future , people will be able to make guns for themselves . ' "" That was already true , but now it 's been demonstrated in yet another technology . "" Despite that worldview , Defense Distributed applied for , and in March received , a federal firearm license which makes it a legal gun manufacturer . Wilson acknowledged in a recent interview with Forbes that his creation could be used by criminals , but suggested that demonstrating the freedom to create them is more important than trying to stop that from happening . "" I recognize that this tool might be used to harm people . That 's what it is : It 's a gun , "" he said . "" But I do n't think that 's a reason to not put it out there . I think that liberty in the end is a better interest . "" Defense Distributed is based near Austin , Texas . Wilson has emerged as the face of the group , although many of its members , including the owners of the 3 - D printer the group uses , have chosen to remain anonymous . The group 's future plans include expanding the range of ammunition a 3 - D printed gun can fire and making the guns printable with less expensive printers , such as the $ 2,800 Replicator 2 by Makerbot .",2.784634402281965,1.0806833943788343,0.4012247306939711,0.13814842670903577,0.6776076249246087,0.6257709435842655,0.14329268292682926,0.1676829268292683,0.09298780487804878,0.08384146341463415,0.07317073170731707,0.038109756097560975,0.1173780487804878,0.022865853658536585,0.056402439024390245,0.06859756097560976,0.013719512195121951,0.07774390243902439,0.01524390243902439,0.024390243902439025,True,282.0,0.8414634146341463,4.079268292682927,656.0,0.0,0.009006304413089163,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009006304413089163,0.006004202942059442,0.0,0.0,69.70901459854016,8.230750062924741,10.778856453188784,11.354241127611377,9.90086710294488,9.951970802919707,41.889252454064945,4.344827586206897,20.083401844085046,527364144.4539997,803908.7567896337,4.645985401459854,4.0,2.64413728561668,18.896551724137932,20.0,9.473537836725852,1.3941605839416058,1.0,0.7082172976115138,548,288,0.5255474452554745,2676,29,26
"When Luke is a much older man , Vader does n't wear a helmet , Han Solo resembles a lizard and there is a character named Kane Starkiller , it might take some getting used to . But it 's a fascinating part of movie history , no doubt . CNN spoke separately to J.W. Rinzler , who adapted Lucas ' script for comics , and artist Mike Mayhew . CNN : What captured your interest when adapting this script ? Rinzler : It 's so similar and yet so different at the same time . All the puzzle pieces are there but arranged to form a different picture . You 've got Sith and Jedi , you 've got a desert planet . You 've got a planet with twin suns , an imperial city and a cloud city . When I read the rough draft , it had all those things which made me want to make it into a comic book . It 's such a great story , George is a great storyteller . CNN : Was it difficult to illustrate this story from a script written nearly 40 years ago ? Mayhew : Not at all . I 've been in comics 20 years , and when I read the rough draft , I thought , I can make a comic of this tomorrow . It was just a very well - written screenplay , and that 's what a comic book script is . This is genuinely George 's first complete screenplay story of this tale , and it 's wildly different . You can see why some of it was changed because there 's no way they could have done it . It was just too ambitious . When you look at movies now like "" Avatar "" and "" The Avengers , "" it seems prophetic . Audiences expect all that action and set pieces , and one thing after another . I 'm sure back then they looked at this and thought , "" What 's this guy thinking ? "" The other interesting thing is you see the origins of the characters we know and love . Darth Vader is kind of a general , he 's one of the main heavies but he 's not a lord of the Sith . Here , Vader is really three characters : General Vader , this Lord of the Sith named Valorum , and this mechanical man . You think you know these characters and then you discover their truer origins . CNN : What do you think fans will take away from this book ? Rinzler : Based on early fan feedback from the first issue , they 're really enjoying this alternate universe , and they 're getting to read a story that 's being told by George . Even through my adaptation , you feel his voice . You see many of the things you love in "" Star Wars "" but in a slightly different way . You have the Tusken raider moment surging in front of the binoculars , except it 's not a Tusken raider , it 's a different character . Fans are saying they 're reading it two or three times to take it all in . Mayhew : This to me is the",2.474613213329011,0.8524716465595575,0.42358170965538666,0.06914867880924863,0.5271425330729196,0.5063409181311727,0.13097345132743363,0.1433628318584071,0.05309734513274336,0.09734513274336283,0.06548672566371681,0.021238938053097345,0.10619469026548672,0.03716814159292035,0.0584070796460177,0.12212389380530973,0.01415929203539823,0.0831858407079646,0.012389380530973451,0.05486725663716814,True,282.0,0.8548672566371681,3.679646017699115,565.0,0.0,0.028051554207733132,0.01819560272934041,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013267626990144048,0.00796057619408643,0.0,0.0,86.57151583710409,4.6038763197586725,8.583994105835817,8.155455002513827,5.188058069381601,6.687777777777779,28.080945198592257,1.9705882352941178,18.153493488151103,76552970.81640953,135491.98374585758,4.19017094017094,4.0,2.1652237731637523,13.764705882352942,14.5,7.112783948759452,1.2564102564102564,1.0,0.6048782621582282,468,228,0.48717948717948717,2079,34,27
"Indeed , the game plays with the concept of time from its very beginning . An Edwardian barbershop quartet sings "" God Only Knows "" by the Beach Boys . A mechanical horse is advertised as "" Horse of the Future Today . "" The city itself feels like a floating World 's Fair , with new inventions , a carnival - like atmosphere and everyone speaking about how much better things will be tomorrow -- all based on the prophet 's guidance . The environments are colorful and vibrant , reflective of the game 's disparate moods of optimism and turmoil . The city feels like it has gravitas while remaining lofty in the clouds . There is even a beach and "" ocean , "" so I guess we get to see where rain really comes from . Steampunkish "" voxophones "" and "" kinetoscopes "" scattered throughout the city help provide aural and visual backstories for current events . They fill in the history blanks and give the player a better understanding of actions that take place . Of course , Elizabeth is key to the Prophet 's plan to bring judgment on the sinners below , so Booker 's time in Columbia is not going to be an easy one . Combat in "" Infinite "" is based very much on the principles from other "" BioShock "" games , with some slight tweaks . Instead of plasmids ( the power source in the first two games ) , so - called vigors are the source of Booker 's environmental powers . From throwing fireballs to directing flocks of ravens or firing lightning bolts , the vigors are permanent once acquired and powered by salts found throughout the city . Think of salts as ammunition for your vigor weapons . ' Bioshock ' creator talks history , writing and ' nerdity ' There are more traditional weapons as well . Pistols , shotguns , machine guns -- they 're all here . Both the guns and the vigors are upgradable through purchased additions at vending machines , so keep an eye out for coins wherever you find them . The nice addition for combat is making vigors and weapons dual - wieldable . You can mow down an opponent with bullets or rockets while tossing them in the air with a Bucking Bronco vigor . In previous games , this was an either / or venture , so it is nice to be able to mix and match your attacks to whatever you choose . However , the heart of the game is Elizabeth . She is your constant companion throughout the game , offering help in combat or pointing out items you might miss as you travel throughout Columbia . Her ability to create windows into other worlds can help bring in supplies or allies during battle as well . She is also a master thief who can pick locks quickly . Elizabeth is never in danger during combat and never takes damage . In that way , she is not one big escort mission but a true companion during your adventures . Getting Elizabeth just right was a massive undertaking for Irrational Games and Levine , who said the game 's release date was pushed back a year solely to perfect her . Their success lies in the empathy the player develops toward her as the game progresses . You feel and see her frustrations , her joys and her pain . Her tiny movements , such as bending over to closely examine a new item for the first time ( even one that has no bearing",2.645652624716284,0.46347230666961037,0.4741042140636408,0.06642703795766153,0.7501262076969805,0.7256407429065023,0.12561174551386622,0.22022838499184338,0.10603588907014681,0.08482871125611746,0.040783034257748776,0.02773246329526917,0.10277324632952692,0.040783034257748776,0.0636215334420881,0.06688417618270799,0.013050570962479609,0.04404567699836868,0.004893964110929853,0.057096247960848286,True,281.0,0.8727569331158238,4.213703099510604,613.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015023474178403756,0.0,0.0,0.01468189233278956,73.58282194813413,7.360051233396582,9.725611199111238,10.062719797596458,9.57166350411132,10.252523719165083,40.3370651486401,4.0,17.942170399910374,61970585.30768414,101093.940143041,4.717267552182163,4.0,2.417862396391598,17.566666666666666,17.0,6.706630218588833,1.364326375711575,1.0,0.6832911424272249,527,295,0.5597722960151803,2583,30,28
"Seeking asylum in the U.S. As the case goes through the courts , Wani , who is an American citizen , said he is asking U.S. officials to expedite the asylum process for his wife . If she 's released , their lives could be in grave danger in Sudan , he said . "" I am scared for all our lives -- me , my wife and my two children -- if we have to remain inside Sudan , even a day after her release . "" Wani said he is appealing his home state lawmakers , New Hamphire 's U.S. Sens . Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte . Committed to her religion The court convicted Ibrahim of apostasy on May 15 . At the time , she was eight months pregnant . She gave birth to a baby girl late last month at a Khartoum prison , where she 's detained with Martin , her 20 - month - old son . Despite languishing in prison with two infants , she 's holding firm to her beliefs , according to her husband . "" There is pressure on her from Muslim religious leaders that she should return to the faith , "" Wani told CNN in a TV exclusive . "" She said , ' How can I return when I never was a Muslim ? Yes , my father was a Muslim , but I was brought up by my mother . ' "" Wani said his wife is a practicing Christian , more so than him , and even had their son baptized . "" I know my wife . She 's committed , "" he said . "" They brought in sheikhs ( to the prison ) and she told them , ' I 'm pretty sure I 'm not going to change my mind . ' "" Wani said he is thrilled about his new daughter but hopes her birth does n't hasten his wife 's death sentence . In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women , Sudan waited until the mother had weaned her child before executing any sentence . Sharia law as practiced in Sudan prohibits carrying out the death sentence on a pregnant woman until two years after she gives birth . CNN sought comment from the Sudanese government and was directed to the justice ministry . A CNN request for an interview was denied , and the justice minister said they do n't comment on matters that are going through the courts . An attempt to contact Sudan 's foreign affairs minister was unsuccessful . Muslim relatives turned her in Ibrahim was arrested after Muslim relatives accused her of renouncing her religion . Their complaint alleged that she went missing for years , and her family was shocked to find out she married a Christian . Wani said he 'd never met the relatives who made the accusations .

""" But ( the source of the noise ) is just as likely to be a natural event . "" Low frequency signals can travel thousands of miles through water under favorable circumstances , at about 1 mile per second , Duncan said . But "" at the moment ( the sound ) appears to be inconsistent with other data about the aircraft position , "" he said . That 's because researchers at Curtin University believe the sound came from an area thousands of miles to the northwest of the current search area in the southern Indian Ocean . And even then , they have n't been able to pinpoint the source . Duncan says his team has calculated an "" uncertainty box "" for the signal 's origin . It 's area that stretches some 2,485 miles in length from southeast to northwest across the Indian Ocean , and spans some 124 to 186 miles in width at its widest point . The center of the long , narrow box is south of the tip of India , as shown in a map released Wednesday . The university on Wednesday released an audio clip captured by one of the listening devices , off of Perth . Duncan says his team has sped up the recording 10 times to make it audible to the human ear . It also shared charts of acoustic signal plots showing what various devices detected . Searching in the right place ? The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight continues to focus along an arc hundreds of kilometers long , the area where investigators believe the Boeing 777 ran out of fuel , about 1,000 miles off the coast of Western Australia . Martin Dolan , the chief commissioner with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau ( ATSB ) , the organization leading the search into MH370 at the request of Malaysia , says an international team of experts continues to review the analysis of Inmarsat satellite data and aircraft performance . In a television exclusive , Dolan told CNN 's "" Erin Burnett OutFront "" he remains confident the final resting place of MH370 is somewhere along that arc , the so - called "" partial handshake "" with the satellite : "" We 've seen all the data . We 've seen all the calculations . We are reviewing the calculations and are also developing our own model to cross check and verify that information , "" Dolan told Burnett . When asked last week about the underwater sound being analyzed by the team at Curtin University , along with Geoscience Australia , a government agency , Dolan was skeptical .

"Through the practice of "" sema , "" or listening , in a prayer - induced trance , the Dervishes aim to act as a bridge between God and humankind . The Dervishes turn as one arm reaches to the sky "" taking from God "" and the other "" gives life to the earth , "" Loras says . "" We receive from God and we return that light and gift to humanity , "" he explains . Every Sunday , a different Mevlevi order visits Istanbul and worships at the Galata Mevlevihanesi , a Dervish "" Tekke "" or lodge . When CNN visits the lodge , it is the turn of the Mevlana Culture and Arts Foundation from Turkey 's capital , Ankara . Two teenage Dervishes are conducting their debut sema ritual in public . The young semazens , aged 14 and 15 , wear white felt hats rather than the traditional brown . For them , it 's a coming of age moment , the beginning of a long life of spiritual modesty displayed through meditative dance . "" It takes about six months to learn how to whirl . There are some people that ca n't , "" the "" semazenbasi "" -- leader of the sema -- Sahin Naci Sair says . "" They really need to feel three things . Music , rhythm , and belief . "" In 2005 , UNESCO declared the sema ceremony a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity . But in Turkey the Mevlevis still face restrictions . The sema ritual exists in spite of controversial laws banning Sufism altogether . The Mevlevis ' religious association was used as justification to ban the order after the founding of the secular Turkish Republic . In 1925 , the founder of the Republic of Turkey , Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , prohibited all Sufi orders , under Law 677 of the constitution on maintaining order . In the 1950s , the government eased the ban , allowing the sema to be performed in public . But it is commonly assumed this move was to boost the tourism industry rather than a sign of religious tolerance and private worship by the order remains officially banned . The tourism industry is the main source of income for the Dervishes , with members of the public giving donations to watch them worship . Each December , there is a huge festival in Konya , where Celaladin Rumi founded the order in the 13th century . At the "" Seb - i - Arus , "" curious observers can watch Mevlevi associations performing the religious ceremony together . Tickets went on sale this month for the ceremony , which runs from December 7 - 17 every year . At the beginning of each sema ceremony , the disciples stand with their arms closed to their chest and feet pointed inward . Young and old Mevlevis do this out of respect and to signify humility , fighting their ego through a spiritual journey inside and outside of the Dervish lodge . Ilyas Noyan Ozatik , the head of the reed flute players accompanying the Ankara semazens in Istanbul , says the Mevlevis "" are on an inner journey of oneself to where God is . "" Music is a unifying force he says , bringing "" our frequencies together leading to a completion of souls . "" This passionate inner battle reflects their relationship with the outside world . When asked about the turmoil in the Middle East , Lora points to an old British saying : "" if you want a clean street , every shop owner must clean the front of their own shop . "" Mevlevis strive for universal peace , but believe that peace must begin in the hearts of individuals . As the Dervishes turn , mesmerized and apparently staring into blank space , their spirit takes control and leads them across the age - old prayer space . They glide effortlessly in circles , their white robes rising and falling , thinking all the while of their act as a bridge from God to earth .",2.59161075380516,0.8451112730667669,0.41994876078944954,0.1261342584008618,0.6939173985385534,0.6984535915544257,0.14714285714285713,0.19142857142857142,0.11571428571428571,0.12,0.09714285714285714,0.017142857142857144,0.10857142857142857,0.03142857142857143,0.054285714285714284,0.04285714285714286,0.014285714285714285,0.022857142857142857,0.015714285714285715,0.02,True,272.0,0.84,4.208571428571428,700.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014814814814814815,0.0,0.0,0.015714285714285715,70.69347774244835,7.724574721780606,10.590485417798838,10.883624801271859,9.807503974562799,10.628648648648653,41.22933227344992,4.147058823529412,23.21744262929669,12111758920.974895,17302512.74424985,4.783783783783784,4.0,2.483841131002818,17.41176470588235,17.0,7.863234056480172,1.400337837837838,1.0,0.7284284412169143,592,317,0.535472972972973,2946,34,31
"FULL COVERAGE : The Iraq War , 10 years on I headed the U.N. inspections in Iraq at the time of the war 10 years ago . Today , I look again at the reasons why this terrible mistake -- and violation of the U.N. charter -- took place and explore if any lessons be drawn . Here are my thoughts . After the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , George W. Bush 's administration felt a need to let the weight and wrath of the world 's only superpower fall on more evil actors than just Afghanistan 's Taliban regime . No target could have seemed more worthy of being crushed than Iraq 's brutal dictator , Saddam Hussein . Sadly , however , the elimination of this tyrant was perhaps the only positive result of the war . The war aimed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction , but there were n't any . The war aimed to eliminate al Qaeda in Iraq , but the terrorist group did n't exist in the country until after the invasion . The war aimed to make Iraq a model democracy based on law , but it replaced tyranny with anarchy and led America to practices that violated the laws of war . The war aimed to transform Iraq to a friendly base for U.S. troops capable to act , if needed , against Iran -- but instead it gave Iran a new ally in Baghdad . WATCH NOW : Iraq 's phantom WMD The Bush administration certainly wanted to go to war , and it advanced eradication of weapons of mass destruction as the main reason . As Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz has since explained , it was the only rationale that was acceptable to all parts of the U.S. administration . The WMDs argument also carried weight with the public and with the U.S. Congress . Indeed , in the autumn of 2002 the threat seemed credible . While I never believed Saddam could have concealed a continued nuclear program , I too thought there could still be some biological and chemical weapons left from Iraq 's war with Iran . If not , why had Iraq stopped U.N. inspections at many places around the country throughout the 1990s ? However , suspicions are one thing and reality is quite another . U.N. inspectors were asked to search for , report and destroy real weapons . As we found no weapons and no evidence supporting the suspicions , we reported this . But U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfield dismissed our reports with one of his wittier retorts : "" The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . "" Rumsfeld 's logic was correct , I believe , but it was no excuse for the American and British governments to mislead themselves and the world , as they did , by giving credit to fake evidence or assuming that if weapons items were "" unaccounted for "" that they must exist . They did not exist . We inspected many hundred of sites , including dozens that had been suggested to us by various governments ' national intelligence organizations . In a few cases we found conventional weapons -- but no weapons of mass destruction . The governments that launched the war claimed to be 100 % convinced that there were such weapons , but they had 0 % knowledge of where these weapons were . I am not suggesting that governments should ignore information coming from their billion dollar intelligence programs . Such information is indispensable and collected with many means that are not available to U.N. inspectors . However , I think one lesson from the Iraq war is that we should pay equal attention to the results of multimillion dollar international reports that are based on extensive professional inspections on the ground . In 2003 , the alliance of willing states did not do that . After the war it was reported that I and several others in New York had had our offices bugged during this period . If I was bugged , as I find very likely , I regret that those listening in did not pay more attention to what I had to say . FAREED ZAKARIA : 5 lessons of the Iraq War Fortunately , enough states did listen , and the U.N. Security Council was saved from green - lighting a",2.714363819495778,0.7600479392437313,0.42496683909648125,0.0973029637057184,0.7545167747884989,0.7537328716247312,0.10201342281879194,0.18523489932885906,0.10067114093959731,0.08456375838926175,0.07651006711409396,0.03758389261744966,0.10738255033557047,0.032214765100671144,0.07248322147651007,0.06711409395973154,0.02953020134228188,0.05771812080536913,0.01879194630872483,0.028187919463087248,True,350.0,0.8818791946308725,4.323489932885906,745.0,0.0,0.025220680958385876,0.02068095838587642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009079445145018916,0.009079445145018916,0.015132408575031526,0.0026845637583892616,65.71494396014944,9.03938563719386,11.389717465364857,12.164549605645497,10.87733084267331,10.618630136986297,44.71883215718832,4.9393939393939394,22.12560104766651,4064680778.81787,5455947.354117947,4.745814307458143,4.0,2.6340906920107092,19.90909090909091,20.0,9.592811817579511,1.4292237442922375,1.0,0.7812090151047654,657,322,0.4901065449010654,3221,33,32
"What we have now , after the initial panic when ISIS made its move into Iraq , are two distinct camps : Explorers suspending operations and producers battening down the hatches and producing as best they can . According to the Kurdish Regional Government , supplies up north are still above 300,000 barrels a day . Tucked into the IEA 's latest monthly report is one of today 's harsher realities : ISIS has taken control of seven fields , which typically produce about 80 thousand barrels a day . Energy and security sources here in the region tell me that oil is starting to find its way onto the black market , offered at a heavy discount . Beyond the fighting , other complex problems still exist that could easily tilt the balance in Iraq . In Baiji , near the country 's center , 300,000 barrels of refining capacity is off - line after ISIS rebels fought for control , according to the Iraq Energy Institute 's Luay al - Khatteeb . Oil is being exported via pipeline from the Kurdish region through the Port of Ceyhan in Turkey . Tankers have sailed , but Baghdad is blocking sales with an on - going dispute over who actually controls that oil . Despite all that , Iraq continues to supply the market with an ample level of crude . According to the IEA 's monthly report , overall production is 3.1 million barrels a day , down slightly from the month before . Exports are up again to 2.44 million and that is what the market is concentrating on . But there is a price to pay for the violence in the north and political in - fighting in Baghdad . The country 's original target of expanding capacity to over 4 million barrels a day will be missed , according to al- Khatteeb . With this level of uncertainty , the international oil companies ( IOCs ) may tighten their purse strings , waiting to see if the U.S. intervention can help stabilize the country before committing more money for exploration and production . The big bounty for Iraq and the energy majors remains the oil rich south around Basra which , despite initial security threats against international oil workers , is pumping and exporting crude at near record levels . BP initially trimmed staff when ISIS began its march into Iraq , but at the end of July , CEO Bob Dudley went out of his way to assure investors production is back up to normal with plans for expansion . "" The Rumaila field is now the second largest producing field in the world at about 1.4 million barrels per day , "" said Dudley . "" If you think about the map of Iraq , it is down in the bottom of the funnel , near the Kuwait border , in the desert , in an unpopulated area . "" Lukoil has put $ 4 billion into the West Qurna 2 field in the south -- one of the world 's largest oil fields -- and despite initial delays is still producing 300,000 barrels a day without interruption . What we have learned in the past two months of fighting , is another harsh reality : Money talks . Iraq may have difficulty staying glued together as a country or even passing a petroleum law to govern revenue sharing , but securing production and distribution have been paramount . And that persistence earned the country $ 53 billion last month alone .

"That was unusual back then when most professors graded on the bell curve and only a handful of the best students received an A. Some actually failed and most received grades of B or C. But in the case of this particular professor everybody got an A. As a test , I surreptitiously enrolled a fictitious student into the roster of his next class . This "" nobody "" never came to class , never wrote a term paper and never took an exam . At the end of the semester the mysterious student received an A. That led to a discussion with the professor . In a tone of righteous indignation he claimed I had overstepped my bounds to play such a trick on him . With righteous indignation I claimed that he had underperformed as a professor by acting in a reckless manner , grading his students with careless abandonment . Steam came out of both our ears . I believed his actions were a mark of failure in academic responsibility . Grades serve several purposes . They are a tool that measures a student 's progress in relation to others in a class ; they allow financial aid and scholarship committees to assess merit ; and they culminate in a 4 - year overall performance record in the form of a college transcript . Academic strengths and weaknesses are discovered over a period of time . To some extent Harvard 's faculty have abandoned their responsibilities to their students as well as to those who wish to judge their students : Admission officers at law and medical school ; faculty selecting graduates to mentor them for advanced degree programs ; employers deciding between applicants for jobs . Decades ago , professors were often characterized by their students on the severity of their grading . Professor Smith is a tough grader -- no one gets an A. Or , Professor Jones is an easy grader -- no one fails . What can be said today ? All the professors are easy marks as well as easy markers . Why give everyone an A ? When the admissions office puts together a freshman class full of high school valedictorians who have perfect grades and SAT scores , there is no doubt they are bringing capable students to the campus . But the power has shifted from the faculty to the students and a new form of entitlement on the part of students has developed . If students are paying $ 55,000 a year , they may feel they have paid for the As in dollars as well as sense . Is there an unspoken academic transaction that is filtering into the university landscape now that tuition prices are in the stratosphere ? Has higher education morphed into a consumer business in which the customer is always right ? It seems like it . First , universities have to compete for students in the marketplace . Then faculties do the same after students enroll . Professors want to be popular . They want good ratings from students at the end of semester reviews just",2.382698406420126,0.756191145280764,0.4719716275428945,0.07226503592375998,0.6681177967786789,0.6962374572952589,0.08206106870229007,0.26145038167938933,0.12404580152671756,0.1183206106870229,0.013358778625954198,0.015267175572519083,0.1049618320610687,0.02480916030534351,0.0648854961832061,0.08015267175572519,0.013358778625954198,0.04770992366412214,0.003816793893129771,0.04389312977099236,True,257.0,0.9122137404580153,4.423664122137405,524.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007039774727208729,0.010559662090813094,0.0,0.0,65.91595270595795,8.642181628392489,11.20814326018867,11.711610727477117,10.092582302874582,10.44659707724426,44.936646860446444,4.884615384615385,14.364096103870335,1730803.144065905,3303.0594352402763,4.736951983298539,4.0,2.8324307190975944,18.423076923076923,15.0,14.063518207713825,1.4446764091858038,1.0,0.7730911907625808,479,256,0.534446764091858,2318,26,35
"It was this marginalization that provided ISIS , which now calls itself the Islamic State , an opportunity to exploit the Sunni desire for fairer representation . But as much as ISIS claims to be championing Sunnis , it does not in any way represent Islam . The Quran clearly and categorically condemns forced conversion to Islam . It also accepts other religions and prophets as messengers of God , especially those of the other monotheistic religions : Judaism and Christianity . What ISIS is doing -- including its targeting of Christians and Yazidis -- therefore has nothing to do with practices through the ages , from the Levant to Andalusia . Indeed , Arab Christians have been an integral part of Arab history -- the presence of Christians in this part of the world is not an aberration , and Christianity is as part of the history of this region as Islam . Sadly , ISIS has tried to hijack Islam and is often wrongly labeled a Sunni organization . This is unfortunate as the vast majority of Sunnis are moderates who should not be tarred with the same brush as the extremist group . In fact , Sunnis have largely been the main victims of ISIS atrocities . In Syria , for example , ISIS has often trained its fire on the moderate Free Syrian Army rather than the forces of the al - Assad regime . In Iraq , meanwhile , ISIS has alienated those Sunni tribes that have rejected its extremist practices , while also fighting ( predominantly Sunni ) Kurdish forces . So how should the West and the countries of the Middle East respond to the growing threat that ISIS poses ? The reality is that force alone will not be enough to uproot ISIS and banish the threat it poses to this region and to the rest of the world . Instead , militias such as ISIS -- typically based on rigid and outdated ideological beliefs -- require a multipronged approach . Yes , military confrontation is an important tool , as is boosting economic and social development in areas affected . But the war on ISIS ca n't be won unless a key reason for its emergence is not tackled : tyranny and a lack of justice . Tyranny is another face of extremism , and it therefore makes no sense to treat it as if it is a viable alternative to radical agendas . With that in mind , it is high time that world leaders not just claim to cherish democracy , freedom , justice and respect of human rights while merely condemning the acts of dictators . Empty words will do nothing to change their behavior . Instead , the West must offer genuine support for moderate , civil opposition in Syria and Iraq . The United States ' increased engagement in the region , as signaled by President Barack Obama 's speech last Wednesday , is welcome . And the proposed military element -- including airstrikes -- may be successful in containing the threat ISIS poses . But to truly eliminate the risk of its resurgence ( or its replacement by some other extremist group ) , the West has to be more engaged in finding lasting solutions to fundamental problems in the region . What are these problems ? Israel 's occupation of Arab lands is one . Another is the vindictive government policies that have left large segments of the Iraqi population frustrated , a problem that could in part be resolved by guaranteeing a true power sharing arrangement .

"The Israeli government blamed Hamas , which denied responsibility but praised the abductions . Israel carried out arrests and demolished homes of the suspects in the West Bank , and launched airstrikes against targets in Gaza that are used to lob rockets into Israel . Palestinians stepped up rocket attacks and clashed with Israeli troops . Has the Middle East crisis reached a tipping point ? When was the Palestinian teen killed ? On Wednesday , according to his family , Mohammad Abu Khedair was headed to a mosque in his middle - class neighborhood of Shuafat , part of eastern Jerusalem , which is populated by Arabs . Three people in a car forced him inside , according to authorities and family members . He was reported missing and , about an hour later , his body was found in a forest in Jerusalem . Israel vowed a swift investigation and condemned the killing . Still , clashes erupted in the usually quiet Shuafat neighborhood . Residents threw rocks at security forces , and Israeli authorities responded with occasional volleys of stun grenades or tear gas . Some protesters also attacked two fellow Palestinians whom they mistook for undercover Israeli police . Israel announced over the weekend that several Jewish suspects had been arrested and that there was "" strong indication "" the killing may have been in revenge for the three Israeli teens ' deaths . The clashes are the worst the city has seen in a decade . Israel has condemned the killings of five teens . Who 's the fifth ? Israel announced over the weekend that a taxi driver had confessed to killing an Israeli Jewish teen in May . Shelly Dadon , 19 , was kidnapped , stabbed to death and left in an abandoned parking lot . The suspect 's motivation was believed to be Palestinian nationalism , Israeli police said . In the Knesset , Israel 's parliament , lawmakers unanimously condemned the deaths of all five young people , The Jerusalem Post reported . Who 's the beaten teen ? Tariq Abu Khdeir is from Florida . He was visiting his relatives in Jerusalem when his cousin , Mohammad Abu Khedair , was killed . Two videos posted online Thursday show Tariq Abu Khdeir beaten by men wearing the uniform of Israeli security forces . The videos do not show what led to the beating . There 's a dispute over what transpired . Ron Dermer , Israel 's ambassador to the United States , said Khdeir was among six masked people who threw petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails , and three of whom had knives . Still , that would not excuse "" any excessive use of force , "" he told "" Fox News Sunday . "" Khdeir says he was watching protesters and was "" attacked . "" A court has ordered him to house arrest for nine days at a relative 's home in a different neighborhood . His mother says the family plans to sue Israeli authorities . Physically , he 's "" doing a lot better , "" a family lawyer in Florida told CNN on Monday . Will this spark a ' third Intifada ' ? That 's a question being raised by some in the region as well as global media . The term refers to two previous armed uprisings by Palestinians against Israel . The first began in 1987 and ended in 1993 with the signing of the Oslo accords . The second lasted from 2000 to 2005 .

"The search began Wednesday afternoon and wrapped up at 3 a.m. Thursday at the couple 's New Jersey house , said Robert Gottlieb , who represents Rosemary Hernandez . He said his client "" does n't know what they were looking for . "" The satchels contained personal items including paperwork belonging to Rosemary Hernandez , he said . Gottlieb said his client was home during the search and cooperated fully . "" An assistant prosecutor called me before investigators entered the house and asked whether she was willing to be there to offer assistance , and she did . She was there in five , 10 minutes . "" Rosemary Hernandez feels that her husband 's confession is unreliable and is coming from a mentally ill man , Gottlieb said . The suspect , who is being held without bail at New York 's Bellevue Hospital , is receiving a medication called olanzapine , according to a source familiar with his medical history . The drug is used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia , according to the National Institutes of Health . Pedro Hernandez admitted choking the boy after luring him into the basement of a bodega , a small grocery store , on May 25 , 1979 , police said . Etan 's remains have not been found . His attorney previously told a judge that Hernandez has a history of mental disorders , suffers from hallucinations and is bipolar . "" Mrs. Hernandez has seen her husband 's delusions and hallucinations and other mental illnesses for a very long period of time , "" Gottlieb said . He would not elaborate on the mental disorders , nor would he provide an example of what his client observed . "" She does not believe the confession at all , "" Gottlieb said . Investigators have been trying to build a case against Hernandez , looking for evidence to back up his statements to them . Police have said they have no other evidence or a motive to support his confession . A relative has said she reported that Hernandez told family members in the 1980s that he killed a boy in New York . Norma Hernandez , the suspect 's sister , said she went to police in Camden , New Jersey , back then but felt that they did n't believe her . Police have said they have no record of that report . Hernandez said her brother also told a prayer group about killing a boy . Gottlieb said he was asked to represent the wife because of her growing frustration over the case and her desire to make sure prosecutors "" understand the severity and nature of the mental illnesses . "" A spokesman for the district attorney 's office had no comment Wednesday . Rosemary Hernandez has not seen her husband at Bellevue Hospital but has spoken to him by telephone .

"But the top players in the country at that time , 80 % of them did n't just come from the same town or the same suburb , but from the very same street . Olympic goal : A swimmer 's story "" There had n't been a genetic mutation -- we happened to have the best coach who gave us access to the only 24 - hour club . "" So we practiced before school , after school , at weekends , on holidays . Over many years , we transformed ourselves from perfectly ordinary players into world - class players . "" So does practice in itself make the world 's top athletes perfect ? Not necessarily , according to mental performance coach Andy Barton . "" Practice does n't make perfect , "" he says . "" You only have to think of your handwriting for instance , how as you get older the more you write the worse you get . "" Only perfect practice will make perfect . To improve you have to be very specific about what you are aiming to do and target it . "" It is a view supported by Syed , who suggests that the willingness of top athletes to push themselves further and further in practice pays dividends when it comes to high - pressure competition . "" It 's interesting , for example , that world - class ice dancers fall over more often in practice than intermediate ice dancers , which sounds paradoxical , "" he said . "" The reason is they are always pushing themselves , they are attempting jumps that are at the outer limits of their capabilities . It 's a branch of science called ' epigenetics ' -- the brain is re - wired as we practice . "" Once athletes have meticulously honed their skills , they should , in theory , have all the tools at their disposal to achieve success . But in high - pressure situations , even the greatest can crumble . What causes a footballer to crack under the nail - biting strain of a penalty shootout ? Or a tennis star to fall apart at match point ? "" The problem when you 're under pressure is you 're so nervous you start thinking consciously about the shot you are playing , "" Syed says . "" You are intruding upon your subconscious competence , and that is what triggers the choking response . "" So how can Olympians preparing for London 2012 ensure they are mentally ready to challenge for gold ? Barton suggested that imagining the crowning moment is almost as important as physically training for it . "" The thing about when we mentally rehearse something vividly , it actually fires up the same neurology in the brain as if we were really experiencing it . So on a certain level the mind can not differentiate between a vividly - imagined experience and reality .

""" We believe your order is causing us to violate our professional ethics . It 's morally repugnant to us as defense counsel , "" said Lt . Col . Kris Poppe , head of Hasan 's legal team . He asked for a stay on her order , which would prevent it from going into effect . The judge then asked for a written document from the state bar establishing that continuing to work with Hasan would be an ethical violation . "" I will make it easy for you . I 've given you an order ... and that relieves you of every ethical liability , "" Osborn said . Poppe would have nothing of it , his voice raised in obvious frustration . "" The order does not relieve us of the responsibility . ... We believe we are doing something that is morally repugnant . This is not about saving my license ... this is about what you are requiring me to do today : assist this man in achieving the goal , which we believe is achieving a death sentence . "" The lead prosecutor chimed in , questioning the defense team 's claims , saying that Hasan is mounting a legitimate defense . "" The government sees only two defenses : either ' I did n't do it , ' or ' I did it , with an excuse . ' He was caught with a gun in his hand , "" said Col . Michael Mulligan . "" I do n't understand how that 's repugnant to defense counsel -- I 'm truly perplexed . "" In a military capital trial , a guilty plea is not an option . Hasan 's official plea is that he is not guilty of the charges . But on Tuesday , Hasan used his opening statement to declare "" I am the shooter . "" After the standby counsel argued Wednesday that Hasan was seeking the death penalty , Hasan objected , calling it "" a twist of the facts . "" But he refused to submit his objection in writing , a move that Osborn requested to avoid revealing privileged information in open court . The defense attorneys Thursday immediately appealed Osborn 's ruling . But she gave no stay in the meantime . "" We 're going to move forward , "" the judge said , allowing the trial to continue unless a higher military court weighs in . The trial resumed with the prosecution calling to the stand soldiers who were witnesses of Hasan 's shooting spree . The attorneys ' request Wednesday halted what would have been the second day of testimony . Although Hasan , a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent , was granted his request to represent himself , Osborn ruled before the court - martial began that defense lawyers would act as standby counsel during the proceedings . Expert : Judge ca n't let attorneys stop Geoffrey Corn , a military justice expert at the South Texas College of Law in Houston , said the defense lawyers are in "" a terrible predicament . "" "" They have to stand by and watch the person they are ostensibly charged with assisting to represent himself essentially put a noose around his own neck , and they view this as fundamentally inconsistent with their ethical obligation as lawyers , "" he said . But Corn said Hasan not only has the right to defend himself , "" he has the right to do it poorly "" -- even to the point of asking for death . "" The defense lawyers would love to get off this case , because it becomes unbearable , "" Corn said . "" If you imagine having to sit there , being an ardent opponent of capital punishment , watching this guy seal his own fate with every move he makes , it must be torture .

"The prime ministers of Canada , Mauritius and India opted not to attend .

"" He also reiterated calls for an investigation into alleged human rights abuses during and after the war . Announcing Cameron 's northern visit this month , UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said four years after its war ended Sri Lanka is "" still a country where civil society is suppressed , where ( nongovernmental organizations ) and the media are routinely intimidated , where journalists and critics of the government have disappeared , and where no one has been held to account for alleged war crimes including rape and sexual violence . "" The north , Hague said , was "" where some of the worst fighting and suffering occurred , and thousands of people are still displaced from their homes . "" On Friday , Cameron tweeted : "" I 'm the first PM or president to go to the north of Sri Lanka since 1948 . I want to shine a light on chilling events there first hand .

A U.N. report in 2011 said the government used "" large - scale and widespread shelling "" that left a large number of civilians dead . The number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day , and U.N. figures greatly differ from those in reports from Sri Lanka 's government and various nongovernmental organizations .

"Romney had different ideas than the president about the war on terror , and he also had outspoken ideas on Russia , which he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN in March of 2012 was "" without question our number one geopolitical foe . "" His statement drew snickers in Washington and complaints in foreign policy circles that he was stuck in the Cold War . Archives : Hillary Clinton criticizes Romney 's remarks on Russia "" You do n't call Russia our No . 1 enemy -- not al Qaeda , Russia -- unless you 're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp , "" President Barack Obama said at the Democratic National Convention last September . The president probably still would n't call Russia this country 's top foe . But now that Russia has given NSA leaker Edward Snowden a year of asylum , and the two countries ca n't find accord on Syria or Iran , he might choose not to put the line in his convention speech . Snowden asylum could cancel planned Obama - Putin talks "" Now is the time to fundamentally rethink our relationship with Putin 's Russia , "" Sen. John McCain said upon hearing news of Snowden 's asylum . "" We need to deal with the Russia that is , not the Russia we might wish for . We can not allow today 's action by [ Russian President Vladimir Putin ] to stand without serious repercussions . "" "" Russia has stabbed us in the back , "" said Sen. Chuck Schumer , the New York Democrat . He called on Obama to protest by demanding the upcoming G-20 summit for world economic powers be moved away from Russia . Biden 's slogan , "" General Motors is alive ! "" drew a direct contrast between the candidates on the auto bailout that Obama engineered after initial action by President George W. Bush . Romney 's much - cited New York Times op - ed argued the car industry should be shepherded into a managed bankruptcy and not propped up with taxpayer dollars . The headline of Romney 's op - ed in November 2008 was "" Let Detroit Go Bankrupt . "" That headline followed him all the way to November of 2012 when he lost the election . Romney 's argument in the opinion piece was directed at the car industry , but it foreshadowed last month 's news that the Detroit the city , once the powerhouse of the American economy , was going bankrupt . "" [ W]e refused to throw in the towel and do nothing , "" Obama said in a video message in October of 2012 . "" We refused to let Detroit go bankrupt , I bet on American workers , and American ingenuity and three years later that bet is paying off in a big way .

""" It 's a cat signal because we see the cat as the symbol of the Internet , "" said Tiffiniy Cheng , co - director of the nonprofit Fight for the Future , which helped organize recent piracy legislation protests and is behind the new site . "" There 's this academic theory ... that talks about if you ban the ability of people to share cat photos , they 'll start protesting en masse . "" She added : "" The idea is we 're building the infrastructure to put up this cat signal or this bat signal all over the Internet at a moment 's notice , with the click of a button . "" The Internet went haywire in January when Congress was considering two pieces of legislation -- nicknamed SOPA and PIPA -- that aimed to help the government crack down on the online distribution of pirated content . The English - language version of Wikipedia shut down for 24 hours in protest of the proposed legislation , which died after the digitally based protests . Time Warner , the parent company of CNN , supported the legislation , along with several movie and music industry groups . The Internet Defense League says it is targeting two upcoming pieces of legislation , ACTA and CISPA , which take different approaches to regulating pirated content . The group also will seek promises from U.S. presidential candidates on the subject of Internet openness and legislation , according to Cheng . "" For the past 10 years at least , tech policy has not been based on what 's good for the public interest , "" she said . The group says it has the support of some big names on the Web , including WordPress , craigslist founder Craig Newmark , Reddit , the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Cheezburger Network , which owns several humor blogs . Cheng declined to comment on whether larger commercial websites like Google and Facebook would consider supporting the effort . Pundits have wondered whether this is the dawn of a new era for Internet activism , especially from tech and Web companies that , in the past , have been less political . "" This is the first real test of the political strength of the Web , and regardless of how things go , they are no longer a pushover , "" Tim Wu , from Columbia Law School , told the New York Times during the Web protests in January . "" The Web taking a stand against one of the most powerful lobbyers and seeming to get somewhere is definitely a first . "" The Internet Defense League aims to expand on that energy , alerting supporters to new threats to "" Internet freedom "" when they arise . A co - founder of the group , Reddit 's Alexis Ohanian , explained the idea to Forbes this way : "" You can only cry ' Oh my gosh , they 're going to shut down the Internet ' so often . We 've scared ( Congress ) from doing anything as egregious as SOPA and PIPA again . But the new challenge is this endless series of smaller bills that try to unravel Internet rights . "" On its site , the group pitches its battle against anti - Internet legislation as a sort of duel between all - knowing geeks and uneducated or "" confused "" public officials : "" Internet freedom and individual power are changing the course of history . But entrenched institutions and monopolies want this to stop . Elected leaders often do n't understand the Internet , so they 're easily confused or corrupted . "" It adds : "" With the combined reach of our websites and social networks , we can be massively more effective than any one organization . "" The Internet Defense League site lets people donate money to the cause and , perhaps more powerfully , rally people for or against certain pieces of legislation . When there 's an Internet "" emergency , "" the group says it will send out snippets of code that will help websites participate in the protests .

"It hosted the ATP tournament in the late ' 70s and ' 80s in the heyday of Madison Square Garden . Brazil , meanwhile , is an emerging market that in the next three years will host soccer 's World Cup , the Summer Olympics and a medium - sized tennis event in Rio . However , moving the event elsewhere would be a "" gamble , "" according to the former head of the ATP 's commercial division , while Roger Federer -- whose record six finals wins are spread across London , Houston and Shanghai -- would have no issue with a further continuation . Tournament director Andre Silva says staying in Britain past 2015 is "" definitely "" a possibility . Unlike soccer 's ruling body FIFA , which aims to take the World Cup to pastures new , the ATP 's goal is n't to be "" evangelistic "" about tennis -- and London , with its packed crowds , has been a boon financially for the men 's game . "" My personality is n't much for a change , "" Silva , a Brazilian , told CNN . "" This is a different animal to the World Cup in that it 's year to year , and you do want to expose fans around the world to this type of tennis . "" But the tournament is a very important part of the business of the ATP . More important than exposing everyone around the world to it is making sure it 's healthy and not an experiment . "" I know a lot of people talked about Rio and New York . It 's obviously great to be wanted . At the same time you need to be sure it makes sense -- and right now London makes a lot of sense . "" Federer , who lost to Novak Djokovic in last year 's final , shared Silva 's view . "" I must agree with Andre in many ways because I think it 's important that this event is played in a place that knows tennis , "" Federer told CNN . "" I think it 's good sometimes to play Shanghai , or maybe Lisbon or Sydney for a year , but I think it 's not long enough in one place to put its roots down . "" Lisbon welcomed the world 's top players in 2000 and Sydney did the same in 2001 in another one - year stint . "" It 's like a circus , "" said Federer , who will this week tie Ivan Lendl 's record of 12 successive appearances at the season - ending event . "" You come , the tent is there but it 's temporary and you move it away again . So here the roots are down , it 's successful and that 's why if the business makes sense , if the numbers make sense , if the excitement of everybody involved makes sense , I",2.6027226441111218,1.3633101054392243,0.38342439820431473,0.18537432644261206,0.5892266924069687,0.5709536685830071,0.13976377952755906,0.15551181102362205,0.08858267716535433,0.09448818897637795,0.09645669291338582,0.04133858267716536,0.09055118110236221,0.031496062992125984,0.05708661417322835,0.06692913385826772,0.01968503937007874,0.06496062992125984,0.015748031496062992,0.03740157480314961,True,236.0,0.8484251968503937,3.72244094488189,508.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012510425354462052,0.006255212677231026,0.01626355296080067,0.0,78.83021739130436,6.7357971014492755,9.971965246562196,10.388405797101449,7.706956521739134,7.6946859903381615,31.52657004830918,2.4347826086956523,17.276464020898246,31847327.28931549,62691.58915219584,4.27536231884058,4.0,2.246096289169866,18.0,18.0,11.821130674972787,1.2971014492753623,1.0,0.6378869891791831,414,218,0.5265700483091788,1891,23,46
"After the United States acquired Puerto Rico and other territories in 1898 after the Spanish - American War , the Supreme Court decided a series of deeply divided and controversial cases known as the Insular Cases . While none of these cases addressed constitutional issues relating to citizenship , Justice Henry Billings Brown wrote an opinion in Downes v. Bidwell that suggested , in passing , that citizenship was not a fundamental right in these newly acquired areas , which were populated by what he called "" alien races . "" Although his opinion was not joined by a single other justice , it was good enough for those in Congress who thought birthright citizenship was not such a great idea for the inhabitants of these areas , who did not look like or speak like them . The assumption that Congress controls citizenship in overseas territories has survived since , but not without disagreement in the lower courts . Leneuoti Tuaua , the Samoan Federation of America , and several others born in American Samoa are challenging this faulty assumption in a federal lawsuit pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit . They argue that so long as American Samoa is under the U.S. flag , with American Samoa 's sons and daughters fighting and dying to defend that flag , the U.S. Constitution guarantees them birthright citizenship , regardless of what Congress has said . What does the Constitution itself say ? The Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment -- part of the Constitution since 1868 -- states that "" All persons born ... in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States . "" The great Chief Justice John Marshall explained decades earlier that the Constitution used the phrase "" the United States "" as "" the name given to our great republic , which is composed of states and territories . "" It is no surprise then that those who drafted the Citizenship Clause understood its guarantees to extend to U.S. territories , explaining that "" the first section ( of the 14th Amendment ) refers to persons everywhere , whether in the states or in the territories or in the District of Columbia . "" Just four years after the Citizenship Clause was ratified , the Supreme Court stated that the clause "" put to rest "" the notion that "" those ... who had been born and resided always in the District of Columbia or in the territories , though within the United States , were not citizens . "" This original understanding makes sense . The 14th Amendment was intended to overturn the Supreme Court 's infamous Dred Scott decision and put the question of citizenship by birth on all U.S. soil beyond Congress ' power to deny . In 1868 , nearly half of all land in the United States was in a U.S. territory . An amendment that failed to guarantee citizenship in U.S. territories would not have been much of an amendment at all . Birthright citizenship remains a hotly debated topic . But there is a remarkable cross - ideological consensus among legal scholars about what exactly the Constitution guarantees when it comes to birthright citizenship .

""" "" Unfortunately we will feel its effects for years to come , as guns that were lost during this operation continue to show up at crime scenes both here and in Mexico , "" Holder said . "" We are losing the battle to stop the flow of illegal guns to Mexico . "" Holder defended his own actions , reminding the panel he called for the inspector general to examine the so - called Operation Fast and Furious and issued a directive that "" gun - alking "" was illegal and should never be repeated . The resulting report may be concluded before the end of the year . However , Holder stopped short of laying blame for the flawed operation . Last week , his assistant attorney general , Lanny Breuer , expressed "" regret "" for his failure to alert Holder about a similar earlier operation called "" Wide Receiver "" which had employed similar ATF "" gun - walking "" tactics during the Bush administration . At the hearing Tuesday , Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said , "" It does n't matter how many laws we pass if those responsible for enforcing them refuse to do their duty -- as was the case in Fast and Furious . "" Grassley pressed Holder at the hearing about who had leaked a sensitive document to the press regarding a whistle - blower who had come forward with allegations of gun - walking . Grassley asked who was being held accountable . Holder refused to answer , but several hours later Grassley said Justice had provided him a document in a classified setting . Grassley revealed that former U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke , who resigned from his post , had leaked the document to the press . Still , the senator said , he is not satisfied . "" The Justice Department should not be allowed to continue to scapegoating the one person who has resigned , "" Grassley said , promising to pursue the matter further . Despite the disagreements , Holder pressed for congressional cooperation . He made a plea to the committee for strengthening the authority of the ATF to detect and disrupt illegal gun trafficking , and urged full funding for the ATF to combat gun - running . He added : "" I am determined to ensure that our shared concerns about Operation Fast and Furious lead to more than headline - grabbing Washington ' gotcha ' games and cynical political point scoring , "" Holder concluded . Holder has the support of Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , chairman of the committee , who opened the hearing by reciting successes by the Justice Department under Holder 's leadership . On Monday , Leahy tried to lower the heat on Holder by raising it on the Bush administration for Operation Wide Receiver . In a letter to the Justice Department inspector general , the senator asked whether the current investigation also will cover the Bush - era supervision of the ATF in 2006 when , he said , "" hundreds of weapons apparently moved beyond the custody and control of",3.0375239775637457,0.8776373442820715,0.43159821636090606,0.044141477193825364,0.8028426137235429,0.8044713139533997,0.1431261770244821,0.16760828625235405,0.09792843691148775,0.08662900188323917,0.11487758945386065,0.035781544256120526,0.1393596986817326,0.022598870056497175,0.04896421845574388,0.054613935969868174,0.018832391713747645,0.04331450094161959,0.003766478342749529,0.022598870056497175,True,209.0,0.8531073446327684,4.4086629001883235,531.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00522466039707419,0.01671891327063741,0.0,0.0018832391713747645,52.6068258034467,11.831700046576618,13.936533991178674,15.53348858872846,13.993896134140662,12.329734513274335,52.99301350721937,6.947368421052632,15.83262054014439,7516570.490776821,14155.499982630548,4.995575221238938,4.0,2.6213854804782373,23.789473684210527,25.0,11.052882202672278,1.5376106194690264,1.0,0.8497274673310169,452,244,0.5398230088495575,2341,19,48
"Abbott won Monday 's ballot , with 61 out of 102 of his colleagues voting down the motion to remove him , while 39 voted to vacate his position , along with that of his deputy , the Foreign Minister Julie Bishop . The principle of cabinet solidarity meant the prime minister went in to the meeting with nearly 40 votes secured . Despite a significant block of lawmakers opposing their leader , the Liberal Party 's whip , Phillip Ruddock , a former immigration minister , said there was no debate and that "" the result is clear . "" The meeting originally scheduled for Tuesday was brought forward a day , to prevent the prime minister 's detractors caucusing in Canberra ahead of the first week of parliament this year . The move was a "" captain 's call "" quipped his nemesis , the immensely popular Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull who was being urged to show his hand and pledge to stand for the top job in the event the motion to vacate the position was successful . In the end , Turnbull skated close to declaring his candidacy but stopped short . He would now have been obliged to resign from the Cabinet had he done so . He may well have won the vote , but the fact 39 out of 102 members of the party have declared a lack of confidence in their prime minister leaves Abbott very exposed . In recent Australian political history , no leader who has faced such a challenge , itself a vote of no confidence , has gone on to survive the wrath of colleagues . All have eventually been overthrown . But for now Abbott has at least spared himself the indignity of becoming the shortest serving first term prime minister ousted by his own party . While lawmakers remain angry by his failure to sell the government 's first budget , which has stalled in the country 's upper house , Abbott has been accused of not consulting his colleagues on big decisions , among them a botched paid maternity leave scheme , widely seen as favoring the wealthy , and the bizarre knighting of Prince Philip . He seemed to consolidate this view of him as a non - collegiate player by calling Monday 's vote a day earlier than anticipated and without apparent consultation , even with his deputy whose job would also have been vacated had the no - confidence vote succeeded . Australians have looked on at the shenanigans in their capital with a mixture of delight and dismay . Those who dislike the government were divided by a desire to see the end of Abbott 's government and the fear that replacing him with Turnbull would spell disaster for the Australian Labor Party 's chances at the next election . Others raised concerns about tossing out leaders when unpopular decisions are taken . News Corp political commentator Paul Kelly noted that the apparently new political culture of tossing out leaders who make unpopular decisions was damaging the ability of government to govern . "" The politicians will try to deny it -- but our system is moving inexorably into a ' death of reform ' straitjacket , "" he wrote . The 2016 election is likely to be dominated by political advice to Liberal and Labor not to provoke the voters . This will put Australia on a long - run trajectory of decline and growing unhappiness . There is broad agreement that frequent leadership changes are not good for Australia . But that is no guarantee that Abbott can and will survive to battle the next election . Indeed , Monday 's vote suggests strongly he wo n't .",2.981296366619201,0.6580955656335093,0.4671062432723176,0.0648213591832929,0.8146825270219282,0.8099857341675532,0.09062003179650238,0.1875993640699523,0.10969793322734499,0.10174880763116058,0.06041335453100159,0.046104928457869634,0.12559618441971382,0.022257551669316374,0.06836248012718601,0.06200317965023847,0.01589825119236884,0.06518282988871224,0.011128775834658187,0.033386327503974564,True,293.0,0.8966613672496025,4.462639109697934,629.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016302765647743814,0.0,0.0,0.0,60.2073136645963,10.910295031055902,12.583877053449477,14.23913043478261,13.66310947204969,11.596785714285716,50.95496894409938,6.478260869565218,18.077277379540966,70935202.64830141,112774.5670084283,4.866071428571429,4.0,2.5617221318113805,24.347826086956523,21.0,12.39077039276719,1.4410714285714286,1.0,0.7536285523372632,560,298,0.5321428571428571,2807,23,49
"Ottawa 's Communications Security Establishment Canada , or CSEC , did not comment to the CBC , according to that news outlet . When similar reports have surfaced in the past . U.S. government officials have pointed to the Obama - ordered review of America 's intelligence gathering -- which gained steam after reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been spied on -- but refused to comment on specific claims . But they also have not backed away from the idea that the U.S. spies , just like other nations do . "" As we have made clear , ... the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations , "" said NSA spokeswoman Caitlin Haden in October , when the Merkel reports stirred tensions between traditional allies in Germany and the United States . The new CBC reporting does not specify which world leaders , if any , were targeted during the G8 and G20 summits , or what specific information may have been obtained . Nor does the Canadian news outlet 's account of the NSA documents spell out what role , if any , the CSEC had in it . If that Canadian agency had been complicit in snooping on anyone -- be they Canadians or foreign nationals -- without a warrant , it could violate that North American nation 's laws , the CBC reports . G8 summits are meetings of world leaders from the Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Japan , Russia , the European Union and the United States . G20 summits incorporate a larger group , traditionally taking place once or twice each year . During these meetings , leaders traditionally discuss a wide range of important and sometimes hot - button issues . At the end of 2010 's G8 summit in Toronto , for example , the group issued a final statement focusing on recovery from a global economic crisis while also criticizing Iran and North Korea . The fact that Snowden is linked to the CBC 's report is n't a big surprise . The now 30 - year - old worked as an information technology contractor for the U.S. government . He collected information on his native country 's spy programs , then exposed them to media outlets such as the Guardian and the Washington Post . Some of the reported leaks -- like that the National Security Agency mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States -- put the Obama administration on the defensive , trying to justify its spying programs while assuring Americans of their privacy . Others , like the claims that Merkel was spied on for years , forced Washington to do damage control with leaders of countries overseas . U.S. authorities have charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property .

"Words flying from person to person , nonstop , on the go . As , meanwhile , on those same sidewalks , the men and women with the satchels weave their way through the people with the screens , on their appointed rounds to deliver words by hand . The visitor from space , or from a future century , might think this scene -- mailbag luggers walking amid screen tappers -- is like witnessing ox carts amid hovercraft . As might an efficiency expert , or a business consultant . Which summarizes the continuing headache faced by officials in charge of the United States Postal Service . The price of a first - class stamp is going up again in the new year : On January 26 , it will increase by three cents , to 49 cents per letter . Federal regulators last week approved the rise on an allegedly temporary basis -- the higher rate is supposed to last for no more than two years -- but no one really expects it to go back down . The Postal Service reports that it lost $ 5 billion in the last fiscal year -- and this is being presented as good news . The year before , it lost almost $ 16 billion . But there are fewer and fewer envelopes in those satchels , so each stamp will come with a higher price tag ; the billions of dollars the Postal Service is required to pay each year to pre - fund health care for future retirees is a burden heavier than anything that would fit into a mail sack . Yet there are reasons to hope that the Postal Service finds a way to stay around for a very long time . The Postal Service , like UPS , FedEx and other private delivery companies , is a stand - alone business . It is expected to sustain itself ; it does not depend on tax money . But , unlike UPS and FedEx , the Postal Service must go to Congress to get explicit approval for the rates it charges , and for many of the rules under which it operates . This is why it costs the same amount to send a letter across the country as it does to send a letter to the next town . This is why mail service is universal -- why those carriers are required to show up each day at virtually every address in the United States . Forty - nine cents may seem like a lot to mail a first - class letter . But if the Postal Service were to collapse under financial pressures and competition from digital means of communication -- if the Postal Service had to throw in the towel -- do you really think that UPS or FedEx or some other courier service would take your envelope across the country for 49 cents ? Over the Christmas holiday , the failures by UPS and FedEx to get packages to some customers on time were prominent in the news . As efficient as UPS and FedEx usually are , the existence and ubiquity of the Postal Service has a lot to do with what keeps them on their toes . Their business model is : We cost more than the Postal Service , but because of that you can count on us to be reliable and accountable to you . If the Postal Service were to go away -- if that",2.961670002707881,0.7319830912663905,0.4368197863280942,0.06368042556928578,0.7756076753139496,0.7531469294003078,0.10204081632653061,0.18877551020408162,0.11904761904761904,0.10884353741496598,0.0663265306122449,0.03231292517006803,0.09693877551020408,0.03741496598639456,0.06292517006802721,0.05952380952380952,0.023809523809523808,0.05272108843537415,0.01870748299319728,0.027210884353741496,True,294.0,0.8843537414965986,4.01530612244898,588.0,0.0,0.017639077340569877,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05223880597014925,0.048846675712347354,0.0,0.0,71.04581305172842,9.042102136787395,10.848893137575418,12.35307317878063,10.502062536094385,8.46998102466793,41.508868905205844,4.260869565217392,17.365572143146935,34815461.5381387,59209.968602276705,4.347248576850095,4.0,2.210657947015528,22.91304347826087,23.0,11.864866086854045,1.3301707779886147,1.0,0.6439770356525005,527,256,0.4857685009487666,2361,23,51
"In 2006 , the number was 1 in 110 , and the newest data -- from 2008 -- suggests 1 in 88 children have autism . Read the CDC report ( PDF ) Boys with autism continue to outnumber girls 5 - to-1 , according to the CDC report . It estimates that 1 in 54 boys in the United States have autism . Mark Roithmayr , president of the advocacy group Autism Speaks , says more children are being diagnosed with autism because of "" better diagnosis , broader diagnosis , better awareness , and roughly 50 % of ' We do n't know . ' "" He said the numbers show there is an epidemic of autism in the United States . Early recognition of signs of autism -- a neurodevelopment disorder that leads to impaired language , communication and social skills -- is vital because it can lead to early intervention , says Dr. Gary Goldstein , an autism specialist and president of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore . "" There have been studies -- double - blinded studies -- to show that behavioral early intervention changes the outcome for children , "" Goldstein says . Roy Sanders and Charlie Bailey sensed something was wrong with their son Frankie Sanders when he was 9 months old . "" Our pediatrician at the time who was a friend of ours tried to tell us that we were being too cautious , we were being too anxious , "" Sanders says . Frankie 's pediatrician thought his parents were seeing developmental delays that were n't really there . But Frankie was n't talking , Sanders says . "" He did n't have speech ; he did n't have any communication skills at all . He did n't point . He would flap quite a bit . He would stare at fans ; he would stare at lights ; he would become frantic if he did n't have a Thomas the [ Tank ] Engine because he was obsessed with Thomas the [ Tank ] Engine . "" His parents kept pushing , and Frankie , now a ninth - grade nose guard and defensive guard for the Decatur Bulldogs football team in Decatur , Georgia , was diagnosed with autism when he was 15 months old . iReport : Have a child with autism ? Sign up to participate in a project with CNN . "" Early detection is associated with better outcomes , "" says CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden . "" The earlier kids are detected , the earlier they could get services , and the less impairment they 'll have on their learning and in their lives on a long - term basis is our best understanding . "" The CDC is working with the Academy of American Pediatrics to recommend that children get screened for autism at ages 18 months and 24 months , Frieden says . CDC : What you should know about autism However , according to the CDC report , most children were diagnosed between ages 4 and 5 , when a child 's brain is already more developed and harder to change . "" Doctors are getting better at diagnosing autism ; communities are getting much better at [ providing ] services to children with autism , and CDC scientists are getting much better at tracking which kids in the communities we 're studying have autism , "" Frieden says . "" How much of that increase is a result of better tracking and how much of it is a result of an actual increase , we still do n't know . We know more about autism today than we have ever known , "" he says , "" but there is still so much we do n't know and wish that we knew .

""" It 's an outpouring of creative talent , "" exclaimed Douglas Young , a Hong Kong - based designer and entrepreneur , during a recent visit to the protest encampment . "" Why have n't we seen this before ? "" asked Young , who also took care to point out that he was not an active supporter of the protest movement . Umbrella inspiration The sit - in has acted as a magnet attracting artists eager to make their voices heard . The artist known as Milk told CNN his statue was inspired by the image of a protester holding an umbrella to shield a police officer from the rain . Most of the other images displayed here also riff on the umbrella and the yellow ribbon , two symbols of the protest movement . Last month , protesters used umbrellas -- an accessory Hong Kongers carry to protect themselves from torrential downpours as well as tropical sun -- to shield themselves from pepper spray fired by police . Less than 48 hours into the occupation , demonstrators erected a globe - shaped monument out of umbrellas above the traffic circle next to the Legislative Council building . Since then , the streets and sidewalks have been plastered with cartoon - like characters holdings umbrellas , accompanied by slogans calling for democracy , freedom and justice . One of the posters shows a helmeted police officer with riot shield yelling "" You 're such a thug ! "" while pointing his finger at an umbrella - toting cartoon that resembles the children 's book character Paddington Bear . The artist who drew the cartoon is a 30 - year - old graphic designer Carol Hung . "" My initial idea was to make people laugh in this heavy atmosphere , "" Hung told CNN . Hung , who described herself as a political neophyte , said she was inspired to produce a series of protest - inspired drawings after seeing reports of police clashing with protesters on September 28th . "" At the moment I saw the tear gas , it made me want to support the students , "" Hung said . Art as ' silent protest ' On a recent afternoon , art teacher Josephine Lau sat in the middle of the highway now occupied by students , painting yellow ribbons onto Chinese paper . She hoped her posters would prove more durable than previous slogans she had made , which were washed away by rainstorms last week . "" We can use different media to express ourselves ... to tell people what we feel about Hong Kong , "" Lau said . "" I like the peaceful and silent protest and I 'm supporting the students behind the scenes . "" Not far away , 17 - year - old Timothy Sun was designing his own posters on the asphalt with the slogan "" GOV YU NO LISTEN TO US ? "" "" I want to use my way to show my voice to the public , "" the teenager said . Post - it politics Like many others here , Sun said his favorite piece of art at the protest site was actually a colorful piece of work created by thousands of contributors named the "" Lennon Wall . "" Thousands of pastel post - it notes bearing messages and drawings written by passersby in many languages coat the curved staircase",2.5675697376008095,0.909865132777782,0.4253303759429306,0.13970537137504993,0.6004228247329593,0.5979429561158885,0.14013840830449828,0.23183391003460208,0.10553633217993079,0.09169550173010381,0.058823529411764705,0.02768166089965398,0.1314878892733564,0.012110726643598616,0.06228373702422145,0.06401384083044982,0.006920415224913495,0.0328719723183391,0.00865051903114187,0.02422145328719723,True,224.0,0.8529411764705882,4.228373702422146,578.0,0.0,0.016556291390728478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00695364238410596,0.0,0.0,0.0,70.10492195121952,8.370159349593497,9.984395529734659,10.798829268292684,10.887804878048776,10.75739837398374,46.3060162601626,5.24,15.573790041227578,5802445.596577009,10038.833212070951,4.772357723577236,4.0,2.483483680056507,19.68,20.0,8.57307412775604,1.3800813008130082,1.0,0.6563089644403861,492,288,0.5853658536585366,2444,25,53
"Is this latest round of provocations under his son and successor , Kim Jong Un , simply more of what we 've seen before ? Not necessarily , argue some of those closely familiar with North Korea . They warn that under Kim Jong Un 's rule , Pyongyang has shown an even greater willingness to raise the stakes , whether it be the multiple missile launches over the past several weeks , the way it stoked a crisis last spring when it announced it had ended the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement and moved intermediate missiles to its east coast , or its warning that foreign companies and tourists in South Korea should evacuate . South Korea investigates two suspected North Korea drones More recently , in the U.S. intelligence community 's annual worldwide threat assessment , Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned that North Korea had "" expand(ed ) the size of its Yongbyon enrichment facility and restart(ed ) the reactor that was previously used for plutonium production "" but was shut down in 2007 . "" The regime still acts in a very belligerent manner , but it seems less predictable , and more random , "" said Christian Whiton , deputy envoy to North Korea during the George W. Bush administration . Timeline : North Korea nuclear program The younger Kim ( and young is the right word -- he is still only 31 ) took office in December 2011 , amid questions over how much control he really has over the levers of power , including the country 's military of more than 1 million people . Since then , North Korea has faced additional international sanctions after the launch of a long - range rocket in December 2012 , a move that it followed up with the country 's third nuclear test , in February 2013 . "" The timing and the intensity of North Korea 's provocations ( since Kim Jong Un took office ) clearly demonstrates a high tolerance for risk , "" said Ellen Kim , assistant director of the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . "" Since ( Kim ) took power he has purged almost all of his elder guardians ... and filled his surroundings with new faces . We are in a situation where we are learning about him a little bit every day through his unpredictable behavior and actions , which is why the current situation with North Korea is a lot more dangerous than before , "" she said . But James Person , coordinator of the North Korea International Documentation Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center , suggested this week 's exchange of live fire is not , on its own , too troubling . "" North Korea actually warned South Korea in advance that they were going to carry out live - fire drills in seven locations . They advised the South to remove ships from the area . All of the shells fell in the water . No land or military installations were targeted , "" Person said . "" This is comparatively a very mild provocation .

"A prime example of such skirmishes came last week . Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren objected to a GOP provision -- attached to a broad spending bill -- that rolled back a key portion of the Wall Street reform law . Her opposition prompted dozens of Democrats to defect and triggered a last - minute scramble for support ; President Barack Obama himself made calls to win lawmakers back and stave off a potential government shutdown . The spending bill eventually passed the Senate on Saturday night and on Sunday , Democratic leaders downplayed a possible rift within the party . But the nearly 2,000 progressive activists and operatives who descended on Washington over the weekend for the annual Rootscamp gathering felt otherwise . Panels addressed things like # HillaryProblems and the lack of understanding between the grassroots and establishment wings of the Democratic Party . And panelists and attendees alike endorsed the newly antagonistic moves from their elected officials this week . "" How do we make change in general , as we 're seeing from the streets of DC to Ferguson to New York ? I do think that sometimes you have to shut it down , "" said Alana Krivo - Kaufman , a 27 - year - old Rootscamp attendee and an organizer with Jewish Voice for Peace . And with Republicans taking control of the Senate next month , the imperative for progressives to hold their ground on key issues could grow ever more urgent . Jim Manley , a Democratic strategist and former Senate leadership aide , said Republicans have given every indication they 'll attempt to use a series of upcoming deadlines , including the need to raise the debt ceiling next year , to peel back Democratic policies passed under Obama . "" What we saw just now is just a taste of what 's to come for two years , "" he said . Obama 's standing within the party diminished And Democrats no longer feel beholden to their de facto leader — the President — as he enters the final , lame - duck years of his presidency . Some now openly admit he 's going to have to navigate a difficult terrain within his own party in the new Congress . Jeremy Bird , the former national field director for Obama 's re - election campaign , told CNN the left is still adjusting to the new political landscape . "" Everybody 's sort of figuring it out , post - midterms , how it 's all going to shake out , "" he said of Obama 's leadership role among Democrats . "" I 'm sure there 'll be other disagreements . And it 's a different world with a Republican Senate and a Republican House . "" Many progressives are frustrated with what they believe has been too much waffling from the President and other Democratic leaders on the issues that matter most to the base -- behavior they argue contributed to their losses in the midterms .

"Media outlets , including CNN , have been allowed to record and air occasional high - profile appeals in the 9th Circuit and the New York - based 2nd Circuit in recent years . Most other federal courts , including the U.S. Supreme Court , have banned photographs and video . "" The 9th Circuit has a long history of using advances in technology to make the court more accessible and transparent , "" said Chief Judge Alex Kozinski . "" Video streaming is a way to open the court 's doors even wider so that more people can see and hear what transpires in the courtroom , particularly in regard to some of our most important cases . "" Under the new rules , all "" en banc "" oral arguments -- involving 11 judges sitting together in a courtroom at the 9th Circuit -- will be covered live through the court 's website . Most such federal appeals are first heard by three - judge panels , and those hearings will not automatically be streamed live . The losing party at the three - judge stage can ask the court for wider en banc review , and typically involve matters of "" exceptional importance . "" The court estimates about 20 en banc cases each year will be streamed live . Previous 9th Circuit cases that were televised by the media involved California 's same - sex marriage ban , electronic surveillance by the government , affirmative action and international terrorism . The largest and busiest appeals court All of circuit 's 11 courtrooms are equipped with video cameras , and broadcast and cable news outlets have been allowed to access the feeds . About 378 media requests for photographic and video coverage have been granted in the past two decades , said officials . Among the 13 federal judicial circuits nationwide , the 9th is the largest and busiest , comprising of cases originating in Alaska , Washington , Oregon , California , Idaho , Montana , Nevada , Arizona and Hawaii , along with Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands . Most appeals are heard at the James R. Browning Courthouse in San Francisco . Panels also convene occasionally in Pasadena , California ; Portland , Oregon ; and Seattle . Many at the 9th Circuit credit Browning for being a nationwide pioneer in bringing technology to improve public access in the courtroom and increase internal efficiency when managing a court 's docket . "" The major innovations in court administration over the past 30 to 40 years , you 'll find most of them started through the creative mind of Judge Browning , "" said Judge Sidney Thomas , a longtime colleague who was a 2010 finalist for a Supreme Court seat . "" We had e - mail in the 9th circuit 20 years before anybody heard of the term , and this from a judge who has never been able to operate a computer . "" Browning served on the circuit from 1961 until his death last year . He was chief judge from 1976 to 1988 . The Judicial Conference , the third branch 's policymaking board , allowed federal courts of appeals in 1996 wide discretion to decide for themselves whether to allow cameras in its courtrooms . Three years ago , a pilot program was extended to federal district , or trial , courts . Fourteen such courts nationwide are participating , and nearly 150 civil proceedings are available to be viewed online . At almost 18,000 , the case with the highest viewership involved a 2012 civil trial where several citizens alleged government surveillance of their phone and computer activity . Most federal courtrooms remain accessible for the public to watch in person , but seating can be limited . Baby steps at the U.S. Supreme Court As for the highest court in the land , still no cameras , but incremental steps over the years to greater public access . Audio of that week 's arguments are now posted Fridays on the Supreme Court 's website . It may be the easiest to sample the flavor of public session : only about 330 courtroom seats are available to the public and only on a first - come , first - seated basis . A little - known fact about the high court is that it has been taping its arguments since 1955 , initially in secret . Until three years ago , the audio from one term was not available",2.7258357207354518,1.0901955407026742,0.3956409226686352,0.13871600903922157,0.6654931559197365,0.7369860268275564,0.12598425196850394,0.2020997375328084,0.09580052493438321,0.08661417322834646,0.08005249343832022,0.028871391076115485,0.08267716535433071,0.031496062992125984,0.09317585301837271,0.026246719160104987,0.011811023622047244,0.05380577427821522,0.03280839895013123,0.04199475065616798,True,295.0,0.8503937007874016,4.427821522309712,762.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005078597339782346,0.010882708585247884,0.0,0.0,63.79578125000003,9.461631944444445,11.638503566790096,12.535178843226788,12.184894406392694,11.907701674277018,47.47188926940639,5.53125,21.986227185086175,3535876961.237082,4640258.479313756,4.957382039573821,4.0,2.5418286712672447,20.53125,20.5,10.644788557669898,1.4444444444444444,1.0,0.7587362542640128,657,328,0.4992389649923896,3374,32,56
"5 things to know about Pope Francis "" He told me . ... ' I 'm in favor of gay rights and in any case , I also favor civil unions for homosexuals , but I believe that Argentina is not yet ready for a gay marriage law , ' "" said Marquez , a gay rights activist , a self - described devout Catholic and a former theology professor at a Catholic seminary . The pope 's reported willingness behind - the - scenes to accept civil unions as a compromise may offer new insight into how he will lead the world 's 1.2 billion Catholics . A public battle As archbishop of Buenos Aires , Bergoglio was one of the leaders of the Catholic Church 's public charge against legalizing same - sex marriage in Argentina . He engaged in a notorious war of words with the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner , who supported the measure . Bergoglio put himself in the middle of the fight , calling the proposed legislation "" a destructive attack on God 's plan . "" With a front - page counterpunch , the president said the church possessed "" attitudes reminiscent of medieval times and the Inquisition . "" Some point to the public battle as evidence of Bergoglio 's traditionalist views . But behind closed doors , Marquez said , the man who would become pope appeared to be more open to discussion of the issue . In another meeting , Bergoglio told him he had always treated gay people with respect and dignity . World reacts to new pope "" I have accompanied many homosexual people during my career to tend to their spiritual needs , "" Bergoglio said at the time , according to Marquez . Pope was ' very open , very frank ' Bergoglio , who chose the name Pope Francis after he was elected pontiff last week , may have voiced his support for civil unions in other circles . Andres Albertsen , a former pastor of the Danish Church in Buenos Aires , said Bergoglio made similar comments about civil unions to him in a private meeting . "" In this conversation that we had , he showed himself to be very open , very frank with me , "" Albertsen told CNN en Español on Wednesday . "" He told me that he would have accepted a civil union . "" According to a story published by The New York Times on Wednesday , Bergoglio also told bishops at a 2010 meeting that the church should support civil unions for gay couples . CNN could not independently confirm the details of the Argentine bishops ' meeting , which was also described in a July 2010 article published by Argentina 's Clarin newspaper . "" Bergoglio -- faithful to his moderate position -- proposed continuing measured actions . ... He would suggest , also , that the church discreetly accept the intermediate alternative of the civil union -- authorizing a series of rights ( inheritance , social work ) -- that would not equate to marriage nor permit adoption , "" wrote journalist Sergio Rubin -- now Bergoglio 's biographer . But that proposal was rejected by bishops , who voted instead to begin a high - profile , public battle against same - sex marriage , Rubin wrote . Pushing for dialogue A senior Vatican official said he could neither confirm nor deny The New York Times report at this point , adding",2.998278361895917,0.5555411284987348,0.45062794063304457,0.06897548410657896,0.8124807268381119,0.7843083174605119,0.14502529510961215,0.17706576728499157,0.10961214165261383,0.08768971332209106,0.10286677908937605,0.02866779089376054,0.10961214165261383,0.016863406408094434,0.08431703204047218,0.05396290050590219,0.011804384485666104,0.03709949409780776,0.01011804384485666,0.025295109612141653,True,229.0,0.8448566610455311,4.328836424957841,593.0,0.0,0.013932868904369854,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013299556681443952,0.0,0.0,0.0,56.71439759036146,11.2400975329891,12.623101263956098,14.144348823866899,13.655576592082618,11.950361445783134,51.023522662076886,6.476190476190476,16.552505098929288,15440509.472333167,26037.958637998596,4.931726907630522,4.0,2.625821238857018,23.714285714285715,23.0,9.774324271579413,1.4899598393574298,1.0,0.797145760729473,498,248,0.4979919678714859,2567,21,57
"Nor was today 's announcement a full - fledged reveal like Apple 's iOS 6 presentation at WWDC . Microsoft says it will unveil more end - user features in the summer . But in the meantime , these platform updates are significant , and Microsoft had a lot to say about them . Here 's a deeper dive into what we can expect from Windows Phone 8 . Hardware updates As suspected , Windows Phone 8 will support multi - core chips . It 's a move that will make Windows Phone more competitive with the iPhone and Android handsets , which have been able to check off multi - core support on their spec sheets for quite a while . When they launch , Windows Phone 8 devices will run on dual - core processors , specifically those from Qualcomm . "" The experience that people have had on a single - core will get much , much better as we move to dual - core , "" Joe Belfiore , manager of the Windows Phone Program , said at the event . Windows Phone 8 will also support three screen resolutions . ( Windows Phone 7.5 supports just one . ) The new screen resolutions include WVGA at 800×480 pixels and a 15:9 aspect ratio ; WXGA at 1280×769 and 15:9 ; and 720p at 1280×720 at 16:9 . Rounding out the hardware story , Windows Phone 8 will support microSD card expansion . Hardware manufacturers can include a microSD slot for users to easily transfer information from device to device . "" What this enables is that an end user can add a MicroSD card months after they 've bought a phone and transfer information from PC to phone , and phone to phone , "" Belfiore said . "" We did n't want to deliver this feature until we could do it where it 's easy to use . "" Revamped Internet Explorer 10 Microsoft showed off a new Internet Explorer browser for Windows Phone 8 . The new IE 10 features Smart Screen , an anti - phishing filter that uses data from Windows PCs to block malicious websites in real time . Belfiore showed off how IE 10 can protect users who might fall victim to scam links sent via email . IE 10 also receives a JavaScript update — JavaScript is now four times faster than the browser in Windows PHone 7.5 , according to the company . There 's also twice as much HTML5 support . How does mobile IE 10 compare to other mobile browsers ? According to recent SunSpider scores that measures a browser 's JavaScript execution performance , IE 10 performed the best . Shared Native Code Windows Phone 8 will share native C and C++ code with Windows 8 , making it easier for developers to create apps for both platforms . It 's not something that consumers will immediately notice when they use the OS , but Microsoft hopes shared native code will lead to better , faster app development — and thus more quality apps in Windows Phone Marketplace . "" The biggest effect this will have is we 're going to see some freaking killer games this year , "" Belfiore said . At its developer summit ,",2.7164581017327816,0.7831846649519038,0.40054300950422017,0.10151131854870235,0.6421848385093304,0.6391493440791964,0.12072072072072072,0.18558558558558558,0.07747747747747748,0.06306306306306306,0.11351351351351352,0.025225225225225224,0.10990990990990991,0.021621621621621623,0.07027027027027027,0.055855855855855854,0.021621621621621623,0.06126126126126126,0.04684684684684685,0.02702702702702703,True,209.0,0.8342342342342343,4.2,555.0,0.0,0.03398058252427184,0.020804438280166437,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04958391123439667,0.03640776699029126,0.027739251040221916,0.007207207207207207,75.72622004357301,7.076732026143791,8.515128840125781,9.068658574540928,9.549520697167758,10.191596638655462,40.52878929349518,4.037037037037037,13.701148593095617,891935.0482927263,1607.0901771040112,4.705882352941177,4.0,2.4205108884177915,17.62962962962963,17.0,9.157664865496647,1.338235294117647,1.0,0.6555261496477257,476,252,0.5294117647058824,2331,27,58
"The flight , carrying more than 200 passengers , disappeared from radar Saturday and has n't been seen or heard from since . Interpol identified the men using the stolen passports as Pouri Nourmohammadi , 18 , and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza , 29 , both Iranians . Malaysian police believe Nourmohammadi was trying to emigrate to Germany using the stolen Austrian passport . The men entered Malaysia on February 28 using valid Iranian passports , Interpol said . "" Interpol is asking why only a handful of countries worldwide are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights , "" Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said in a statement . Before the departure of Flight 370 , no country had checked the stolen passports against Interpol 's list since they were added to the lost - documents database in 2012 and 2013 , Interpol said . Countries , but not airlines , have access to Interpol 's data , and many governments do n't routinely check passports against the database . In 2013 , passengers were able to board planes more than 1 billion times without having their travel documents checked against Interpol 's data , the agency said . Airlines carried more than 3.1 billion passengers globally in 2013 , according to estimates from the International Air Transport Association . Are stolen passports related to plane 's disappearance ? Interpol head Noble said Tuesday that the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 does not appear to be related to terrorism . "" The more information we get , the more we 're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident , "" Noble said at a news conference in Lyon , France . There 's no evidence to suggest either of the men traveling on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight was connected to any terrorist organizations , according to Malaysian investigators . On any given day , many people travel using stolen or fake passports for reasons that have nothing to do with terrorism , aviation security expert Richard Bloom told CNN . They might be trying to immigrate illegally to another country , or they might be smuggling stolen goods , people , drugs or weapons or trying to import otherwise legal goods without paying taxes , said Bloom , director of terrorism , intelligence and security studies at Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University . "" For all of those reasons , the very notion that passports might be important in this particular situation may be a red herring , "" Bloom said . Noble said Sunday that the fact that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in Interpol 's databases is a big concern . "" This is a situation we had hoped never to see , "" he said . "" For years Interpol has asked why should countries wait for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates ? "" Few countries look up stolen passports Interpol does not charge countries for access to its databases , but some of the 190 Interpol member countries may not have the technical capacity or resources to access the network , according to Tom Fuentes , a former FBI assistant director . "" It 's just up to the will of the country to",2.8121022871194836,1.163108176609871,0.42363527468822754,0.14417627258380078,0.6682935908267443,0.7110442803019569,0.11733800350262696,0.19264448336252188,0.09632224168126094,0.07180385288966724,0.10157618213660245,0.047285464098073555,0.14185639229422067,0.02626970227670753,0.0542907180385289,0.03327495621716287,0.01576182136602452,0.05779334500875657,0.02626970227670753,0.017513134851138354,True,229.0,0.8598949211908932,4.646234676007006,571.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005584858827179647,0.013031337263419174,0.0,0.0070052539404553416,54.36695388135891,11.01202781200493,13.376103337137366,14.583207181834183,13.74583083964091,13.328825910931165,53.66449568737898,6.913043478260869,15.875676772942057,7847274.036404111,13743.036841338198,5.1882591093117405,5.0,2.7373159460925973,21.47826086956522,21.0,11.530185583247174,1.5445344129554657,1.0,0.8590082820164386,494,247,0.5,2653,23,59
""" A lot of my friends say , ' Why do you like surfing ? Surfing is dangerous . ' It 's not dangerous for me . It 's very fun , "" Rahayu says . "" Indonesian girls are scared of getting dark skin and do n't want to go surfing . And I 'm the luckiest one , I love the beach . "" Born in Seminyak , a coastal town in southern Bali that has been absorbed by the major tourist resort of Kuta , Rahayu has lived by the sea all her life . "" So many Australians come and act like bad tourists and make everything dirty , "" she told Surfing Life website last month . "" But no matter what I would never leave Bali , because I can surf amazing waves all - year - round and you ca n't do that anywhere else . "" Her dad was a renowned local surfer , but he was n't so keen when she said she wanted to follow in his footsteps . So the 12 - year - old went behind his back and learned from her uncle instead . Two years later , she made a name for herself at a local talent contest and earned a sponsorship deal . The middle of three sisters , Rahayu says surfing has given her an identity . Unlike her father , who had to give up the sport to support the family , she has been able to combine competing with her university studies thanks to funding from Rip Curl -- one of surfing 's major brands . "" I feel so lucky . No - one from Bali can surf . I do n't want to be like any other girls , "" she says . "" I feel great because I can do something different . Everything in my life now is about surfing . "" Rahayu 's major breakthrough came when she won a bronze medal for Indonesia at the 2008 Asian Beach Games , which were held in Bali . "" I met the president , had an interview with him and we talked a lot , "" she recalls . "" It was really cool . And my mom and my dad were proud of me , and my name was in every newspaper . "" The silver medal winner that year was Yasniar Gea . From the island of Nias , off the coast of Sumatra , she has gone on to become the most successful female Indonesian surfer . Rahayu competes against Gea on the Asian Surfing Tour , but says her biggest inspiration comes from women riding on the world stage -- such as leading Australians Stephanie Gilmore and Sally Fitzgibbons , and Hawaii 's Carissa Moore . Joining them is still a pipe dream ; she acknowledges she has yet to pay her dues on the Asian circuit . "" I want to win this tour . I want to focus on that -- it 's my dream , "" Rahayu says . "" I 'm not going to Europe yet , but I will . And I want to go to Australia , maybe next year .

"And that 's a spirit that does n't always jibe with the image of CEO of a corporation expected to be valued at up to $ 100 billion when it makes its first public stock offering in the next few weeks . "" On balance , I 'm not sure it 's the best way to do business , "" said Ali Velshi , CNN 's chief business correspondent . "" But Mark Zuckerberg has defied all rules . "" The moxie suggested in the report comes at an interesting time for Facebook and Zuckerberg , who also reportedly whittled down Systrom 's initial asking price of $ 2 billion . On the brink of offering up Facebook , with its hundreds of millions of users , to stockholders , even Zuckerberg 's controlling interest in the company ( a 57 % share of voting rights , according to reports ) could soon need to be checked by the types of lawyers , bean - counters and other business types whose jobs involve looking out for a company 's bottom line . "" This paints a complex picture of its CEO as at once confident and bold , and also nervous and panicky -- details that will be scrutinized come Facebook 's imminent IPO , "" Kit Eaton wrote on Fast Company 's website . Velshi , who over the course of his career covered the "" tech bubble "" of the late 1990s , said the whirlwind purchase may , in fact , be a last hurrah of sorts for Zuckerberg . "" It actually happens more than we think . And it 's not a bad thing , particularly in non - public companies , Velshi said . "" But , in public companies , boards are important -- they are supposed to protect shareholder interests , and they are supposed to bring perspective and experience that a kid CEO may not have . "" The Facebook board did vote to approve the deal , according to the Journal . But at that point , it was largely an endorsement more than a decision . The board , one source said , "" was told , not consulted . "" In the fast - moving world of Web tech , being nimble is almost a prerequisite for survival . Fail to adapt and someone else will pass you by . Instagram , a mobile app which lets users enhance their photos with a raft of pre - created filters , was reportedly on the verge of nailing down a new round of private investments worth $ 50 million . Could that have made Zuckerberg overpay for a company with 13 employees and no revenue to date ? Maybe , says Velshi . "" Creativity , innovation and deal - making are different strengths ; rarely does one person possess all of them , "" he said . "" That Zuckerberg felt strongly that he wanted Instragram may not have made him the best person to do the deal -- that 's why we have real estate agents , or talent agents .

"West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a request for a civil injunction last week in which he alleges that two female students were victims of sexual assaults over the course of the year at the hands of two seventh - grade boys . According to the filing , abuse of the two 13 - year - old Burch Middle School students , also in the seventh grade , took place on multiple occasions between November 2012 and May 2013 . The attorney general says in the filing that two boys would work in concert : one would restrain their victim while the other groped her "" breasts , genitalia ( and ) buttocks . "" Most of the alleged attacks Morrisey outlines in the filing took place at the school , except for a class trip to the state capital of Charleston , where one of the girls said she was raped . Names of neither the boys nor the girls have been released , but the attorney general 's court filing identifies the suspects as Juvenile 1 and Juvenile 2 , and states they are both relatives of employees of the Mingo County school system . Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney Teresa Maynard told CNN that she first learned of the investigation last week after Morrisey filed the request for an injunction . She said she met with the attorney general on Friday and explained to him that her office must be part of the investigation from now on -- and it did n't take her very long to show that she meant it : Maynard filed juvenile charges against both of the boys on Friday . She would not divulge what those charges were . Maynard has not brought charges against any other parties , but the attorney general did name a handful of teachers and administrators as defendants in the court filing requesting a civil injunction -- which is not to be confused with the filing of criminal charges . Attorney General Morrisey declined to be interviewed for this article , but West Virginia State Police Public Information Officer Lt . Mike Baylous explained that a civil injunction -- like the one requested by Morrisey in this case -- is an "" extreme "" court order that is made for the purpose of restraining the defendant -- or in this case , the defendants - from pursuing any conduct that amounts to harassment . The attorney general made the case in his complaint that he has ample reason to believe that a state investigation would be stymied . As abhorrent as the allegations are themselves , Morrissey says they are not why he is taking this action ; he 's doing that because , he said "" the overall handling of the allegations was inherently flawed and tainted with conflicts of interest . "" That may seem like an understatement in a 32 - page complaint that details allegations of disappearing evidence , connected suspects , sham investigations , deceitful and vengeful administrators , and refusals to cooperate with law enforcement . Mingo County , going back to the Hatfield - McCoy days , has earned an unsavory reputation , thanks to nepotism , cronyism and a spectacular history of vendettas and public corruption . In the last few years Mingo 's sheriff was assassinated , its only circuit judge and prosecutor both went to prison on conspiracy charges in an unrelated case , and a county commissioner pleaded guilty to extortion . Just this week , the mayor of the county 's largest city pleaded guilty to lying to federal authorities in a workers ' compensation case . Not even the Mingo school system seems to be immune from controversy . Court filings cite repeated examples of school officials allegedly protecting the accused in the seventh - grade sexual assault allegations , and claim that "" a relative of ( one of the boys ) was directly involved in",2.987492186116105,0.9771604879379203,0.44638630037355514,0.11396079801221634,0.7654605399817228,0.7539705704701575,0.10407239819004525,0.2277526395173454,0.11463046757164404,0.10407239819004525,0.07541478129713423,0.024132730015082957,0.09803921568627451,0.03167420814479638,0.058823529411764705,0.05128205128205128,0.02564102564102564,0.04675716440422323,0.01809954751131222,0.0196078431372549,True,296.0,0.8853695324283559,4.541478129713424,663.0,0.0,0.014157364552137218,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017968962700789546,0.014701878573373264,0.0,0.0015082956259426848,51.37112244897962,13.050068027210887,14.689810185797409,17.050340136054423,15.999846938775512,12.392857142857139,57.08163265306122,8.142857142857142,18.96851864527109,172950960.20785862,260861.17678410048,4.974489795918367,4.0,2.688669013884455,28.0,28.0,12.474736374731437,1.501700680272109,1.0,0.8640577221125881,588,280,0.47619047619047616,3011,21,62
"Tina Maze had been poised to add the slalom title to her overall , giant slalom and super - G Crystal Globes , having been denied the downhill when fog canceled racing on Shiffrin 's birthday . The Slovenian was the fastest on the opening run , and led the standings by seven points , but Shiffrin made up a 1.17 - second deficit to claim her fourth World Cup race this season and become the fourth youngest woman to win the title . She is only the third non - European to win the slalom globe , following compatriot Tamara McKinney in 1984 and Canadian Betsy Clifford in 1971 . No other non - European woman has won four World Cup races in a season . "" I was freaking out , this time there was really too much emotion , "" said Shiffrin , who last month in Austria was the youngest winner of the slalom title at a world championships since 1974 . "" I think half of this globe belongs to someone else today . I actually would like to thank Tina Maze . She 's been inspiring , she 's helped me get to where I am . "" She 's also had strong support from her parents and coaching staff . "" After the first run I went directly to our athlete tent and just tried to sit quietly and figure out what I needed to do to make it better , "" Shiffrin said . "" It 's hard to do that between runs in a race , but my mom helped , my coaches helped , my dad helped , everybody . They all just said the same thing , ' You have to let it go . You can not hold back . There is nothing to lose . ' So I tried to do that . "" Maze had to settle for third place behind Austria 's Bernadette Schild for her 23rd podium finish this season . "" In the first run I risked a lot and somehow in the second I did n't manage to risk as much , "" the 29 - year - old said . "" Mikaela has been dominating slalom the whole season and I do n't think I lost the globe here today , but somewhere else . "" Maze has already wrapped up the giant slalom globe ahead of Sunday 's final race -- and American Ted Ligety confirmed his dominance of the men 's discipline when he crowned his season with a sixth victory out of eight starts on Saturday . "" It 's so ridiculous , it has been such an amazing year , "" said Ligety , who won three golds at the world championships and sealed the giant slalom globe last weekend with victory in Slovenia . "" I never would have expected it and in a way it 's kind of a bummer as I will never be able to do that again . A really cool season and to finish it up with a victory . I could n't be more pleased . "" Overall World Cup champion Marcel Hirscher was second to be giant slalom runnerup , and has already clinched the slalom title ahead of Sunday 's final race .

"Finally , word came from Green on Wednesday evening that every child that had been stuck was on a bus and headed home . That included the 2,000 Fulton County Schools students and 400 Atlanta Public Schools kids who had stayed at their schools overnight . Facing critics who ask how fewer than 3 inches of snow could cripple the city , especially after it tangled with another debilitating storm in 2011 , Mayor Kasim Reed assured Atlantans the city was working to open roads and asked them to stay at home . "" What I want to say to them is hold off on trying to get to them . What I can assure ( you ) is they are safe , "" he said . "" The safest place for them was in the school system . ... I know it is very tough . "" There were uplifting stories amid the chaos , however , as the city schools ' Twitter feed and a specially created Facebook page , SnowedOutAtlanta , which had more than 52,000 members as of Wednesday night , showed a steady stream of gratitude alongside the messages of frustration . At E. Rivers Elementary School , about 150 students and teachers spent the night on gym mats , according to CNN affiliate WSB . They watched movies , ate a warm meal Tuesday night and were served French toast for breakfast , the station reported . Was Atlanta asleep at the wheel ? One father , who identified himself only as Mark , said he walked 6 miles to spend the night with his 5 - year - old daughter , Elizabeth . He said it put his mind at ease to see how the school staff was taking care of the youngsters . "" It was fantastic . All the students seemed like they were having a great time , "" he told WSB . "" It looked like a very large sleepover party . "" Added young Elizabeth , "" We got to watch four or five movies . "" Heartwarming stories were heavily outnumbered by those from worried parents who had to spend the night without their children . Corliss Collins , for instance , said she spoke to her granddaughter , one of about 200 students who spent the night at New Manchester High School in Douglasville , west of Atlanta , around 8 a.m. The granddaughter ate dinner and breakfast there , but told her grandmother that school officials were asking parents to pick up their children because the cafeteria had run out of food , Collins said . Principal Constance Craft told CNN there was no truth to reports the school had no food . "" We are trying to get teachers who have been here since early morning yesterday home to their families . Our manpower is exhausted , and our children are ready to be home , "" she said in an e - mail . Craft later added that the National Guard troops who helped escort the students home were "" wonderful . "" All students had been sent home by lunchtime Wednesday , she said . In West Atlanta , about 60 students from Riverwood International Charter School remained at a Kroger supermarket Wednesday morning after being transported there from their buses , which were stuck on I-285 , said store employee Kim Bradley . The store provided food for them , she said .

"No need to cut out dessert : The key is to eat strategically . Happily , some major companies are getting on board . In the past four years , cereal brands have cut back on sugar , the milk industry recently lowered amounts in the chocolate milk served in schools , and Walmart is aiming for 10 % less added sugar in select foods by 2015 . Health.com : 25 ways to cut 500 calories a day We turned to experts to clear up the confusion over this tasty temptress . As Katz says , "" There 's a role for sugar in our diet . After all , what 's the point of being healthy if it 's not to enjoy living ? "" Is there such thing as a sweet tooth ? Yes , sugar love is in your DNA . Researchers have found two sweet - receptor genes that can predict a preference for sweets . How much is OK ? The American Heart Association ( AHA ) recommends most women get no more than 24 grams of added sugar per day . That 's about six teaspoons , or 100 calories -- a little less than the amount in one can of soda . Thing is , the average American woman eats about 18 daily teaspoons . Sugar is hidden in unlikely foods , from salad dressing to crackers , which can push you past 24 grams . Read labels ; if there 's a sweetener in the first few ingredients ( some common aliases : evaporated cane juice , high - fructose corn syrup , fruit juice concentrate , agave nectar , fructose , dextrose , and syrup ) , look for a brand with a low - or no - sugar option .

"He drank three cups of water and frequently wiped his face . The judges ordered van der Sloot expelled from Peru at the end of his sentence and ordered him to pay 200,000 Peruvian new soles , or about $ 74,500 , in reparations to Flores ' closest relatives . Van der Sloot confessed to robbery in addition to murder , admitting that he stole Flores ' belongings , including 850 soles ( more than $ 300 ) , credit cards , and the victim 's van as a means to leave the country . He fled to Chile and was arrested a few days later . It was an apparent attempt to win a more lenient sentence , using a plea called an "" anticipated conclusion of the process "" under Peruvian law . Five days earlier , the three judges delayed the start of van der Sloot 's trial after he declined to give a plea after expressing reservations about the "" aggravating factors "" tied to admitting his guilt . Van der Sloot 's attorney , Jose Luis Jimenez , pressed earlier this week for a shorter sentence . Jimenez claimed that his client was under special stress the day the 2010 murder occurred , which marked five years after Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway went missing in Aruba . Van der Sloot -- who , with two others , was among the last people seen with Holloway - was detained twice , but never charged , in the high - profile international case . "" He was pointed at and persecuted . The world had been against him for five years before this case , for a murder he said he never committed and for which there is no evidence whatsoever , "" said Jimenez . Investigators have said they believe van der Sloot killed Flores after she found something related to the Holloway case on his computer while visiting him in his hotel room . The two met while van der Sloot was in town for a poker tournament . Judges on Friday recounted the crime in detail . They described how Flores hit van der Sloot in the face after reading the item on Holloway , leading him to hit her in the face with his elbow . Flores fainted and van der Sloot tried to strangle her , but she was still breathing and so he suffocated her with his shirt . Van der Sloot then tried to clean the room by removing the sheets and changing his bloodied shirt , they said . He was ultimately caught while traveling alone in a taxi near the Chilean central coastal city of Vina del Mar. Holloway 's body has never been found , and no one has been charged in relation to the case in Aruba . But van der Sloot does face possible extradition to the United States in a related matter . In June 2010 , a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $ 250,000 from Holloway 's mother , Beth . Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway 's remains in exchange for the money , according to the indictment . He was allegedly given a total of $ 25,000 , and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru for the poker tournament . Thursday , about six and a half years after Holloway went missing , Alabama Probate Judge Alan King signed an order declaring the teenager legally dead .",2.8972830264543226,0.6377300747211417,0.4320935094047236,0.06320321318764001,0.8000428909840791,0.7794166884639047,0.10016420361247948,0.17077175697865354,0.11001642036124795,0.08210180623973727,0.12151067323481117,0.031198686371100164,0.1330049261083744,0.027914614121510674,0.042692939244663386,0.06732348111658457,0.019704433497536946,0.031198686371100164,0.026272577996715927,0.029556650246305417,True,249.0,0.8768472906403941,4.22495894909688,609.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.033951587551084565,0.028607356177302735,0.023577491354919836,0.0,70.10083333333334,9.0712962962963,11.538034831475386,12.851851851851855,11.599388888888889,10.074000000000002,45.092592592592595,5.083333333333333,16.623194198262986,16571488.199639944,27210.98226541863,4.624074074074074,4.0,2.3572924821423586,22.5,24.0,9.561206339508978,1.3462962962962963,1.0,0.7229602117433991,540,269,0.4981481481481482,2573,24,67
"There , Haleigh began a regimen of cannabis oil : four times a day and once at night . By summer , she was down to just a handful of seizures a day . In less than three months , doctors were able to wean her off Depakote , a powerful medication that had been damaging her liver . Haleigh had never been able to walk or talk . But freed from seizures in Colorado , "" She said ' Mama ' for the first time , "" Cox said . "" She 's playing with puzzles ; she 's walking . She 's almost being a normal child . "" Despite all the good news , Cox is living in limbo . Her husband , a paramedic , could n't afford to leave his job and pension ; he still lives and works in Forsyth , Georgia . The family is relying on charity to keep their Colorado apartment for the next few months ; beyond that , the future is uncertain . A bill being introduced Monday in the U.S. House of Representatives could be Cox 's ticket home . The three - page bill would amend the Controlled Substances Act -- the federal law that criminalizes marijuana -- to exempt plants with an extremely low percentage of THC , the chemical that makes users high . Gupta : Why I changed my mind on weed If passed , it would be the first time that federal law allows any medical marijuana use . "" No one should face a choice of having their child suffer or moving to Colorado and splitting up their family , "" said Rep. Scott Perry , R - Pennsylvania , the bill 's sponsor . "" We live in America , and if there 's something that would make my child better , and they ca n't get it because of the government , that 's not right . "" The bill will land in a Congress that may be open to change . Across the country , highly sympathetic patients and a nonintoxicating product have proved a popular mix . This year alone , 11 states have passed legislation loosening regulation of cannabis strains with high cannabidiol and/or minimal THC content . In this atmosphere , Perry says that once members and their staffs are brought up to speed , he expects the bill to attract "" overwhelming "" support . "" It would n't be surprising if we see broad support for this proposal , "" agreed Mason Tvert , communications director at the Marijuana Policy Project , which advocates for marijuana and medical marijuana legalization . "" If this bill gets support , it will demonstrate that there is recognition of marijuana 's medical benefits . "" Dubbed the Charlotte 's Web Medical Hemp Act of 2014 , the bill is named after Charlotte Figi , a young Colorado girl whose parents have campaigned nationwide for easier access to medical marijuana after successfully controlling their daughter 's seizures with cannabis oil . Since her story became known , a growing number of parents have flocked to Colorado , hoping for similar success . The Charlotte 's Web cannabis strain , developed by the Realm of Caring nonprofit organization in Colorado Springs , is in high demand , in part because of the attention it 's received in the media . Many families wait months for a batch to be grown and processed into cannabis oil . Perry 's bill , however , would apply to any cannabis strain with a THC content of less than 0.3 % . Charlotte 's Web and similar strains not only have minimal THC , they have high levels of cannabidiol , another chemical .

"There 's hundreds of people , wedding certificates are being issued , there 's marriages taking place all over the hallways . Everybody 's embracing . It 's just a warm , wonderful moment in the state of Utah . "" In striking down the state law , which voters had approved in 2004 , U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Shelby wrote in a 53 - page ruling that the state 's "" current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and , in so doing , demean the dignity of these same - sex couples for no rational reason . "" Accordingly , the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional , "" he said . Shelby said lawyers for the state had offered no evidence that opposite - sex marriage would be affected and that their "" fears and speculations are insufficient to justify the State 's refusal to dignify the family relationships of its gay and lesbian citizens . "" In addition , the Constitution protects the rights of same - sex couples , including their right to marry and to have that marriage recognized by their government , he said . "" These rights would be meaningless if the Constitution did not also prevent the government from interfering with the intensely personal choices an individual makes when that person decides to make a solemn commitment to another human being . The Constitution therefore protects the choice of one 's partner for all citizens , regardless of their sexual identity . "" The lawsuit was brought by one gay and two lesbian couples in Utah who wish to marry but have been unable to do so because the Utah Constitution prohibits same - sex marriage . The decision was greeted with joy from a spokesman for GLAAD , formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation . "" At last , loving and committed couples in Utah will have the opportunity to celebrate marriage equality this holiday season , "" said Wilson Cruz in a posting on its website . "" We are seeing state leaders and more and more citizens recognize that loving and committed couples should not be legally kept apart , "" said Cruz . "" We look forward to seeing that momentum to continue in 2014 . "" Gov. Gary R. Herbert expressed disappointment at the ruling by Shelby , whom he called "" an activist federal judge . "" Herbert said he was working with his legal counsel and the acting attorney general "" to determine the best course to defend traditional marriage within the borders of Utah . "" A spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints said in a statement that it supports "" traditional marriage , "" while teaching that everyone should be treated with respect . "" This ruling by a district court will work its way through the judicial process , "" Eric Hawkins said . "" We continue to believe that voters in Utah did the right thing by providing clear direction in the state Constitution that marriage should be between a man and a woman and we are hopeful that this view will be validated by a higher court . "" The president of the National Organization for Marriage , Brian Brown , called the ruling "" a travesty of justice . "" In a statement , he added , "" This trend of vetoing the voters from the bench must be stopped . "" That view was not shared by Clifford Rosky , chairman of the board of Equality Utah . "" We think it is a thoughtful and careful ruling that is based on the Supreme Court decision last summer and we expect that it will be upheld ultimately by the United States Supreme Court , "" he said . By early Friday evening , Rosky told CNN he had signed as a witness to multiple marriages among same - sex couples . Though the state has already filed a notice of appeal , the state 's lawyers did not file a motion for a stay in district court ,",2.9251416417733047,1.1548004681726514,0.4307929867648585,0.13139397749458603,0.6886911631490176,0.7213302838802338,0.12893982808022922,0.18481375358166188,0.0988538681948424,0.10601719197707736,0.08452722063037249,0.03008595988538682,0.11604584527220631,0.025787965616045846,0.06446991404011461,0.05157593123209169,0.022922636103151862,0.05730659025787966,0.0071633237822349575,0.02148997134670487,True,300.0,0.8653295128939829,4.319484240687679,698.0,0.0,0.02209051724137931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013739224137931034,0.010775862068965518,0.014547413793103448,0.0028653295128939827,62.57212885673654,10.043190502689672,11.715833242495528,12.947529833673407,12.52850244234218,11.411752921535893,48.56248067767267,5.851851851851852,20.460760839952613,769122521.0585002,1101894.7293101721,4.854757929883139,4.0,2.5745524725453817,22.185185185185187,18.0,13.193817399005454,1.4390651085141903,1.0,0.7811701727745805,599,288,0.48080133555926546,3015,27,69
"I call this "" antibiotic winter . "" To explain : In the early 1950 's , scientists conducted experiments to determine whether our resident microbes -- the huge number of bacteria that live in and on our bodies , now called our "" microbiome "" -- help in fending off invading bacteria . They fed mice a species of a typical invader , disease - causing salmonella . It took about 100,000 organisms to infect half of the normal mice . But when they first gave mice an antibiotic , which kills both good and bad bacteria , and then several days later gave them salmonella , it took only three organisms to infect them . This is n't a 10 or 20 % difference ; it 's a 30,000 - fold difference . That was in mice , but what about humans ? In 1985 , Chicago faced a massive outbreak of salmonella . At least 160,000 people became ill and several died from drinking contaminated milk . The health department asked victims of the outbreak and unaffected persons , "" Have you received antibiotics in the month prior to becoming ill ? "" People who said yes were five times more likely to become ill than those who drank the milk but had n't recently received antibiotics . People carry a small number of highly abundant bacterial species and a large number of much less common ones . For example , you may carry trillions of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in your colon and only a thousand cells , or fewer , belonging to many other species . We are not sure how many rare species any of us has . If you had only 50 cells of a particular type , it would be difficult to detect them against the background of trillions of others . When you take a broad - spectrum antibiotic , which is the kind most commonly prescribed , it may be that rare microbes occasionally get wiped out entirely . And once the population hits zero , there is no bouncing back . For your body , that species is now extinct . My worry is that some of these critical residential organisms -- what I consider "" contingency "" species -- may disappear altogether . Why might it matter ? Those puny species may not be so inconsequential . Microbes multiply . Any small population of , say , 50 cells can explode into a billion or more in one week . The trigger for their massive bloom could be a food you 've eaten for the first time , which only they have the enzymes to digest . In the presence of this food , the rare microbe goes into overdrive , doubling every 12 or 20 minutes , multiplying by a million percent or more . This could be good for you because some of the energy captured by these digesting microbes might end up in your bloodstream . When food is in short supply , as has been the case for most of human existence , and people need to eat unfamiliar plants or animals , it is useful to have a repertoire of enzymes that help us process a wide variety of nutrients . The genes of our flexible partners , our resident microbes , provide those enzymes . Now consider the consequences if one of your rare microbes -- an ancient one that has been dwelling in Homo sapiens for 200,000 years -- went extinct . One possibility is that it does n't matter . Perhaps that microbe was a marginal player -- good riddance . Another possibility : It 's a "" contingency "" organism , useful -- crucial -- when we need it for protection . When a new influenza epidemic arose in Mexico in 2009 , people in California and Texas soon fell ill , and then flu appeared in New York a few days later . After a few weeks , this flu spread throughout the world . Considering the numbers of people infected , we were lucky that it was not a highly lethal strain . Yet thousands of people all over the world did",2.790519479296576,0.9497996426570842,0.45378451180732493,0.07438673888598643,0.7471963371549334,0.7297380435116151,0.13068181818181818,0.18892045454545456,0.09232954545454546,0.07954545454545454,0.009943181818181818,0.022727272727272728,0.10369318181818182,0.03125,0.09517045454545454,0.08522727272727272,0.024147727272727272,0.056818181818181816,0.03125,0.045454545454545456,True,325.0,0.8465909090909091,4.193181818181818,704.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004378762999452655,0.0,0.0,0.0014204545454545455,69.03673507462688,7.7912562189054775,10.56542912352145,10.74643449419569,9.073407960199006,10.058109452736318,41.293946932006634,4.111111111111111,20.331228266331138,675678727.8182113,959770.9201963228,4.698175787728027,4.0,2.595783030462673,16.75,13.5,9.378980636389958,1.427860696517413,1.0,0.8120280900737579,603,312,0.5174129353233831,2952,36,70
"Since 9/11 , jihadist terrorists have killed 25 people in the United States . Each one of those deaths is a tragedy , but none of these attacks were national catastrophes as 9/11 was . While al Qaeda and its affiliates have failed to conduct any successful attacks in the United States since 9/11 , they have sought to encourage action from militant American citizens , who might be more capable of carrying out terrorist operations in the States than foreign operatives given the stringent security measures now in place . Unfortunately , this strategy of promoting homegrown extremism has demonstrated some successes , such as Maj . Nidal Hasan 's killing of 13 people at the Fort Hood , Texas , military base in 2009 and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings , which authorities have said were carried out by Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev . All of these were inspired by the propaganda of Anwar al - Awlaki , the American cleric killed in a 2011 U.S. drone strike in Yemen after he took up an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . According to the New America Foundation 's research , an astonishing quarter of the 247 jihadist extremists charged since 9/11 either possessed copies of al - Awlaki 's propaganda materials , cited him as an influence or were in communication with him . The influence of al - Awlaki and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula 's English - language magazine Inspire has persisted even after al - Awlaki 's death . Worrisomely , around 100 Americans have traveled to fight in Syria with opposition groups , including with ISIS and the al Qaeda - affiliated Nusra Front . So far , nine Americans have been charged with attempting to support or supporting ISIS or Nusra , according to a count by New America . In addition , at least two Americans have died fighting with these groups : Moner Mohammad Abu - Salha , who committed a suicide bombing in Syria for Nusra Front , and Douglas McCain , who died fighting with ISIS . The difficulty al Qaeda and similar groups have had in inspiring Americans to conduct attacks at home is due to the strength of systemic security checks , such as the willingness of Muslim communities to report potential terrorist activity . A third of the extremists charged since 2001 were implicated by tips from family or local community members , according to an analysis by New America . Of the 51 plots to conduct an attack inside the United States since 9/11 , nearly half were initiated while the suspects were under surveillance by informants , according to a count by New America . The role that the Muslim community has played as well as aggressive law enforcement efforts using informants have both helped to make the United States a hard target for militants . Add to these factors other measures taken since 9/11 ; the day that",2.945649833190389,0.432531603374854,0.49813828186947484,0.05594070414132412,0.8427888711293539,0.8363512243543353,0.096,0.168,0.13,0.09,0.154,0.026,0.098,0.026,0.054,0.03,0.02,0.05,0.034,0.024,True,207.0,0.874,4.616,500.0,0.0,0.07267545422158889,0.07267545422158889,0.027787673672960457,0.027787673672960457,0.027787673672960457,0.010687566797292483,0.024225151407196294,0.017100106875667972,0.002,51.67306837248324,12.992425894854588,14.90622815163357,17.260011185682327,16.24680369127517,12.737807606263978,56.12541946308725,7.875,12.796060706635657,360793.37557980476,721.5867511596095,5.033557046979865,4.0,2.6665953476041713,27.9375,27.5,10.807802447768927,1.4988814317673378,1.0,0.8351203756764566,447,239,0.5346756152125279,2308,16,71

"" He said the officer refused to discuss the suggestion . Reaction at home Hashimoto 's comments also found little support among political colleagues at home . "" A series of remarks by Japanese politicians related to our interpretation of [ wartime ] history have been misunderstood , "" Education Minister Hakubun Shimomura told reporters at his weekly press conference Tuesday . "" In that sense Mr. Hashimoto 's remarks came at a bad time . [ But ] I wonder if there is any positive meaning to intentionally make such remarks at this particular moment ? As for the remarks about adult entertainment , I could not believe that it came from a man representing a political party . "" Fellow minister Tomomi Inada asked : "" I wonder is this something the representative of a political party should say ? I myself think the comfort women [ issue ] infringed the human rights of the women . "" Chief Cabinet Spokesman Yoshihide Suga did not respond directly to Hashimoto 's comments but instead told reporters "" the stance of the Japanese government on the comfort women issue is , as it has been stated repeatedly in the past , that they suffered unspeakably painful experiences and we keenly feel the pain when we think about them . "" Sex slaves Many of the 200,000 women whom historians estimate were forced to become sex slaves for Japan 's former Imperial Army were from the Philippines , China and the Korean peninsula -- all occupied territories at the time . While many have now died , a group of Korean survivors has spent years protesting outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul . They demand greater recognition of their suffering , as well as individual compensation . Tokyo maintains its legal liability for wrongdoing was cleared by a bilateral treaty signed in 1965 with South Korea . For its part , the Seoul government expressed "" deep disappointment "" over Hashimoto 's comments . "" There is worldwide recognition ... that the issue of comfort women amounts to a wartime rape committed by Japan during its past imperial period in a serious breach of human rights , "" a foreign ministry spokesman told Agence France - Presse Tuesday . "" Our government again urges Japan 's prominent officials to show regret for atrocities committed during Japan 's imperial period and to correct their anachronistic way of thinking and comments . "" In 1993 , the Japanese government released a statement acknowledging the "" immeasurable pain and suffering "" endured by thousands of women forced to have sex during World War II . It even vowed to include the comfort women issue in new junior high school textbooks for the first time . But Japan 's wartime past continues to loom over its relations with key Asian neighbors such as South Korea and China , which are currently strained by territorial disputes in the region .",2.9791266567032357,0.9993123188100459,0.4236888477224611,0.11313121645580292,0.7207238763570786,0.7468329213167492,0.11233885819521179,0.20257826887661143,0.11049723756906077,0.07918968692449356,0.07918968692449356,0.03683241252302026,0.11602209944751381,0.020257826887661142,0.09208103130755065,0.06813996316758748,0.01289134438305709,0.03683241252302026,0.0055248618784530384,0.02578268876611418,True,219.0,0.8802946593001841,4.661141804788214,543.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00878620240807029,0.02050113895216401,0.0,0.001841620626151013,51.74454802259888,11.625714285714288,13.484332010920856,14.837933817594834,14.22625201775626,13.366864406779658,52.137207425343014,6.666666666666667,14.00813583755839,1212428.3867295077,2232.8331247320584,5.184322033898305,5.0,2.7941236699070506,22.476190476190474,19.0,12.469463835493135,1.5635593220338984,1.0,0.8758690845443499,472,265,0.5614406779661016,2531,21,72
"The most recent , and tragic , tale to emerge concerned the death of two construction workers after a crane collapsed at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo -- due to host the World Cup 's opening match . Friday marks the start of a countdown to June 12 next year , when Brazil will begin a month - long festival of football , likely to captivate the world . Where ? The draw will take place in the resort of Costa do Sauipe in Bahia on the northeast coast of Brazil . In attendance will be representatives from each World Cup nation as well as FIFA 's top brass , including president Sepp Blatter . The ceremony will be broadcast live to 193 countries from 1 p.m. local time ( 1700 CET ) with 1,300 guests alongside a bank of 2,000 reporters . As ever , there will be entertainment , including turns from Brazilian singers Alexandre Pires and Vanessa da Mata as well as dance troupe Companhia de Danca Deborah Colker . There has been some controversy already when the two actors scheduled to host the draw -- Lazaro Ramos and Camila Pitanga , who both have dark skin -- were replaced by another married celebrity couple , Fernanda Lima and Rodrigo Hilbert , who are blond and white . What is it ? The World Cup draw determines which of the 32 nations will face each other in the group stages . Teams will be drawn into eight groups of four , based on FIFA 's seeding system and geographical separation , meaning that teams from the same qualification zone ca n't be drawn in the same group . There is an exception for European countries , given there are 13 participating in the tournament , but no more than two from the region can be drawn in the same group . The winners of a particular group will face the runner - up of another when the tournament enters its final-16 stage -- the first of the knockout rounds . The seedings Eight teams in the draw are seeded -- seven are the highest placed teams from FIFA 's rankings , the other is host Brazil . The top seven when the seedings were announced in October comprised of defending champion Spain along with Germany , Argentina , Colombia , Belgium , Uruguay and Switzerland . The seedings are calculated on how a team has played over the past four years , with the most recent year given greatest importance . Teams earn ranking points for a win or a draw but nothing for a defeat . The points vary with each game depending on who is playing and whether it is a friendly or qualifying match .

"One of the houses was in Bahia de Banderas , a tourist town in western Mexico 's Nayarit state , he said . Mexican intelligence detected the alleged plot on September 6 , he said . Intelligence agents followed the trail and discovered that Cynthia Ann Vanier , a Canadian who was in direct contact with the Gadhafi family , was the leader of the ring , Poire said . Vanier was arrested on November 10 . The next day , authorities arrested Gabriela Davila Huerta o Cueto , a Mexican living in the United States who Poire said was in charge of getting the false documents . Pierre Christian Flemsborg , a Dane , was in charge of logistics , Poire said , and was arrested on November 11 . Also arrested was Mexican Jose Luis Kennedy Prieto , who helped obtain the phony documents , Poire said . The suspects face charges that include falsifying documents and opening bank accounts under false identities . According to Poire , the Gadhafis would have entered the country under the following aliases : Daniel Bejar Hanan , Amira Sayed Nader , Moah Bejar Sayed and Sofia Bejar Sayed . Saadi Gadhafi remains in Niger , a landlocked West African nation bordering Libya , to which he fled this year as his father 's regime was collapsing . He had offered to negotiate an end to the war with the rebels in Libya after his father 's troops lost control of Tripoli , but appeared later to change his mind . Saadi Gadhafi 's lawyer , Nick Kaufman , said he spoke with his client Wednesday . "" There is absolutely no truth whatsoever to the allegation that , since fleeing Libya where his life was in grave danger , Saadi Gaddafi has attempted to flout the restrictive measures placed on him by the international community , "" Kaufman said . The alleged plot , however , would have been hatched while Saadi Gadhafi was still in Libya , before he fled to Niger . Wednesday 's announcement appeared to have been spurred by an investigation into the plot by the Canadian newspaper National Post . The newspaper spoke with the CEO of a Canadian security company who said he was involved in the alleged plan to move Saadi and his family to Mexico . Gary Peters , CEO of Can / Aust Security and Investigations International , told the paper that the plan was to be carried out with the approval of the Mexican government , which was to have supplied the documentation . Mexico contradicted that version with its own allegations Wednesday . The National Post article mentioned Varnier , whom it identified as a Canadian consultant who traveled to Libya in July on fact - finding mission with Peters . Two of the men who helped secure the private jet used for the trip were among those arrested with Varnier , the paper reported . The Canadian government confirmed the arrest of a Canadian in connection with the case and said Canadian consular officials in Mexico City and in Ottawa were providing assistance as required . Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou had reaffirmed his country 's decision to grant asylum to Saadi Gadhafi , saying he should be allowed to stay and be treated like other Libyan refugees . Libya 's National Transitional Council has blasted that stance . A businessman , Saadi Gadhafi ran the Libyan Football Federation before the unrest began . He played soccer for Perugia in Italy for one season .

"Her attorney , Brett McArthur , told CNN Tuesday night that Rogers had agreed as part of an arrangement to turn herself in , in exchange for a personal recognizance bond . "" She did not have to post any money "" to be released , McArthur said , adding that his client pleaded not guilty to the charge of lying to police . "" She maintains her innocence . This has been kind of a kick in the gut as a victim to turn around and be charged , "" McArthur said . In a news release , police cited DNA and pathologists ' examinations that did not substantiate Rogers ' original statements , and changes in her story during the investigation . "" These were serious allegations that garnered national attention and spread fear among local citizens , "" the police statement said . "" A great deal of time and resources were spent investigating Charlie Rogers ' claims in hopes of identifying and arresting the three suspects in this case .

"" It leads to a bigger problem in our society that someone would do this . "" Rigatuso said she hopes people would not turn their backs on Rogers now . The vigil she put together in Omaha raised more than $ 1,800 , all of which was deposited in an account for Rogers . "" We 'd like to get the funds returned to us so we can establish our own fund to support victims of anti - gay violence . "" Rigatuso said Tuesday . McArthur , Rogers ' attorney , said he "" knows nothing "" about the fund or how much money might be in it . He said it was in place before he became Rogers ' lawyer . According to the Lincoln Police Department complaint , Rogers , 33 , provided information "" she knew to be false "" with the intent to "" instigate an investigation of an alleged criminal matter . "" Rogers reported to police that she was lying on her bed when the alleged attackers held her down and carved "" derogatory words "" into her arms and abdomen and "" a cross "" in her chest .

"After "" The Help "" took home a surprise win at the SAG Awards , the race for Best Picture has narrowed to that film and "" The Descendants "" and "" The Artist , "" both big winners at the Globes . For the next few weeks , until the close of Academy voting on the Sunday before the Oscars , the studios and distributors behind those three pictures -- Disney , 20th Century Fox and The Weinstein Company , respectively -- will be aggressively wooing the Academy 's 6,000 members into their camps . As in a political campaign , you simply can not win an Oscar without spending money . It does n't matter who spends the most , but it does matter who spends it best . One of the better campaigns of the past five years was the 2010 win for the little war flick that could : "" The Hurt Locker . "" Despite its critical acclaim and high - quality cinematography and script , it was the lowest - grossing best picture winner of all time , competing against the highest - grossing movie in recent history , "" Avatar . "" Besides quality , of course , what did it have going for it ? One hell of an Oscar campaign . Its studio , Summit Entertainment , was flush with vampire money from the "" Twilight "" series . Oscar watchers , including studio executives , film journalists and fellow Oscar campaigners , told me that Summit spent between $ 3 million and $ 5 million for the campaign , which consisted mainly of hiring consultants to spin "" Hurt Locker "" and "" Avatar "" in a battle of good versus evil within the press . "" Hurt Locker "" actually lost out to "" Avatar "" in the Globes race , and that might have been a well - timed boon for the small flick . It positioned it perfectly as the underdog going into the home stretch of the campaign . Besides the cachet of an Oscar win , the successful campaign typically pays for itself in dividends . In the nine months after "" The Hurt Locker 's "" Oscar win , the film sold more than $ 31 million worth of DVDs in the United States , 214 % of its U.S. box office gross of $ 14.7 million . That 's what makes Oscar campaigning more than a $ 100 million - a - year cottage industry within the movie industry . Persuading members of the Academy to first nominate your film and then vote for it is tremendously similar to how political operatives get candidates elected . There is no single strategy for a successful Oscar campaign , but momentum is key . Peak too early and excitement peters out ; peak too late and you 've spent millions of dollars without enough time to get voters invested . Building momentum involves racking up accolades and awards from individual guilds and film festivals before the nomination voting in January . This year Weinstein is making sure "" The Artist "" gathers momentum at just the right time . It took home a Golden Globe and its lead actor , Jean Dujardin , brought home a Best Actor SAG . But it has yet to peak . How is momentum built ? And why does it cost millions ? After all , word of mouth is free",2.946527814301429,0.9077513688808484,0.4261295914737171,0.06896800202386258,0.6875338790317377,0.6470272450343423,0.1457975986277873,0.1783876500857633,0.10806174957118353,0.09777015437392796,0.09262435677530018,0.0137221269296741,0.0823327615780446,0.03430531732418525,0.0548885077186964,0.05317324185248713,0.015437392795883362,0.0411663807890223,0.030874785591766724,0.04288164665523156,True,233.0,0.8284734133790738,4.102915951972555,583.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010090817356205853,0.0,0.0,0.0,73.37199512195123,7.91446829268293,9.791249743138472,10.636227642276424,10.37085365853659,10.112032520325204,40.61495934959349,4.12,17.06369768024853,25743627.53938358,44157.165590709395,4.662601626016261,4.0,2.3804726719941938,19.68,16.0,11.678082034306831,1.3414634146341464,1.0,0.6480648905164109,492,260,0.5284552845528455,2392,25,76
""" "" Expect it to move very slowly , "" said James Franklin of the National Hurricane Center . "" The large size of the system and its slow motion will mean a long - lasting event with two to three days of impacts . "" At 8 p.m. ET Friday , forecasters said Sandy was about 400 miles south - southeast of Charleston , South Carolina , heading north at 7 mph . It was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph . It 's possible , the hurricane center says , that Sandy may weaken to a tropical storm . Nonetheless , experts said , it 's not to be taken lightly . Keep a hurricane preparation checklist "" Forget about the category with this , "" said CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano . "" When you have trees with leaves on them still , this kind of wind and rain on top of that , you 're talking about trees that are going to come down , power lines are going to be out and the coastal flooding situation is going to be huge . "" Sandy 's death toll in Haiti , Jamaica and Cuba this week was 21 people . The U.S. target area is hard to predict at this point . Some landfall computer models show the storm striking somewhere between the border separating North Carolina and Virginia north to Connecticut , some of the most densely populated areas of the country . The District of Columbia , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Virginia and New York have declared states of emergency , while Maine 's governor signed a limited emergency declaration . The National Hurricane Center reported tropical storm watches and warnings were in effect , covering parts of the Florida and Carolina coasts . With a national election already under way in many early - voting states , Sandy 's wrath could have a ripple effect on politics . In Virginia Beach , a campaign rally scheduled for Sunday for GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was canceled because of Sandy . There was no word yet on the status of other events scheduled later in the week . "" We 're keeping an eye on it , "" said a senior campaign adviser . How Sandy was dubbed ' Frankenstorm ' Similarly , Vice President Joe Biden canceled his visit to Virginia Beach on Saturday , "" out of an abundance of caution to ensure that all local law enforcement and emergency management resources can stay focused on ensuring the safety of people who might be impacted by the storm , "" according to the campaign of President Barack Obama . Bad weather in Maryland or Washington , D.C. , could make it harder for people to get out and cast their ballots . Early voting kicked off Monday in Washington and is scheduled to start Saturday in Maryland . But Friday , Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley warned that his state 's early voting could be affected by the pending storm , leaving open the possibility that the vote could be rescheduled",2.3315061810673963,1.205344444852139,0.38596298065633095,0.17567964991717433,0.5768990714592898,0.5895951977404563,0.12884615384615383,0.18653846153846154,0.10961538461538461,0.075,0.1326923076923077,0.028846153846153848,0.10384615384615385,0.025,0.04423076923076923,0.038461538461538464,0.01730769230769231,0.057692307692307696,0.015384615384615385,0.03653846153846154,True,204.0,0.8596153846153847,4.303846153846154,520.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00544069640914037,0.008705114254624592,0.0,0.0019230769230769232,71.62616756756759,7.680994594594598,9.791249743138472,10.167063063063063,10.204391891891888,10.940090090090084,42.30954954954955,4.36,15.247060663369206,4185181.6390663916,8048.42622897383,4.831081081081081,4.0,2.4852407033899593,17.76,16.0,13.276385050155785,1.385135135135135,1.0,0.683034254301573,444,255,0.5743243243243243,2238,25,77
"Indeed , it seems there is an international consensus that there is no appetite for Western "" boots on the ground "" ( besides a very limited presence to secure national assets ) . If there were to be any intervention , therefore , it seems likely it would take the form of "" targeted strikes "" from the air -- be they via drones , jets or missiles . And we are told that in that case , the focus would be exclusively on "" ISIS strongholds "" in order to "" minimize civilian casualties . "" Removed from the rhetoric of politicos , though , Western intervention would bolster the propaganda efforts of ISIS , for any attack would inevitably kill or injure Muslim civilians , regardless of how well it had been planned or how good the intelligence behind it was . This would be good news for ISIS . Indeed , the group actually relies on its ability to attribute civilian casualties to its enemies . By doing so , it bolsters the skewed jihadist narrative of international politics and presents an opportunity to exaggerate the non - existent "" Crusader threat "" and defend the group 's false legitimacy . In short , the more civilians that die , the more events in Iraq can be internationalized , and the wider the appeal of ISIS can become . This effect would be grossly amplified if there were deaths at the hands of the U.S. or the UK . After all , one of the central tenets of the jihadist narrative is the so - called "" War on Islam . "" Through this much abused paradigm , any international involvement in a conflict involving Muslims is used by jihadists to fortify their ever - tenuous relevance in the modern world . And even were we to set aside all of the above , we still could not in any way justify intervening against ISIS in Iraq but not against Assad in Syria . Rightly or wrongly , this would be read by the region 's most vulnerable as incontrovertible evidence that the West will only intervene when its own economic prosperity is at stake . Why else would it defend the rights of civilians here and not against Assad after his apparent use of chemical weapons ? The West must ignore Baghdad 's plea for military assistance . We must not play into the jihadists ' hands . Instead , we must focus on humanitarian assistance for refugees and diplomatic pressure on al - Maliki to force him into profound and far - reaching reforms . In the long term , the only solution there can be is a political one : Iraq 's economically and politically marginalized Sunnis need to be brought back into Iraq 's decision - making process . But even if it is not our place to carry out military action , this is not to say that military intervention is categorically inappropriate . Indeed , if the Iraqi national army can not pull itself together , I would argue it is absolutely necessary . However , it must be at the hands of a Sunni Muslim - majority country , in order to diffuse the narrative of Western armed forces once again attacking Muslims . If a country like Turkey or Jordan acts against it , ISIS 's "" War on Islam "" rhetoric would not have anywhere near the same impact . Leaving its operational and strategic capacity to regional players , the West 's focus needs to be on ISIS 's ideological heart . We need to undermine its greatest rhetorical asset : that Muslims , worldwide , are under attack by the "" Crusading "" West . This can only be achieved with a policy of restraint .",3.0355131307021783,0.6827992188018399,0.42558505334214713,0.057974481635608394,0.8155549342433611,0.809064753677534,0.12636505460218408,0.14508580343213728,0.10452418096723869,0.07956318252730109,0.062402496099843996,0.0483619344773791,0.0904836193447738,0.028081123244929798,0.08892355694227769,0.06396255850234009,0.0234009360374415,0.07332293291731669,0.0015600624024961,0.06396255850234009,True,314.0,0.8705148205928237,4.299531981279251,641.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0088339222614841,0.0,0.0,0.0,56.8359090909091,10.79727272727273,12.756391145488433,13.963636363636363,12.315018181818182,11.249600000000001,47.45454545454545,5.6,19.255221088358976,230375487.10650104,359400.1358915773,4.829090909090909,4.0,2.744228504087192,22.0,23.0,8.059776671843954,1.509090909090909,1.0,0.889795222053975,550,286,0.52,2756,25,78
"The following is an edited transcript . CNN : How has writing about Elvis Cole and Joe Pike changed over the course of the series ? Crais : I really strive to bring something new to each book . I do n't want to write the same book over and over again . I 've done Elvis books ; I 've done Joe books ; I 've done mixed books , but this time , I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50 - 50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles . When I discovered this particular story , it just seemed a perfect way to do that . Part of the book , they 're working together . Then there 's Elvis ' track through the story , and there 's Joe track , where he 's trying to find Elvis and save him . So it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage . CNN : In "" Taken , "" the story jumps between several points of view and moves back and forth in time . How difficult was it to put together ? Crais : It was like a crazy puzzle that kept changing . You should have seen my office . I have these huge black foam boards on the wall , and tacked to them , I have these white punch cards with my story ideas , scenes and notes . I kept juggling these cards and amending them , making little scrawls on them . Notions came to me , things changed , and I literally shuffled them around like a deck of cards , trying to bring them all into focus so the events were as exciting as I could make them . CNN : How do you start a novel ? What comes first , an idea , an image , a scene ? Crais : It could be any of the above , but it 's usually an image , almost always driven by a character moment . In "" Taken , "" it was the notion of Krista Morales and her hunger to know more about her mother 's experience that night in the desert . I just saw her . It was literally my first image in the book . I saw her staring out into the black desert sky with this open - eyed wonder , trying to see the path her mother took to get to this country . All I had was her face in the moonlight , staring out there , and I just knew whatever she 's looking for , I want to find . That was the engine that really kicked off the rest of the book . CNN : "" Taken "" revolves around a kidnapping on the U.S.-Mexico border by bajadores . What prompted you to write about these bandits ?",2.2656655427634744,0.8539893076692343,0.4402797955600818,0.06838288105559395,0.48270129964783276,0.48328099625983406,0.13111545988258316,0.15655577299412915,0.08023483365949119,0.09393346379647749,0.03718199608610567,0.03131115459882583,0.13894324853228962,0.029354207436399216,0.043052837573385516,0.13111545988258316,0.01761252446183953,0.05283757338551859,0.003913894324853229,0.050880626223091974,True,258.0,0.8551859099804305,3.62426614481409,511.0,0.0,0.027130139889783807,0.01526070368800339,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007630351844001695,0.011869436201780416,0.01271725307333616,0.0019569471624266144,92.53868020108278,3.9211206496519715,6.88968998030894,6.953163186388244,5.008600154679041,6.178097447795821,24.807501933488012,1.5,16.8351334462965,20483565.635894094,40085.25564754226,4.088167053364269,4.0,1.9593606916851771,14.366666666666667,12.0,11.097997817424346,1.1786542923433874,1.0,0.47499815481277746,431,214,0.4965197215777262,1852,30,79
"Officials said the disruptions resulted in a backlog of of work to get through , cost workers shifts and wages , and caused a negative ripple effect for people up and down the West Coast . Port of Oakland Executive Director Omar Benjamin suggested the Occupy movement should focus on "" real solutions to the problems plaguing our economy . "" On a normal night , several hundred people would be working the graveyard shift , port spokesman Isaac Kos - Read told CNN . "" What has this accomplished ? "" he asked . "" This is disrupting the 99 % . "" The Occupy movement has rallied against what it describes as corporate greed while asserting that the nation 's wealthiest 1 % hold inordinate sway over the remaining 99 % of the population . Oakland Mayor Jean Quan concurred with Kos - Read , saying the Occupy movement is n't thinking of the consequences of its actions and whom it is actually hurting . "" They are saying ... they have to get the attention of the ruling class . I think the ruling class is probably laughing and people in this city will be crying this Christmas , "" Quan said . "" It 's really got to stop . "" Oakland has been a flash point of the Occupy movement since October when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown . One demonstrator , a Marine veteran of the war in Iraq , suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile , according to a veteran 's group ; police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers . The International Longshore and Warehouse Union -- which represents 15,000 dockworkers -- has distanced itself from the protest movement . The union "" shares the Occupy movement 's concerns about the future of the middle class and corporate abuses , "" ILWU President Robert McEllrath wrote to locals last week -- but he urged the movement to stay out of its dispute with the port of Longview , Washington , and warned against "" outside groups attempting to co - opt our struggle in order to advance a broader agenda . "" In Washington , D.C. , on Tuesday , three people claiming ties with the Occupy movement blocked the main door of House Speaker John Boehner office . The men , who said they were in the 120th hour of a hunger strike , sat together with stickers that read "" Taxation without representation "" taped over their mouths .

"I knew nothing about it , "" he said in a studio appearance for a live call - in show hosted by New Jersey 101.5 . The fresh response came amid a new allegation from a former top adviser caught up in the scandal , David Wildstein , that "" evidence exists "" that Christie knew about the closures and resulting traffic gridlock over five days in Fort Lee in real time , which would , if true , contradict his account of events . On CNN 's "" Piers Morgan Live "" Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich said he believed Christie but thought the governor should sign a sworn statement backing up his claims . "" I take it him at his word but it would appear from the polls that a lot of folks do n't , "" Sokolich said . Why is this important ? Christie 's recollection ultimately may be critical in answering why the bridge lanes overseen by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey were closed in the first place and who authorized it for sure -- and whether any laws were broken . E - mails and political figures in New Jersey have suggested the gridlock was a bit of orchestrated political payback for the Fort Lee mayor , who did not endorse Christie for re - election last November . A state legislative committee is investigating as is the Justice Department , which would be interested if there was any abuse of power . Both have subpoenaed Christie 's office for documents , and he said his office is complying . Christie 's office also has hired a private law firm to investigate . And why is Wildstein important ? It has been suggested in the e - mails released by state legislative investigators in New Jersey that Wildstein , a top Christie appointee at the Port Authority , carried out the closures . He also has been subpoenaed , refused to answer questions from legislative investigators , and he 's got a lawyer . For his part , Christie has fired a top aide linked to what has metastasized into a political scandal coming on the heels of a successful re - election and prior to a possible White House bid . Others have left their jobs as the scandal unfolded , including Wildstein . Former deputy chief of staff Bridget Ann Kelly , whose e - mail to Wildstein -- "" Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee "" -- weeks before the gridlock occurred led to her firing by Christie in January , refused on Monday on constitutional grounds to comply with a state legislative subpoena to turn over documents , a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN 's Chris Frates . State lawmakers leading that investigation said they are reviewing the matter and "" considering our legal options with respect to enforcing the subpoena . "" Christie , in the radio interview , repeated what he said at a January news conference -- challenged by Wildstein in a letter written by his lawyer to the Port Authority on Friday -- about the timeline around when he became aware of the traffic mess . He also denied having any knowledge of a suggested political motive . Who 's who in the bridge scandal Christie blasts Wildstein "" The first time that this really came into my consciousness , as an issue "" was when an e - mail from Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye "" was leaked to the media and reported on . "" Foye was the person , according to e - mails , who started asking questions about the lane closures and ordered them reopened . That 's when Christie said he asked his chief of staff and his chief counsel to "" look into this and see what 's going on here . "" He said any reference to",3.048159021565875,0.9959298975194687,0.44450355235521943,0.06238409727143534,0.7266027240649514,0.7117720503698696,0.10757575757575757,0.18787878787878787,0.11969696969696969,0.08787878787878788,0.11212121212121212,0.01818181818181818,0.12424242424242424,0.024242424242424242,0.051515151515151514,0.07424242424242425,0.024242424242424242,0.051515151515151514,0.0030303030303030303,0.013636363636363636,True,290.0,0.8833333333333333,4.283333333333333,660.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008605851979345954,0.01549053356282272,0.0,0.0030303030303030303,63.61846835075494,10.32739547038328,11.698219412168324,13.32973286875726,12.888524970964,10.877003484320557,48.306910569105696,5.833333333333333,17.714203867684983,49337937.5629927,74754.45085301924,4.7473867595818815,4.0,2.645873481684082,23.916666666666668,22.0,14.674003846561062,1.4059233449477353,1.0,0.761005044037707,574,274,0.47735191637630664,2827,24,81
"Dozens rush over to witness , Jafra is the first to arrive . The woman who has discovered the specimen uses an ice pick to prod the earth and dig a hole about six inches in diameter . She then lifts a clump of earth up and sifts out the specimen . The crowd gossips about its value -- "" it 's small , only 300 rupees ! "" ( about $ 3 ) . A middle man will offer her that amount , then walk it to a market in Tibet and sell it for three times the price . Jafra explains : "" We pay attention when other people find them . This is our first time coming for the harvest . We 've been here for nearly a week . We have n't found anything , because we do n't know what they look like -- we do n't know what we 're looking for . "" See also : Himalayan glaciers ' buck melting trend ' Like many others , Ram and his brothers traveled for the harvest betting on hope alone . "" People in our village talked about the money to be earned , so we came , "" he says . The rumors of riches are not baseless . According to experts , the market value of yartsa gunbu has increased by 900 % between 1997 and 2008 . One study says 500 grams of top quality yartsa gunbu can sell for up to $ 13,000 in Lhasa , Tibet , or up to $ 26,000 in Shanghai . Average annual income in Nepal 's rural mid - and - far - western hills , where many harvesters live , is just $ 283 , according to the government . Police in Dolpa expect 40,000 people to migrate to the district this year . The influx of migrant harvesters speaks volumes to the increasing global commodification of yartsa gunbu . Prized in traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicinal practices for its power as an elixir or an aphrodisiac , in recent years commercial dubbing of the product as "" Himalayan Viagra "" has driven up both demand and market value around the world . But the unprecedented flood of harvesters has observers concerned about the environmental impacts of this informal economic boom . "" Look at the hills , "" says Gyalpo Thandin , a student in Dolpa , "" they 're all torn up from people digging . By next year they 'll be deserts . "" Thandin , who was visiting home for the harvest , remembers when the yartsa gunbu season meant local bounty , not commercial competition . "" Just five years ago the numbers were lower , "" he says . "" Every year we see more people come and more grasslands get damaged . People who come hack at the land with tools and leave it to dry out . "" He says his family 's yaks have died in recent winters due to depleted grass caused by the harvest . See also : Bringing Nepal 's ghost town back to life Environmental protection measures offer some hope . Six years ago , a committee of community leaders in Dolpa instituted a taxation system on harvesters in an effort to control numbers and ensure the local community remained resilient amidst environmental changes . The committee charges locals 1,000 rupees ( $ 11 ) and outsiders 3,000 rupees ( $ 33 ) to join the harvest . The system is intended to spend the money on environmental protection measures and to subsidize food for villages in the district . Similar systems exist in harvest areas across the Himalayas . However , some worry the measure is ineffective . A former committee member who spoke on the condition of anonymity suggests that charging admission to the harvest has only made it seem even more valuable , and as a result , drawn more harvesters . "" The goal of the system was to charge people and therefore limit the number who would want to come for the harvest , but putting a price on the entry might actually be encouraging more people , "" he says . A leading expert on Himalayan caterpillar fungus , ecologist and geographer Daniel Winkler , believes the future of the harvests is contingent on many factors -- collection intensity , rainfall , and climate change among them . "" Centuries of collection indicate that caterpillar fungus is a relatively resilient resource , "" he says . But his research suggests that over - harvesting is contributing to fewer fungal spores being around for the next season . Winkler believes",2.4962926280688995,0.9209687470782888,0.4373237632779013,0.11474354999657153,0.6165450524538756,0.6057477553303425,0.1361323155216285,0.2099236641221374,0.10687022900763359,0.08269720101781171,0.04071246819338423,0.029262086513994912,0.12086513994910941,0.029262086513994912,0.06997455470737914,0.05597964376590331,0.010178117048346057,0.04580152671755725,0.024173027989821884,0.030534351145038167,True,324.0,0.8346055979643766,4.190839694656488,786.0,0.0,0.022069641981363415,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006620892594409024,0.014713094654242276,0.010789602746444336,0.015267175572519083,70.81500659195784,7.417494323591889,10.154140820990676,10.22128469933348,9.004338606899584,10.232732732732728,38.616274811396764,3.6341463414634148,22.964646380181748,9406308142.902897,11967313.158909539,4.737237237237237,4.0,2.5043555201580547,16.24390243902439,15.0,9.385459661820116,1.412912912912913,1.0,0.7744502544515325,666,351,0.527027027027027,3294,41,82
"Google reported $ 16.86 billion in revenues for the last quarter of 2013 alone . One way it makes money from Gmail is by automatically scanning and indexing messages and using the data it mines to show relevant ads to its users . "" The basic premise of Gmail is , we 'll give you a robust e - mail service and in exchange we want to display ads alongside our e - mail and we 're scanning your e - mail to decide what ads are most relevant , "" said Eric Goldman , a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law . Scanning and ads Gmail looks for keywords that identify topics of discussion based on things such as frequency and context , then matches the e - mail up with related ads . A conversation thread about meeting up at a spinning class , for example , might trigger an ad for a weight - loss product . Data gathered through e - mail scanning can also be used to create user profiles for future ad targeting . What many consumers do n't consider is that companies such as Google can create a comprehensive profile of each user based on information from different products such as search , maps , e - mail and Google+ , its social network . "" Nothing in life is free , and as a result it is important for people to understand what value they bring to a free service of any kind , "" said Behnam Dayanim , a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings LLP in Washington . When people send and receive messages using a free e - mail service , they are sharing details about their interests , who their connections are and what their finances look like . That information might seem mundane on the surface , but when extracted and organized , it 's incredibly valuable to marketers and advertisers . All the major e - mail providers , including Microsoft Outlook and Yahoo , benefit one way or another from offering a free service . The provider might serve up general or targeted ads , generate a user base for marketing other services , or just use the e - mail service to build brand recognition . And while Gmail may have popularized it , targeted ads based on user data has become the primary business model for many tech companies . It 's how social media companies such as Facebook and search engines such as Bing make money as well as a huge number of apps that scrape contact and location information from users . It 's also led to a number of similar privacy lawsuits against other companies , including LinkedIn , Yahoo and Facebook . Any company that collects personal information has to advise its customers what it is doing with their information and comply with any relevant privacy laws , Dayanim said . These are usually laid out in the lengthy terms and conditions and privacy policies that customers barely skim before hitting "" agree . "" However , many of the details about how exactly Google 's program works have been kept confidential . And critics say the service does n't adequately disclose what it is doing with customers ' information . Legal action When Gmail made its debut in 2004 , it was upfront about the fact that it would show contextual ads targeted to match the topic of e - mail threads . People still lined up to be accepted as early beta users of the service because it was slickly designed , included ample amounts of storage , and was excellent at filtering out spam . And it did n't cost anything to sign up . One problem is that not all the people affected have agreed to Google 's privacy policy . One group of plaintiffs in a recent class - action lawsuit were non - Gmail users who sent messages to Gmail accounts . Google responded that non - Gmail customers had no expectations of privacy when sending e - mails to people who did use the service . Google has defended its e - mail scanning program by pointing out that",3.015872275781209,0.4845900867021071,0.4416099216352825,0.04328685447853536,0.8134317803382873,0.7895484355588754,0.09845288326300984,0.25035161744022505,0.10970464135021098,0.06188466947960619,0.05063291139240506,0.02390998593530239,0.12517580872011252,0.0379746835443038,0.06469760900140648,0.06469760900140648,0.01969057665260197,0.05625879043600562,0.011251758087201125,0.02390998593530239,True,303.0,0.8874824191279888,4.30801687763713,711.0,0.0,0.011131725417439703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00954147892923403,0.023323615160349854,0.012721971905645375,0.004219409282700422,63.31916153846157,10.399400000000004,11.807384569943707,13.455384615384617,12.910862769230768,10.835136000000002,50.75846153846154,6.423076923076923,18.49849345408446,108092019.43105052,152028.156724403,4.7392,4.0,2.489173228202489,24.03846153846154,21.5,9.464430452329514,1.408,1.0,0.7188435156555284,625,308,0.4928,3063,26,83
"Despite the eulogy , Battams said we have to wait for the Hubble Space Telescope or other telescopes to confirm ISON 's fate . "" It seems unlikely at this stage that anything of significant size remains but Hubble observations would help clear that up , "" Battams told CNN in an e - mail . NASA also hinted there may be a bit of hope for ISON in its latest update posted online Wednesday . The agency said it will use space telescopes to monitor ISON for the next several weeks because it 's possible that dust is hiding a new , smaller version of it . "" Most agree that up to 90 % of ISON was destroyed , leaving approximately 10 % of the comet intact . If previous sungrazing comets are any guides , there may be a sizeable piece of comet nucleus left . At this point , though , scientists are waiting for a variety of telescopes to make observations before the status of Comet ISON can be confirmed . "" 2 . What do we call ISON now ? "" I do n't think there is an official term yet , "" Battams said . "" I have been referring to it as a comet remnant , and that seems pretty appropriate . "" 3 . ISON was n't a flop . Okay , it wo n't be a "" Great Comet "" or the "" Comet of the Century . "" But ISON did become a social media superstar and it gave scientists tons of data . "" It 's disappointing that we did n't get a spectacular naked - eye comet , "" Matthew Knight of Comet ISON Observing Campaign said in a NASA science article . "" But in other ways I think Comet ISON was a huge success . The way people connected with Comet ISON via social media was phenomenal ; our Comet ISON Observing Campaign website earned well over a million hits ; and I had trouble downloading images near perihelion because NASA 's servers were swamped . "" So maybe ISON was the ' Comet of the New Century , ' "" he said . NASA deep - sixes Deep Impact comet hunter 4 . ISON wo n't be forgotten . ISON 's fate has become a near obsession for a special Facebook group set up by physicist and astronomer Padma Yanamandra - Fisher with the Space Science Institute and the ISON observing campaign . More than 300 members have been tracking the comet and sharing amazing pictures . Many are still looking for ISON 's remains and they are n't ready to declare it dead . "" I think the evidence shows that something catastrophic happened to the comet , but I do n't think anyone is 100 % sure , "" said Yanamandra - Fisher . "" Ground - based observations and orbiting telescopic observations , such as Hubble Space Telescope , later in December are important . "" 5 . But wait , there 's more ! Believe it or not , ISON is not the only comet ! "" There are several comets to enjoy right now , "" Battams says . He likes Comet Lovejoy ( discovered by Australian amateur astronomer Terry Lovejoy ) , Comet Encke and Comet LINEAR .

"Alec Gagneux was handing out flyers and speaking softly to interested passers - by . Of all the criticisms leveled at Davos , its elite nature is the biggest gripe . Like other such pow - wows of the powerful , the lack of access to this minute sphere of massive influence has in past years stirred up visible dissent around the venue itself . At the height of the Occupy movement in 2012 , protesters even camped in igloos near the heavily fortified conference center . Davos this year was oddly quiet though . Like the bitter cold that can often grip this mountain resort in January , protests were noticeable by their relative absence . There was a small group from Ukraine attempting to draw attention to their predicament on Friday , but little to really catch the eyes of the delegates safely cocooned behind the venue 's ring of security . Gagneux 's disparate group had been gathered via the internet , but while they had made it to Davos they were still a long way from the action . "" This is the only thing that was possible , "" Gagneux said . "" It is absolutely taboo to go further towards the center where the people ... are meeting from the World Economic Forum . "" I asked him why he and his fellow protestors were here . Just like the delegates at the other end of the street , growth and inequality were on his mind too . "" The 2015 goal is to halve extreme poverty , "" he told me , "" but we do n't talk about ( the fact ) that we have to halve extreme riches as well . "" Gagneux 's primary concern was for the long term impact of growth . The flyers he handed out quoted the economist Kenneth Boulding : "" Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist . "" "" The planet is limited , "" Gagneux told me . "" In 30 years or in 70 years we have four times more cars , pollution , resources that are exploited , and future generations ' family will have nothing . "" He had been at Davos the entire week , and had been coming to the town for the past 12 years . "" This evening I will make another gathering , "" he told me . He planned to make what he called a "" thought stone "" representing WEF organizer Klaus Schwab . "" Mr Schwab ( is ) a very important person in Davos , but actually we are all the same , including the animals and the plants , "" he said . Why had Gagneux left his protest until the end of the week , and not staged it while the Forum was in full swing , I asked . "" Most of the people still have to work during the weekdays , so Saturday is the easiest way for people ( who are not from ) Davos to come here .

"Jump on the Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong , head straight for domestic departures , where I would then board a flight to Tacloban -- a flight of little more than an hour . Except it was n't . TYPHOON TRACKER : Follow Hagupit Planes ... 10:30 a.m. came and went with no sign of a boarding call . I began to meet other journalists waiting for the same flight who were equally at a loss as to what was happening . We were eventually approached by a Philippines Airlines manager , apologizing profusely . "" Technical difficulties "" had apparently grounded the aircraft but we were assured there would be another flight at 1.30 p.m. All other flights to different parts of the Philippines were on schedule , so we were confident about this next take - off time . But as the time approached , no boarding call came . A brief announcement informed us the flight was canceled because of continuing "" technical difficulties . "" And so it went . Another airlines staff member presented us with new boarding passes for a 3.45 p.m. flight . Fifteen minutes before departure we were sitting patiently on the airport bus waiting to be taken out to the apron and it looked as if we would finally be on our way . But the bus did n't move . We sat for 30 minutes until another announcement of another delay . We trudged back to the boarding gate , very frustrated . Other routes were being discussed but all ferries had been canceled and the direct flight still looked the best bet . More than an hour later we learned that all flights were canceled because of the weather conditions in Tacloban . We appeared to be stuck where the story was n't . Blades ... And so to Plan B. A hasty conference call with the Hong Kong news desk and a new plan : Charter a light aircraft . Initial indications were good . A private operator thought they could get a few of us into Tacloban at first light Saturday . The final decision on weather conditions would be made at 4 a.m. At the appointed time the news came through : Conditions were too dangerous to risk it . Another call to Hong Kong and we decided that it could be possible to fly to Cebu and take the short hop to Tacloban by helicopter . I boarded my flight at 11 a.m. and was on the island inside the hour to be met by the helicopter crew . I knew I was in good hands when I met my pilot , retired military man Col . Andy Largo . His flying career included flying four former Philippine presidents around the country , as well as the late Pope John Paul II . He had already flown two sorties that morning to Tacloban but my anxieties grew as he described the flights . He was forced to touch down early on both journeys because of the conditions -- and they were growing worse by the hour . The biggest worry , he said , were strong wings that could literally break the rotor blades . If we encountered excessive winds he would reduce the flying speed and edge ahead , waiting for a break in the weather . I was his only passenger but he took along an engineer to help "" just in case . "" I buckled into the front seat next to Col . Largo and off we went into a murky cloud - filled sky . It was surprisingly smooth . We flew at between 1,000 and 2,000 feet over a white - capped sea , towards increasingly thick clouds . Our pilot seemed unworried until we got to the tip of Leyte Island and the town of Beybey , which lies at the foot of a range of mountains separating us from Tacloban . One look at the cloud ahead and he tapped me on the arm and indicated the flight had come to an end . We put down on a playing field and I jumped out . And automobiles .. I was soon surrounded by a group of locals , who managed to rustle up a van . Ten minutes later we on the road driving along a virtually deserted road in heavy rain , towards the mountains and Tacloban . It took two hours to make the 100 kilometer ( 62 mile ) journey . At 4 p.m. , 31 hours after touching down in Manila , I finally arrived at my destination .",2.312585935040638,0.9136183280538209,0.44431455614124465,0.12124248358626245,0.6007654370462641,0.5717432349717811,0.10025706940874037,0.17866323907455012,0.12210796915167095,0.09897172236503857,0.05141388174807198,0.016709511568123392,0.11696658097686376,0.032133676092544985,0.061696658097686374,0.07969151670951156,0.019280205655526992,0.056555269922879174,0.02313624678663239,0.042416452442159386,True,375.0,0.884318766066838,4.092544987146529,778.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006059075990911386,0.0,0.0,0.002570694087403599,80.914718585605,5.580729017216644,9.408791572840183,9.136884265901484,6.71119141559063,8.229268292682928,35.61122070779531,3.0625,22.395829360941157,5325803136.585999,6845505.316948584,4.433285509325682,4.0,2.447482170695679,14.520833333333334,15.5,8.210738860717036,1.3142037302725968,1.0,0.6407820982010143,697,340,0.4878048780487805,3184,48,86
"On Saturday mornings , artisanal food and hipster fashion fill the second and third floors of a parking garage . The entrance is down an alley off DeBeer Street and then up a ramp , but the way is marked and decorated with lights . It should n't be a struggle to find the entrance , just follow the crowds of Beautiful People who come every week for lunch . For shoppers , there are cured meats , rustic breads , endless cheeses , cut flowers and raw chocolates . For diners , it 's a straight shot toward the back for a tray of raw oysters with champagne . Those who prefer their food cooked can head across the way for the best fried chicken in the city ( served over watermelon and fries ) . On chilly days there 's a potjie , a cast iron cauldron brimming with stew . Up the stairs is an open - air level with seating that overlooks the neighborhood 's pricey new condos and the tangle of train tracks leading to South Africa 's main rail hub . A bit higher up is the fashion level , where racks of leather jackets hang alongside children 's dresses printed with Nelson Mandela 's beaming smile . The Braamfontein neighborhood pulls a curious mix of people . One of the country 's most prestigious universities is nearby , along with the Joburg Theatre complex ( 158 Civic Boulevard St. , Johannesburg ; +27 11 877 6800 ) and the headquarters of some of the country 's biggest corporations . A decade ago , Braamfontein felt like it had slipped irretrievably into urban decay . Now it 's one of the most dynamic neighborhoods in the city . The people who pack into the market are the lifeblood of the small shops and galleries on the surrounding streets , which now do most of their business on Saturdays selling photos taken by street kids , vintage clothing and high - design furniture . On the east end of downtown , the weekly market at Arts on Main ( 268 Fox St. , Johannesburg ; +27 11 334 5947 ) opened five years ago in a century - old building that was originally a liquor warehouse . Inside there now , there are craft beers and cocktails to sip every Sunday while shoppers wander aisles of food as cosmopolitan as the city itself . There 's the option of sitting on a stool in a sunny courtyard and enjoying Ethiopian coffee , then moving on to an Argentine barbeque and Italian gelato . If that does n't suit , keep walking to find paella , burritos , dim sum and crepes . This is also one of the city 's best places to sample food from around South Africa . The traditional bread known as roosterkoek cooks on the braai barbecue , waiting to be stuffed with vegetables and meat . Nearby is a table of curries from Durban , which can be served as "" bunny chow "" inside the hollowed end of a loaf of bread .

""" She is a figure that has contributed much to cross - cultural communication , "" Deng Jianglei , director of the cartoon , "" Princess Fragrant , "" told CNN . The animation is set to become a television series at the end of 2015 , and a film the following year . Deng 's company , Shenzhen Qianheng Cultural Communication Company , won a tender to create the 3 - D animation last year , as part of a campaign by Xinjiang authorities to promote social harmony among China 's different ethnic groups and raise awareness of the folk customs of the Uyghurs . During a visit to the province in June , Deng and his colleagues were inspired by the natural beauty and rich culture of Xinjiang -- a region the size of Iran that shares borders with eight countries . "" The cultures there and the folk arts are exquisite . But the place 's economy is less developed . So we wanted ... to help them promote their cultures , "" he said . But appealing to both Han and Uyghur audiences may prove a challenge . Princess or sex slave ? Selecting a musician to compose the theme song , for example , took over a year , China 's Global Times reports , because it was difficult to find a composer who was familiar with both Han and Uyghur traditions . Then there are the alternative versions of the Uyghur girl 's story . Although the legend of Fragrant Concubine has become a symbol of national unity for many Chinese , modern Uyghur interpretations of the tale portray her as an imperial sex slave who was murdered by the emperor 's mother after stubbornly rejecting the emperor 's advances . Deng said he wants the series to be entertaining while also fulfilling "" political needs . "" "" ( The cartoon ) is a re - understanding of the friendship between Han and Uyghurs , which is especially significant to the re - education of the children and teaching them to accept different cultures . "" His animation company , working in collaboration with the government of Kashgar , has plans to show the cartoon in China and abroad , especially in Islamic regions . Xinjiang has a long history of ethnic unrest . Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward the Han Chinese in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment by security forces , discrimination and a lack of economic opportunities . Muslim separatists have been held responsible for a series of recent deadly attacks , with Chinese authorities launching an anti - terror campaign in May . Measures to end the violence have ranged from executing convicted terrorists to banning beards and Islamic dress in some areas . But authorities have not ignored the role of soft power . "" It is similar as fighting a war in the realm of ideology . If we do n't pass on positive energy , the opposite side would occupy the battlefield , "" Sheng Jun , a deputy director of cultural industry office at the Xinjiang Bureau of Culture told The Global Times . Finding common ground , however , was difficult even among the animators .

"He then gave a partial recap , using PowerPoint slides , of how the two intelligence programs work . Alexander said the NSA can collect metadata on phone calls in the United States , including the date and time of the call , the numbers involved and the length of the conversations . He made a special point of saying the NSA does not have access to the content of citizens ' calls or text messages . Top senator questions need to collect phone records Alexander said the NSA 's PRISM surveillance program , which probes digital activity such as e - mail , instant messaging and Web searches , focuses on foreign actors and does not apply to people in the United States . He said the phone and Internet data is necessary to "" connect the dots "" and identify potential terrorists before they act . Alexander attempted to reassure the audience that NSA officials are not abusing access to the databases to intrude on Americans ' privacy . "" The assumption is that people are out there just wheeling and dealing ( users ' information ) , and nothing could be further from the truth , "" he said . "" We have tremendous oversight and compliance in these programs . "" Congress and courts make sure the programs operate within the bounds of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , and internal auditing systems are in place to prevent any abuse by employees , Alexander said . He added that only 35 analysts are authorized to run queries on the phone metadata . Alexander made no mention of a report in Wednesday 's Guardian newspaper about the existence of another secret NSA program , called XKeyscore . According to documents provided to the Guardian by Snowden , XKeyscore allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing e - mails , online chats and the browsing histories of millions of people . CNNMoney : NSA chief to hackers : If you do n't like what we do , change it Alexander denied accusations that the NSA programs allow the government to collect all online data on everyone .

The answer is no , "" said the security chief before looking out at the auditorium thick with hackers and joking , "" You may be able to . "" Aside from a couple jokes , Alexander 's words were serious and measured , and he seemed unfazed by a smattering of heckling from the audience during his hourlong talk .

"Credit the strong leadership of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid with keeping a remarkably diverse Democratic Congress together . When you can keep a strong conservative like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia on the same page with the powerfully progressive Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota , you are definitely winning . Meanwhile , the GOP , whose members range from conservative to ultraconservative , is at war with itself and its leaders . Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas led the fight on the Senate floor to block consideration of the funding bill . But after a pointless 21 - hour talkathon , the majority of his GOP colleagues rejected Cruz 's strategy . Senate Republicans split badly and bitterly ; 25 voted against Cruz while just 19 voted with him . In the House , it is chaos . The Neanderthals are fighting the Cro - Magnons and the Homo erectus tough guys are fighting the australopithecines . Which side is more mainstream ? A majority of voters do n't like the Affordable Care Act -- although that 's a bit misleading , because a percentage of them dislike it because they think it does n't go far enough . I like it -- in fact , I love it -- but that 's not the point of this column . Obamacare clocks in at just 29 % support in a recent CNBC poll . So you 'd think that the Republicans ' position of repealing the ACA would be more mainstream . But you 'd be wrong . That same CNBC poll shows that Americans oppose defunding Obamacare , with only a little more than one - third of voters saying they want it defunded . They want to mend it , not end it . What 's worse for the Republicans , when the question shifts to whether you support shutting down the government and/or defaulting on U.S. debt in order to kill Obamacare , the GOP position loses by a crushing 59 to 19 percentage points . When you 're down to just 19 % of your countrymen and -women supporting your crusade , it 's time ( as we say in Texas ) to pee on the fire and call the dogs : The hunt 's over . That is , no doubt , why the House Republicans have retreated to their new position : delaying Obamacare for a year rather than outright defunding it . But health care delayed is health care denied , and it 's a bit of a reach to demand a one - year delay in the president 's top domestic priority in exchange for funding the government for 10 weeks . Which side is more reasonable ? It is hard to seem reasonable when you are pursuing a strategy that even conservative Republicans like Sen. Richard Burr called "" the dumbest idea I 've ever heard of . "" Keep in mind this is from a man who represents North Carolina , where the Republicans proposed a law barring federal courts from interpreting the Constitution , and allowing the North Carolina Legislature to declare a state religion .

"He took the reins in 2000 from Gates , whom he became friends with at Harvard University in the 1970s . Ballmer earned a degree in mathematics and economics . Gates , of course , did n't graduate . But he seemed to do OK without a degree . Ballmer 's years leading Microsoft were sometimes turbulent ... When Ballmer took over as CEO , Microsoft was the most valuable company in the world . But the company went on to lose more than half of its market value over the course of a decade . Investors have been critical of Ballmer for failing to anticipate the mobile computing revolution . ... but there were also great times . During Ballmer 's tenure , Windows 7 was the fastest - selling operating system of all time , and Microsoft 's cloud and enterprise businesses have stayed strong over the past decade . According to Microsoft , the company tripled its revenue and doubled profits under Ballmer 's leadership . He retired in February and has been spotted at Clippers games since . He 's really animated . Just watch how he takes the stage for a corporate presentation . "" Come on ! Get up ! "" Ballmer screamed at one gathering as he danced and leaped across the floor . "" Whoooooo ! Come on ! Give it up for me ! "" By the time he took the podium , he barely had enough breath to say , "" I love this company ! "" So much so that he 's ripped his vocal cords . Perhaps it 's not surprising , then , that Ballmer has damaged his voice during his public displays of affection ( for Microsoft ) . According to The New York Times , Ballmer once shouted '' Windows ! Windows ! '' so furiously at a sales meeting in Japan that he ripped his vocal cords , requiring surgery . He 's from Motown but has a soft spot for LA . Ballmer 's dad , Fred Ballmer , was a manager at Ford Motor Co. in Detroit . The son excelled academically there and became valedictorian of his high school class . But he has reason to cheer for the Clippers . "" I love basketball . And I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that the Clippers continue to win -- and win big -- in Los Angeles , "" Ballmer said in a statement after making his offer . "" LA is one of the world 's great cities -- a city that embraces inclusiveness , in exactly the same way that the NBA and I embrace inclusiveness . "" Ballmer was n't the only bigwig eyeing the Clippers . A group that included media moguls David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey also made a bid of $ 1.6 billion for the Clippers , a source told CNN . This is n't his first time trying to buy an NBA team . Ballmer 's purchase of the Clippers would still have to be approved by 75 % of the NBA 's 30 owners . Last year , the owners denied the sale of the Sacramento Kings to a group that included Ballmer . That sale would have resulted in the Kings moving to Seattle , and the league 's relocation committee recommended keeping the team in Sacramento . But with all the talk about changing ownership of the Clippers , Ballmer 's fate this time may turn out differently .

"And yet we could n't allow ourselves to be emotional on the stand . "" We could n't allow ourselves to show emotion , although I 'm sure some came through , and I 'm very , very proud of my peers and my jurors that were with us because they did a fantastic job of holding it together . "" That stoicism in the face of emotional testimony disappeared in the jury room , he said . Zervakos said the 32 - year - old defendant simply did not fit his image of a murderer . "" When you look at a young woman and you think of the crime , and then you see the brutality of the crime , it just does n't wash , "" he said . "" It 's very difficult to divest yourself from the personal , from the emotional part of it . "" Though the jury did not believe Arias ' story that she killed Travis Alexander in self - defense , Zervakos said he believed Alexander abused her . "" I 'm very sure , in my own mind , that she was mentally and verbally abused , "" he said . "" Now , is that an excuse ? Of course not . Does it factor into decisions we make ? It has to . "" Zervakos said Arias ' 18 days on the stand hurt her case . "" She was not a good witness , "" he said . "" There were so many contradicting stories . "" But he expressed sympathy for her ability to endure her time on the stand . "" I think the way the prosecutor was with her -- he 's known for an aggressive style -- I think it was very hard , I think it would be difficult for anybody . "" A retrial for the penalty phase will begin on July 18 , Judge Sherry Stephens said . Jurors had deliberated since Tuesday on whether Arias should get a death sentence for the 2008 murder . A source with knowledge of the jury 's vote said there was an 8 - 4 split in favor of sentencing Arias to death . Jurors refused to talk to reporters and immediately left the courtroom . The hung jury brought to a close a chapter in the high - profile case , which has lasted for months . But the trial is n't over . In many states , the death penalty would be off the table if the jury could n't agree . Not Arizona . In a written statement , Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said prosecutors "" will proceed with the intent to retry the penalty phase . "" "" We appreciate the jury 's work in the guilt and aggravation phases of the trial , and now we will assess , based upon available information , what the next steps will be , "" he said . Emotions ran high in the courtroom as the jury 's deadlock was announced . Arias appeared to be on the verge of tears . One of Alexander 's sisters sobbed .

"Unlike her aforementioned reality show judge counterparts , Spears joins the Fox singing competition still riding the success of her seventh studio album , and her worldwide "" Femme Fatale Tour . "" Even the star 's personal life appears to be more in order these days . But the pop princess has n't exactly been accessible to her fans since she was placed in a conservatorship in 2008 . And as stars like Lady Gaga and Beyonce have figured out , there 's more to being a singing sensation in 2012 than meets the ear . Fans want to relate to their favorite artists on a personal level , said Andy Greene , an associate editor at Rolling Stone . Becoming a mainstay on a show like "" The X Factor , "" and showing off her personality each week , could reignite the level of fame Spears experienced in the early 2000s , Greene added . Referencing the way Lady Gaga uses Twitter to stay connected to her fans , which she often calls her "" little monsters , "" Greene said , "" ( Gaga ) is part of their daily life , while Britney is not . And her handlers are realizing they have to loosen the reins a bit . "" Even Beyonce has opened up to her fans since the birth of her daughter , Blue Ivy , joining Twitter and giving an intimate glimpse of her offstage life via her Tumblr page . Though Spears has used social platforms to share pictures of her two sons and announce her engagement to former manager Jason Trawick , she 's come off as a sort of "" Stepford "" pop star of late , Greene said . "" She walks around like a robot . People ca n't relate to that , "" he said . "" This could prove to be a whole new phase of her career . Britney 4.0 . "" And lucky for Spears because , with a reported $ 15 million contract to appear on "" X Factor , "" this move is likely less about the money than it is about rebuilding her image . "" Britney off the cuff does n't exist , "" said Phil Gallo , Billboard 's senior correspondent for film and TV . "" It 's really been a while since we 've heard her give any kind of expansive commentary . "" To that end , there 's a risk involved , because "" the No . 1 dangerous thing that could happen , "" Gallo said , "" is if the artist does n't appear genuine . You have to feel like that 's Britney saying what Britney wants to say . It ca n't feel scripted , like she has someone in her ear telling her what to say . "" While "" The X Factor "" played hardball in the ratings game last fall , fluctuating from 8.5 to 12.5 million viewers each week , the singing competition underwhelmed critics thanks to Simon Cowell 's prediction that anything less than 20 million in viewers would be unacceptable . However , with Spears at the judges ' table , ratings probably wo n't be a concern , Gallo said . If the show starts pulling "" Idol""-like numbers , he added , "" it will be driven by , ' What did Britney say ? ' ' What is Britney going to say ? ' Out of the gate , that 's what it is .

"Teachers wants additional money to teach the additional hours . Chicago mayor takes strike fight to court Q. Why are teachers objecting to evaluations tied to performance ? A. The union says student performance is directly linked to conditions in the home or neighborhood , making it unfair for teachers to be punished if students do n't do well in the the classroom for those reasons . Q. How many jobs will be lost under the evaluation plan ? A. As many as 6,000 teachers could lose their jobs under the evaluation system , according to CTU President Karen Lewis , who has called the system "" unacceptable . "" The mayor 's office , the city and school officials have questioned that job - loss figure . Q. How many school closings are being talked about ? A. The teachers union says 200 schools will be closed , but Marielle Sainvilus , a spokeswoman for Chicago Public Schools , calls the claim "" false , "" asserting that union leaders said recently that 100 schools would close . "" I 'm sure it 'll be another number tomorrow , "" she said . Q. What is the status of the strike ? A. The Chicago Teachers Union will make no decision Monday . They are taking the day off for Rosh Hashanah , the Jewish New Year . Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is vowing to go to court to force teachers back to work , calling Sunday 's actions by the union "" a delay of choice that is wrong for our children . "" He announced in a statement that he 's asked city lawyers to file an injunction in circuit court to "" immediately end this strike . "" My view : From the picket lines Q. What 's next ? A. The House of Delegates , a group of 800 union representatives , will reconvene Tuesday afternoon , at which point delegates could decide to end the strike . If they do , classes would resume no earlier than Wednesday . The rank - and - file of the Chicago Teachers Union would still have the opportunity at some point to accept , or reject , the proposed contract . But as of Sunday , Lewis said a "" clear majority "" of union delegates did not want to suspend the strike given the proposed contract , saying "" they are not happy with the agreement . "" Q. How many teachers are in the union and how much do Chicago teachers make ? A. The Chicago Teachers Union represents 26,000 teachers . Chicago has the nation 's third - largest school system with some 35,000 students , and its teachers are among the highest paid in the country . The median base salary for teachers in the Chicago public schools in 2011 was $ 67,974 , according to the system 's annual financial report . Q. What sort of raise are they being offered ? A. The pay structure would change with a 3 % pay hike for the first year of the contract , 2 % for the second year and 2 % for the third year . If a trigger extends the contract to four years , teachers would get a 3 % pay increase . Union members would no longer be compensated for unused personal days , health insurance contribution rates will be frozen",2.0484946638549424,1.2972344224511112,0.343735150324521,0.19852732967579412,0.3487286683909285,0.323970117153866,0.12041884816753927,0.24607329842931938,0.08726003490401396,0.1012216404886562,0.07504363001745201,0.027923211169284468,0.10645724258289703,0.015706806282722512,0.04712041884816754,0.03315881326352531,0.02268760907504363,0.07155322862129145,0.02268760907504363,0.020942408376963352,True,230.0,0.8481675392670157,4.167539267015707,573.0,0.0,0.02095302467049679,0.02095302467049679,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009462656302805001,0.01622169651909429,0.0,0.0034904013961605585,76.37300765123575,5.903531678317833,8.918530864059932,8.403831122364727,7.229900919249189,9.465336048879834,35.06253096273463,2.891891891891892,16.103074709861207,9850913.104942678,17191.820427474133,4.676171079429735,4.0,2.435945682456919,13.27027027027027,10.0,10.422555189765642,1.3828920570264767,1.0,0.678467623583141,491,246,0.5010183299389002,2388,37,94
"A judge ruled Wednesday that the officers will stand trial in the beating death last July of Kelly Thomas , a 37 - year - old homeless man afflicted with schizophrenia . Cpl . Jay Patrick Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force . Officer Manuel Ramos faces the more serious charge of second - degree murder , because prosecutors believe he took a more active role in the assault . Both officers have pleaded not guilty . This week , at the preliminary hearing to determine whether enough evidence supports proceeding with a trial , prosecutors aired a graphic video of the savage beating . The footage shows about a half dozen officers punching and kicking and putting pressure on Thomas ' chest , firing electric shocks from a Taser stun gun , all to supposedly subdue a suspect well beyond the point where he is resisting or capable of resisting arrest . Early on , Ramos appears to tell the young man who is sitting on the ground : "" You see my fists ? They 're getting ready to f--- you up ! "" Another police officer is heard saying : "" We ran out of options so I got to the end of my Taser and I ... smashed his face to hell . "" By the end of the video , Thomas is lying in a pool of blood . According to prosecutors , the young man suffered brain injuries , facial fractures , broken ribs and extensive bruises and abrasions . He died five days later . What we see in that 33 minutes of footage , including a defenseless Thomas screaming in pain , saying he 's sorry and pleading for help , should never happen in the United States of America . When it does happen , it ca n't be tolerated , justified , or excused . That 's coming from the son of a retired cop . My father wore a badge for 36 years , and he has no stomach for police brutality . In fact , about 20 years ago , when another piece of videotape surfaced -- that of the Rodney King beating by police officers in 1991 -- I remember my father telling me that , as far as he was concerned , those out - of - control law enforcement officers wailing on King had ceased being cops and become little more than thugs and criminals .

"They were making plans to schedule a meeting with affected residents . "" It really is a loss , and there is a grieving process that has to take place , "" said Steve Cox with the Colorado Springs mayor 's executive team . The FBI 's Denver office , meanwhile , said it was working with other agencies to determine whether any of a dozen wildfires across the state resulted from criminal activity . Nearly 1,000 firefighters tried to corral the 15,517 - acre blaze that moved into Colorado Springs . Gov. John Hickenlooper told CNN 's "" John King USA "" that the number of evacuations grew Wednesday to 36,000 . "" We 're still fighting with everything we 've got , "" he said . Harvey said progress had been made in some portions of the Waldo Canyon Fire , and firefighters were taking an aggressive stance against hot spots . "" It 's been house to house , door to door , street to street , hill to hill activity , "" he said of one location . Higher humidity and cloud cover Wednesday night might aid firefighting efforts , but there was no guarantee conditions would not be similar to Tuesday 's conflagration , Harvey told reporters . Some rain did fall Wednesday on a separate fire burning near Boulder , Colorado , according to the National Weather Service . President Barack Obama will travel to the Colorado Springs area Friday to survey the damage and thank responders battling the blaze , the White House said . The Waldo Canyon Fire captured attention because of its proximity to landmarks such as Pikes Peak and the Air Force Academy , and also to Colorado Springs , a city of about 400,000 , the state 's second largest . "" We have rehearsed and practiced disasters , "" said Dave Rose , public information officer for El Paso County , which includes Colorado Springs . "" We have never seen one like this before . "" Winds gusting to 65 mph through mountain canyons blew the wildfire through containment lines into northwest Colorado Springs on Tuesday afternoon . It roared downhill , burning to the ground the Flying W Ranch , a popular Western - style tourist destination . CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen likened conditions to a double - edged sword . While temperatures were down a bit Wednesday , high - based thunderstorms will be fed by rising air , wind and low humidity , he said . Such storms produce lightning and rain , but dry air will suck up most of the precipitation before it hits the ground . Lightning can reach the parched soil and possibly ignite additional fires , according to Hennen . Open Story : iReporters share their harrowing views of the western wildfires Richard Brown , the Colorado Springs fire chief , on Tuesday described the Waldo Canyon Fire as a "" firestorm of epic proportions . "" Stan and Darlene Colbert were among the last families in the evacuation zone to pull out . They waited , hoping the fire would subside , but after watching the flames from their back porch , they knew it was time to go . The first things the couple -- married 43 years -- packed were the family photos . "" Every one of them I could find . Every photo because I ca n't replace those , "" said Darlene Colbert . Many residents waited anxiously to get word of whether their homes had been spared . Becky Schormann was one . Her family managed to take some sentimental items with them when they left , but still had to leave behind a boat , a pair of ATVs , a china cabinet and an antique doll collection . "" I keep telling myself : It 's going to be OK , "" she said . Schormann told CNN that flames came to within 20 feet of their home but were beaten back . "" Our volunteer fire department is just awesome , "" she said . The Schormanns are staying in an RV at their daughter 's home . The family 's two dogs , a pony and a donkey also came along for the ride . The flames came dangerously close to the Air Force Academy 's main campus , and an",2.523860971243386,1.1494818849807642,0.43800303346712577,0.14508889269042613,0.5841844773769994,0.5640793824568391,0.14032697547683923,0.17983651226158037,0.08719346049046321,0.08174386920980926,0.12534059945504086,0.02861035422343324,0.12125340599455041,0.025885558583106268,0.04632152588555858,0.05858310626702997,0.01226158038147139,0.05040871934604905,0.01634877384196185,0.025885558583106268,True,283.0,0.8487738419618529,4.267029972752043,734.0,0.0,0.007246376811594203,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007763975155279503,0.006211180124223602,0.0,0.006811989100817439,74.38334708737867,6.722555016181232,10.298539674758413,10.257669902912623,9.159077669902913,10.827831715210351,39.560032362459545,3.725,21.77005200729049,2848481856.268612,3880765.471755602,4.854368932038835,4.0,2.4544040081881766,15.45,15.0,8.902106492285968,1.3802588996763754,1.0,0.723662876525337,618,358,0.5792880258899676,3132,40,97
"The former House speaker told the congregation that President Washington would not have apologized "" to those who are killing us . "" Now , besides the fact Obama did not apologize "" to those who are killing us "" or that our generals also apologized for the mistake or that the Lord 's Prayer asks God to forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us -- I 'm trying to figure out who , besides a "" Jeopardy ! "" contestant , whips out a George Washington card in the first place ? That 's the problem with Gingrich and the other GOP challengers . It seems they have mistaken their base 's fervor to defeat Obama for a fervor to hear them pander . Remember Gingrich 's moon base speech while he was campaigning near NASA ? Or Mitt Romney quoting "" America the Beautiful "" while in Iowa , saying : "" If you count corn as an amber wave of grain , why , you have them right here . What a wonderful place this is . "" Seriously , who says that ? The GOP 's once credible attacks on the president 's record have morphed into an incredible attack on the country 's intelligence . That change is reflected by Obama 's double - digit lead over the GOP field . While "" amber waves of grain "" is pretty bad , I thought Romney showing up in Michigan last fall saying , "" The trees are the right height . The grass is the right color for this time of year , kind of a brownish - greenish sort of thing . It just feels right , "" was as low as pandering could go . Then he showed up in Detroit a couple of days ago and repeated that the "" trees are the right height . "" Hurling out chunks of red meat at a rally is a longstanding practice . Massaging a position to suit the polls , or support the party , is something voters do n't like , but we understand the rationale . But telling a crowd you love their trees and dead grass ? Ridiculous . Granted , some of us are gullible enough to give each other high - fives because Rick Santorum called Obama a snob for promoting a college education . But the rest of us look at "" Slick Rick 's "" college degree , law degree and MBA , the fact that he 's sending his kids to college and owns at least six properties , and has earned millions , and wonder -- What is he talking about ? Virtually every socioeconomic study looking at the intersection of income and education shows a direct correlation between the two .

"Earlier Tuesday , U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki - moon congratulated Libya 's transitional leadership on the apparent success of that country 's revolution , ushering in a post - Gadhafi era for the North African nation as part of the international body . "" For Libya , this is a historic day , "" said Ban , who directed that the country 's new flag be presented alongside the U.N. flag amid a standing ovation from those in attendance . The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to accept the credentials of the country 's new leadership after rebels last month all but ousted Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi after more than four decades in power . "" I am sure you saw your new flag this morning , flying so proudly outside this building , "" the U.N. chief said . The rebuilding of Libya and the Palestinian quest for statehood are expected to be the dominant topics this week as world leaders converge on the United Nations in New York for the 66th annual session of the General Assembly . On Tuesday , Ban met with Mustafa Abdul Jalil -- head of Libya 's ruling National Transitional Council -- to discuss the deployment of a support mission to be run by British diplomat and U.N. envoy Ian Martin . The mission is thought to largely center on post - conflict planning , with particular focus on security - building and electoral assistance . But American participation , the U.N. chief says , is instrumental in supporting the new government , noting challenges facing transitional leadership as it confronts pockets of resistance and the specter of Gadhafi , who remains at large . U.S. President Barack Obama vowed to continue to protect Libyan civilians for as long as they remained threatened by the former regime , pledging to reopen the American embassy in Tripoli later this week . "" Six months ago , as his tanks approached Benghazi , Gadhafi predicted that his opponents would be slaughtered like rats , "" said U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague . "" But he had not counted on the courage of the Libyan people , the principled stand of the Arab League and the resolve of the international community . "" Hague said he sought to send to a clear message to the former dictator and his remaining supporters that "" their time is up , "" adding that the unfreezing of Libyan assets will help pay for the country 's critical services . Tuesday 's Libya summit at the U.N. General Assembly was billed as an event designed to give world leaders a chance to figure out ways to help Libya rebuild from the battle against their former leader . The meeting was in stark contrast to two years ago , when Gadhafi gave a rambling General Assembly address where he floated conspiracy theories , urged probes into U.S. military activities and took aim at the structure of the Security Council itself . Meanwhile , the international body also focused on what it described as an alarming increase in global desertification , and wrapped a two - day meeting on noncommunicable diseases , now the world 's leading killer . It is only the second time a health issue has been debated at a special meeting of the General Assembly , following the group 's pledge to take on AIDS a decade ago . Delegates unanimously approved a "" political declaration """,3.502560689300903,0.7121767798425538,0.44136654970246375,0.06636340836024811,0.8185004256665707,0.8096067349116007,0.10481099656357389,0.19072164948453607,0.10996563573883161,0.10309278350515463,0.12027491408934708,0.03951890034364261,0.10824742268041238,0.018900343642611683,0.08075601374570447,0.037800687285223365,0.01718213058419244,0.03264604810996564,0.006872852233676976,0.029209621993127148,True,223.0,0.8951890034364262,4.597938144329897,582.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01473748848633712,0.01289530242554498,0.0,0.0,48.70465073529414,13.948069852941178,14.385316635316524,17.20330882352941,17.500796185661763,13.019140624999999,61.75827205882353,9.529411764705882,16.444546318006743,13860398.706385294,23815.11805220841,5.068359375,4.0,2.7473735404654405,30.11764705882353,33.0,8.421836832908745,1.5078125,1.0,0.8148628503274339,512,289,0.564453125,2676,17,99
""" It 's the appearance of arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in concrete situations , "" she added . But with so many programming choices on broadcast , cable and satellite TV , "" All the government is asking for is a few ( broadcast ) channels where you can say -- they are not going to hear the s - word , the f - word . They are not going to see nudity , "" Chief Justice John Roberts said . The court 's ruling , which will come in a few months , could establish important First Amendment guidelines over explicit content on the airwaves . The Justice Department had filed an appeal , and helpfully provided the justices with a DVD of a 2003 episode of the now - canceled "" NYPD Blue "" on ABC in which a naked woman was shown . The content of that program is central to the ongoing legal dispute . Lawyer Seth Waxman representing ABC said the FCC 's tough action against the network was "" a shot out of the blue . "" A federal appeals court last year for a second time struck down the government policies , concluding they were vague and inconsistently applied . Pending fines against the broadcasters were dismissed . ABC , CBS , NBC and Fox are all parties in the case . Controversial words and images have been aired in scripted and unscripted instances on all the major over - the - air networks in the past eight years , dating back to when the FCC began considering a stronger , no - tolerance policy . The policy became known as the Golden Globes Rule , for singer Bono 's 2003 acceptance speech at the live awards show on NBC , where he uttered the phrase "" really , really , f --- ing brilliant . "" The commission specifically cited celebrities Cher and Nicole Richie for potty - mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards , which aired live on Fox . Richie , in an apparent scripted moment said , "" Have you ever tried to get cow s -- t out of a Prada purse ? It 's not so f --- ing simple . "" Justice Stephen Breyer dryly noted the language from the two women "" seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary . "" That drew laughter in the courtroom . The CBS complaint involved dirty language on "" The Early Show , "" a news and interview program . The high court two years ago ruled in favor of the FCC on the issue of "" fleeting expletives , "" concluding federal regulators have the authority to clamp down on broadcast TV networks airing isolated cases of profanity . The court , however , refused at the time to decide whether the commission 's policy violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech , ruling only on the agency 's enforcement power . The justices ordered the free - speech aspect to be reviewed again by a New York - based federal appeals court , which subsequently ruled in favor of the broadcasters . The Justice Department , in its new appeal , lumped both the expletives and nudity cases together , saying the court should decide the free speech questions as one . Explicit language is heard with greater , albeit varying , frequency on cable television , the Internet , and satellite radio , which do not use public airwaves . But the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints of "" indecent "" language and images on broadcast television and radio , which is subject to greater regulation .
