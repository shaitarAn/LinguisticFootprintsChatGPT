"The findings of this study suggest that there is an interference between students ' value beliefs in English and their value beliefs in French and German . Specifically , students who held higher value beliefs in English in Grade 9 experienced steeper decreases in their value beliefs for French and German from Grades 9 to 11 . However , students who had stronger increases in their value beliefs for English over time also had stronger increases in their value beliefs for French and German . Additionally , the study found that multilingual students initially had higher value beliefs in French and English compared to their monolingual peers . However , these multilingual students also showed steeper decreases in their value beliefs for French and English over time . These results highlight the importance of considering motivational interactions in the context of multiple language learning . It suggests that students ' value beliefs in one language can have an impact on their value beliefs in other languages . Furthermore , it suggests that multilingual students may face unique challenges in maintaining their motivation for multiple languages . The implications of these findings for teaching practice are significant . Educators should be aware of the potential interference between languages and strive to create an environment that supports students ' motivation in all languages they are learning . Additionally , strategies should be implemented to help multilingual students maintain their motivation for multiple languages over time . Further research in this area is needed to better understand the specific mechanisms underlying these longitudinal associations between value beliefs in different languages . By gaining a deeper understanding of these interactions , researchers can continue to inform teaching practices and support students ' motivation in multilingual contexts . Overall , this study suggests that the value beliefs students hold in English can impact their value beliefs in other languages , particularly French and German . Multilingual students may face unique challenges in maintaining their motivation for multiple languages . Educators should be aware of these potential interferences and create an environment that supports students ' motivation in all languages .

"Title : Framing as a Bridging Concept for Climate Change Communication : A Systematic Review Based on 25 Years of Literature Introduction : Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time , requiring effective communication strategies to engage and inform the public . The concept of framing has gained significant attention in recent years as a powerful tool for understanding and shaping public discourse on climate change . Framing refers to the process by which individuals and organizations select , emphasize , and interpret certain aspects of a topic , while downplaying or excluding others , in order to influence public opinion and policy decisions . While there has been a proliferation of studies on framing in climate change communication , the lack of clear definitions and inconsistent use of terminology have hindered the synthesis of theoretical and empirical insights . This systematic review aims to address this gap by examining the trends and patterns of framing in climate change communication over the past 25 years . By comparing frames across different frame locations , including frame production , frame content , audience frames , and framing effects , this review seeks to harness framing 's potential as a bridging concept in climate change communication . Drawing on a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches , this review analyzes a comprehensive dataset of 275 peer - reviewed articles on the framing of climate change . By analyzing the content of these articles , the review aims to identify the key themes , theories , and methodologies used in framing research in the context of climate change . Additionally , the review explores how framing has been employed as a means to bridge different perspectives and foster a more comprehensive understanding of the issue . Despite the growing body of literature on framing in climate change communication , our preliminary findings suggest that there is a missed opportunity to fully utilize framing 's potential as a bridging concept . This review aims to shed light on this conceptual ( mis)fit between frame locations and provide directions for future research in order to enhance the effectiveness of climate change communication . By synthesizing and analyzing the existing literature on framing in climate change communication , this review seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how framing can be utilized as a bridging concept in addressing the challenges of climate change . The findings of this review will have important implications for researchers , practitioners , and policymakers involved in climate change communication . By identifying the gaps and limitations in current framing research , this review aims to provide recommendations for future studies that can enhance the effectiveness of communication strategies on climate change . The remainder of this paper is organized as follows . Section 2 provides an overview of the theoretical foundations of framing and its relevance to climate change communication . Section 3 describes the methods used in conducting the systematic review and selecting the articles for analysis . Section 4 presents the results of the content analysis , including the key themes and trends identified in the literature . Section 5 discusses the implications of these findings and proposes directions for future research . Finally , Section 6 concludes the paper by summarizing the main findings and highlighting the importance of framing as a bridging concept in climate change communication .",2.638552522163488,0.4371741574369368,0.48730385955625194,0.05475248565205085,0.9057961733717668,0.9068055119779375,0.11052631578947368,0.3105263157894737,0.14035087719298245,0.15087719298245614,0.012280701754385965,0.012280701754385965,0.02280701754385965,0.03859649122807018,0.05789473684210526,0.08421052631578947,0.010526315789473684,0.021052631578947368,True,212.0,0.9017543859649123,5.28421052631579,570.0,0.14018430605975984,0.09131527506283162,0.09131527506283162,0.06143535325328121,0.030717676626640603,0.0,0.05473331471655962,0.07037140463557666,0.06059759843619101,0.0017543859649122807,32.55769230769235,15.177307692307693,15.579741850924794,17.70769230769231,18.380769230769232,16.532307692307693,67.34615384615384,10.75,16.656532715155645,17133269.48434423,30058.367516393384,5.6923076923076925,6.0,3.2760110684657433,26.0,25.5,8.23407554009556,1.748076923076923,1.0,1.0741705896277842,520,213,0.4096153846153846,3012,20,4
"Section 1 : Introduction 1.1 Background Francoprovençal is a non - standardized Gallo - Romance language that is highly endangered . It is spoken in the Swiss region of Valais and the Aosta Valley in Italy . One notable feature of Francoprovençal is the use of partitive articles ( PAs ) , which are determiners that generally have an indefinite interpretation . These PAs are often correlated with the presence of the invariable preposition "" de "" . 1.2 Research Gap Previous literature on Francoprovençal has provided a basic subdivision of the language into two types , Francoprovençal A and B. However , the existing research has not fully explored the fine - grained spatial distribution of PAs and their correlation with the invariable preposition "" de "" . This study aims to fill this gap by conducting a spatial analysis of PAs and de in the Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal . 1.3 Research Objective The main objective of this study is to provide a more nuanced understanding of the spatial distribution of PAs and de in Francoprovençal . By presenting several maps based on fieldwork data from Valais and the Aosta Valley , we aim to demonstrate that the distribution of these elements is more complex than previously reported in the literature . 1.4 Hypotheses Based on preliminary observations , we hypothesize that the presence of PAs in Francoprovençal A is dependent on the syntactic context . On the other hand , in Francoprovençal B , the presence of PAs is limited to specific areas , where singular and plural PAs do not occur together . Additionally , we hypothesize that there is no correlation between phonologically overt plural marking on nouns and the absence of PAs , but there may be a correlation between overt sigmatic number marking on nouns and the absence of PAs . 1.5 Significance of the Study Understanding the spatial distribution of PAs and de in Francoprovençal contributes to our knowledge of the language 's morphosyntactic features . This study not only challenges the existing basic subdivision of Francoprovençal but also sheds light on the factors influencing the presence or absence of PAs . This research has implications for the documentation and preservation of endangered languages and provides valuable insights into the linguistic diversity of the Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal.1.6 Structure of the Paper This paper is organized as follows . In Section 2 , we provide a brief overview of the linguistic background of Francoprovençal , including its historical development and current endangered status . Section 3 discusses the theoretical framework and previous research on partitive articles and their potential correlates . Section 4 describes the methodology used in this study , including data collection and analysis .

"This study aimed to examine the relationship between preschool children 's multimodal imitation skills and their narrative performance and sociopragmatic abilities . Previous research has mainly focused on the importance of imitation skills in infants for language development , but there is limited research on the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors in later stages of development . A total of thirty - one typically developing 3- to 4 - year - old children participated in this correlational study . They were assessed on four tasks : multimodal imitation , object - based imitation , narrative abilities , and sociopragmatic abilities . Multimodal imitation involved imitating gestures , prosodic features , and lexical components , while object - based imitation focused on imitating objects . The children 's narrative abilities were assessed through storytelling tasks , and their sociopragmatic abilities were measured by evaluating their ability to use appropriate social and pragmatic language in various contexts . The results of the study showed a significant relationship between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschoolers . However , there was no significant relationship between object - based imitation skills and these language and sociocommunicative skills . This suggests that preschoolers ' imitation of socially relevant multimodal cues , including gestures , prosody , and verbal linguistic patterns , is strongly associated with their language and sociocommunicative development . Based on these findings , it is important to broaden the conceptualization of imitation behaviors in the field of language development . Instead of solely focusing on object - based imitation , researchers and practitioners should consider the integration of prosodic , gestural , and verbal linguistic patterns in their assessments and interventions . By recognizing the significance of multimodal imitation skills , we can better support preschool children 's language development and sociocommunicative abilities . By incorporating multimodal imitation tasks into early childhood education programs , teachers can provide opportunities for children to practice imitating gestures , prosody , and verbal linguistic patterns . This may enhance their narrative skills and sociopragmatic abilities , ultimately promoting their overall language development . In conclusion , this study highlights the importance of preschool children 's multimodal imitation skills in relation to their narrative performance and sociopragmatic abilities . By recognizing and fostering these skills , educators and researchers can contribute to the optimization of language development in young children . Additionally , future research could further explore the specific mechanisms through which multimodal imitation skills influence narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschoolers . Understanding these underlying processes may provide valuable insights for the development of targeted interventions and educational strategies aimed at enhancing language and sociocommunicative skills in young children . Overall , the findings of this study emphasize the significance of considering multimodal imitation as an integral component of language development and highlight the potential benefits of incorporating multimodal imitation tasks into early childhood education programs . These tasks can provide valuable opportunities for young children to practice and develop their imitation skills , ultimately supporting their language and sociocommunicative development . By expanding our understanding of imitation behaviors and their impact on language skills , we can better support the overall development of preschool children .",2.836800120319122,0.506968799525906,0.47529471757592456,0.056049095945816654,0.8998445510864258,0.8939196718366522,0.06133828996282528,0.3048327137546468,0.10780669144981413,0.10594795539033457,0.007434944237918215,0.03903345724907063,0.020446096654275093,0.05390334572490706,0.13011152416356878,0.10594795539033457,0.026022304832713755,0.027881040892193308,False,177.0,0.8884758364312267,6.0241635687732344,538.0,0.22075172048703018,0.19851773425092642,0.1296982530439386,0.06934886183165696,0.04235044997353097,0.0,0.04764425622022234,0.04446797247220752,0.02541026998411858,0.022304832713754646,10.718249299719929,17.395378151260505,18.599290044081553,22.007843137254902,21.319824929971993,22.11470588235294,74.97759103641457,11.857142857142858,13.790986519489017,975774.2325117359,1813.70675188055,6.670168067226891,7.0,3.467501094058894,22.666666666666668,21.0,5.3214152551234255,2.046218487394958,2.0,1.242611097173158,476,184,0.3865546218487395,3241,21,6
"These findings suggest that vowel quality in ALM dialects has a significant influence on the respective varieties of SSG . The transfer of vowel quality from ALM to SSG is most pronounced in Chur and Brig , where the SSG vowels closely resemble those found in the corresponding ALM dialects . However , in Bern and Zurich , certain vowel qualities in the SSG varieties deviate from the ALM norms . Notably , the vowel < a > in both Bern and Zurich SSG is fronted compared to its pronunciation in the corresponding ALM dialects . Furthermore , the Bern SSG vowel < ä > is produced as both [ ɛː ] and [ æː ] , indicating variation in its realization . Additionally , the vowel < o > in the SSG varieties of Bern and Zurich is pronounced further back compared to its pronunciation in ALM dialects . These findings highlight the influence of ALM dialects on the vowel qualities of SSG varieties , while also revealing regional variation within the SSG system . Further research is needed to explore the sociolinguistic factors that contribute to these phonetic variations in Swiss Standard German .

"1 . Introduction Referring expressions play a crucial role in communication as they allow language users to refer to entities in their discourse . Within referring expressions , noun phrases ( NP REs ) often serve as the central component . Previous research has shown that the use of NP REs can change over the course of a communicative interaction . Specifically , speakers tend to converge on linguistic forms and shorten their NP REs , establishing routines in the process . The present chapter aims to investigate this shortening process and examine the structural changes that accompany it in NP REs . To explore these structural changes , we analyze data from an experimentally elicited corpus of spoken English . The corpus consists of conversational dyads who engage in a referential communication task , repeatedly referring to visual stimuli . By examining the dialogues produced during this task , we can observe how interlocutors modify their NP REs over time . Our findings reveal that interlocutors indeed shorten their NP REs as the interaction progresses . Specifically , we observe a decrease in the presence of longer clausal post - head elements , indicating a reduction in structural elaboration . Conversely , there is a relative increase in the use of only premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification . These changes suggest a shift towards structural compression in the NP REs . In summary , this chapter aims to provide a detailed analysis of the structural changes that occur in NP REs during interactive communication . By examining the shortening process and its accompanying modifications , we contribute to our understanding of how language users adapt and optimize their referring expressions in dynamic conversations.1 .

"Introduction : Working memory ( WM ) is a cognitive system responsible for the temporary storage and manipulation of information that is needed for ongoing tasks ( Baddeley & Hitch , 1974 ) . It plays a crucial role in a wide range of cognitive processes , including language comprehension , problem - solving , and decision - making . One common method used to assess WM is immediate serial recall , which requires individuals to remember and reproduce a sequence of items in the same order they were presented ( Baddeley , 2003 ) . Previous research has consistently shown that performance in immediate serial recall tasks is influenced by the phonological similarity between the items to be remembered . Specifically , when the items share similar phonological properties , such as sound or syllable structure , individuals are more likely to make errors in recalling the correct order of the items ( Baddeley , Thomson , & Buchanan , 1975 ) . This phenomenon , known as the phonological - similarity effect , suggests that phonological encoding plays a critical role in the representation of serial order in verbal working memory tasks ( Baddeley , 1986 ) . In contrast to the robust phonological - similarity effect , the influence of semantic similarity on immediate serial recall performance has been less consistent . Semantic similarity refers to the extent to which the meaning of the items is related or similar to each other . While some studies have reported a detrimental effect of semantic similarity on recall accuracy ( Baddeley et al . , 1975 ) , others have found no significant impact ( Baddeley , 1966 ; Conrad & Hull , 1964 ) . This discrepancy raises questions about how semantic information is encoded and represented in verbal working memory tasks . To address this discrepancy and gain a better understanding of how phonological and semantic information is encoded in working memory , we conducted a series of experiments . Specifically , we aimed to investigate the effects of phonological and semantic similarity on the retention of positional information in working memory . By manipulating between - item semantic and phonological similarity , we aimed to elucidate the differential roles of phonology and semantics in the encoding and maintenance of item - context bindings in working memory . In this paper , we present the results of six experiments , all conducted with a sample of young adults . Participants performed tasks that required them to form and maintain new item - context bindings in working memory . They were then asked to retrieve either the items from their context or the contexts from their items . By examining the effects of phonological and semantic similarity on these retrieval tasks , we were able to uncover distinct encoding processes for phonological and semantic information in working memory . Based on our findings , we propose a working memory model that can account for the effects of semantic similarity in working memory . This model suggests that semantic knowledge , derived from activated long - term memory , supports the maintenance and retrieval of information in working memory . Through our research , we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of how different types of information are encoded and represented in verbal working memory .",2.8742384649995874,0.3655568010579299,0.4570526940591332,0.058930239006859224,0.8604617934477957,0.8490962617927127,0.07885304659498207,0.24910394265232974,0.11648745519713262,0.1039426523297491,0.012544802867383513,0.03942652329749104,0.021505376344086023,0.03942652329749104,0.11648745519713262,0.13440860215053763,0.010752688172043012,0.034050179211469536,True,199.0,0.8476702508960573,4.948028673835125,558.0,0.14677516576250754,0.08740204942736589,0.08740204942736589,0.05846895720313442,0.0,0.0,0.046413502109704644,0.035864978902953586,0.034358047016274866,0.0,31.605000000000018,14.813333333333336,16.52667757954773,18.766666666666666,16.8969375,15.833416666666668,61.083333333333336,8.9,16.293154682595613,11913165.399025735,21349.75877961601,5.589583333333334,5.0,3.087659549408833,24.0,23.0,4.929503017546495,1.7833333333333334,1.0,1.0968388922515264,480,215,0.4479166666666667,2761,20,10
