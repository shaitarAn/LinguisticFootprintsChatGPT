The role of English as a global language has significantly impacted language education and motivation around the world. In multilingual countries like Switzerland, where multiple languages are commonly spoken, the influence of English on students' value beliefs in other languages has not been extensively explored. This study aims to investigate the longitudinal associations between Swiss German students' value beliefs in English, French, and German during their upper secondary school years. Additionally, it examines whether there are any differences in motivational development between multilingual and monolingual students.
Motivation plays a crucial role in language learning success, as it directly influences learners' effort and engagement with the target language. Previous research on language motivation has primarily focused on individual languages without considering potential interactions between them. By examining the interplay among value beliefs in multiple languages, this study provides valuable insights into how students' motivations might be influenced by their proficiency or interest in one specific language.
To analyze these longitudinal associations, data from 850 Swiss German students were collected annually from Grades 9 to 11 using self-report questionnaires. The participants had an average age of 15.61 years at the beginning of Grade 9 (SD = .62), with females constituting 54% of the sample. Multivariate latent growth modeling was utilized to examine changes over time regarding students' value beliefs in each language.
The results indicated a significant interference between students' value beliefs in English and their perceptions of French and German value over time. Students who initially reported higher value beliefs in English showed steeper decreases in their perceptions of value for French and German from Grades 9 to 11. However, those who experienced stronger increases in their English value beliefs also demonstrated stronger increases in their French and German values over time.
Furthermore, when comparing multilingual and monolingual students, it was found that while multilingual individuals initially reported higher value beliefs for both French and English compared to their monolingual peers, they exhibited steeper declines in value beliefs for these languages as they progressed through secondary school. This suggests that being proficient in multiple languages might not necessarily lead to sustained motivation or higher value beliefs.
These findings have important implications for language teaching practice and future research directions. First, educators need to be aware of the potential interference between English and other languages when designing language learning curricula. Acknowledging that students' motivations for one language can impact their motivation for others can help create more effective strategies for promoting sustained motivation across multiple languages.
Second, the decline in multilingual students' value beliefs over time highlights the need to identify strategies to maintain their motivations throughout their educational journey. Future research should investigate potential factors contributing to this decline and explore interventions or instructional approaches that can counteract it.
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the longitudinal associations between Swiss German students' value beliefs in English, French, and German. It highlights the interference between English and other languages but also reveals the potential positive influence of increasing value beliefs in English on value beliefs in other languages. The differences observed between multilingual and monolingual students emphasize the importance of considering learners' linguistic backgrounds when developing motivational interventions. By better understanding these dynamics, educators can enhance language instruction practices and ultimately foster a more positive learning environment for multilingual learners. 
Swiss Standard German (SSG) is one of the official languages in Switzerland, but it has received limited attention when it comes to its phonetic properties. In particular, research on the vowel quality variations in SSG influenced by Alemannic (ALM) dialects has been lacking. Most existing studies have focused primarily on consonants rather than vowels. To address this gap in research, this study aims to investigate the long-vowel inventories of four ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties, specifically focusing on vowel quality.
The primary objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, it seeks to provide a comparative acoustic analysis of ALM and SSG vowels. Secondly, it aims to determine the extent to which interference from ALM dialects shapes the vowel qualities observed in SSG varieties.
To achieve these goals, a total of eight speakers (four males and four females) from four different regions were selected for recordings: Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Each speaker was instructed to produce each vowel three times during recording sessions. This resulted in a corpus containing 1,632 tokens.
The analysis of the data revealed that there is a transfer of ALM vowel quality into the corresponding SSG varieties occurring predominantly in two dialect regions: Chur and Brig. In these regions, there was a significant resemblance between ALM vowels and those observed in their respective SSG varieties.
In contrast, some discrepancies were found between ALM vowels and those present in their corresponding Bern and Zurich SSG varieties. Notably, certain vowel qualities did not match entirely with their ALM counterparts – most notably with <a>, which was fronted in both Bern and Zurich's SSG varieties compared to ALM dialects' pronunciation.
Additional differences were observed when analyzing specific vowels within Bern's variety of SSG. For instance, <ä> was pronounced as both [ɛː] and [æː] in the Bern SSG variety, which deviated from standard ALM pronunciation. Furthermore, <o> was consistently realized with more backness in the Bern SSG variety compared to ALM dialects.
These findings suggest that interference from ALM dialects indeed plays a role in shaping vowel quality in their corresponding SSG varieties. However, it is evident that this influence is not uniform across all regions. While Chur and Brig showed high similarity between ALM and SSG vowels, the fronting of certain vowels observed in Bern and Zurich's SSG varieties indicates some divergence.
Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the phonetic properties of Swiss Standard German influenced by Alemannic dialects. By analyzing vowel qualities within these dialect regions and their corresponding SSG varieties, it sheds light on both similarities and divergences between them. Further research is needed to explore other phonetic aspects of SSG as well as analyze the impact of different dialect regions on its phonetics comprehensively. 2. Methodology
To investigate the vowel qualities in four Alemannic dialects and their influence on the respective varieties of Swiss Standard German (SSG), a comparative acoustic analysis was conducted. Eight speakers, consisting of four males and four females, from Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich were selected for recording sessions.
Each participant was instructed to produce each vowel three times in a controlled environment. The vowels recorded included /iː/, /uː/, /eː/, /oː/, /aː/, and /æː/. These vowels represent the long-vowel inventory commonly found in both Alemannic dialects and SSG.
The recordings resulted in a corpus comprising 1,632 tokens. Acoustic analysis software was utilized to measure various vowel properties such as formants frequencies (F1-F3), duration, and spectral characteristics.
3. Results
The results of the acoustic analysis revealed interesting findings regarding the vowel qualities observed in both ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties.
In Chur and Brig – two regions with strong Alemannic influences – there was a remarkable similarity between ALM vowels' qualities compared to those found in their respective SSG varieties. The formant frequencies were closely aligned between these dialects, indicating a transfer of vowel quality from ALM to SSG.
However, some differences were observed when examining Bern's variety of SSG. One notable discrepancy involved <a>, which was fronted compared to its pronunciation in ALM dialects. This fronting effect suggests that while there is an influence from the underlying Alemannic phonetic system on Bern's variety of SSG, it is not entirely mirrored or copied.
A similar deviation from ALM vowels occurred within Zurich's variety of SSG as well. For instance, <ä> exhibited variations in pronunciation; it could be produced as either [ɛː] or [æː], veering from the standard ALM representation. Additionally, <o> was consistently pronounced with more backness in Zurich's SSG variety compared to its ALM counterparts.
4. Discussion
The results of this study provide valuable insights into the vowel quality variations within Alemannic dialects and their respective SSG varieties. The findings suggest that there is a significant transfer of vowel quality from ALM to SSG in some regions, such as Chur and Brig.
However, it is important to note that these dialectal influences on SSG are not uniform across all regions. The deviations observed in Bern and Zurich's SSG varieties indicate that other factors, such as regional linguistic features or sociolinguistic factors, may also contribute to the variation in vowel qualities.
It is essential for future research to explore these non-uniform influences further and investigate how regional differences impact the phonetic properties of SSG. Additionally, studying other phonetic aspects of SSG influenced by Alemannic dialects would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Swiss German phonetics.
In conclusion, this study highlights the significance of investigating vowel qualities in Alemannic dialects and their influence on Swiss Standard German varieties. By conducting an acoustic analysis comparing ALM vowels with corresponding SSG vowels, valuable insights into their similarities and divergences have been gained. Further research will help unveil additional aspects related to sound patterns and language change within Switzerland's multilingual context.
 
In interactive communication, language users often use referring expressions with noun phrases at their center (NP REs) to convey specific objects or people. These NP REs can undergo changes throughout a communicative interaction, as interlocutors tend to converge on linguistic forms and establish routine ways of referring [REF]. One notable change that occurs is the shortening of NP REs, making them more succinct and efficient [REF]. This chapter aims to investigate this process of shortening and analyze the structural changes that accompany it.
To study this phenomenon, a corpus of spoken English was collected through an experimental task where pairs of participants engaged in conversational interactions. They were tasked with repeatedly referring to visual stimuli as part of a referential communication task. The data obtained from these dialogues provide valuable insights into how interlocutors modify their NP REs over time.
The analysis reveals that interlocutors indeed shorten their NP REs throughout the elicited conversations. A closer examination demonstrates that there is a decrease in longer clausal post-head elements as the interaction progresses. Initially, speakers tend to include more elaborate clauses in their NP REs for added descriptive detail. However, as the conversation unfolds, they gradually reduce the presence of these clausal elements.
In contrast to the reduction in clausal modification, there is an observed increase in only premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification. Interlocutors prefer using simpler structures that require less syntactic complexity towards later stages of the conversation. This shift indicates a form of structural compression occurring within the shortened NP REs [REF].
These findings shed light on how speakers adapt their linguistic forms during interactive communication. As conversations progress and routines are established between interlocutors, there is a natural tendency towards brevity and efficiency in language use.
The observed patterns also have implications for our understanding of cognitive processes involved in reference production. Shortened NP REs with reduced clausal modification may reflect a cognitive economy principle, where interlocutors strive to convey information using the least effortful means possible. By simplifying their NP REs, speakers can optimize their cognitive resources and enhance communication efficiency.
Furthermore, the structural changes in NP REs over time demonstrate the dynamic nature of linguistic expression within interactive contexts. Language use is not a static phenomenon but evolves as speakers engage in ongoing interactions. These findings contribute to our understanding of how linguistic structures adapt and change during real-time communication.
In summary, this chapter analyzes the process of shortening in referring expressions with noun phrases at their center in interactive communication. The study reveals structural changes accompanying this shortening process, with a decrease in clausal modification and an increase in simpler phrasal forms. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of language use during communicative interactions and provide insights into cognitive processes involved in reference production. The findings of this study have important implications for various fields, including psycholinguistics, pragmatics, and communication studies. Understanding how referring expressions change over the course of an interaction can provide valuable insights into the underlying cognitive processes involved in language production and comprehension.
From a psycholinguistic perspective, this research contributes to our understanding of how speakers manage their cognitive load during communication. The tendency to shorten NP REs suggests that speakers adapt their language use to optimize processing resources. By reducing syntactic complexity and eliminating unnecessary elements, interlocutors can enhance information processing efficiency.
Pragmatically, these findings highlight the role of context in shaping referring expressions. As conversations progress and shared knowledge between interlocutors increases, there is less need for elaborate descriptions. Instead, shorter forms suffice as they rely on shared mental representations established throughout the interaction.
Moreover, these structural changes reflect an interactive process where both speakers actively shape and negotiate linguistic forms through mutual adaptation. As one speaker shortens their NP REs, it may prompt the other speaker to do the same in order to maintain conversational coherence and alignment.
Additionally, these results have practical implications for natural language processing (NLP) systems that aim to understand human-like communication patterns. Incorporating knowledge about the compression and structural changes in NP REs can help improve the accuracy of such systems by enabling them to generate more efficient referring expressions.
Future research could explore other factors influencing NP RE compression and investigate its role in different types of interactive communication tasks or genres. For instance, studying how referring expression shortening occurs within professional settings or across different languages could provide further insights into cross-contextual variation in linguistic adaptation strategies.
In conclusion, this chapter demonstrates that over the course of a communicative interaction between interlocutors using NP REs as referring expressions centred on noun phrases undergo compressions characterized by a decrease in clausal modification accompanied by an increase in simpler phrasal modifications. These structural changes reflect the dynamic nature of language use in interactive communication contexts, highlighting the cognitive processes involved in reference production and the importance of context in shaping linguistic expressions. By understanding how referring expression compression occurs, we can gain valuable insights into how speakers optimize their language use for efficient communication and develop more accurate models of natural language processing systems. 
Landscapes are an integral part of human life, providing both tangible and intangible benefits. They not only provide essential resources such as food and water but also offer aesthetic beauty, serenity, and recreational opportunities. The significance of landscapes is recognized globally, as evidenced by international conventions and treaties that aim to protect, monitor, and manage these valuable ecosystems.
Despite the importance of landscapes, there is still a lack of understanding regarding how people conceptualize them. Specifically, little is known about how individuals perceive and represent different components of landscapes. Recent research suggests that these conceptualizations can significantly impact landscape management practices. Consequently, it becomes crucial to investigate how people with different linguistic backgrounds and levels of expertise perceive various landscape domains.
In this study, we focused on exploring the conceptualizations of waterbodies—such as rivers, lakes or oceans—in both German-speaking individuals and English-speaking individuals who varied in their level of expertise in this domain. By comparing experts (those well-versed in waterbody-related terms) to nonexperts (individuals without specialized knowledge), we aimed to identify any differences in their conceptualization processes.
To carry out our investigation, we first identified commonly used waterbody terms used within sustainability discourses across both German and English languages. These terms acted as the basis for eliciting ratings related to sensory experiences (such as visual or auditory impressions), motor associations (activities associated with waterbodies), and affective responses (emotional associations).
Our findings revealed that speakers from both language groups generally exhibited similar ways of conceptualizing the domain of waterbody-related terms. This demonstrated a remarkable level of cross-cultural consistency in perceiving landscapes associated with water bodies.
However, we did observe subtle variations among nonexperts across different languages. For instance, there were notable differences between German-speaking nonexperts' association between specific types of waterbodies accompanied by calm happiness compared to English-speaking nonexperts' preferences for other waterbodies in relation to this emotional state. This suggests that language might influence or shape the emotional associations linked to certain landscape components.
Moreover, our research hinted at a potential role of olfaction in English speakers' conceptualization of waterbodies, an aspect that did not appear prominent among German speakers. Understanding these nuanced differences can shed light on how language and cultural contexts shape individuals' relationships with landscapes.
In conclusion, our study contributes to a growing body of research that aims to unravel the intricacies surrounding human conceptualizations of landscapes. By examining the specific domain of waterbodies within German and English language groups, we found both similarities and variations among experts and nonexperts. These findings reinforce the idea that shared perceptions of landscapes are influenced by individual backgrounds and highlight the need for further exploration into these linguistic-cultural influences on conceptualizing natural environments. Such insights can ultimately aid in developing more effective landscape management strategies that consider diverse perspectives and motivations across different communities. 2. Methodology
To investigate how language and expertise influence the conceptualization of waterbody-related terms, we employed a mixed-methods approach. First, we identified commonly used waterbody terms in sustainability discourses by conducting a comprehensive literature review in both German and English languages. This step ensured that our study encompassed a broad range of terms commonly employed to describe waterbodies.
Next, we recruited participants from both language groups who varied in their level of expertise in the domain of waterbodies. The expert group consisted of individuals with specialized knowledge and experience working with water-related issues, such as hydrologists or environmental scientists. The nonexpert group comprised individuals without specific expertise but were representative of the general population.
Participants were presented with a list of identified waterbody terms and asked to rate them on multiple dimensions: sensory (visual appearance, auditory characteristics), motor (associated activities or movements), and affective (emotions or feelings elicited). Ratings were collected using Likert scales ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 indicated low intensity or relevance and 5 indicated high intensity or relevance.
Data analysis involved examining mean ratings across different dimensions for each term within each language group. We also performed statistical analyses to identify any significant differences between expert and nonexpert groups within each language group.
3. Results
Overall, our results revealed remarkable similarity in how speakers from both German and English language groups conceptualize landscape entities related to waterbodies. Experts across both languages consistently rated similar terms highly for sensory attributes such as natural beauty or calming sounds associated with flowing rivers.
Among nonexperts, while there was still significant agreement regarding certain sensory aspects across languages (such as visual appeal), subtle distinctions emerged concerning emotional associations with specific types of waterbodies. For example, English-speaking nonexperts tended to associate calm happiness more strongly with serene lakes compared to German-speaking nonexperts who expressed a preference for tranquil ponds.
Furthermore, an interesting finding was the potential influence of olfaction on English speakers' conceptualization of waterbodies. While specific terms elicited olfactory associations among nonexperts in the English group, this dimension appeared less prominent among their German counterparts.
4. Discussion
The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of how language and expertise influence the conceptualization of landscape domains, particularly in relation to waterbodies. The striking similarities observed between experts suggest a shared understanding and perception fostered by specialized knowledge in both languages.
However, the subtle differences observed among nonexperts raise intriguing questions about the role language and culture play in shaping perceptions and emotional associations with landscapes. These variations may stem from cultural environmental experiences or linguistic nuances that impact individuals' relationships with specific types of waterbodies.
The potential influence of olfaction on English speakers' conceptualizations emphasizes the importance of considering multisensory aspects when examining landscape perception across different cultures and languages. Understanding these nuanced differences can inform strategies for effective communication about landscape management that consider diverse perspectives.
It is important to note some limitations associated with our study. The sample size for each language group should be expanded to ensure greater generalizability. Additionally, including participants from other cultures would provide a more comprehensive analysis of linguistic-cultural influences on conceptualizing landscapes.
Further research could delve deeper into understanding how language shapes not only perceptual but also cognitive processes related to landscapes. Examining how linguistic structures differ across languages in describing waterbody-related terms could offer insights into underlying cultural values or priorities concerning these landscapes.
5.Conclusion
In conclusion, this study highlights intriguing insights into how language and expertise shape individuals' conceptualizations of waterbody domains within German-speaking and English-speaking groups. While consistent patterns were observed among experts across cultures, subtle differences emerged among nonexpert groups regarding emotional associations and sensory dimensions linked to specific types of waterbodies.
These findings emphasize the need for holistic approaches when managing landscapes, considering the influence of linguistic-cultural factors in shaping individuals' relationships with nature. Future research should explore these issues across a wider range of cultures and languages to garner a more comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of landscape conceptualization. Ultimately, this knowledge can inform effective landscape management strategies that encompass diverse perspectives and promote sustainable interactions with our natural environment. 
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and as such, it has attracted considerable attention from researchers studying how it is framed in communication. Framing, a concept that refers to the way information is presented and interpreted, has become an important tool for understanding climate change communication. However, despite the proliferation of studies on this topic in recent years, there remains a lack of consensus on its definition and application.
In this systematic review, we aim to bridge this gap by examining trends in framing research on climate change and comparing them to broader trends in communication research. By doing so, we hope to shed light on how framing can be used as a bridging concept between different perspectives.
To conduct this review, we analyzed 25 years' worth of peer-reviewed literature on the framing of climate change. In total, our sample included 275 articles that employed both quantitative and qualitative approaches to content analysis. We focused our analysis on four key frame locations: frame production (i.e., who creates the frames), frame content (i.e., what messages are conveyed), audience frames (i.e., how frames are interpreted by different audiences), and framing effects (i.e., the impact of frames on attitudes and behaviors).
Our findings reveal several key insights about previous research on framing climate change. First, we observed that there has been limited utilization of framing's potential as a bridging concept. While individual studies have explored specific aspects of framing within their respective frame locations, few have examined how different locations interact with each other or seek to connect them theoretically.
This lack of integration between frame locations raises questions about the conceptual fit within existing literature. For example, if scholars focus solely on frame production without considering how these frames might be interpreted differently by various audiences or their ultimate impact (framing effects), they may miss important nuances in shaping public perceptions about climate change.
To address these concerns and move forward with future research directions in climate change communication, we propose several avenues for exploration. First, researchers should focus on developing a common language and understanding of framing to enhance synthesis across studies. This could involve clarifying definitions and taxonomies of frames and their locations.
Second, greater attention should be given to the interplay between frame locations. By examining how frame production influences frame content, how different audiences interpret frames, and the subsequent effects on attitudes and behaviors, researchers can provide a more comprehensive understanding of climate change communication.
Finally, there is a need for interdisciplinary collaboration in framing research. Climate change is a complex issue that requires input from various disciplines such as psychology, sociology, political science, and environmental studies. By bringing together scholars with diverse expertise, we can overcome disciplinary boundaries and develop a more holistic approach to studying framing in climate change communication.
In conclusion, our systematic review highlights the importance of framing as a bridging concept for understanding climate change communication. By analyzing trends in the field over the past 25 years and comparing them to broader communication research trends, we identify areas for improvement and recommend future directions for research. With continued efforts in this area, scholars can enhance our understanding of how frames shape public perceptions about climate change and contribute to effective communication strategies that address this urgent global issue. 
The Francoprovençal language, a non-standardized Gallo-Romance language, is at risk of extinction. As researchers in linguistics, our aim is to contribute to the preservation and understanding of this endangered language. In this paper, we explore the spatial distribution of partitive articles (PAs) and their potential correlates in Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal.
Partitive articles are determiners that typically have an indefinite interpretation. They play an essential role in the syntactic structure and semantic interpretation of noun phrases. One potential correlate of PAs in Francoprovençal is the invariant form "de". Previous studies on Francoprovençal have reported a basic subdivision into two types: Francoprovençal A and B.
To investigate the distribution patterns of PAs and "de" more thoroughly, we conducted fieldwork data collection in Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy). Using this data, we created spatial maps to visualize their distribution across these regions.
Contrary to previous literature, our analysis reveals a more intricate spatial pattern for PAs and "de" in Francoprovençal. We found that the presence or absence of PAs is influenced by morphosyntactic factors. In Francoprovençal A, for instance, the occurrence of PAs depends on specific syntactic contexts.
In contrast, our findings demonstrate that in certain areas categorized as Francoprovençal B, singular and plural PAs do not co-occur. Instead, there are separate areas where only singular or only plural PAs are present. This indicates a more constrained pattern compared to previous research.
Interestingly, we discovered that there is no direct correlation between overt plural marking on nouns phonologically and the absence or presence of PAs. However, we did observe a correlation between overt sigmatic number marking on nouns (e.g., adding -s to indicate plural) and the absence of PAs. This suggests a potential influence of number marking on the presence or absence of PAs.
Our findings shed light on the distributional patterns of PAs and "de" in Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal. By providing a more nuanced understanding, we contribute to the ongoing documentation and preservation efforts for this endangered language.
The spatial analysis presented in this paper enhances our knowledge not only about the specific features of Francoprovençal but also about Gallo-Romance languages more broadly. Understanding the distribution patterns of linguistic elements is crucial for describing, analyzing, and preserving endangered languages.
We hope that our research contributes to raising awareness about Francoprovençal's uniqueness as well as its vulnerability. By gaining a better understanding of this language, we can support future preservation efforts and foster appreciation for linguistic diversity in Switzerland and Italy. Additionally, our findings have implications for the study of language contact and language variation. The spatial distribution of PAs and "de" in Francoprovençal reflects the historical, cultural, and geographical factors that have shaped the language over time.
The presence of distinct patterns in Francoprovençal A and B suggests that these varieties may have different historical origins or influences from neighboring languages. Further research is needed to investigate these potential linguistic contact situations and their impact on the development of PAs in different regions.
Moreover, the correlation between sigmatic number marking on nouns and the absence of PAs raises intriguing questions about morphological processes in Francoprovençal. It suggests that there may be morphosyntactic interactions between noun morphology and determiners. Investigating these interactions can provide insight into how grammatical features evolve within a language over time.
Our study also highlights the importance of fieldwork data collection for accurately documenting endangered languages like Francoprovençal. By engaging with speakers in their native environments, we were able to capture detailed information about linguistic phenomena that may not be captured through other methods such as historical texts or recordings alone.
In conclusion, our spatial analysis reveals a more complex distribution pattern for partitive articles (PAs) and their potential correlates (such as "de") in Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal than previously reported. This nuanced understanding enhances our knowledge about this endangered Gallo-Romance language while also contributing to broader discussions on language variation, contact situations, morphosyntax, and preservation efforts.
Moving forward, it is crucial to continue documenting endangered languages like Francoprovençal before they vanish completely. Alongside documentation efforts, further research can delve deeper into understanding the sociolinguistic factors influencing variations in PAs across different regions.
By shedding light on the unique features of this marginalized dialect group within Switzerland and Italy's linguistic landscape, we hope to inspire increased recognition and appreciation for the rich linguistic diversity that characterizes the Francoprovençal language. Ultimately, our research aims to contribute to its preservation and ensure that future generations have access to this invaluable cultural heritage. 
The study of wordhood in languages has always been a topic of interest for linguists, as it provides insight into the structure and organization of those languages. In particular, the older Insular Celtic languages, such as Middle Welsh, have posed unique challenges due to their high amount of bound elements and complex phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures.
Previous research on these languages has suggested that individual words may play a lesser role in their grammars compared to other European languages. This is largely attributed to the extensive use of bound elements, which blur the boundaries between words and make it difficult to determine where one word ends and another begins. Additionally, the intricate phonological interactions further complicate the analysis of wordhood in these languages.
In this article, we aim to provide an in-depth investigation into the distribution of phonological and morphological domains within the Middle Welsh verbal complex. We draw upon typological research on wordhood as well as discuss the limitations and challenges associated with studying wordhood in corpus languages.
The Middle Welsh verbal complex is known for its highly agglutinative nature, where multiple morphemes are affixed to roots or stems. These affixes serve various functions including tense/aspect/mood marking, subject agreement, object agreement, negation marking, among others. These affixes can be both prefixal or suffixal in nature and interact with each other phonologically.
One major challenge faced when studying wordhood is determining what constitutes a coherent unit within this complex verbal morphology. Is it composed solely of one root/stem plus its affixes? Or does it also include additional elements that might further modify or specify its meaning?
To address these questions, we examined various phenomena such as reduplication patterns (both partial and total), consonant mutations triggered by certain affixes or syntactic environments (known as lenition), vowel harmony effects across adjacent morphemes (known as umlaut), and the behavior of certain bound elements in different syntactic constructions.
Our findings reveal that structures resembling what can be traditionally labeled as 'words' do exist within the Middle Welsh verbal complex. However, these word-like units are highly dependent on context and do not align neatly with individual lexical items. Rather, they form a continuum of varying degrees of cohesiveness.
For example, some prefixes and suffixes consistently attach to specific stems, behaving like affixes in typical word-formation processes. They undergo phonological changes (such as lenition or umlaut) based on predictable patterns, indicating their close association with the root/stem and suggesting a level of morphological unity.
On the other hand, certain elements exhibit more flexibility in their attachment points and display phonological interactions that defy straightforward analysis. These elements often serve pragmatic or discourse-related functions rather than strictly morphological ones. Their behavior suggests a higher degree of syntactic or phrasal unity rather than strict wordhood.
Overall, our investigation provides evidence that the term 'word' is not very useful for synchronic description within Middle Welsh. While there are structures that resemble words to some extent, they exist along a continuum of cohesiveness and are heavily influenced by context.
This study highlights the importance of taking into account typological research on wordhood as well as recognizing the limitations inherent in studying corpus languages. It also opens avenues for further research into how these complex verbal complexes function syntactically and semantically within Middle Welsh grammar.
In conclusion, understanding the distribution of phonological and morphological domains in Middle Welsh verbs is crucial for comprehending its unique linguistic properties. The intricate interplay between bound elements and phonological interactions challenges traditional notions of wordhood and calls for innovative approaches to analyzing language structure in these complex systems. 
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of heritage languages, which are languages spoken by immigrant communities or their descendants in a new linguistic environment. Such languages often undergo changes and adaptations as they are passed down through generations. This process is particularly fascinating in the case of Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian (BCMS), as it represents a complex linguistic continuum comprising multiple closely related varieties.
This paper introduces a new corpus of heritage BCMS spoken in German-speaking Switzerland. The corpus aims to capture the speech patterns and language behaviors of second-generation speakers who have grown up in Switzerland but maintain a connection to their ancestral language and culture. These speakers offer valuable insights into how BCMS has evolved outside its original context and how it is used within diasporic communities.
The corpus consists of elicited conversations between 29 second-generation speakers, all originating from different regions of former Yugoslavia. The participants were asked to engage in various conversational tasks, including the map task, where they had to describe and discuss locations on a map. These conversations were recorded, transcribed, and turn-aligned to facilitate further analysis.
In total, the corpus contains 30 turn-aligned transcripts with an average length of 6 minutes each. The transcripts are enriched with extensive metadata about the speakers' background and socio-cultural context. Annotations such as part-of-speech tags, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis scores are also included to provide additional layers of linguistic information for researchers.
To facilitate access and analysis of the corpus data, we have developed an interactive corpus platform that allows users to browse, query, filter data based on different criteria such as speaker demographics or linguistic features. Users can also create custom annotations tailored to their research needs and share them with other users on the platform.
The principal user groups targeted by this corpus are researchers interested in studying heritage BCMS phenomena from various perspectives such as language contact, code-switching, language maintenance, or language attrition. Additionally, the corpus can serve as a valuable resource for students and teachers of BCMS living in diaspora communities who can use it for language learning and teaching purposes.
In addition to presenting the corpus platform and its functionalities, we also provide a case study focusing on BCMS spoken by a pair of siblings who participated in the map task. The analysis investigates their language behaviors, code-switching patterns, and linguistic strategies employed when describing locations on the map. This case study illustrates the rich potential of this corpus for uncovering unique features of heritage BCMS and sheds light on how it has adapted to life outside its traditional linguistic community.
While this corpus offers substantial benefits for researching heritage BCMS in Swiss context specifically, it also presents certain challenges. One major challenge is ensuring the representativeness of the sample, given that heritage speakers are a diverse group with varying degrees of proficiency and exposure to different varieties within BCMS. However, by including speakers from different regions of former Yugoslavia in our sample, we aim to capture some variation present within heritage BCMS.
Additionally, efforts are constantly being made to expand the size of this corpus by including more participants with diverse backgrounds and experiences. Moreover, ongoing collaborations with experts in sociolinguistics and dialectology will further enhance our understanding of how heritage languages evolve over time.
In conclusion, this paper introduces a new corpus that captures heritage BCMS spoken by second-generation speakers in German-speaking Switzerland. It provides an invaluable resource for researchers interested in studying various linguistic phenomena related to heritage languages. The interactive platform allows users to explore data easily while offering customization options tailored to individual research needs. Through ongoing expansion efforts and collaborations with experts across disciplines, we hope this corpus will contribute significantly towards advancing our knowledge about heritage languages like BCMS within diverse diaspora communities.
 
Imitation plays a crucial role in language development, as it allows children to acquire and practice new linguistic and social skills. While previous research has extensively explored the relationship between imitation skills and language development in infants, limited attention has been given to the continued importance of these imitative behaviors later on in development. This correlational study aims to address this gap by investigating the joint relevance of multimodal imitation (incorporating gestures, prosody, and language) and object-based imitation on narratives and sociopragmatic abilities in preschoolers.
The ability to imitate multimodal cues is an important aspect of early language acquisition. Gestures, prosodic patterns, and verbal utterances are all critical components of communication that preschoolers must learn to navigate effectively. By imitating these various modalities, children gain a deeper understanding of how to interpret social cues and develop their own communication skills.
To investigate the relationship between imitation skills and narrative abilities as well as sociopragmatic abilities, a sample of thirty-one typically developing 3-4-year-old children completed four tasks designed to assess their proficiency in multimodal imitation (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components), object-based imitation (such as copying actions with objects), narrative abilities (through storytelling tasks), and sociopragmatic abilities (measured through tasks that assessed understanding of social conventions).
Analyzing the data revealed significant correlations between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative abilities as well as sociopragmatic abilities. However, no significant correlation was found between object-based imitation skills alone with either narratives or sociopragmatics.
These findings suggest that preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues strongly predicts their performance in narrative tasks as well as their grasp of sociocommunicative conventions. It highlights the importance of incorporating not just verbal language but also non-verbal communicative elements into our understanding of language development.
By examining gesture use alongside spoken words and prosodic patterns, this study brings forth a more holistic perspective on imitation behaviors in language development. It recognizes that successful communication is a multi-faceted process that involves the integration of various modalities. Preschoolers who are adept at using gestures, intonation, and appropriate vocabulary are likely to be more competent storytellers and better equipped to navigate social interactions.
The implications of these findings extend beyond the theoretical framework of language development. They have practical implications for educators and clinicians working with preschool-aged children. By promoting the development of multimodal imitation skills, practitioners can help foster stronger narrative abilities and enhance sociopragmatic competence in young learners.
In conclusion, this correlational study provides evidence for the strong link between preschoolers' multimodal imitation skills and their narrative as well as sociopragmatic abilities. It highlights the importance of considering gestures, prosody, and verbal linguistic patterns when examining imitation behaviors in the context of language development. By broadening our understanding of imitation to include multiple modalities, we gain insights into how children acquire language skills and navigate complex social interactions from an early age. 2. Methodology
This study utilized a correlational design to examine the relationship between imitation skills and narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children. The sample consisted of thirty-one typically developing 3-4-year-old children, recruited from local preschools.
To assess the participants' imitation skills, two tasks were administered. The first task involved multimodal imitation, where children were asked to imitate a series of gestures, prosodic patterns, and verbal utterances performed by an experimenter. The second task focused on object-based imitation, requiring participants to imitate various actions with objects presented by the experimenter.
Narrative abilities were evaluated through storytelling tasks that prompted children to create and narrate their own stories based on visual stimuli. The narratives were then rated for coherence, structure, grammar usage, and overall storytelling proficiency.
Sociopragmatic abilities were measured using tasks that tested understanding of social conventions and pragmatic language use in different contexts. This included scenarios where children had to interpret appropriate responses in social situations or identify false statements made between characters.
Statistical analyses were conducted to examine correlations between multimodal imitation skills (gestural, prosodic, and lexical components), object-based imitation skills (actions with objects), narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities.
3. Results
The results of this study revealed significant correlations between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative abilities (r = .56) as well as sociopragmatic abilities (r = .46). However, no significant correlation was found between object-based imitation skills alone with either narratives or sociopragmatics.
These results indicate that preschool-aged children's ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is strongly related to their language development in terms of narratives as well as their understanding of social conventions when communicating with others.
4. Discussion
The findings from this study contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of multimodal imitation in preschool-aged children's language development. By incorporating gestures, prosodic patterns, and verbal linguistic patterns into their imitative behaviors, children are better equipped to navigate the complexities of communication and develop stronger narrative and sociopragmatic skills.
The lack of correlation between object-based imitation skills and both narratives and sociopragmatics suggests that the ability to imitate actions with objects alone may not necessarily contribute to language development in the same way as incorporating multimodal cues does. This highlights the importance of considering a broader range of communicative elements when examining imitation behaviors in relation to language development.
Educators and clinicians working with young children can benefit from these findings by promoting the integration of gestures, prosody, and appropriate vocabulary into their teaching practices. By encouraging children to engage in multimodal imitation activities, practitioners can help enhance their narrative abilities as well as their understanding of socially appropriate communication.
However, it is important to note that this study focused solely on typically developing preschool-aged children. Future research could expand on these findings by including a more diverse sample that includes children with developmental delays or disorders. This would provide valuable insights into how imitation skills may vary across different populations and further inform intervention strategies for individuals who may struggle with language development.
In conclusion, this study emphasizes the significance of multimodal imitation skills for preschool-aged children's narrative abilities and sociopragmatic competence. The inclusion of gestures, prosody, and verbal linguistic patterns in imitation behaviors contributes to a broader conceptualization of language development. These findings have practical implications for educators and clinicians who aim to support young learners' communication skills through thoughtful incorporation of multimodal cues into instructional practices.
 
Working memory refers to the cognitive system responsible for temporarily holding and manipulating information in mind. It plays a crucial role in various cognitive processes, such as learning, problem-solving, and language comprehension. One common method used to test working memory is immediate serial recall tasks where individuals are asked to remember and repeat a sequence of words or numbers in the order they were presented.
One robust finding in immediate serial recall tasks is the phonological-similarity effect. This effect refers to the phenomenon where participants are more likely to make errors when recalling word lists that have phonologically similar items (e.g., cat, fat, mat). The presence of this effect suggests that phonology plays an important role in how we encode and maintain the serial order of items in working memory.
On the other hand, semantic similarity between items typically does not have a negative impact on recall performance. For example, if participants need to remember a list of fruits such as apple, banana, and orange - similarity based on their shared semantic category does not lead to increased errors.
The discrepancy between phonological similarity having a detrimental impact on recall performance while semantic similarity does not has raised questions about how verbal working memory encodes different types of information. To address this discrepancy and gain a better understanding of how positional information is retained in working memory with respect to phonology and semantics, several experiments were conducted.
In these experiments involving young adults from various populations (Ns = 60), researchers manipulated both between-item semantic and phonological similarity while participants performed tasks that required them to form new item-context bindings in working memory. Specifically, participants needed to retrieve either the context from its associated item or vice versa.
The results consistently showed that phonological similarity had an adverse effect on working memory for item-context bindings across all experiments regardless of whether retrieval was item-to-context or context-to-item. When two words had similar sound patterns or rhymed with each other (e.g., cat vs. mat), participants were more likely to make errors in recalling the correct order or binding of items with their respective contexts.
In contrast, semantic similarity had no significant impact on recall performance for item-context bindings. Even when participants had to remember and retrieve semantically similar items, such as different types of fruits or animals, there was no observable decline in recall accuracy.
Based on these findings, the researchers propose a working memory model that can account for the effects of semantic similarity. According to this model, semantic knowledge acts as support for working memory through activated long-term memory representations. The relationships between semantically related items are thought to be encoded and retained in long-term memory rather than being actively maintained within working memory itself.
In conclusion, verbal working memory encodes phonological and semantic information differently when it comes to retaining positional information in various tasks. Phonological similarity consistently impairs recall performance for item-context bindings across experiments while semantic similarity has little to no effect. These findings provide new insights into how different types of information are processed and represented within working memory systems.
