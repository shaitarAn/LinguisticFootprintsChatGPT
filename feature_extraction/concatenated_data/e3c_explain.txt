Title: Recurrent Plasmacytoma - A Challenging Case
Introduction:
Plasmacytomas are rare tumors characterized by the proliferation of plasma cells in a localized area. Although they are typically found in the bone, extramedullary plasmacytomas can also occur in soft tissues. These tumors are classified as solitary if the patient presents with a single lesion or multiple when there is more than one tumor. We present a case of recurrent plasmacytoma with unusual clinical and histological features.
Initial Diagnosis and Treatment:
The patient initially presented with an orchidectomy due to testicular mass suspicion. Pathological examination revealed a plasmocytoma characterized by infiltration of mature plasma cells, some plasmablasts, and positivity for CD138 and lambda chains while being negative for kappa chains and CD20. Further evaluation excluded multiple myeloma utilizing several diagnostic modalities including immunoelectrophoresis, whole body bone scan, urine tests for Bence Jones protein, and bone marrow biopsy.
First Recurrence:
Sixteen months following orchidectomy, the patient developed a subcutaneous nodule at the right iliac fossa identified as recurrent plasmocytoma via cytology aspiration and cutaneous biopsy. Serum examination showed elevated levels of lambda light chains along with hypergammaglobulinemia IgA; however, no abnormalities were found on bone marrow aspiration.
Treatment Dilemma:
Due to poor response after thalidomide-based chemotherapy (thalidomide plus dexamethasone), further investigations were carried out to determine disease extent. Thoraco-abdominal CT scans uncovered mediastinal and retroperitoneal masses consistent with recurrent plasmocytomas but skeletal surveys remained normal indicating no skeletal involvement.
Recurrent Plasmacytoma Management:
Histological analysis confirmed similar morphology between initial testicular tumor and recurrences supporting the diagnosis of recurrent plasmacytoma. The patient was then started on polychemotherapy VTD (bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) but persistent retroperitoneal mass and the development of another skin lesion indicated a suboptimal response.
Alternative Treatment Approach:
Subsequent treatment with CTD (cyclophosphamide, thalidomide, dexamethasone) showed promising results with a good response observed after three cycles. Follow-up CT scans revealed complete resolution of all masses and normalization of protein electrophoresis.
Long-term Monitoring:
Given the frequency of recurrence and potential for transformation into multiple myeloma (MM), long-term follow-up is warranted to monitor disease progression. Although the patient is currently asymptomatic, regular evaluations are essential to detect any signs or symptoms indicative of a relapse.
Discussion:
Recurrent plasmacytomas pose significant challenges in terms of diagnosis and treatment due to their clinical heterogeneity. This case highlights the importance of comprehensive diagnostic investigations including laboratory tests, immunohistochemistry, cytology aspiration or biopsy for precise characterization and exclusion/detection of multiple myeloma.
Furthermore, it underscores the need for an individualized approach to therapy considering various factors such as disease extent/recurrence pattern, histological findings, previous treatment responses, and associated comorbidities. Collaboration among medical teams comprising hematologists/oncologists and radiation specialists plays a crucial role in ensuring optimal management strategies are implemented at each stage.
Conclusion:
Recurrent plasmacytomas represent an intriguing clinical challenge due to their low incidence rates and varied presentation patterns. Continuous monitoring coupled with appropriate diagnostic assessments facilitates accurate staging while guiding therapeutic decisions tailored to each patient's unique circumstances. Further research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms contributing to recurrent tumors in order to enhance our understanding and ultimately improve outcomes for patients with this rare malignancy. 
This clinical case involves a middle-aged woman who presented with vaginal bleeding and an abnormal mass protruding from her cervix. Let's break down the information provided and discuss the key points.
The patient, a G10P9018, has had nine normal deliveries and one spontaneous abortion in the first trimester. She has a history of breastfeeding for 18 months after giving birth to her last child, who is now 24 years old. 
In terms of medical history, she was diagnosed with essential high blood pressure nine years ago and has been taking indapamide without experiencing any complications. She also underwent two eye surgeries for cataracts. It is mentioned that she has never received blood products and has no known allergies or habits such as alcohol or tobacco consumption.
On examination, there was a foul-smelling vaginal discharge noted but no signs of pelvic pain, coughing, chest pain, weight loss, anorexia or vomiting. Her general condition was good with a blood pressure reading of 140/88 mmHg. She had elevated weight (116 kg) with an increased body mass index (BMI) of 43.13 kg/m2.
Further examination revealed varicosities on both legs while cardiac, pulmonary, and breast examinations were normal except for an increased heart size visible on chest radiography without any pulmonary abnormalities detected.
Following this initial evaluation and physical examination findings suggestive of cervical pathology like necrotic hemorrhagic mass protruding from the cervix; further investigations were conducted to determine the extent of disease involvement: ultrasonography and CT scans showed that there was only cervical involvement without additional abnormalities in the abdomen or pelvis.
Laboratory tests including full blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), hemostasis workup were all within normal limits along with negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) as well as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test results indicating no infection. Fasting blood glucose levels were also normal.
Based on the clinical and diagnostic findings, the working diagnosis was a stage II uterine leiomyosarcoma as per FIGO staging. To confirm the diagnosis, a total abdominal hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of fallopian tubes and ovaries) was performed under general anesthesia.
The surgery revealed that the uterus itself contained a seven-centimeter mass prolapsed through the cervix. The serosa layer of the uterus was invaded by tumor cells, but adnexae (fallopian tubes and ovaries) appeared macroscopically normal without any adhesions in the pelvis.
After surgery, there were complications with an infection developing in the abdominal wall, requiring drainage of an abscess and secondary closure 22 days later. The patient was then referred for adjuvant radiotherapy to further treat her condition.
The final histopathological analysis showed a neoplasm involving both malignant epithelial (mostly undifferentiated squamous carcinoma) and mesenchymal (homologous leiomyosarcoma) elements. This type of tumor is referred to as Mixed Malignant MÃ¼llerian Tumor or Carcinosarcoma of corpus uteri with pathological stage PT3.
In summary, this clinical case describes a middle-aged woman who presented with vaginal bleeding associated with a necrotic hemorrhagic mass protruding from her cervix. Further investigations confirmed the presence of uterine leiomyosarcoma along with squamous carcinoma components. Treatment involved surgical removal followed by radiotherapy due to postoperative complications arising from an abdominal wall infection 
This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a fever and rash, along with other symptoms. The patient had no prior medical history or surgical procedures, and was not taking any significant medications or recreational drugs. The patient is a grade ten scholar and had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal.
On examination, the patient appeared ill and had vital signs indicative of an infection - low blood pressure, high heart rate, and elevated temperature. A rash was observed on the torso, back, limbs, and palms of the hands. Additionally, the patient had inflammation of the eyelids (desquamating lesions) and conjunctivitis. The abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal.
Initial diagnostic tests showed elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers in the blood. However, blood cultures remained negative for any bacterial infection. Other diagnostic tests including lumbar puncture (for viral analysis) chest radiograph (to examine the lungs), abdominal sonar (to assess abdominal organs) came back normal.
Differential diagnoses were considered for both infectious causes like viral infections such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus seroconversion or Epstein-Barr Virus infection; bacterial infections caused by Group A streptococci or Neisseria meningitidis; non-infectious causes like Kawasaki-like disease or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
The treatment plan initially included antibiotics to cover possible bacterial infections along with doxycycline for rickettsial disease. Intravenous fluids were given but did not result in significant improvement in hemodynamic parameters.
However,on day four of admission,since persistently low mean arterial pressures along with other symptoms persisted,a repeat echocardiogram revealed structural abnormalities in the heart including reduced ejection fraction(HF), chamber dilation and valve regurgitation. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was started along with a dobutamine infusion and diuresis to improve the heart's function. Steroids were also initiated and the patient showed improvement with no further temperature spikes.
Further testing confirmed the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the patient had multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which is potentially related to COVID-19 infection.
The patient continued to improve over time, with resolution of symptoms and normalization of inflammatory markers. Follow-up visits showed complete recovery, and the treatment was well tolerated without any side effects.
In conclusion, this clinical case presents a patient who initially presented with fever, rash, and other symptoms suggestive of an infectious or autoimmune process. Through a thorough diagnostic workup involving various tests and examinations, it was ultimately determined that the patient had MIS-C potentially related to a recent COVID-19 infection. The prompt initiation of appropriate treatment led to full recovery without any residual symptoms. After the patient's hospital discharge, they were followed up in the rheumatology outpatient clinic two weeks later for further evaluation. During this visit, it was noted that the patient had fully recovered with no residual symptoms. The rash had completely resolved, with only a few areas of residual hyperpigmentation. There were no signs of tachycardia or heart failure on examination.
A repeat echocardiogram was performed and showed significant improvement in cardiac function, with an increase in ejection fraction to 57% and no sign of pericardial effusion. Based on these positive findings, the patient's medication regimen was adjusted. Prednisone dosage was gradually reduced to 10mg daily over time and subsequently tapered down over four weeks.
The treatment course was well tolerated by the patient, who did not experience any side effects related to the medications. They were able to return to school without any limitations or complications.
Follow-up visits will continue to be scheduled for monitoring purposes in the coming months as part of ongoing care for this patient.
It is worth noting that informed consent was obtained from the patient regarding both historical and clinical information as well as any images used throughout their medical case presentation, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.
In summary, this clinical case highlights a unique presentation of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) potentially associated with a recent COVID-19 infection. Through appropriate diagnostic assessments and therapeutic interventions including IV immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG), dobutamine infusion, diuresis, corticosteroids (prednisone), along with antibiotics initially provided adequate management leading to resolution of symptoms and complete recovery in this young individual. Close follow-up care will be continued to ensure ongoing health monitoring post-discharge from hospital.
 
Case report 1: This clinical case involves a female patient who had a tympanoplasty on her right ear two weeks prior for chronic suppurative otitis media without any complications. She has a history of HIV, acquired from her mother, and has been on antiretroviral therapy since the age of 5. Her last CD4 count was low at 198 cells/ÂµL. She has also experienced multiple episodes of rape starting at the age of 12, which led to her being placed on oral contraceptives and recently switched to Depo-Provera injections. The patient presented with convulsions and was found to have thrombosis in the sagittal vein along with meningeal enhancement and white matter edema in the left brain hemisphere.
After admission, she experienced more convulsions resulting in right-sided hemiparesis (weakness) and subsequent MRI findings indicated venous infarction (tissue damage due to lack of blood flow) with hemorrhagic components and edema in multiple lobes of the brain. She received anticonvulsants, anticoagulation therapy, and saw improvement over time.
She was discharged with mild residual weakness in her limbs but did not show any further deterioration during follow-up visits.
Case report 2: This case involves a middle-aged female patient who presented with an ongoing throbbing headache accompanied by symptoms such as vomiting, light sensitivity (photophobia), dizziness, and double vision (diplopia). Her medical history revealed that she had been living with HIV for the past decade while taking medication. Lumbar puncture results were initially normal; however, she experienced worsening symptoms after discharge leading to readmission.
A repeated lumbar puncture showed increased pressure within the cerebrospinal fluid space along with normal laboratory results. A non-contrast CT scan revealed abnormalities in several sinuses including hyperdensity indicating possible thrombosis (clot formation) in the superior sagittal, right transverse, and left sigmoid sinuses. The patient was treated with anticoagulation therapy and further experienced seizures without any lasting neurological deficits.
During her hospital stay, she also developed papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) which improved with intravenous Mannitol treatment. Her seizures were controlled with phenytoin, and she was discharged without any neurological impairment around three weeks later.
In both case reports, thrombosis of the cerebral sinuses led to various complications including seizures and neurological deficits. Timely intervention through anticoagulation therapy helped in preventing further deterioration or long-term consequences.
It is important to note that each patient had pre-existing conditions (HIV, history of sexual abuse) which may have contributed to their increased risk for thrombotic events. Additionally, proper monitoring and management during hospitalization played a crucial role in their recovery and prevention of permanent damage.
These cases highlight the importance of recognizing potential risk factors for thrombosis in patients with underlying conditions such as HIV or a history of trauma. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment can help manage these situations effectively while minimizing long-term complications. In both cases, the presence of HIV may have played a role in contributing to the development of thrombosis. HIV infection is associated with a heightened risk of hypercoagulability and endothelial dysfunction, which can predispose individuals to thrombotic events. The low CD4 cell count in both patients indicates a compromised immune system, further increasing their susceptibility to infections and inflammatory processes.
Case report 1 highlights additional factors that may have contributed to the development of thrombosis. The patient's history of sexual abuse could have led to psychological stress and dysregulation of the immune system, potentially promoting a prothrombotic state. Additionally, her use of oral contraceptives and subsequent switch to Depo-Provera injections may increase the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to changes in hormone levels.
The presentation in case report 2 involves an acute severe headache with other neurological symptoms such as diplopia and papilledema. These are suggestive of increased intracranial pressure, which can occur due to cerebral sinus thrombosis blocking normal cerebrospinal fluid drainage pathways.
Thrombosis involving cerebral sinuses is known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), which is relatively rare but potentially life-threatening if not recognized promptly. Common presenting symptoms include headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits (such as weakness or visual disturbances), and signs suggestive of elevated intracranial pressure (e.g., papilledema).
Diagnostic imaging techniques like CT scans with contrast or magnetic resonance venography help identify characteristic findings such as filling defects within cerebral sinuses or jugular veins consistent with thrombi formation.
Management typically includes anticoagulation therapy using drugs like heparin followed by long-term oral warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants. Seizures occurring secondary to CVST often require treatment with antiepileptic medications for seizure control. In some cases, additional measures like Mannitol may be used to reduce intracranial pressure and alleviate associated symptoms.
It is crucial for patients with HIV and other risk factors, including a history of sexual abuse or the use of specific medications like oral contraceptives, to be educated about potential thrombotic risks. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and vigilance for symptoms suggestive of thrombosis are important in early detection and prompt intervention.
These clinical cases underscore the complex interplay between underlying medical conditions, psychosocial factors, and medication use in the context of thrombosis formation. Healthcare providers must have a comprehensive understanding of these interactions to provide appropriate care while considering individual patient circumstances. Multidisciplinary collaboration involving specialists such as infectious disease physicians, hematologists, neurologists, psychiatrists/psychologists, and social workers can ensure holistic management tailored to the unique needs of each patient. 
This clinical case describes a patient who presented with various symptoms and laboratory findings that led to the diagnosis of combined primary adrenal and spinal tuberculosis (TB) with adrenal insufficiency. The patient was started on anti-TB drugs and steroid therapy, which resulted in improvement in clinical symptoms and laboratory values.
Upon examination, there were no significant peripheral lymphadenopathy or enlarged thyroid gland. The abdomen was soft and flat without organomegaly. Chest and cardiac examinations revealed no abnormalities. However, laboratory findings were notable for a red blood cell count of 4.51 Ã 10^12 /L, hemoglobin 11.1 g/dl, white blood cell count 16.31 Ã 10^9 / L (with differential indicating neutrophils at 61.6%, lymphocytes at 13.1%, monocytes at 7%, eosinophils at 0.1%, and basophils at 0.7%), platelet count of 308 Ã10^9 /L, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (42 mm/h), high C-reactive protein (14.88 mg/L), low serum sodium (129 mmol/L), high serum potassium (5.4 mmol/L), low serum chloride (92 mmol/L), blood glucose level of118 mg/dl, normal kidney function, normal liver function, low-serum cortisol levels at both morning and afternoon measurements (2.9 Âµg/dL in the morning;2 .6 Âµg/dL in the afternoon).
Additional investigations included testing for TB-specific antibodies [IgM antibody negative; IgG antibody positive], purified protein derivative test positive). Imaging studies revealed narrowing of the L1-L2 space with irregularity and osteolysis of the endplates suggestive of spinal TB as seen on thoracic lumbar plain film.
In addition, an abdominal CT showed bilateral adrenal mass-like enlargement with irregular enhancement and lesion-like changes without calcification. These findings strongly supported a diagnosis of combined primary adrenal and spinal TB with adrenal insufficiency.
The patient was started on a combination of anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide) along with vitamin B6 tablets. Steroid therapy in the form of prednisolone (7.5 mg/day) was initiated to manage adrenal insufficiency. Regular clinical follow-up every 6 months was scheduled, with all necessary investigations done each time.
In the most recent follow-up in 2012, the patient remained asymptomatic, and laboratory investigations showed near-normalization of values. The anti-TB drugs were discontinued; however, steroid therapy with prednisolone continued at the same dose as before.
While the thoracic lumbar plain film taken later in 2012 revealed similar findings to those seen during initial presentation, it is important to note that this may not indicate active disease but rather residual effects from prior infection. A CT scan of the adrenal glands confirmed reduction in size and enhancement of bilateral masses compared to previous scans; however, complete restoration of normal adrenal function could not be determined conclusively.
This case highlights an uncommon presentation of TB involving both the spine and adrenals leading to adrenal insufficiency. The prompt initiation of appropriate treatment resulted in clinical improvement and near normalization of laboratory results over time.
It also underscores the importance of comprehensive follow-up for monitoring treatment response and ensuring proper management since certain radiological abnormalities may persist despite successful treatment completion. Continuation of steroid therapy is recommended when there is evidence or suspicion for irreversible damage or functional impairment even after effective anti-TB treatment.
Overall, this case emphasizes how effective multidrug TB therapy combined with supportive measures can lead to positive outcomes despite complex presentations involving multiple organ systems affected by TB infection like spinal TB along with vascular supply interruption of the adrenal gland. 
This clinical case involves a patient who presented with a complex set of symptoms and medical history. Let's break it down step by step for better understanding.
The patient had a past medical history of Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura, which is an inflammatory condition that commonly affects small blood vessels in children. This information is important as it provides insight into the patient's overall health and potential predisposition to certain conditions.
The social history revealed that the patient was a smoker, having smoked 11 pack-years. Smoking is known to have detrimental effects on respiratory function and general health, which could be relevant later in the case.
The family history was non-contributory, meaning there were no known genetic or familial conditions that might offer insight into the current presentation. However, family history can sometimes play a role in certain diseases or conditions, so it is important to mention its absence.
Initial laboratory tests showed marked neutrophilic leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count with neutrophils being predominant). Neutrophilic leukocytosis is often associated with bacterial infections or inflammation.
A CT scan revealed several findings including small bilateral pleural effusions (fluid around the lungs), small hepatic enlargement (enlarged liver), Gerota's fascia thickening (the tissue surrounding the kidneys), perineal soft tissue stranding with fascial thickening (swelling and thickened tissue in the perineal area), and small bubbles of air. These findings raised suspicion for Fournier's gangrene, which is a life-threatening infection affecting genitalia/perineum and spreading to surrounding tissues rapidly.
 
Based on calculated scoring systems like FGSI (Fournier Gangrene Severity Index), UFGSI (Uludag Fournier Gangrene Severity Index), and LRINEC score( Laboratory Risk Indicator for necrotizing fasciitis) indicating severe infection; immediate radical surgical debridement of necrotic tissue was performed. During surgery, samples were taken for microbiologic analysis to identify the causative agents.
The patient's condition worsened, and she developed a fever. Microbiologic cultures revealed Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, indicating multiple infections from different organisms. As a result, the antibiotic regimen was modified and antifungal treatment initiated.
Debridements were repeated every 24 hours due to the extensive nature of the lesions. After ten days, the patient underwent another surgical procedure for temporary ileostomy (creating an opening in the small intestine) to ease recovery.
Complications arose with MRSA ventilator-associated pneumonia (a type of pneumonia caused by Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and occlusion of the left internal jugular vein (a large vein in the neck). The patient received additional antibiotics targeting MRSA and underwent vascular ultrasound examination as well as transcranial Doppler examination to assess blood flow in arteries supplying brain. Dental consultation showed no abnormalities that could explain these complications.
Gradually, with ongoing debridements and treatments including anticoagulation therapy (blood thinners), her condition improved. She became afebrile (no longer had a fever), leading to her discharge from ICU after 13 days.
 
A follow-up CTA (computed tomography angiography) confirmed that left jugular vein thrombosis had resolved - meaning blood clotting resolved naturally on its own without complications.
About a month later, she underwent surgery for ileostomy closure and reconstruction of an area on her right buttock known as "right gluteal region."
Six months later during follow-up examinations, it was noted that she had returned to her normal everyday life suggesting complete recovery from this extensive infection episode.
In summary, this case highlights the complexity involved in diagnosing and managing severe infections such as Fournier's gangrene. It demonstrates the importance of microbiologic analysis, appropriate antibiotic therapy, surgical interventions like debridement, and timely recognition and management of complications like pneumonia and thrombosis. Additionally, it underscores the importance of follow-up care to monitor long-term recovery. 
Title: Sturge-Weber Syndrome and its Manifestations: A Clinical Case Study
Introduction:
This clinical case presents a young woman with a complex set of symptoms that can be attributed to Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS). The patient has a history of callosotomy for seizure control at age 6 and experienced her first post-surgical seizure during laser treatment for her port wine birthmark at age 18. To manage her seizures, she was prescribed carbamazepine, which effectively controlled seizures. However, despite normal development in infancy, the patient faced significant challenges in terms of cognitive abilities and academic performance.
Clinical Presentation:
The patient's family history is largely unremarkable; however, her elder sister also had a port wine stain on her face but did not exhibit any signs of SWS. This suggests that the siblings might share the genetic basis for their birthmarks but only one developed SWS-related symptoms.
Key Diagnostic Findings:
1. Physical Examination:
   - Facial nevus: The presence of angioma-caused facial nevi on the right forehead, eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek.
   - Gingival overgrowth: Bright red gingival enlargement with angiomatous characteristics.
   - Extremities asymmetry: Mild size discrepancy between the left arm/leg versus the right arm/leg with associated hemiparesis (muscular weakness).
2. Ophthalmological Evaluation:
   - Glaucoma diagnosis in the right eye.
3. Neurological Evaluation:
   - Hemiparesis: Weakness observed on both upper and lower extremities on the same side as facial nevus.
   - Cranial CT Scan findings include diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere along with irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area.
   - Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI showed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures, in addition to diffuse atrophy confined to the right hemisphere.
   - Axial T1-weighted cranial MRI demonstrates right calvarial thickness compared to the left, as well as asymmetrical overall size with smaller volume on the right side.
   - Extensive venous formations are observed around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle and localized at Gallen vein, perivascular space anterior to third ventricle at Willis polygon, and in the right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern.
4. Intellectual Capacity:
   - Proteus intelligence test revealed a score of 75 points equivalent to mild mental retardation.
Discussion:
The combined clinical findings suggest a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS). This neurocutaneous disorder manifests as capillary malformations (port wine stains), ocular abnormalities (glaucoma), and neurological features such as seizures and developmental delays. The characteristic radiological findings observed, including diffuse brain atrophy in the affected hemisphere along with double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications suggest underlying pathology associated with SWS.
Sturge-Weber Syndrome is sporadic but can occur due to somatic mutations affecting GNAQ gene. It is important for family members of individuals affected by SWS or presenting port wine birthmarks also seek medical evaluation for any associated symptoms or complications that could arise later in life.
Management:
The patient has been prescribed carbamazepine successfully for seizure control following callosotomy performed earlier in life. Close monitoring is essential since medication management may require adjustments over time. Comorbid conditions such as anxiety disorder have also been identified during psychiatric evaluation; therefore, additional medications like ketiapin and venlafaxine have been prescribed accordingly.
Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights various manifestations associated with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) â a rare neurocutaneous disorder characterized by capillary malformations, ocular abnormalities, and neurological features such as seizures and developmental delays. Early detection and proper management are crucial to optimize the patient's quality of life. Interdisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals is essential in providing comprehensive care to individuals affected by this complex condition.
Please note that this clinical case study is provided for educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice. It is important to consult with a qualified healthcare provider regarding any individual medical concerns or conditions. 
This clinical case involves a pregnant woman who presented with multiple medical conditions and complications. On admission, she had an elevated pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. She also had a right-sided facial nerve palsy, but no other neurological deficits were noted. Her skin appeared normal without any signs of bleeding or bruising. There was no edema or jaundice observed. 
A physical examination revealed that she had a 30-week gravid uterus with a dilated cervix and 40% effacement. The fetal heartbeats were not detected, indicating intrauterine fetal death. In addition, the patient had proteinuria and hyperglycemia suggestive of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes respectively.
Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with placenta abruption (separation of the placenta from the uterus), preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy), Bell's palsy (facial nerve paralysis), and gestational diabetes.
To manage her conditions, the patient was prescribed medications such as methyldopa (to lower blood pressure), nifedipine (to relax blood vessels), hydralazine (to reduce blood pressure in emergencies), magnesium sulfate (to prevent seizures associated with preeclampsia) as well as insulin to manage her high blood sugar levels.
During her hospital stay, four hours after admission she delivered a stillborn fetus weighing 1200gm without any congenital abnormalities through vaginal delivery. However, she experienced postpartum hemorrhage which required treatment such as uterine massage and oxytocin administration to stop bleeding.
Investigations done on admission showed that the patient had low red blood cell count (anemia) but normal kidney function and liver enzymes levels.
One day after delivery, the patient developed fever along with palpitations, blurred vision, dizziness, headache, and shortness of breath. Physical examination revealed severe paleness of the conjunctiva, mild swelling in her feet, increased respiratory rate, and a clear chest on auscultation. Her hemoglobin and platelet count dropped significantly.
Considering these symptoms, laboratory findings, and the recent stillbirth, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) was diagnosed. Consumptive coagulopathy was also considered due to fever and worsening hemolysis after the stillbirth.
The patient received transfusions of whole blood and platelets along with antibiotics for suspected sepsis. However, her renal function continued to deteriorate with increased swelling in her face and legs. Liver enzymes were found to be elevated as well.
Based on ongoing hemolysis (falling hemoglobin levels), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), peripheral blood smear findings of fragmented red blood cells called schistocytes and normal coagulation profile; a diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) was made.
Treatment for TTP-HUS involves supportive measures such as dexamethasone administration and hemodialysis. Platelet transfusions were stopped because they can exacerbate the condition in TTP-HUS patients. Fresh frozen plasma was given instead to replenish clotting factors that may have been depleted.
After several weeks of hospitalization and treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient's clinical condition improved gradually with normalization of hematological parameters such as hemoglobin levels and platelet counts. Her kidney function also improved during this time period. She was eventually discharged home in good health without any subsequent complications.
In summary, this clinical case highlights the complex nature of medical conditions that can occur during pregnancy. The patient experienced multiple complications including placenta abruption leading to intrauterine fetal death, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, Bell's palsy, postpartum hemorrhage, HELLP syndrome, and ultimately TTP-HUS. Early recognition and appropriate management of these conditions are crucial in ensuring the best possible outcomes for both the mother and the fetus. 
Clinical Case: Bilateral Spermatocytic Seminoma with Inguinal Lymph Node Enlargement
In this clinical case, the patient presented with swelling on both sides of the scrotum. On the left side, there was a firm to hard non-tender swelling measuring approximately 11X8X6 cm3, which was associated with restricted mobility. The surface of the swelling was regular and transillumination test was negative. On examination of the right side, a similar firm to hard non-tender swelling measuring approximately 8X6X5 cm3 was found, also associated with restricted mobility.
The patient reported altered testicular sensations on the right side and absence of sensations on the left side. In addition to these findings, bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were swollen but non-tender and palpable.
Based on these clinical findings, a provisional diagnosis of bilateral testicular malignancy was made and further investigations were performed. Routine blood tests including hemoglobin level, total leukocyte count, differential leukocyte count (types of white blood cells) and platelet count were within normal range.
Kidney function tests and liver function tests did not reveal any abnormalities. Chest radiograph showed no abnormality as well. Urine analysis including microscopic examination did not show any signs of disease or infection.
Special investigations included assessment of serum tumor markers such as Beta HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Beta HCG levels were elevated at 12 mIU/ml while AFP and LDH levels were normal.
Further imaging studies such as ultrasonography (USG) abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral enlargement of inguinal lymph nodes without significant changes in their echosensitivity or morphology. The testes appeared multilobulated enlarged with multiple scattered whorled masses surrounded by peripheral vascularity, suggesting neoplastic nature.
Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the enlargement of both testes. The left testis measured about 11X8.8X7.8 cm with heterogeneous hypodensity and mild enhancement on post-contrast imaging. Similarly, the right testis measured about 8X6.9X5.5 cm with similar characteristics.
Intraoperatively, a biopsy was performed on the suspicious area of the left testis and frozen sections were sent for histopathological examination which revealed malignancy (spermatocytic seminoma). Subsequently, a left-sided orchidectomy (removal of testis) along with spermatic cord and left inguinal lymph nodes was performed under general anesthesia.
Postoperative period for the patient was uneventful without any complications in recovery. Sutures were removed on day 10 and wound healing was normal.
After five days from surgery, an intraoperative biopsy of the right testis was done confirming another case of malignancy (spermatocytic seminoma). This diagnosis was later confirmed by immunohistochemistry as well.
Following these findings, a right-sided orchidectomy along with spermatic cord and right inguinal lymph nodes removal were performed after 15 days from surgery.
Histopathological studies revealed that both removed testes showed atrophy and multilobulated appearance microscopically. The evaluation also demonstrated atrophic seminiferous tubules with reduced spermatogenesis and dysplastic cells surrounded by infiltrates composed mainly of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages indicating inflammatory responses to neoplastic cells in both testes.
To prevent relapse or recurrence, prophylactic radiotherapy treatment was given to the patient for 15 days with a total dose of 20Gy (Gray - unit measurement equivalent to joules per kilogram) delivered. The patient was advised to follow up every 6 months. Presently, the patient is asymptomatic with normal follow-up CT scan and tumor markers within normal limits indicating no evidence of disease.
In conclusion, this clinical case presents a rare scenario of bilateral spermatocytic seminoma, a type of malignancy affecting the testes. The patient initially presented with bilateral non-tender scrotal swellings associated with restricted mobility along with altered or absent testicular sensations on both sides.
The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry following orchidectomy procedures on both sides along with removal of inguinal lymph nodes.
Thanks to timely investigation and appropriate treatment in the form of surgery followed by prophylactic radiotherapy, there has been no evidence of disease recurrence during subsequent follow-up visits.
Regular check-ups and continued monitoring will play an important role in assessing long-term outcome and ensuring the absence of any relapse or new disease manifestation. 
Title: Neglected Ocular Trauma in a Preterm Infant: A Case Study
Introduction:
This clinical case presents a unique and challenging scenario involving ocular trauma in an infant from a disadvantaged background. The patient, a preterm twin born to parents with limited education and resources, suffered severe injuries to the left eye. Despite financial constraints, the child received initial treatment and is currently undergoing follow-up care to address the potential long-term consequences of this neglected injury.
Patient Presentation:
The patient, a female preterm infant, was found alone in her room after breastfeeding while her mother attended to domestic chores outside. Born as part of a polygamous family setting, she resides with siblings in crowded living conditions characterized by limited resources and inadequate hygiene. The mother reported rats freely navigating within and around their apartment before the incident.
Clinical Findings:
Upon examination, it was evident that the child presented as acutely ill with significant damage to her left eyelids, nares (nostrils), cheek, and central cornea ulceration. Her weight was below average for her age group (1kg) - likely due to being born prematurely - but other systemic examinations did not reveal any additional abnormalities.
Medical Care Provided:
After admission into the special baby care unit (SCBU), suitable measures were undertaken for wound management and infection prevention. To safeguard against tetanus infection, she received tetanus toxoid vaccination via subcutaneous injection along with intravenous antibiotics (Unasyn and Gentamicin) administered over multiple doses.
Additionally, supportive measures such as providing incubator care were initiated following recommendations made by the pediatrician overseeing her case. Feedings consisted of expressed breast milk given at calorie-rich quantities appropriate for an infant of this stage of development (120 kcal/kg/day).
Ophthalmological Intervention:
With regard to eye-specific interventions for treating corneal ulcers resulting from rat bites on her face and damage-associated infections acquired soon after the injury, a plastic surgeon provided consultation. The ocular injury was cleaned daily with normal saline, and chloramphenicol ointment and artificial tear drops were administered to promote recovery.
Microbial Keratitis and Financial Constraints:
Two weeks post-injury, the patient developed central microbial keratitis, a potentially debilitating complication that required prompt intervention. Unfortunately, the care giver declined referral to a corneal specialist due to financial constraints. Similarly, corneal scrapings for further analysis were also unaffordable.
Continued Management:
Given the financial limitations of her care giver, the medical team procured lomefloxacin eye drops through voluntary donations from physicians. With timely administration of this medication coupled with regular follow-up appointments across ophthalmology, pediatrics, and plastic surgery departments,
the child's condition improved - evident from resolved corneal ulcers and infiltrates.
Future Plans:
The clinical team has emphasized to the care giver on multiple occasions about the critical need for penetrating keratoplasty (corneal grafting) along with reconstructive procedures for lid reconstruction in order to optimize visual outcomes as soon as possible.
It is hoped that potential community support or access to charitable resources shall be explored extensively by healthcare providers ensuring optimal outcome in this neglected case.
Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights several key aspects - socioeconomic disparities influencing healthcare access and compliance issues in underserved populations. Despite limited resources available for comprehensive management options, medical interventions such as wound cleaning protocols and continuous administration of suitable antibiotics have helped stabilize the patient's ocular health. The commitment of healthcare professionals involved is vital in addressing cases characterized by vulnerable backgrounds while considering cost-effective approaches without compromising long-term visual rehabilitation goals 
This clinical case involves a patient who presented with an abdominal pregnancy at 32 weeks and 3 days gestation. An abdominal pregnancy is a rare condition where the fertilized egg implants and develops outside of the uterus, typically within the abdomen. 
In this case, the patient had previously undergone an obstetrical ultrasound two days before admission, which showed a live fetus in her abdomen with severe oligoamnios (reduced amniotic fluid). The placenta was found to be attached to her polymyomatous uterus (a uterus with multiple fibroids) and possibly on the omentum (a layer of tissue covering the abdominal organs), without any contact with major blood vessels.
Due to these findings, she was referred to our service for management. The patient provided some relevant background information, such as having her first menstrual period at 12 years old and having regular menstrual cycles lasting 30 days, with bleeding lasting for four days. She reported not using any contraception methods and had her first sexual intercourse at 16 years old. She also mentioned having had six sexual partners throughout her life.
Additionally, she disclosed a previous history of pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Chlamydia infection. Her blood group is A rhesus positive, and she has no known allergies or history of blood transfusions. Furthermore, she has been pregnant five times before: two full-term deliveries resulting in healthy baby boys weighing 3,700 grams and 4,300 grams respectively; eight years of secondary infertility following the first delivery; treatment for a tubal pregnancy; and emergency removal of another ectopic pregnancy from her right fallopian tube.
On examination during admission, it was noted that the patient's general condition was good and all vital parameters were normal. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations did not reveal any abnormalities either. Her abdomen displayed a Pfannenstiel incision scar from a previous cesarean section surgery. Upon palpation, fetal parts were easily felt beneath the abdominal wall. The distance between the symphysis pubis and sternum measured 38 centimeters, while the abdominal circumference was 90 centimeters. The fetus was in a transverse lie (sideways position), and its heart rate was normal at 146 beats per minute. Bowel sounds were also found to be normal.
A thorough examination of the cervico-vaginal area revealed no abnormalities in the mucosa, and the cervix was closed but slightly displaced to the left. Digital vaginal exploration indicated a long, firm, and closed cervix consistent with a pregnancy of 16 weeks gestation.
Based on these findings, a working diagnosis was made for an abdominal pregnancy with a live fetus at around 34 weeks and 2 days gestation. It was determined that urgent intervention would be necessary after lung maturation of the fetus with corticosteroids through two intramuscular injections of 12 milligrams of bethamethasone given within a 24-hour interval.
The patient underwent laparotomy under general anesthesia where it was discovered that approximately 80% of the placenta had implanted onto intestinal loops and omentum (visceral fat tissue), while about 20% remained attached to her uterine fundus (the upper part). The fetus exhibited talipes valgus (clubfoot) deformity in its right foot but did not display any signs of hemoperitoneum (blood in the abdomen). The uterus appeared soft, globular, and consistent with being at around week 16 gestation. No visible abnormalities were noted in her uterine adnexa or evidence of pelvic adhesions.
Once the fetus was extracted through cesarean section delivery, it received immediate medical attention due to severe respiratory distress and unfortunately passed away three hours later in pediatric intensive care.
Post-operatively, drain placement was necessary to manage potential complications. Two Delbet corrugated drains were inserted into the parieto-colic gutters (spaces in the abdominal cavity) and the pouch of Douglas (an area behind the uterus). The patient recovered well after surgery, and on the fourth day, the drains were removed.
Following discharge, she underwent follow-up care with serial abdominal ultrasounds and plasmatic beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (Î²-hCG) measurements. Î²-hCG is a hormone produced by placental cells during pregnancy, and its levels can help monitor pregnancy progression or detect residual tissues after delivery. In this case, her first Î²-hCG level was measured at 13,266 milliunits per milliliter while an ultrasound confirmed a vascularized placental mass.
It took eleven months for both the placenta and Î²-hCG levels to completely disappear from her body. Before leaving our care, we ensured that she received appropriate counseling on recognizing danger signs that would necessitate emergency medical attention such as abdominal pain, trauma to the abdomen, dizziness, or extreme fatigue.
In summary, this clinical case describes a rare situation of an abdominal pregnancy with a live fetus at 32 weeks and 3 days gestation. Prompt intervention through cesarean section delivery was performed despite challenging circumstances due to placental attachment and associated risks like severe bleeding. The mother recovered well post-operatively; however unfortunately her newborn experienced severe respiratory distress leading to its tragic demise shortly after birth. 
Clinical Case: Management of Ventricular Tachycardia in a Pregnant Patient
In this case, we encounter a pregnant patient with a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) who requires medical and interventional management. Initially, the patient was treated with Cordarone (amiodarone), an antiarrhythmic medication commonly used for VT. However, due to the persistence of VT and the occurrence of secondary hyperthyroidism, the treatment was switched to flecainide.
Despite this change in medication, the patient experiences recurring episodes of VT. To address this, hyperten (a beta blocker) is added to her treatment regimen. However, as the recurrent VT persists despite medical therapy and poses a significant risk to both mother and fetus, radiofrequency ablation is indicated.
The first attempt at radiofrequency ablation is complicated by VT with ST elevation and an increase in troponin levels. To rule out any underlying coronary artery disease as a cause for these complications, a coronary angiography is performed which comes back normal.
A second attempt at radiofrequency ablation is successfully carried out later that year. During this time, the patient continues her treatment with Detensiel (an antihypertensive), flecainide (antiarrhythmic), and AspÃ©gic (aspirin). Following successful intervention without further VT occurrences during pregnancy, she remains stable throughout her pregnancy without experiencing ventricular arrhythmias.
At 34 weeks of gestation when it becomes necessary to plan for delivery due to concerns about maternal cardiac function and possible arrhythmias during labor or postpartum period; preoperative evaluation reveals normal somatic examination results but shows signs suggestive of right ventricular hypertrophy on chest radiography along with right bundle branch block on ECG beyond V1 leads.
Further evaluation through transthoracic echocardiogram confirms dilated right ventricle and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. Blood tests, including complete blood count, prothrombin ratio, liver function tests, and kidney function tests, come back normal.
In preparation for the cesarean section delivery scheduled at 38 weeks of pregnancy, the patient undergoes preoperative fasting for six hours and continues her medication regimen until the day of surgery. The potential risks associated with bleeding, transfusion requirements, and perioperative cardiac rhythm disturbances are explained to the patient during consultation. Anesthetic techniques involving general anesthesia along with postoperative pain management using titration of morphine are also discussed.
On the day of surgery, standard monitoring is initiated including ECG, oxygen saturation (pSO2), non-invasive blood pressure measurement, and capnography. Two peripheral venous lines are established using an 18G needle. The patient is placed in a left lateral decubitus position. Intravenous administration of 500 mL Ringer lactate over 30 minutes is prescribed to maintain hydration.
Preoxygenation is performed three minutes before anesthesia induction. Anesthetic induction occurs after draping with propofol (3 mg/kg), remifentanil (1 Î¼g/kg), and rocuronium (0.6 mg/kg) while applying Sellick maneuver to prevent regurgitation during intubation. A size 7Fr tube is used for endotracheal intubation.
Anesthesia maintenance is achieved through continuous infusion of propofol (10 mg/kg/hour) and remifentanil (0.1 mcg/kg/minute). Following fetal extraction during surgery, prophylactic antibiotic therapy with cefazolin (2 g) is administered intravenously while oxytocin given as an injection at a dose of 5 IU followed by infusion at a dosage rate equivalent to that diluted in saline solution.
Throughout the surgery, hemodynamic stability is maintained, ensuring systolic blood pressure of 110-100 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of 60-50 mm Hg, and heart rate between 60 and 70 beats per minute. Respiratory parameters such as oxygen saturation and end-tidal CO2 are closely monitored to maintain optimal ventilation.
Extubation is successfully performed on the operating table without any immediate complications. The postoperative period remains uneventful with no changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) findings or evidence of bleeding. Adequate postoperative analgesia is achieved through administration of paracetamol (15 mg/kg/6 hours) and morphine (5 mg subcutaneously every 6 hours).
Following a three-day hospital stay after delivery, breastfeeding is contraindicated due to the medications administered during this period. The patient's stable clinical condition as well as absence of any cardiac rhythm disturbances allows for a successful outcome.
In conclusion, this case highlights the complex management involved in treating a pregnant patient with ventricular tachycardia. It necessitates careful consideration regarding antiarrhythmic medications to control arrhythmias while minimizing risks to both mother and fetus. Close monitoring during surgery along with appropriate anesthesia protocols ensures safe delivery while managing potential complications associated with ventricular tachycardia in pregnancy 
Title: A Case of Delirium and Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
Introduction:
This clinical case describes a patient who presented with agitated and combative behavior, initially attributed to dissatisfaction with rehabilitation progress. However, through careful assessment and investigation, a provisional diagnosis of delirium due to a recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) was made. Subsequently, the patient's condition deteriorated further, eventually leading to a complex partial seizure and the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Prompt recognition and management of these conditions were crucial in achieving successful patient outcomes.
Clinical Presentation:
The patient initially exhibited signs consistent with delirium, including agitation, combativeness, refusal of medication and oral intake, as well as progressively worsening sleep disturbances. Given the absence of psychiatric history or substance abuse and no exposure to neuroleptics in the past, these symptoms were suspected to be secondary to an underlying physiological cause rather than behavioral factors alone.
Diagnosis:
A review revealed previous treatment for UTI during hospitalization which indicated a potential association between recurrent infections and the current symptoms. To confirm this suspicion, urinalysis was ordered for further investigation while immediate symptomatic management was initiated using Olanzapine 10 mg IM stat.
On presenting evidence from urinalysis that confirmed urinary tract bacterial infection on the following day after initiating intravenous antibiotics for treatment purposes,the patient continued exhibiting agitated behavior prompting administration of haloperidol 10 mg IM in order to manage his symptoms.
Clinical Deterioration:
Despite initial symptom improvement following treatment initiation,the third day demonstrated significant changes in mental state including perplexed affect,distractibility,poor initiation abilities,and immobility.Unresponsiveness,staring,and inappropriate language use were also notable.The presence of generalized spasticity throughout movement examinations prohibited thorough assessment.Pain elicited purposeful withdrawal responses but verbal commands did not register appropriately.CNS involvement became difficult discern especially due to constant movement and agitation by the patient.
Laboratory Investigation:
Concurrently, laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, serum creatinine,and liver enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP),aspartate aminotransferase(AST),gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT),as well as significantly raised creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels.An abnormally low urine output further added to the complexity of this case.
Development of Complex Partial Seizure:
Early the next morning following admission to ICU,the patient experienced a complex partial seizure which was promptly managed through intravenous diazepam administration.Additional diagnostic tests, including lumbar puncture (LP), CT scan of the head,and electroencephalogram (EEG) were conducted but did not yield any significant findings.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome Diagnosis:
Considering the overall clinical picture, including deteriorating mental state,involuntary movements and raised CPK levels, a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome was made. The patient was commenced on bromocriptine 7.5 mg three times daily alongside lorazepam 1mg at bedtime for symptom management.As NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with antidopaminergic medications,a prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment initiated in critical-care setting was crucial for optimal outcomes.
Recovery and Rehabilitation:
Following treatment initiation,major improvements in rigidity levels,agitation,and periods of wakefulness were observed on days five and six post-ICU admission.The patient regained full orientation and cooperation.Subsequent normalization of liver function tests and CPK levels further supported recovery.Patient subsequently transferred from ICU to general ward for continued monitoring,rehabilitation,and care.
Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights the importance of careful assessment,diligent investigation strategies,and timely interventions in managing complex patients presenting with diverse symptoms.A comprehensive diagnostic approach can help identify underlying causes and provide appropriate treatment plans to ensure optimal patient outcomes.Clinical vigilance and expertise are key in recognizing potential life-threatening conditions such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and facilitating prompt management.
 
Case Presentation:
A patient presented to our hospital with complaints of a mass in the right side of their palate. Upon taking their medical history, we found that they had no previous history of similar illness, significant medical or surgical issues, or any family history of similar complaints. The patient had not sought treatment for this issue previously.
Upon general examination, the patient's vital parameters were normal and stable. There were no signs of jaundice or pallor. No other swelling was observed upon examination of the rest of the body. The systemic examination of other systems did not reveal any abnormalities.
On local examination, a globular mass with normal overlying mucosa was observed on the right side of the palate. The lesion appeared to originate from the mid part of the palate and extended up to the posterior border of the hard palate. It was non-tender, firm, non-compressible, and had well-defined margins. Posteriorly it was limited by the posterior margin of soft palate and anteriorly merged with it. Superiorly it extended into nasopharyngeal region.
The transillumination test performed on this mass yielded negative results. Further examination in otorhinolaryngology did not reveal any other significant abnormalities.
Based on this history and clinical examination findings, a diagnosis was made suggesting a solid non-infectious mass likely benign in nature originating from soft palate tissue.
To further investigate this condition and rule out potential infective etiology (palatal abscess), a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan was recommended for paranasal sinuses assessment.
The CT scan used 128 slice spiral CT technology with coronal and saggital reformations for better imaging analysis.
The results showed a well-defined homogeneously enhancing hypodense soft tissue lesion measuring approximately 4.27 cm X 4 cm X 4.5 cm.
This lesion arose from t the right side of the soft palate and was in close proximity to the anterior border of the hard palate, posteriorly abutting the uvula, inferiorly reaching towards the tongue, and superiorly extending into the nasopharyngeal wall. Lateral to it, it was seen to abut the right lateral nasopharyngeal wall. The surrounding structures showed no signs of infiltration and well-defined planes were observed. There was no evidence of central necrosis or secondary infection.
Based on these radiological features, a benign etiology neoplastic mass was suspected. The possibility of other clinical diagnosis such as palatal abscess was completely ruled out.
To confirm the diagnosis, a biopsy was performed on the excised mass during surgery under general anesthesia. The surgical excision resulted in a 5 Ã 4 cm mass which was subsequently closed with advancement of adjacent mucosa.
The histopathological examination revealed epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells within the specimen. These findings along with other features were consistent with pleomorphic adenoma (PA), confirming our suspicion.
Preoperative blood and urine investigations were conducted before surgery and all results fell within normal limits. This indicated that there were no underlying systemic issues contributing to this condition.
The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, with satisfactory healing observed after surgery. A follow-up period of one year showed no signs of recurrence or complications related to this condition.
Pleomorphic adenoma is a type of benign tumor that commonly arises from salivary gland tissue but can occur elsewhere in the body as well. In this case, it originated from soft palate tissue.
Although benign, pleomorphic adenomas have potential for local recurrence if not completely excised.
Regular follow-up is important after surgical removal to monitor for any signs or symptoms suggestive o
f recurrence or metastasis.
Patients should be educated about these potential risks and advised on how to recognize them at an early stage.
In conclusion, this clinical case presented a patient with a globular mass on the right side of their palate. Through a series of clinical examinations, radiological imaging, and histopathological analysis, it was determined that the mass was a pleomorphic adenoma originating from the soft palate. Surgical excision successfully removed the tumor and no recurrence was observed during the follow-up period. This case highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment for benign neoplastic masses in order to achieve optimal patient outcomes. 
This clinical case describes a patient who presented with severe hypertension and haematospermia (blood in semen).
The patient's history reveals several important factors. He had been intermittently taking oral sildenafil, a medication used to enhance sexual performance, for the past two years. He also had a positive history of unprotected sexual intercourse with both his current and previous girlfriends. Additionally, his father and elder sister were known hypertensives, suggesting a possible family history of high blood pressure.
On examination, the patient did not exhibit any signs of respiratory distress or pain. There were no obvious physical abnormalities such as pale skin, jaundice, or edema. However, the blood pressure reading was significantly elevated at 200/120 mmHg and there was an abnormal sound heard when listening to the heart (heaving apex beat). This indicates that the patient's hypertension is severe enough to cause cardiac complications.
Laboratory investigations revealed an increased urea level and elevated creatinine indicating impaired kidney function. His lipid profile showed mildly elevated LDL cholesterol levels while other lipid parameters were normal. The full blood count indicated a lower than normal hematocrit level but other parameters were within normal range.
Immunological testing ruled out HIV or tuberculosis infection as potential causes for his symptoms. Urine analysis showed trace glycosuria (sugar in urine) but no protein or blood present. There was also no significant bacterial growth on urine culture.
The analysis of the seminal fluid revealed brownish gelatinous fluid with numerous red blood cells present along with pus cells indicating inflammation in the semen. The spermatozoa count was low at 10.2 x 10^6 ml and only 30% of them appeared actively motile while 60% were non-motile.
Due to financial constraints, further imaging tests such as renal ultrasound scan, echocardiogram, prostate scan, and prostate-specific antigen test were not performed.
Treatment for the patient focused on managing his severe hypertension, counseling him on lifestyle modifications, and implementing a DASH (dietary approach to stop hypertension) diet. Medications used included oral nifedipine control release tablets, moduretic tablets, and lisinopril. Gradual reduction of blood pressure occurred over several days. By the time of discharge after two weeks, the patient's blood pressure had improved to 150/100 mm Hg.
During follow-up visits, the patient reported lower blood pressure readings outside of the hospital setting. He also faced social challenges as his sexual partners became scared and avoided him due to his haematospermia.
Although the haematospermia resolved completely after being on regular antihypertensive medications for some weeks, it is mentioned that he was lost to follow-up. The last known information is that he suffered a stroke while seeking further treatment at a church.
This case highlights several significant issues. Firstly, there is a strong association between severe hypertension and urological symptoms such as haematospermia in this patient. Secondly, inadequate management of hypertension can lead to serious complications such as stroke. Lastly, there may be barriers in healthcare access or belief systems that can hinder proper medical management when individuals seek alternative treatments.
In conclusion, this clinical case demonstrates the importance of early diagnosis and management of severe hypertension for preventing potentially life-threatening complications like stroke. It also emphasizes the need for appropriate communication regarding expectations and potential side effects related to medications such as sildenafil which are commonly used without medical supervision. 
This clinical case describes a patient, Mrs. AMS, who presents with episodes of palpitations and lipothymia (a momentary loss of consciousness). Upon analysis of her medical history, it is revealed that she has a past medical history of asthma attacks but has not experienced any in over a year. She is also primipara, meaning this is her first pregnancy and she has given birth to a healthy child.
The initial examination reveals that Mrs. AMS has a normal cardiovascular examination with no heart murmur or signs of heart failure. Her blood pressure while lying down and standing up is slightly different on her right arm compared to her left arm. Additional examinations including 12-lead surface ECG and Doppler echocardiography are found to be normal.
Further investigations show that Mrs. AMS has hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels), which could potentially contribute to her symptoms. She is prescribed magnesium supplementation as well as atenolol, which is a beta-blocker medication used to control heart rate and rhythm disorders.
However, after some time, Mrs. AMS experiences recurring symptoms such as chest tightness, palpitations, lipothymia, discomfort, and dizziness despite the treatment regimen. A 24-hours Holter ECG reveals ventricular extrasystoles (abnormal heartbeats originating from the ventricles) and unsustained ventricular tachycardia (rapid heart rhythm).
To address these persistent symptoms, her medication regimen is modified with the introduction of amiodarone initially and later replacing it with higher doses of atenolol. This helps alleviate her symptoms temporarily but does not result in sustained improvement.
At this point in the case presentation, it becomes evident that Mrs. AMS becomes pregnant again despite experiencing these recurrent symptoms related to cardiac arrhythmias during pregnancy.
During the subsequent months of pregnancy leading up to admission into intensive care for severe symptoms, Mrs. AMS undergoes various treatments including the administration of potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate, acebutolol, enoxaparin (a blood-thinning medication), and nadolol. Each treatment aims to control her arrhythmia and prevent its recurrence.
Despite the modifications in her treatment regimen and prolonged hospitalizations, Mrs. AMS continued to experience ventricular tachycardia attacks until a combination of flecainide (an antiarrhythmic drug) and nadolol provided better control over her symptoms.
Eventually, she is referred to another country for advanced electrophysiological study which confirms the type of ventricular tachycardia she is experiencing - infundibular VT. This type of VT originates from an abnormal electrical pathway in the heart's right ventricle. The condition can be successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation, which is a procedure that destroys or scarring tissue responsible for generating abnormal electrical signals.
Following radiofrequency ablation treatment and discontinuation of antiarrhythmic drugs, Mrs. AMS experiences successful management of her condition without any cardiac complications throughout her pregnancy leading up to vaginal delivery.
Overall, this clinical case emphasizes the complexities involved in diagnosing and treating patients with cardiac arrhythmias during pregnancy. It highlights the challenges healthcare professionals encounter when managing such cases while prioritizing both maternal health and fetal well-being. Through appropriate investigations and interventions involving multiple medications as well as invasive procedures like radiofrequency ablation, successful outcomes can be achieved for both mother and child in such scenarios.
 
In these two clinical cases, both patients presented with symptoms that led to the suspicion of sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement.
In the first case, a 48-year-old woman had a history of Lofgren's syndrome and was presenting with symptoms such as palpitations and exertional dyspnea. Upon examination, she was hemodynamically stable, with no signs of peripheral cyanosis or jugular distension. Cardiac auscultation revealed rhythmic sounds without murmurs or friction rubs. No peripheral edema or deep vein thrombosis were observed. The admission electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal.
Further investigations revealed lymphopenia and an elevated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed regression of mediastinal lymphadenopathies without pleuroparenchymal lesion, suggesting the possibility of sarcoidosis with heart involvement.
To confirm this diagnosis, more specialized cardiac evaluation was performed. A 24-hour holter monitoring showed recurrent episodes of ventricular extrasystoles. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed evidence of fibrogranulomatous tissue consistent with sarcoidosis in the left ventricular regions. Technetium99m-sestamibi scintigraphy myocardial perfusion study also indicated reduced uptake in ventricular myocardium.
Coronary angiography and left ventriculography confirmed normal coronary arteries but did not explain the observed cardiac abnormalities seen on imaging studies. Given these findings along with a history suggestive of systemic sarcoidosis, a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis was made.
The patient received corticosteroids at an initial dose and gradually tapered over five months alongside supportive care. The progression throughout treatment has been favorable so far.
In Case 2, another 48-year-old woman presented to medical consultation complaining about intermittent palpitations and exertional dyspnea worsening over the past two weeks. She had a previous diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis, which was being treated with corticosteroids and antimalarial drugs.
On examination, she had a high pulse rate of 160 beats per minute but no signs of cardiac failure. Admission ECG revealed ventricular tachycardia at 160 cycles per minute. Further diagnostics including echocardiography, coronary angiography, and a cardiac electrophysiology study were performed.
The echocardiogram showed decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (FE), infiltration in the ventricular myocardium, and moderate mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography displayed normal coronary arteries. Laboratory tests did not indicate any relevant alterations apart from the symptoms related to sarcoidosis.
Given the absence of primary heart disease to explain the observed cardiac abnormalities and considering her history of systemic sarcoidosis, a diagnosis of sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement was made.
Treatment for this patient involved corticosteroids alongside supportive care. As recurrent ventricular tachycardia occurred despite amiodarone treatment, an automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was implanted to manage further arrhythmias.
In both cases presented above, sarcoidosis with cardiac involvement was suspected based on clinical symptoms along with specific laboratory findings and imaging studies that supported this diagnosis. Treatment included corticosteroids as the mainstay therapy along with additional interventions such as anti-arrhythmic drugs or ICD placement depending on individual patient needs.
It is crucial for healthcare providers to recognize these clinical features suggestive of cardiac sarcoidosis in patients who have already been diagnosed with systemic sarcoidosis or show classic signs and symptoms compatible with this condition. Early detection and appropriate management can help improve outcomes for these patients and prevent further complications related to heart involvement in sarcoid disease.
 
In the first clinical case, the patient initially presented with mild hypertension and normal renal function. However, she was lost to follow-up until 2011 when she sought medical attention for weight loss and poor health status.
At this point, the patient was prescribed diltiazem and prednisone. Four months later, she was referred to the nephrology department due to high blood pressure and oliguria (low urine output). On admission, her blood pressure was very elevated at 230/140 mm Hg, and a urinalysis showed proteinuria (presence of excess protein in the urine) and hematuria (presence of blood in the urine). Further investigations revealed a significant amount of proteinuria (3.5 g in 24 hours), anemia with low hemoglobin levels (7 g/dl), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), signs indicative of congestive heart failure on cardiovascular examination, hypertensive retinopathy on retinal examination, impaired renal function with elevated creatinine and blood urea levels, hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels) as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase levels.
The renal sonography showed normal-sized kidneys but poor corticomedullary differentiationâa finding that can indicate underlying kidney pathology. Due to severe hypertension and complications like thrombocytopenia correction became necessary; thus Nicardipine IV perfusion treatment along with hemodialysis were started promptly. The patient also received a blood transfusion due to anemia.
The initial treatment plan included captopril three times daily for controlling hypertension after discontinuation/tapering of prednisone. To further investigate the underlying cause of these symptoms, a renal needle biopsy was performed. The histopathologic examination revealed partial cortical hemorrhagic necrosis which extended to glomerular basement membrane along with mesangial thickening characterized by edema.
Moving on to the second clinical case, a 32-year-old woman with no significant past medical history was admitted for dyspnea, low level of consciousness, oliguria, and focal neurological signs. She had recently given birth vaginally. The patient also reported diffuse joint pain (arthralgia), Raynaud's phenomenon (reduced blood flow to extremities in response to cold or stress), and thickening of the skin on fingers since about a year ago.
On physical examination, her blood pressure was highly elevated at 250/130 mm Hg. She presented with beaklike facies and sausage-shaped fingers and toesâsigns suggestive of acromegaly (enlargement of facial features and extremities). Hypopigmentation in a salt-and-pepper pattern was observed on the abdomen and back.
Laboratory tests revealed severe renal insufficiency with high creatinine levels, normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia along with positive anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-scleroderma-70 antibodies. Ultrasonography showed poor corticomedullary differentiationâa feature shared with the first caseâalongside echogenic renal cortices without dilation of the pelvicalyceal system.
Chest x-ray displayed an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) as well as reticulonodular lesions predominantly in the lower segments of the right lung. Echocardiography revealed severe pulmonary hypertensionâa condition where there is abnormally high blood pressure within arteries that supply blood to lungsâand left ventricular dysfunction.
The patient received captopril treatment and started hemodialysis simultaneously. While her blood pressure improved following treatment initiation, her renal function did not recover well. Renal biopsy confirmed thrombotic microangiopathyâan abnormality affecting small blood vesselsâwhich could have been responsible for affecting kidney function.
Due to financial constraints preventing immunosuppressive therapy, the patient underwent dialysis for three months. Unfortunately, she developed ischemic necrosis in her right second toe during this period. Eventually, the patient's renal function partially recovered, leading to discontinuation of dialysis.
In both cases, kidney involvement was observed with significant hypertension and renal insufficiency. The histopathologic findings in the renal biopsies suggested different underlying causes: hemorrhagic necrosis and mesangial thickening in case one, and thrombotic microangiopathy in case two. These cases highlight the importance of prompt diagnosis and management of kidney-related conditions to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes.
 
Clinical Case 1:
The first clinical case involves a patient who has presented with various symptoms and findings suggestive of advanced liver disease. The laboratory findings reveal low hemoglobin levels (Hct: 38.4%) and low platelet count (109,000 mm3), which are typical of cirrhosis. The liver function tests, specifically amylase (1523 U/L) and lipase (1254 U/L), are elevated, indicating pancreatitis. Furthermore, the presence of HbsAg suggests an active hepatitis B infection.
Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrates a cirrhotic appearance of the liver and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly). Gastroscopy reveals the presence of grade III esophageal varices, which are dilated veins in the esophagus often associated with portal hypertension.
Dynamic contrasted abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts, suggesting biliary obstruction or cholestasis. There is also an intense arterial phase contrast in a mass located in the fourth segment of the left lobe of the liver measuring 10x8 cm.
MR angiography further reveals thrombus formation within the portal vein left branch. A biopsy performed on this mass confirms focal nodular hyperplasia rather than hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Tenofovir is prescribed to manage HBV infection.
Endoscopic ultrasonography then demonstrates a mass measuring 10 cm in diameter within the left lobe of the liver along with thrombus formation within the portal vein. A biopsy taken from both sites confirms HCC diagnosis.
The patient undergoes radiofrequency embolization for HCC treatment and remains under close medical supervision.
Clinical Case 2:
In this second case, a male patient diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B had previously undergone surgical removal for a small tumor identified as HCC five years ago. However, he now presents with abdominal pain. The patient's laboratory results show abnormal liver function test findings, such as elevated aminotransferases (AST: 92 U/L, ALT: 89 U/L) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP: 139 U/L). Additionally, high gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (386 U/L) indicate cholestasis.
Abdominal tomography reveals a solid mass in the left lobe of the liver next to the lateral segment anterior. This mass measures 80x52 mm and exhibits arterial phase enhancement but lacks wash-out characteristics typically seen in HCC. Angiography of the abdomen confirms thrombus formation within the portal vein left branch.
The patient undergoes endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy on both the liver mass and portal vein thrombus, which confirms HCC diagnosis for both specimens. Radiofrequency embolization is performed as treatment for HCC.
Clinical Case 3:
The third case involves an elderly male diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B who has been receiving lamivudine treatment for four years. He presents with complaints of leg swelling, fatigue, joint pain, and mild edema.
Laboratory tests demonstrate mild abnormalities in liver function tests including elevated aminotransferases (AST: 81 U/L, ALT: 95 U/L). There are also marginal decreases in hemoglobin levels (Hct:30.2%) and platelet count slightly below normal limits (213,000 mm3).
Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging reveals a cirrhotic liver with two distinct masses; one lesion measuring 70x45 mm on the seventh segment of the right lobe and another centrally located lesion measuring 25x20 mm extending to the inferior vena cava causing tumor thrombus formation within this vessel.
Endoscopic ultrasound detects two masses on segments seven and eight of the liver along with extension of thrombus into the inferior vena cava. Biopsy of the thrombus confirms HCC diagnosis.
The patient undergoes radiofrequency embolization for HCC treatment and requires close follow-up.
In summary, all three cases involve patients with chronic hepatitis B who subsequently develop HCC. The management includes antiviral therapy, embolization procedures, and ongoing surveillance to monitor disease progression and response to treatment. 
In this clinical case, we are presented with a young white man who initially had no history of addiction or alcohol consumption. His cognitive function assessment was normal, but genetic studies were not available due to limited techniques in Tunisia.
The patient was described as emotionally cold, with an increased interest in studies compared to leisure activities. Two years ago, the patient suddenly developed soliloquy (talking to oneself), verbal aggressiveness towards his parents, persecution delusions, mystical talk, and sleep disturbance.
Upon physical examination, the patient was found to be moving in a wheelchair due to functional impairment secondary to the severity of extrapyramidal syndrome affecting his limbs. However, his consciousness was clear without any confusion. Neurological examination revealed rotatory nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) and dystonia (abnormal muscle tone) of the hands and feet.
Psychiatric examination showed that the patient had difficulty maintaining good contact but appeared anxious and suspicious. His speech was poor in content and barely understandable due to dysarthria (speech disorder). He reported a fuzzy and non-systematized delusion: believing that he was the prophet "Noah" charged with a divine mission to change the world functioning. He also believed he was persecuted by strangers collaborating with his parents who wanted him dead. The patient experienced auditory and visual hallucinations.
MRI findings showed signal abnormalities in the central gray nucleus or basal ganglia similar to those observed five years earlier. Routine blood tests including complete blood count (CBC), blood sedimentation reaction (BSR), liver and renal function assessments, serum electrolytes were all normal. An electroencephalogram also showed no abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and blood lactate levels were within normal ranges.
The treatment plan began with prescribing amisulpiride in small doses combined with a benzodiazepine for anxiety control and biperiden hydrochloride as a corrector of extrapyramidal effects. Higher doses of antipsychotics were not well-tolerated due to significant side effects, leading to a switch to aripiprazole gradually.
With the use of aripiprazole, the patient showed improvement and was well-tolerated without any neurological deterioration. As there were still persistent positive symptoms, anxiety, and behavioral corollaries such as distrust of his parents, refusal of food prepared by them, and insomnia; valproic acid and clonazepam were added after 6 weeks of treatment.
Although the clinical improvement was only partial after 6 months of treatment with this combination, it allowed for acceptable interfamily adaptation. Another switch in medication was made to olanzapine while maintaining valproic acid and clonazepam. This new combination resulted in partial remission and continued maintenance.
It is interesting to note that clozapine has not been tried in this case. Clozapine is often considered when other antipsychotic medications fail or are poorly tolerated by patients. It may be an option worth considering if the current treatment regimen does not yield satisfactory results.
In conclusion, this clinical case highlights a young man presenting with delusions, hallucinations, extrapyramidal symptoms (as seen through movement impairment), cognitive functioning within normal range but genetic testing unattainable due to limited techniques available locally (in Tunisia). The patient showed partial remission with different medication switches over time but remained partially symptomatic even after six months of treatment. 
In this clinical case, we encounter a patient who experienced deterioration in her health following delivery. The patient initially showed signs of confusion and decreased conscious level, prompting her transfer to a referral hospital for further assessment and treatment.
Upon arrival at the referral hospital, an intern doctor evaluated the patient and made a provisional diagnosis of sepsis with an unknown origin. This diagnosis led to the initiation of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and fluid replacement therapy. However, it is concerning that no formal observations or documentation were recorded regarding the patient's conscious level or response to treatment during this time.
The following day, another healthcare professional reviewed the patient's condition after more than 48 hours since delivery. At this point, vital signs indicated an increased pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, elevated respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, blood pressure measuring 110/75 mmHg, and low oxygen saturation levels at 82% on room air. Unfortunately, no temperature was recorded due to a lack of available equipment in the unit.
Further assessment revealed clinical signs of dehydration such as concentrated urine along with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score indicating decreased consciousness (GCS=7). On physical examination, bilateral basal crepitations were heard over the chest while heart sounds appeared normal. The abdomen was distended upon palpation. Vaginal examination showed minimal lochia without any offensive odor.
The healthcare team promptly responded by providing oxygen therapy using nasal prongs at the highest available concentration (4L/min), resulting in improved oxygen saturation levels up to 92%. Intravenous antibiotics were administered while fluid resuscitation continued with infusions totaling 2 liters of normal saline solution. To investigate further complications within the abdominal region suggestive of sepsis or uterine rupture, an abdominal ultrasound scan was performed swiftly.
Despite efforts to swiftly diagnose and manage this complex situation after identifying significant free fluid/haemoperitoneum on the abdominal ultrasound, the diagnosis shifted towards sepsis with possible uterine rupture. Consequently, a decision was made to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy.
During the surgery, a sub-umbilical midline incision was made, revealing significant blood-stained ascites (approximately 2-3 liters) and sloughy exudate throughout the intra-abdominal organs. Additionally, an identified posterior uterine rupture around 7cm in width was observed. The specific site of rupture remained low (1-2cm above internal os of cervix), without extending into the cervix or vagina laterally. To address both viability concerns and location of the rupture, a sub-total hysterectomy was performed while thoroughly irrigating and closing the abdomen.
In subsequent hours after surgery, despite improved urine output due to intravenous fluid administration, there was no improvement in conscious level for this patient; rather her condition further deteriorated with GCS scores dropping from 7 to 5 and then continuing down to 3. From that point onwards, treatment mainly focused on palliative care measures until she unfortunately succumbed to her illness several days later.
This clinical case highlights several important aspects in patient care: timely recognition and documentation of deterioration following delivery; prompt initiation of appropriate investigations such as ultrasound scans; early diagnosis and treatment interventions for sepsis or suspected uterine ruptures; meticulous surgical management including exploration via laparotomy when necessary; monitoring conscious level closely post-operatively along with other vital signs for comprehensive assessment of patient's condition.
It is crucial for healthcare providers involved in similar cases to emphasize thorough documentation throughout all stages of patient encounters. This facilitates effective communication between healthcare professionals involved in their care as well as ensuring accurate recording for future reference purposes. Additionally, continuous monitoring efforts involving multiple parameters must be carefully evaluated when addressing complex medical conditions like sepsis or potential surgical emergencies such as uterine ruptures.
In conclusion, this case underlines the importance of early recognition, appropriate investigation, intervention, and a multidisciplinary approach in managing deteriorating patients. It also serves as a reminder highlighting the significance of consistent documentation to facilitate effective communication and contribute to improved patient outcomes. 
Title: Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) in Systemic Sclerosis: A Clinical Case Study
Introduction:
In this clinical case, we present a patient with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (SSc) who developed symptoms of Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD). TMD is a group of conditions characterized by pain and dysfunction in the jaw joint and muscles that control jaw movement. The patient's symptoms gradually worsened over time, leading to seeking specialized consultation. This article will highlight the diagnostic approach, treatment strategies, and outcomes observed in managing TMD in this particular case.
Case Presentation:
The patient had a medical history of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis diagnosed three years ago. She was receiving various medications for SSc including methotrexate, colchicine, amlodipine, methylprednisolone, cholecalciferol, sulodexide, acidumfolicum and Lysinacetylsalicylas. One year after her initial diagnosis with SSc, she started experiencing temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and muscle-related symptoms which gradually worsened.
Physical Examination Findings:
On physical examination of the orofacial region, the patient exhibited several characteristic features associated with SSc including masklike facies with smooth and tight facial skin devoid of normal animation lines. Additionally,sclerodactyly complicated by digital ulcers affecting mainly her hands was noted. Furthermore,lung fibrosis causing moderate lung impairment led to flexion contracture and claw-like deformity.
A thorough evaluation revealed limitation of finger movements suggesting scleroderma involvement.Extensive palpation indicated bilateral stiffness in masticatory muscles upon palpation as well as restricted mandibular movements such as mouth opening limited to 23mm,and deviation towards right side.Moreover,painful TMJ palpation predominantly on right side was reported.Restricted condylar movementon the affected side was also identified.
Diagnostic Assessment:
To evaluate the TMJ and potential masticatory muscle fibrosis, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed in both open-mouth and closed-mouth positions. The findings showed internal derangement of TMJ, bilateral mandibular condylar process resorption,and disk deformations with a heterogeneous appearance. Bilateral mandibular condylar processes exhibited subchondral geodes and thinned cortical bone on sagittal and coronal views of MRI. Hypomobility in open mouth position was observed suggesting functional impairment.A notable observation was the absence of masticatory muscle fibrosis.
Diagnosis and Treatment:
A diagnosis of Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) with arthralgia and myalgia related to SSc was made based on the clinical features along with radiological evidence from MRI scan.
The treatment approach consisted of an association of conservative techniques aimed at alleviating pain, improving muscle function, and restoring jaw movements. Initially,the patient received rest, reassurance, and jaw-opening exercises to manage painful joints.A myorelaxant medication was prescribed for a 10-day period to alleviate myofascial pain.Additionally,a 6-month physical therapy program comprising massage treatment on bilateral masseteric muscles,temporalis muscles exercises,and ultrasound therapy were recommended.Physiotherapy interventions were intended for managing musculoskeletal and myofacial pain as well as enhancing jaw movement.
Evaluation & Outcomes:
Monthly reviews were conducted to monitor progress regarding reduction in pain intensity levelsand improvement in jaw movements.Follow-up after two months revealed substantial improvement including an increase in mouth opening capacity from 23mm to 33mm.In addition,pain associated with preauricular region dissipated gradually.Participation in physical therapy played a significant role leading to improved muscle flexibility; however,some residual rigidity remained due to SSc-induced skin fibrosis.
To stabilize the achieved results and provide additional support, a relaxant nocturnal occlusal appliance (commonly known as a night guard) was recommended.The patient reported satisfaction with this treatment modality, enabling sustained positive outcomes.
Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights the successful management of Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) in a patient with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (SSc). A multidisciplinary approach involving rest, reassurance, jaw-opening exercises, myorelaxants, and physical therapy resulted in improved pain control, increased jaw mobility,and better quality of life. Close monitoring and regular evaluations were essential components in achieving favorable outcomes for the patient. This case emphasizes the importance of tailored treatment strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration towards managing TMD in individuals with SSc. 
This clinical case presents a patient with a complex medical and dental history. The patient had a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes, both of which were being managed with medication. Four years ago, the patient received treatment from an ENT doctor for nasal myiasis, where maggots were removed through surgical debridement.
Recently, the patient underwent imaging tests of the brain that revealed a space-occupying lesion in the left temporal region. This lesion was diagnosed as a meningioma based on its characteristics on computed tomography (CT) scans.
Following this diagnosis, the patient was admitted to a private dental hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The multidisciplinary team informed the patient about the treatment plan and obtained informed consent before proceeding with surgery under general anesthesia. Maxillectomy, which is the surgical removal of part or all of the maxilla bone (upper jaw), was performed on the left side.
After surgery, regular debridements were carried out over two months to clean and care for the surgical wound. Sterile cultures were obtained from the wound to monitor for any signs of infection. Based on findings from these examinations and assessments, including intraoral examination, a provisional diagnosis of osteomyelitis (inflammation or infection of bone tissue) in relation to the surgical defect was given.
Other potential diagnoses considered included tuberculosis, squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer), tertiary syphilis (advanced stage syphilis), fungal infections such as aspergillosis or mucormycosis.
To further evaluate intraoral findings and confirm diagnosis, radiographic investigations such as panoramic radiograph (providing an overview image of teeth and jaw bones) and computed tomography were advised. These revealed multiple missing teeth in both maxillary arches along with significant changes consistent with previous left maxillectomy surgery.
Computed tomography also identified sinusitis involving left ethmoidal/sphenoidal sinuses and residual changes associated with osteomyelitis involving left pterygoid plates (part of the skull) and posterior wall of maxillary antrum (sinus cavity). The inflammatory marker erythrocyte sedimentation rate was increased, indicating ongoing inflammation in the body. Additionally, glycosylated hemoglobin levels were elevated, suggesting that diabetes mellitus was not well-controlled.
An incisional biopsy was performed to further investigate the suspected osteomyelitis. The sample obtained from the left maxillary antrum revealed both bacterial and fungal growth upon culture sensitivity testing. Periodic acid Schiff staining demonstrated large non-septate fungal hyphae branching at right angles
Histopathological examination of the specimen showed cellular connective tissue stroma with mixed inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and lymphocytes. Numerous large non-septate fungal hyphae were observed, along with areas of necrosis and super-added bacterial infection. This combination of findings led to a final diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis with mucormycosis.
To address this complex condition, the patient underwent extensive unilateral endoscopic nasosinusal surgery, which involved debridement (removal) of infected tissue in the left maxillary sinus, anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells, as well as extensive removal of invaded mucosa under general anesthesia.
Surgical intervention included excision of fungal masses and necrotic slough from both left maxillary sinus and sphenoidal sinus. Necrotic mucosa was removed until healthy margins were visible. Liposomal amphotericin B antifungal medication was initiated immediately after surgery. Initially administered at 5 mg/kg dosage adjusted to 7.5 mg/kg after three weeks.
Additionally, hyperbaric oxygen therapy comprising 21 sessions lasting 150 minutes each were provided to enhance treatment outcomes over a period four weeks along with systemic delivery (oral administration) antifungal drugs.
Post-operative follow-up visits showed negative cultures, meaning no signs of infection were detected. The patient was provided with an acrylic obturator, a dental prosthesis designed to fill the surgical defect and restore oral function. Soft liners were utilized to ensure a comfortable fit for the patient.
In summary, this clinical case presented a patient with chronic osteomyelitis and mucormycosis following previous maxillectomy surgery. A multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, and dental professionals was utilized to diagnose and manage this complex condition. 
This clinical case is quite complex, involving multiple fractures and various medical conditions. Let's break it down step by step.
The patient in question experienced several fractures throughout his body. Initially, he had surgery for fractures in his left femur (thigh bone) and right humerus (upper arm bone). While rehabilitating using a walking frame after this surgery, he sustained a fracture of his left humerus. Subsequently, he sustained a combination of right femoral (thigh bone) and tibia (shinbone) fractures while weight-bearing on his right lower limb to board a vehicle.
It was then discovered that the patient had hyperparathyroidism, which could have contributed to these subsequent fractures. The diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism was considered due to the patient's history of weakness, generalized bone and joint pains preceding the first fracture by about one year.
Additionally, the patient presented other symptoms such as cloudy urine and epigastric pain. These symptoms were previously informally diagnosed as gastritis caused by chronic ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Prior to these recent fractures, the patient had already undergone open reduction and internal fixation for the initial two fractures under general anesthesia. Unfortunately, during intubation for one of these procedures, the patient sustained a mandibular fracture.
Furthermore, it is important to note that the patient had received multiple blood transfusions on separate occasions prior to this current presentation.
Several findings were observed during physical examination: The patient appeared wasted with reduced muscle bulk overall. There were frontal bursing and multiple bony swellings on their lower jaw without an obvious neck mass present. Additionally, there were healed scars on their right arm and left thigh with decreased range of movement at both shoulder joints and hip joints.
Upon examination of their lower limb where they sustained recent injuries while boarding a vehicle onto their leading limb (right side), swelling was noted at both upper/middle and midshaft regions of the thigh. These areas were tender to touch. No external bleeding, bruises, or abrasions were observed.
Laboratory investigations revealed significantly elevated serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels. Specifically, their serum calcium concentration was 3.17mmol/l (normal range: 2.15-2.55 mmol/l) and alkaline phosphatase level was 260 I.U/l (normal: 40-129 I.U/l). However, all other electrolytes and the complete blood count were within normal limits.
Scouting X-rays showed evidence of both healed and healing fractures in addition to the clinically evident long bone fractures. Urinalysis revealed a presence of hematuria (blood in urine), graded as 2+.
Further imaging studies were conducted to better understand the patient's condition: Neck ultrasound demonstrated an enlarged left lower parathyroid gland, which was likely contributing to hyperparathyroidism symptoms; abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple kidney stones, potentially related to the increased serum calcium levels observed.
Parathyroid hormone levels in his blood were also measured with results showing a markedly elevated level of 202.8 pmol/l (normal range: 1.6-6.9 pmol/l). To pinpoint the exact source of abnormal parathyroid hormone secretion, a nuclear medicine study known as ^99mTc Sestamibi parathyroid scintigraphy was performed revealing increased focal uptake.
Following these investigations and confirming primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma located in the left inferior parathyroid gland, surgical excision was performed under cervical block anesthesia with minimal sedation using local anesthesia at that region alone.
The surgically removed mass measured approximately 7 by 4 cm and weighed approximately 32 g; histological examination confirmed it as a parathyroid adenoma consistent with findings from imaging studies.
However, postoperatively, the patient experienced a sudden and persistent drop in serum calcium levels, necessitating continuous infusion of calcium gluconate to restore and maintain normal serum calcium concentrations.
After 15 months since the operation, the patient is now an outpatient undergoing rehabilitation. They are pain-free, more mobile in terms of physical activity, and their serum calcium levels have remained within the normal range.
In conclusion, this clinical case involved a young man who presented with multiple fractures and various symptoms suggestive of hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause was identified as a parathyroid adenoma located within his left inferior parathyroid gland. Following surgical removal of the adenoma, he experienced temporary hypocalcemia but has subsequently recovered well with normal serum calcium levels. 
Clinical Case 1:
The patient presented with symptoms suggestive of infective endocarditis (IE), which was confirmed by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The absence of an annular abscess indicated a specific type of IE. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 14,500 mm3, indicating an inflammatory response to infection. The hemoglobin concentration was low at 9.3 g/l, suggesting the presence of anemia. Creatinine levels were slightly elevated at 92 Î¼mol/l, indicating some impairment in kidney function. C-reactive protein levels were significantly elevated at 123 mg/dl, pointing towards ongoing inflammation.
Further investigations were conducted to rule out any neurological involvement. Computed topographic scan results showed no abnormalities in the head region.
Blood cultures initially grew Staphylococcus aureus, confirming the bacterial etiology of IE. As a result, antibiotic treatment with Oxacillin and gentamicin was initiated and led to symptom improvement within 72 hours.
However, four days after admission, the patient experienced sudden-onset substernal chest pain. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings showed ST segment elevation in leads V3-V4, which is consistent with myocardial ischemia or injury. Emergency echocardiography revealed the disappearance of vegetation on the mitral valve.
Coronary angiography performed during this acute episode demonstrated complete occlusion in the distal tract of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery while all other coronary arteries were unaffected by stenosis or atherosclerotic lesions. Prompt management involved aspirating thrombus from the occluded vessel leading to restoration of normal blood flow once again (TIMI flow grade 3).
Following this interventional procedure, both patient complaints and ECG changes improved significantly over time suggesting effective treatment intervention for acute coronary artery occlusion related to IE.
Finally,due completion off six weeks of antibiotic treatment, the patient was discharged.
 
Clinical Case 2:
The second case involves a 72-year-old male patient with a history of rheumatic heart disease and presenting with an initial complaint of fever and lethargy lasting for two months. The patient had coronary risk factors including age and hypertension.
Laboratory tests revealed significant inflammation with elevated C-reactive protein levels at 178 mg/l, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response. Anemia was also identified with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dl, suggesting potential underlying issues. Renal function was within normal limits.
Peripheral blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, confirming bacterial involvement in this case as well.
Transthoracic echocardiography showed the presence of a large circumferential periaortic abscess along with moderate aortic regurgitation based on doppler findings. Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed these observations.
Additional imaging studies were performed to assess other potential complications related to infective endocarditis. A computed tomographic scan revealed no abnormalities in the head region, while an abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated the presence of a mycotic aneurysm measuring 13 mm in one branch of the superior mesenteric artery.
Three days after admission, worsening chest pain was reported by the patient. Electrocardiogram findings showed significant anterior ST depression pattern indicating myocardial ischemia/infarction-like changes occurred during this acute episode.Of note,the troponin I level rose significantly to 5.3 ng/ml signifying myocardial injury secondary to impaired blood supply or demand imbalance .
Emergency coronary angiography demonstrated narrowing in both left main and LAD arteries indicative compromised flow in critical vessels.Due to complex coronary anatomy highlighting obstructive lesions situated next to vast perianneurysmal flow cavity,a multidisciplinary team decided terminated surgical intervention given poor prognosis despite attempts Intraoperative findings showed a large aortic root abscess compressing both the left main and LAD arteries. Surgical management involved obligating the abscess cavity, replacing the aortic valve with a bioprosthesis, reconstructing the annulus using pericardium, and performing a single aortocoronary bypass graft utilizing the left internal mammary artery.
Post-surgical management demonstrated considerable difficulty in weaning the patient off bypass machine/support system despite intra-aortic balloon pumping, high-dose catecholamine support,joint implementation of multiguideline,drugs regime and vigorous antibiotics. Unfortunately,the patient's condition deteriorated further,and he ultimately succumbed to complications after 48 hours following surgery.
In summary, these two clinical cases illustrate different presentations and complications associated with infective endocarditis. While both cases involved Staphylococcus aureus infections leading to systemic symptoms and vascular complications, individual patient characteristics and specific anatomical involvement resulted in distinct clinical courses with varying outcomes for each case.
 
Case Study: Anti-SRP Antibody Myopathy
Anti-SRP antibody myopathy is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and damage to skeletal muscles. In this case, we have two observations of a Senegalese woman with a history of anti-SRP antibody myopathy.
Observation 1:
In the first observation, the patient presented with muscle weakness and elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level, an enzyme released from damaged muscles. The absence of Babinski sign and systemic symptoms ruled out central nervous system involvement or generalized manifestations.
Laboratory tests revealed increased CPK level along with positive C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), indicating inflammation in the body. The presence of anti-parietal cell and anti-SRP antibodies confirmed the diagnosis of anti-SRP antibody myopathy. Other autoantibodies such as anti-JO1 and antinuclear antibodies were negative, except for insignificant levels of anti-SSA antibodies.
Further infectious serologies came back negative ruling out common infections like HIV, hepatitis A, B, and C among others. Toxoplasmosis IgG was detected but not IgM suggesting prior exposure rather than an active infection. Epstein Barr virus serology indicated previous infection while the presence of anti-HBs antibodies suggested vaccination against hepatitis B.
Endocrine tests including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), estradiol, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) were all within normal range. A standard short synacthen test was negative ruling out adrenal insufficiency.
Cardiac ultrasound appeared normal given no cardiovascular involvement during examination. Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed hypersignal in pelvic and thigh muscles indicative of inflammatory myopathy. Electromyogram showed a pure myogenic pattern, confirming muscle damage.
A surgical muscle biopsy performed on the left thigh further confirmed inflammatory myopathy as it revealed muscular alterations. The final diagnosis was established as anti-SRP antibody myopathy.
Due to worsening muscle weakness, the patient was readmitted where laboratory tests still showed high CPK levels and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). Further treatment consisted of Methylprednisolone and Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG), which were well tolerated with a decrease in CPK levels post IVIG administration. However, there was no regression in muscle weakness, and the patient was discharged with continued corticosteroid and associated treatment.
Observation 2:
In the second observation, the same patient presented again with muscle pain and weakness of lower limbs that had started five months prior to hospitalization. The symptoms began seven months after her previous delivery. During pregnancy, she had stopped treatment for her anti-SRP antibody myopathy without significant change.
Clinical examination revealed muscle paresis of both lower limbs with reduced muscular strength proximally but retained strength distally. Reflexes like knee jerk, ankle jerk reflexes, and idiomuscular response were absent bilaterally along with no Babinski sign observed.
Laboratory tests demonstrated high CPK level along with elevated liver enzymes once again. CRP was positive while creatinine level was low but serum electrolyte levels remained normal. Repeat laboratory tests from an earlier date still indicated significantly elevated CPK levels accompanied by positive CRP values and increased ESR at the first hour.
Anti-SRP antibodies were present while other autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibodies and anti-JO1 antibodies remained negative. Infectious serologies ruled out common infections like HIV-1&2 or hepatitis B that could contribute to similar symptoms.
Hormonal tests including TSH, ACTH, prolactin, FSH, LH were all within normal range. Cardiac ultrasound showed no abnormalities. Electromyogram demonstrated a pure myogenic pattern consistent with muscle damage.
Treatment in this observation consisted of Solumedrol (Methylprednisolone) with three doses given to the patient. The treatment was well tolerated both clinically and biologically, but there was no improvement in muscle paresis observed even after discharge on corticosteroid and associated treatment.
In conclusion, anti-SRP antibody myopathy is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle inflammation and damage leading to weakness and elevated CPK levels. Despite immunosuppressive treatments such as corticosteroids and IVIG being administered, regression of symptoms can be challenging in some cases like the ones described here. Further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology of this condition and develop more effective treatment strategies. 
Clinical Case: Metastatic Leiomyosarcoma 
This clinical case involves a patient who presented with exaggerated reflexes in the lower limbs. Local examination of the spine revealed tenderness in the right paravertebral area at the T12-L1 level, associated with a subcutaneous fixed mass. Imaging studies including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine were performed.
The findings from these imaging studies showed multiple metastases that involved various parts of the spine. Specifically, there was involvement of the posterior part of the vertebral body at T5, with rupture of the posterior wall; The posterior elements of T12 and L1 vertebrae were affected, with a tissue mass causing bone lysis and severe compression on the spinal cord, extending into the paravertebral region; Additionally, there was involvement of S1 vertebral body with lysis, invasion into the right spinal canal and extension to pre-vertebral area.
On MRI scans, these lesions appeared iso-to hypo-intense to bone on T1 weighted images and heterogeneous on T2 weighted images with multiple hyperintense foci. Contrast enhancement was intense and heterogeneous as well. The CT scan confirmed bone lysis in these affected areas.
Further investigations including CT scans of brain, cervical, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic regions were conducted along with systemic investigations looking for any primary tumoral lesion but all turned out negative. This suggested that these findings were most likely due to metastases rather than originating from a primary tumor site elsewhere in her body.
Given severe symptoms mainly related to compression at T12-L1 level while no other apparent distant metastasis found outside skeletal sites or CNS involvement like brain or spinal cord lesions responsible for exaggerated reflexes thus requiring immediate surgical intervention before pose major threat , it was decided to proceed with surgical intervention aimed at decompression at this level alongwith instrumented fixation using screws.In addition, due to history of lumbosacral radiculopathy , similar procedure was also performed at S1 level for which sacral decompression achieved using hemilaminectomy, curettage of the sacral body and radicular decompression. During surgery, it was observed that the tumor had invaded into the paravertebral muscles and appeared as a multi-lobulated firm mass with a white-reddish appearance. The tumor was not encapsulated but easily differentiated from the surrounding tissues. The bone lysis was evident and compression on the spinal cord was severe, however, dura matter infiltration was absent.
Postoperatively, the patient showed improvement in motor score and regained control over urinary function. She received rehabilitation therapy alongside adjuvant therapy under oncology unit careening hope that these interventions would help control further progression of her metastatic disease.
 Unfortunately, one month after discharge, the patient presented with persistent headaches. Local examination revealed tenderness in the right frontal area of the skull convexity. A CT scan was performed and it showed a small lytic lesion in the frontal bone extending into the subcutaneous tissue, without dural extension.
A small craniectomy around the lesion was performed and histopathological analysis confirmed that it was consistent with metastatic leiomyosarcoma, similar to the previous findings in her spine. This finding indicated that her cancer had spread to her skull.
At one year follow-up, despite receiving adjuvant therapy, it became evident that it failed to control or halt tumor progression. Both local and systemic progression were observed on thoracic and abdominopelvic CT scans.
While there was continuous improvement in motor function leading to regained self-dependency, unfortunately, her general condition continued to deteriorate due to advancing cancer. At this point, palliative treatment options were assessed for providing relief from symptoms associated with advanced metastatic disease.
Despite medical intervention efforts aimed at controlling the disease progression and managing symptoms as best as possible for quality of life preservation ,unfortunately ,the patient succumbed to her illness two years after her initial management.
The final histopathology report confirmed a grade 3 leiomyosarcoma of FNCLCC (French Federation Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer) classification system which indicates aggressive malignant behavior of this sarcoma subtype based upon characteristics such as mitotic activity,tumor necrosis,presence/absence of elevated nuclear atypia .
Immunohistochemical staining yielded important results indicating cellular origin.Outcomes revealed positive staining for smooth muscle actin,a marker characteristic for smooth muscle cell lineage . Flawless reactivity against EMA (Epithelial Membrane Antigen )further pointed towards potential epithelial like phenotype however absence of S100 protein CD34 staining ruled out neurogenic and vascular origins respectively.
This case demonstrates the aggressive nature of metastatic leiomyosarcoma. The initial presentation with exaggerated reflexes and subsequent imaging findings revealed extensive metastatic involvement in the spine.
Surgical intervention provided temporary relief in terms of improved motor function and control over urinary capacity, but unfortunately, the disease continued to progress both locally in the spine and systemically. Metastasis to the skull further complicated her condition.
Despite efforts to manage symptoms through adjuvant therapy, tumor control was not achievable, resulting in a decline in her overall health status. Ultimately, palliative treatment was offered to improve quality of life as best as possible for remaining time.
This case underscores the importance of prompt diagnosis, comprehensive staging investigations , early surgical intervention , complete histopathological evaluation considering immunohistochemical panel availability allowing for determination of cellular lineage confirming tissue origin thus aiding accurate grading helping predict prognosis.Ongoing research endeavors are aimed at finding more effective treatment options for advanced leiomyosarcoma cases to improve overall outcomes and survival rates. 
This clinical case involves a patient who presented with unclear origins of symptoms. The initial evaluation through ultrasound did not reveal any free fluid in the abdomen, and the patient was otherwise stable with no fever or hemodynamic instability. Routine blood tests, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, and pregnancy test were all normal. Despite these inconclusive findings, the patient was admitted to the ward for pain management.
The following day, an abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed to further investigate the cause of the patient's symptoms. The CT scan showed a sausage-like cystic mass extending from the pelvis up to the hepatic flexure of the colon. As a result, there was displacement of the cecum which became ante-flexed over the ascending colon. However, there were no lesions identified in the liver or lymphadenopathy observed. The length of this mass measured 17.27 cm with a maximum diameter of 5.28 cm.
Based on careful analysis by both surgeon and radiologist reviewing this imaging technique, an initial impression was made that suggested an appendiceal mucocele as being responsible for these findings.
Given this diagnosis, it was decided that a semi-elective right hemi-colectomy would be performed to remove affected tissues and prevent potential complications from arising in future.
During surgery exploration revealed a massively distended appendix pushing onto redundant cecal end reaching up to hepatic flexure of colon while its tip extended into right iliac fossaÂ area directly located below caeca ileocecal valveÂ (Figure1). No metastatic processes or other malignancies were noted upon examination nor gynecological areas seemed affected during investigation
The distended appendix itself exhibited no apparent leakages nor adhesionsÂ with nearby structures making isolation easier for performing necessary surgical manipulations without damaging tissues further (Figure2). Right hemicolectomy involved careful handling that avoided rupture or leakage within the appendix while ensuring negative margins were maintained. Finally, a stapled functional end-to-end ileo-colic anastomosis was performed.
Post-operation, the patient experienced an uneventful recovery and was discharged from the hospital on day 6. Follow-up in the outpatient clinic six weeks later showed no complications or adverse events related to this procedure.
Histological examination of tissues obtained during surgery revealed a low-grade appendicular mucinous neoplasm with negative margins indicating complete removal of affected tissue with no involvement of nearby mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure3). The histopathology report further described certain distinguishing features including flattened epithelium located atop marked fibrosis surrounding focal dystrophic calcification across appendiceal wall seen at both medium and high power viewing levels (Figure4).
The presence of an intestinal type covering epithelium comprising crowded columnar cells with basal, hyperchromatic nuclei and large amounts of apical mucin further supported this diagnosis. Evidence of minimal dysplastic changes confirmed that these findings were consistent with appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.
It is important to note that fibrosis and chronic inflammation observed in histological sections are considered secondary changes resulting from luminal compression present in long-standing disease states like this one.
In conclusion, this clinical case involves a patient who presented initially without clear origins for her symptoms. However, careful evaluation through imaging techniques such as CT scan allowed for identification of a sausage-like cystic mass originating from the appendix termed as appendiceal mucocele. Subsequent surgical intervention through right hemi-colectomy successfully removed affected tissues without causing complications leading to a full recovery for the patient.
 
Clinical Case 1:
In this case, we have a pregnant patient who had a heart condition known as mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis is a narrowing of the mitral valve, which separates the left atrium from the left ventricle in the heart. It can lead to decreased blood flow through the valve and increased pressure in the left atrium.
Initially, the patient was offered percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty (PBV), which is a minimally invasive procedure to open up the narrowed valve using a balloon catheter. However, this procedure was not available, so an open commissurotomy was offered instead. Open commissurotomy involves surgically cutting through some of the fused leaflets of the mitral valve to improve blood flow.
The patient declined open commissurotomy due to concerns about risks associated with surgery during pregnancy. Instead, she was started on propranolol to treat her persistent tachycardia and on warfarin as prophylactic treatment for potential clot formation due to her heart condition.
During pregnancy, warfarin is generally not recommended due to potential risks to fetal development. Therefore, at 36 weeks gestation, she switched from warfarin to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). LMWH is an anticoagulant that does not cross the placenta easily and has less risk of causing birth defects compared to warfarin.
At 38 weeks gestation, an echocardiogram showed that her mitral valve area (MVA) had improved to 0.9cm2 and her ejection fraction (EF) was 58%. These measurements indicate that there was some improvement in blood flow through her mitral valve and her overall cardiac function.
Her functional status at this time was classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II, meaning she had mild symptoms and could perform ordinary physical activities without limitations.
An estimated fetal weight (EFW) of 1950g was determined, and evaluations of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) flow showed no abnormalities. In preparation for a required lapse period between the last dose of LMWH and an epidural procedure, she underwent elective induction of labor.
However, six hours after initiating labor induction, the patient developed fetal bradycardia, which is a slow heart rate in the fetus. This is a concerning sign, indicating that the fetus may not be tolerating labor well. As a result, an emergency caesarean section was performed under general anesthesia instead of using an epidural catheter that had been intended for established labor.
A live baby weighing 2020g was delivered successfully. Frusemide (a diuretic) and antibiotics were given to the patient peri-partum to manage any fluid overload or potential infection.
The patient was discharged from the hospital on day 7 on warfarin therapy and remained stable when reviewed by both her physician and obstetrician 14 days postpartum. However, four weeks postpartum she experienced shortness of breath, severe supraventricular tachycardia (rapid heart rate originating above the ventricles), hypotension (low blood pressure), leading to her unfortunate death three days later.
Clinical Case 2:
In this case, we have a pregnant patient known to have rheumatic heart disease with a mechanical mitral valve who was on warfarin therapy before her pregnancy. Rheumatic heart disease is caused by damage to the heart valves due to rheumatic fever â a complication of untreated streptococcal infections such as strep throat or scarlet fever.
Warfarin is commonly used as anticoagulant medication but can cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. Despite this, the patient continued her pregnancy against advice from her gynecologist and cardiologist.
At 20 weeks gestation, a fetal anomaly scan revealed severe abnormalities in the development of the fetus' brain. The ventricles of the brain were found to be severely dilated, and there was a lack of identifiable cortical brain tissue.
The radiological investigation confirmed a condition called hydraencephaly, which involves replacement of supratentorial (above the cerebellum) brain parenchyma with cerebrospinal fluid. The posterior fossa structures were mildly preserved, but overall these findings were not compatible with extra-uterine life.
The couple was informed about these findings and opted for termination of pregnancy (TOP). The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) â a measure used to monitor warfarin therapy â at that time was within therapeutic range (2.3). She expelled the conceptus within 24 hours after induction without excessive bleeding or complications.
Following TOP, she was discharged in stable condition and offered a Copper T intrauterine contraceptive device (Cu-IUCD), which serves as an effective long-term contraceptive option to prevent future pregnancies.
It's crucial to note that both cases highlight potential risks associated with heart conditions during pregnancy. Each patient had different circumstances and management plans tailored specifically for their situation. These cases underscore the importance of close collaboration among physicians from different specialties to ensure optimal care for pregnant patients with complex medical conditions like heart disease. 
This clinical case presents a complex set of findings in a patient, ultimately diagnosed with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome (SGS) with sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) and an asymptomatic cor-triatriatum dexter. The patient underwent surgical excision of the SCT, revealing no malignant foci on histopathology. However, difficulties were encountered during anesthesia induction due to bilateral congenital temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis.
The initial assessment of the patient included various observations and examinations. The pulse rate was noted to be 118 per minute, which was regular and of normal volume. Auscultation revealed heart sounds 1 and 2 without any murmurs. Clear lung fields with good air entry bilaterally indicated normal respiratory function.
Further examination revealed distinctive features on the patient's face. A coarse facial appearance with a flat nasal bridge, hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes), low-set microtic ears with protruding ear lobules, and a short upturned nose were noted. Additionally, an inter-incisal distance of approximately 13mm at maximal mouth opening suggested limited jaw mobility.
A swelling measuring about 15cm by 25cm in the lower sacral region was observed on physical examination. This sessile swelling had an irregular surface, soft consistency, and no distinct edges. Importantly, there was no bony defect underlying the swelling or pelvic extension noted upon digital rectal examination.
To further investigate these findings, two diagnostic tests were performed â a transthoracic echocardiography and an abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography. Echocardiography revealed situs solitus (normal arrangement) of atria and viscera along with atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial concordance â indicating proper alignment between chambers and great vessels of the heart.
The mitral valve, tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve, and aortic valve were found to be normal on echocardiography. Chamber walls demonstrated good contractility without any atrial or ventricular septal defects seen. However, a thick band of echogenic tissue was detected in the right atrium that separated it into two unequal halves with an eccentric aperture communicating both chambers. This finding represented an asymptomatic cor-triatriatum dexter.
Abdomino-pelvic ultrasound revealed normal right and left kidneys, ruling out any significant pathology in these organs. The patient's serum alpha-fetoprotein level was also measured and found to be elevated at 31mcg/L (normal range: 0-5mcg/L). Although genetic analysis was not performed due to limited hospital facilities, the clinical features combined with investigation results led to a diagnosis of Schinzel-Giedion syndrome with sacrococcygeal teratoma.
Given the documented risk of malignancy in embryonic tumors associated with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome, it was decided to perform an early excision of the sacrococcygeal mass. However, challenges arose during anesthesia induction when attempts to pass an endotracheal tube failed due to limited mouth opening caused by bilateral TMJ ankylosis.
As a result, fiber optic laryngeal intubation could not be carried out since this facility was not available in the hospital either. Consequently, a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted for maintaining airway access during surgery while gastric decompression was achieved via naso-gastric intubation.
The excision procedure for the sacrococcygeal teratoma proceeded with the patient positioned on their left side instead of using the conventional prone jack-knife position due to limitations imposed by TMJ ankylosis.
Following surgery, the patient experienced uneventful post-operative recovery and was discharged on the tenth day for follow-up care at the outpatient clinic. The histopathology report of the excised tumor indicated a solid mass lined externally by unremarkable epidermis.
Within three weeks of the operation, during their first follow-up visit, the patient was referred to the Maxillofacial surgery unit due to their TMJ ankylosis. Unfortunately, they were subsequently lost to follow up, making it challenging to assess further management or treatment outcomes.
In conclusion, this clinical case highlights a rare condition involving Schinzel-Giedion syndrome with sacrococcygeal teratoma and asymptomatic cor-triatriatum dexter. Additionally, complications during anesthesia induction due to bilateral TMJ ankylosis added further complexity to patient management. The successful surgical excision of the teratoma emphasized prompt intervention given the known risk of malignancy associated with embryonic tumors in Schinzel-Giedion syndrome patients. 
This clinical case involves a pediatric patient with leptomeningeal spread, which means the tumor has spread within the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The patient underwent two surgical procedures to address their condition.
The first procedure involved placing a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. This is a device made by Medtronic called PS Medical that helps drain excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain's ventricles into the abdominal cavity, relieving hydrocephalus (increase in fluid pressure within the skull). Following this, a radical resection of the tumor was performed. However, due to safety concerns, some small parts of the tumor remained unresected.
The postoperative period was complicated for this patient as they experienced neurological deterioration, leading to an extended stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). While in ICU, they also suffered cardiac arrest and had a permanent internal defibrillator implanted through their right subclavian vein.
Upon discharge from the neurosurgical department, the patient had severe left hemiparesis (weakness on one side of their body) and required further treatment with high-dose chemotherapy. Over subsequent years, they underwent four revision surgeries related to their shunt. These surgeries involved multiple revisions of both distal and proximal catheters due to malfunction caused by peritoneal malabsorption (inadequate absorption of fluids through abdominal tissue).
In recent times at four years old, this child presented to an emergency department with worsening consciousness level and vomiting. Additional tests were conducted including computer tomography (CT) scan that revealed dilated ventricles and periventricular edema (swelling around brain ventricles). Ultrasound imaging showed bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis (blood clots).
Due to lack of alternative options for treatment strategies at that time point, it was decided to implant a new distal catheter in the right atrium by the interventional cardiologist. This was performed through the left subclavian vein using a percutaneous technique called Seldinger method. The process involved puncturing the subclavian vein with a very thin needle (21 G) and inserting a guide wire to navigate to the desired location. Gradual dilation of the vein was achieved using sheaths of increasing size, ultimately accommodating a peel-away sheath.
Confirmation of catheter placement in the right atrium was obtained using intra-operative x-ray imaging with a C-arm machine. Following successful placement, the dilator was removed and wound closure occurred as per standard procedures. The patient had an uneventful recovery without any postoperative complications, leading to their discharge from hospital after few days.
At one year follow-up, this pediatric patient remains free of symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure caused by hydrocephalus. A CT scan showed normalization of ventricular system appearance, indicating that both catheters remain in place appropriately.
This case highlights several significant issues encountered in managing leptomeningeal spread and associated complications such as hydrocephalus and thrombosis. It also demonstrates treatment challenges requiring multiple surgeries and interventions over time. However, despite these complexities, appropriate management has led to an improved clinical outcome for this young patient at least until their one-year follow-up period after last intervention.
 This clinical case showcases the complexity involved in managing a pediatric patient with leptomeningeal spread and associated complications. Leptomeningeal spread refers to the metastasis of tumor cells within the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, posing significant challenges for treatment.
In this particular case, the initial surgical interventions addressed two critical issues: hydrocephalus and tumor resection. Hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain, often requiring surgical intervention to divert and drain excess fluid. The placement of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was performed to alleviate this pressure by allowing CSF drainage into the abdominal cavity.
Furthermore, an attempt was made to achieve radical tumor resection. However, due to safety concerns or specific anatomical considerations regarding inaccessible tumor remnants, complete removal could not be achieved. This highlights one of the challenges encountered during surgery - ensuring maximal tumor removal while preserving normal tissue function and avoiding damage.
Following these procedures, complications arose during the postoperative period. The patient experienced neurological deterioration that necessitated an extended stay in the pediatric ICU, emphasizing that even with appropriate management and treatment strategies, unforeseen complications can still occur.
Additionally, a significant event occurred when cardiac arrest transpired during their time in ICU. As a result of this incident, it was necessary to implant a permanent internal defibrillator through their right subclavian vein. This illustrates how cancer-related medical issues can intertwine with other health conditions faced by patients.
The subsequent management involved continued care for both oncological needs and shunt-related issues. High-dose chemotherapy was administered as part of ongoing treatment for leptomeningeal spread.
Multiple revision surgeries were performed over subsequent years due to malfunctions associated with peritoneal malabsorption affecting shunt functioning. Peritoneal malabsorption occurs when there is inadequate absorption of fluids into abdominal tissue, leading to shunt malfunction. To resolve this issue, revision surgeries included various modifications to the catheter system, including revisions of the distal part and introducing a new proximal catheter at the opposite lateral ventricle.
At four years old, the patient presented with deteriorating levels of consciousness and vomiting, which required immediate medical attention. Diagnostic imaging using a CT scan revealed ventricular dilation and periventricular edema (swelling around brain ventricles), indicating increased intracranial pressure. Additionally, ultrasound imaging discovered blood clots or thrombi within both internal jugular veins.
Given limited options available for treatment in this complex situation involving internal jugular vein thrombosis and malpositioned shunt catheters in an already compromised anatomy due to prior surgeries, a decision was made to implant a new distal catheter into the right atrium through the left subclavian vein. This procedure was carried out under interventional cardiologist guidance using percutaneous techniques like the Seldinger method.
The successful placement of the distal catheter was verified by intra-operative x-ray imaging using a C-arm machine - an essential step to ensure proper positioning before concluding the surgery. The wound was then closed following standard procedures.
Fortunately, postoperatively there were no complications reported for this specific intervention. The patient recovered without any symptoms associated with increased intracranial pressure caused by hydrocephalus or other related issues. Consequently, they were discharged from hospital several days later free of these symptoms.
At their one-year follow-up evaluation after implementing these interventions successfully without complications arisen thus far since surgery completion,the child remained asymptomatic regarding hydrocephalus-related concerns based on clinical assessment and exhibited normalized appearance of their ventricular system on CT scan - confirming that both catheters remain in place appropriately according to observation results.
This clinical case exemplifies not only difficult decisions that must be made when managing complex medical conditions but also the perseverance and dedication of the healthcare team in providing comprehensive care for pediatric patients with intricate medical presentations. The interdisciplinary collaboration between neurosurgeons, cardiologists, and interventional specialists played a crucial role in delivering optimal treatment. Continued monitoring and regular follow-up will be essential to ensure ongoing effectiveness of the treatment plan for this patient's long-term prognosis and quality of life. 
This clinical case describes a boy who presented with various symptoms including abdominal distension, pallor, recurrent fevers, and a history of blood transfusions. The patient did not have any history of jaundice, vomiting, urinary or bowel complaints, bleeding from any site, or neurological complaints.
Upon admission, the patient appeared very pale with silvery gray scalp hair and white eyelashes. Physical examination revealed hypotonia (low muscle tone), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), fever of 40Â°C (104Â°F), lymphadenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes), and hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen).
Initial blood tests showed pancytopenia, which is a condition characterized by low levels of all three major types of blood cells: red blood cells (hemoglobin was low at 6.3 g/dL), white blood cells (1980 white blood cells/ÂµL) including neutrophils and lymphocytes with reduced levels as well as low platelet count (44 000/ÂµL). However, there were no giant cytoplasmic granules in the leukocytes.
Liver function tests showed normal results except for low albumin levels and increased alkaline phosphatase levels. Other abnormal findings included high triglycerides, ferritin levels above normal range indicating iron overload in tissues along with very high lactate dehydrogenase level which can indicate tissue damage or inflammation.
The elevated C-reactive protein indicated an inflammatory response in the body. A chest X-ray was normal while an abdominal ultrasound revealed enlarged liver and spleen but no abnormalities in the bile ducts or ascites.
Based on these findings such as hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia accompanied by hypofibrinogenemia - a syndrome known as Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) - was suspected. A bone marrow aspiration was performed, which showed numerous morphologically benign macrophages with hemophagocytic activity confirming the diagnosis of MAS.
Various infectious causes were ruled out through blood and urine examinations as well as specific viral serologies for diseases like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis A, B, C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The patient's history of recurrent infection, consanguineous (related by blood) family background and the presence of silvery-gray pigmentation in hair and eyebrows led to a suspicion of Griscelli Syndrome. Light microscopy examination of the hair confirmed large clumps of irregular pigments characteristic of Griscelli Syndrome.
Molecular biology tests revealed a mutation in the RAB27A gene, confirming a diagnosis of Griscelli syndrome type 2.
The first-line treatment for MAS complicating Griscelli syndrome type 2 involved parenteral administration of high doses of corticosteroids. However, this did not result in significant improvement as evidenced by ongoing involvement all three cell lines in blood count along with elevated ferritin and triglyceride levels. Therefore, additional drugs such as etoposide (a chemotherapy agent) and cyclophosphamide were administered which resulted in improvements seenin blood cell counts including decreasing ferritin levels while bone marrow examination showed reduced numbers of macrophages with low hemophagocytic activity.
In addition to treating the underlying condition, appropriate management was also employed for any coexisting infections using intravenous antibiotics such as ceftazidime combined with an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
The patient was discharged from the hospital on prednisone and cyclosporine while being placed on the waiting list for bone marrow transplantation (BMT).
In conclusion, this case highlights the complexity involved in diagnosing rare genetic disorders such as Griscelli syndrome type 2 that can present with various symptoms including organomegaly, abnormal blood counts, and hyperferritinemia. Prompt diagnosis is important for appropriate management, in this case using a combination of corticosteroids and chemotherapy drugs to address the MAS component as well as managing any concurrent infections. Bone marrow transplantation may be necessary for long-term management of the underlying genetic condition. 
This clinical case describes the unfortunate and complex health journey of a newborn baby who ultimately succumbed to septic shock and multiple organ failure. The case highlights the importance of proper clinical management, early diagnosis, and timely intervention in neonatal patients.
The story starts with the baby being born without any apparent symptoms during his time in the hospital. However, shortly after being taken home, he started to experience multiple yellowish-watery stools (around 12 times) and refused to feed. Initially, there was no fever or vomiting observed.
Further examination revealed signs of severe dehydration but no distention or tenderness in the abdomen. Laboratory findings showed hypernatremia (abnormally high sodium levels), hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels), and severe metabolic acidosis â characterized by low blood pH and bicarbonate levels. The osmotic gap was also increased at 45 points, indicating an imbalance between ions in bodily fluids.
To identify whether an infectious agent was responsible for these symptoms, blood and stool cultures were obtained with subsequent administration of intravenous fluids, electrolytes, and antibiotics.
After 26 hours of rehydration therapy, the dehydration resolved; however physiological problems continued to develop including acute renal failure complicated by acidosis and hyperkalemia. A chest radiograph showed a "bat wings" pattern on imaging along with an increased cardiothoracic index of 0.45 suggesting potential cardiopulmonary involvement.
A renal ultrasound revealed mildly brighter kidneys cortex without any structural malformations indicative of inherent kidney abnormalities.
Given these ongoing complications, the baby's care needed to be escalated further â he was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit where he required mechanical ventilation for three days along with receiving parenteral feeding through a central catheter due to difficulty tolerating enteral feedings via hydrolyzed milk formula.
Unfortunately as his hospital stay continued lengthening due partly by cholestasis as well as a staphylococcus epidermidis infection.
Throughout the course of his admission, he developed slimy diarrhea, making attempts to introduce enteral feeding challenging. Eventually, an esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and duodenal biopsy were performed which showed partial villous atrophy (a condition where the lining of the intestines becomes damaged) with brush border abnormalities.
Staining with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) revealed further abnormalities including loss of the linear part of enterocytes (intestinal cells) along with intra-cytoplasmic PAS+ bands in the apical pole of enterocytes that had uneven thickness and sometimes a double contour pattern. The presence of numerous Brunner glands in the submucosa was also observed along with hemorrhagic suffusions.
To further confirm their suspicions, an electron microscopic examination was conducted which confirmed a diagnosis hypothesis called Microvillus Inclusion Disease (MVID) - a rare genetic disorder affecting intestinal function and nutrient absorption.
Mutation analysis performed on peripheral blood samples confirmed that there was a homozygous mutation in MYO5B gene. MYO5B gene encodes for an important protein involved in trafficking cellular components within intestinal epithelial cells. When this gene mutates or is absent altogether, it can lead to MVID symptoms such as chronic diarrhea and malabsorption.
Despite ongoing medical interventions and management, unfortunately after 97 days of life, septic shock ensued leading to multiple organ failure resulting in his death.
This clinical case highlights not only the complexity but also emphasizes several key points: the importance of careful observation from birth onwards; early recognition and intervention especially when dealing issues such as dehydration; prompt identification through laboratory testing; interdisciplinary care involving different medical specialties; meticulous follow-up to uncover more clues when challenges arise persistently; performing appropriate diagnostic tests such as endoscopy and biopsy ultimately allowing for specific diagnosis like MVID based on characteristic findings - in this case, the brush border abnormalities observed during histopathological examination using PAS stain. 
This clinical case presents the story of a patient who presented with abnormal laboratory results and imaging findings suggestive of liver abscesses. The patient's treatment involved antimicrobial therapy, drainage of the abscesses, and a successful recovery.
The initial laboratory results showed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), indicating an immune response to infection. Additionally, the patient had an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level, which is another marker for inflammation in the body. Mildly elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were also present, suggesting some liver involvement.
Abdominal ultrasonography revealed enlarged liver and spleen with two sizable hypoechoic lesions. These lesions were further characterized by abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, showing hypodense lesions with peripheral enhancement after contrast administration. This suggested that these lesions were consistent with hepatic abscesses.
The patient was admitted for further evaluation and treatment. Culture-guided antimicrobials were initiated along with appropriate drainage as the first option. Initial percutaneous sonographically guided aspiration yielded purulent material from one of the abscess cavities, which was sent for culture analysis. The bacterial isolate was identified as Aggregatibacter aphrophilus using automated systems and confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).
The sensitivity test indicated that A. aphrophilus showed susceptibility to several antibiotics including ceftriaxone, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin,and meropenem.
Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and drainage procedures being performed on days 5thand 8thof admission,the patient continued to experience irregular spikes of fever accompanying night sweats.This raised concerns about possible sources of infection outside the liver abscesses. Extensive screenings for other infectious causes including gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluation, transthoracic echocardiography, and various antibody tests were conducted but no alternative sources of infection were identified.
In response to the persistent fever and night sweats, ciprofloxacin was discontinued and meropenem was administered instead. This change in antibiotic regimen led to improvement in the patient's clinical condition.
The drains that were placed during the abscess drainage procedures were removed once the fluid from the abscess cavities became clear. Meropenem therapy was continued for a total of 2 weeks before switching to oral ciprofloxacin for another 4 weeks. The patient ultimately made a full recovery and was discharged from the hospital.
Follow-up imaging obtained nearly 2 months after drainage showed completely normal liver parenchyma without any residual cavities, indicating a successful resolution of the abscesses.
In summary,this case highlights an interesting presentation of hepatic abscesses caused by A. aphrophilus in a patient who experienced persistent fever despite appropriate treatment. Prompt recognition through imaging, targeted antimicrobial therapy guided by sensitivity testing, and timely drainage contributed to the successful resolution of this patient's condition without needing surgical intervention.
This case underscores the importance of considering atypical pathogens as potential causes for infections when conventional diagnostic measures prove inconclusive.A multidisciplinary approach involving infectious disease experts,radiologists,and interventional radiologists contributed to positive outcomes in this case The presentation of hepatic abscesses caused by Aggregatibacter aphrophilus is relatively rare, as this bacterium is typically associated with oral infections such as endocarditis or brain abscesses. The fact that this patient did not have any evidence of these typical sources of infection made the diagnosis even more challenging.
Hepatic abscesses can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites. In this case, A. aphrophilus was identified as the causative pathogen through culture and sensitivity testing.
The treatment approach for hepatic abscesses generally involves a combination of targeted antimicrobial therapy and drainage procedures. Antimicrobials are used to eliminate the causative organism and control the infection, while drainage is necessary to remove purulent material from the abscess cavities.
In this case, percutaneous drainage was performed initially to aspirate purulent material from one of the liver abscess cavities using ultrasound guidance. Subsequently, CT-guided catheter drainage was performed on both abscesses on days 5thand 8thof admission to ensure complete evacuation and adequate management.
The choice of antibiotics is typically guided by culture results and susceptibility testing. In this case, since A. aphrophilus showed susceptibility to ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin,and meropenem among other antibiotics; these were used in combination initially in an empirical regimen before switching specifically for better management against A.aggregaapholiusinfections onto intravenous meropenem treatment once susceptibility results were available.
A notable aspect in this case was the persistence of fever with day-time variation accompanied by night sweats despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy targeting A.aphrophilus.This raised concerns for possible alternative sources of infection apart from hepatic involvement.Further investigations including endoscopic evaluation,blood cultures,and echocardiography were conducted to exclude these possibilities.
Echocardiography is an important diagnostic tool in cases of recurrent fever with no clear source as it can detect infective endocarditis. In this case, echocardiography showed mild mitral regurgitation but no vegetations, suggesting that infective endocarditisis not the source of persistent fever.
Gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluation was also performed to rule out any possible source of infection within the gastrointestinal tract. However, no evidence of abscesses or other abnormal findings were observed during this procedure.
Additional serological tests for other parasitic infections and multiple bacterial infections including Entamoeba histolytica,A.canis,A.brucella(leishmania Abs,echinococcus Abs)were conducted to assess if alternative sources may have contributed to the patient's continued symptoms.All these investigations returned negative results.No underlying immunodeficiency conditions including HIV were identified either
The multidisciplinary approach involving infectious disease specialists,radiologists,and interventional radiologists was crucial in managing this complex case. Their expertise and collaboration facilitated accurate diagnosis through appropriate imaging techniques, culture analysis,and comprehensive evaluation for potential alternative sources of infection.
Despite the challenges encountered throughout this patient's treatment course,the combination therapy consisting of appropriate antimicrobial administration guided by sensitivity testing and timely drainage procedures led to successful clinical improvement and complete resolution without requiring surgical intervention,such as open surgical drainage or liver resection.
Following approximately 2 months from drainage; imaging revealed completely normal liver parenchyma without any residual cavities indicating a satisfactory outcome and successful healing process with complete recovery from hepatic abscesses caused by A.aggregatibacter aphrophilus.For optimal recovery outreach,the patient was discharged on oral ciprofloxacin therapy following consolidation IV meropenem treatment
This clinical case underscores several important points.The first is the need for maintaining a high index when faced with atypical presentations or cases that do not respond as expected to initial treatment.Effective communication and collaboration among healthcare professionals and specialties are crucial for thorough evaluation of potential alternative sources guiding appropriate investigations.
Given that hepatic abscesses can be caused by a variety of pathogens, including rare ones like A.aggregatibacter aphrophilus, it is important to consider the possibility of unusual organisms when standard diagnostic tests do not provide clear answers.
In conclusion, this clinical case demonstrates the challenges encountered in diagnosing and treating hepatic abscesses caused by A.aggregatibacter aphrophilus. The multidisciplinary approach involving accurate imaging techniques, targeted antimicrobial therapy guided by susceptibility testing, and timely drainage played a crucial role in achieving complete resolution without the need for surgical intervention. The case also highlights the importance of considering atypical pathogens when conventional diagnostic measures prove inconclusive. 
This clinical case describes a patient presenting with sympathetic signs of pregnancy and vaginal bleeding, but no fever or vomiting. On examination, the patient had tenderness in the left iliac fossa and a globular uterus consistent with an eight-week pregnancy. They also had a tender, smooth, and mobile mass in the left adnexal region.
With these findings, the suspected diagnosis was a non-ruptured extra-uterine pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy). Further investigations were performed to confirm this suspicion. The beta human Chorionic Gonadotropin (Î² hCG) level was found to be elevated at 96 702 mIU/ml. Ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous left ovarian mass measuring 82 millimeters in diameter, an empty uterus, and no peritoneal effusion - providing further evidence for an ectopic pregnancy involving the ovary.
To definitively treat this condition, an emergency laparotomy (surgical exploration of the abdomen) was performed under general anesthesia. During surgery, the left ovary was found to contain a gestational sac and corpus luteum (a structure that forms after egg release from the ovary). The right adnexae (structures near or attached to either side of the uterus) were normal as well as other examination findings.
The gestational sac within the ovarian capsule was removed by dissection and hemostasis procedures were carried out to control bleeding. A sample of this tissue was analyzed by a pathologist who confirmed decidual cells (cells lining the womb during pregnancy) and trophoblastic tissue within the ovarian capsule - confirming that it was indeed an ovarian ectopic pregnancy.
Following surgery, there were no complications during recovery and post-operative care for six days until discharge. Subsequent follow-up investigations showed a decrease in Î² hCG levels until they eventually disappeared 25 days after surgery.
An ectopic pregnancy occurs when implantation of fertilized eggs takes place outside of the uterus. While the majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tubes (tubal ectopic pregnancy), occasionally, they can implant within other structures such as the ovaries, cervix, or abdomen (oophorionic, cervical, or abdominal ectopic pregnancies).
In this case, it was specifically an ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian ectopic pregnancies are extremely rare and account for only about 1-3% of all ectopic pregnancies. In such cases, fertilization occurs within the ovary itself rather than in the fallopian tube.
Symptoms and signs of ovarian ectopic pregnancy are often similar to tubal ectopic pregnancies and can include abdominal pain or tenderness on one side (similar to appendicitis), vaginal bleeding or spotting, and symptoms associated with early pregnancy like breast tenderness and nausea.
Prompt diagnosis is crucial because if left untreated, ovarian ectopic pregnancies can lead to serious complications such as rupture with life-threatening internal bleeding.
In conclusion, this clinical case demonstrates an unusual presentation of an ovarian ectopic pregnancy. Through a combination of clinical findings including physical examination and ultrasound imaging along with subsequent surgical intervention followed by confirmation from pathological analysis - management was successful leading to resolution without any complications. The management of ovarian ectopic pregnancy involves prompt diagnosis and timely intervention to prevent complications. In this case, the patient presented with typical symptoms and physical examination findings consistent with an ectopic pregnancy. The elevated Î² hCG levels further supported this suspicion.
Ultrasonography played a critical role in confirming the presence of an ovarian mass and ruling out other possible causes. The absence of peritoneal effusion also helped differentiate it from other types of ectopic pregnancies or abdominal pathologies.
Once the diagnosis was confirmed, emergency laparotomy was performed to remove the gestational sac from the ovary while ensuring adequate hemostasis. This surgical approach is considered necessary to prevent rupture and subsequent life-threatening internal bleeding that can result from an ovarian ectopic pregnancy.
The postoperative course for this patient was uneventful, which is encouraging as it suggests that there were no complications during or after surgery. After discharge, regular follow-up care should be provided to monitor the patient's recovery and ensure complete resolution of Î² hCG levels.
It's important to note that although rare, ovarian ectopic pregnancies can pose diagnostic challenges due to their similarities in presentation with other gynecological conditions such as tubal ectopic pregnancies, ruptured ovarian cysts, or even pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). However, meticulous history-taking along with thorough clinical evaluation and appropriate investigations can help differentiate among these possibilities.
Furthermore, early identification of risk factors for ectopic pregnancies can aid in prompt diagnosis. In this case, notable risk factors include a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), lack of contraception use resulting in increased chances of conception outside the uterus, and previous vaginal delivery without any complications.
Science has advanced our understanding of these clinical scenarios; however, preventing an unplanned pregnancy through effective contraception remains crucial for reducing occurrences of both intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancies. Educating patients about contraception options tailored specifically to their medical histories is a vital aspect when it comes to reproductive health.
In conclusion, this clinical case highlights the rare occurrence of an ovarian ectopic pregnancy. The meticulous evaluation, correct diagnosis, and timely surgical intervention performed in this case exemplify the importance of effective communication among healthcare professionals involved in delivering optimal care to patients. By sharing such cases and disseminating knowledge about differential diagnoses and management strategies, healthcare providers can enhance their ability to identify and appropriately manage similar instances in the future. 
In this clinical case, the patient underwent a crown lengthening procedure in order to expose enough tooth structure for the placement of a dental crown. The lingual aspect had adequate keratinized tissue present, which means that there was enough gum tissue surrounding the tooth to ensure a healthy and stable outcome.
The crown lengthening procedure did not require any reduction of the underlying bone. This means that only soft tissue (gum) was removed in order to expose more of the tooth structure.
After two weeks, the canals of the tooth were prepared using instruments called Peso-reamers. These instruments are used to shape and clean out the root canals in preparation for further treatment. The specific sizes used were no. 2 and no. 3 reamers.
A direct pattern was made using GC Pattern Resin and a prefabricated post made by MANI Post. The pattern resin is a material that is used to create an exact replica of what will be placed inside the tooth after preparation.
The prefabricated post was placed in the mesio-buccal canal (toward front and cheek side) while still embedded in the pattern resin. After allowing it to set, or harden completely, it was then carefully removed from both resin post and core.
In parallel, another resin pattern corresponding to distal canal (toward back) placement of post was prepared simultaneously using similar technique as before with prefabricated post still embedded which later got casted using semi-precious alloy after setting completely.
Both prefabricated posts were subject to sandblasting with 50 microns aluminum oxide particles at this point for better bonding between cement and metal surface.
To facilitate easy removal of occlusal excess without using rotary tools which could potentially loosen bond between cementsetand cast-core due vibrations caused by rotary instrumentations on pre-fabricated posts now fixed into teeth openings as well as resin patterns into corresponding entry points on tooth.
To ensure a dry and isolated environment, a rubber dam was placed around the tooth during the procedure. The tooth surface was treated using 37% phosphoric acid, which helps in etching or roughening the enamel surface to improve bonding.
The canals were then rinsed and dried using distilled water and paper points. Resin-modified glass ionomer cement, or GIC, was chosen for placing the posts. This type of cement contains resin for better adhesion and strength.
The cement was carefully dispensed into both prepared canals using dispensing tips. The cast post, coated with additional cement, was placed into the tooth along with immediate placement of prefabricated post in mesio-buccal canal before the cement had fully set.
After allowing the initial setting time of 5 minutes for the cement to partially harden, any excess part of prefabricated posts that extended above gum level (occlusal excess) were tilted and broken off from assembly by utilizing small slot made at occlusal level during previous step.This provided an easy way to cut off excess material without disturbing bond between unset cement core below it also allowed patient to bite comfortably without any interference also diminishing stress on newly formed restoration structure prior its complete setting.In other words it helped ensure proper alignment between upper teeth when biting down & reduced chances breakage while chewing food etc.
Tooth preparation procedures took place after waiting 48 hours following post-cementation appointment.The margins chosen for this particular patient's case consisted of chamfer margins on distal,buccolingual aspects whereas Knife edge margin (sharp rounded edge) selected towards mesial aspect where such kind margins provide more longevity as studies claims.Also some studies suggest avoiding sub-gingival margin preparations on zirconia restorations since newer materials available that allow highly polished surfaces which enhances attachment between gums ("hemi-desmosomal" attachment) resuting less chances of bacterial leakage which could in turn lead to tooth decay under restoration edges. Modern zirconia materials offers thin margin as 0.2mm thickness can be easily achieved comparing with conventional dentistry materials.
In summary, this clinical case involved a comprehensive approach to restoring a tooth after crown lengthening procedure. The use of prefabricated posts, resin pattern resin, and careful cementation techniques were employed to ensure a successful outcome. The choice of specific margins and zirconia material utilized helps prolong the longevity of the restoration while minimizing potential complications such as bacterial leakage and marginal decay.

Title: Marfan Syndrome - A Case Study
Introduction:
Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a genetic disorder that affects connective tissue and can have serious implications on multiple organ systems. The following case study presents a patient with typical features of MFS and highlights some of the clinical manifestations commonly associated with the condition.
Patient Presentation:
The patient, without a family history of similar problems, visited the hospital to determine if he indeed had MFS based on his own internet research. On general examination, it was observed that he was exceptionally tall (2.1 meters) and thin, which are characteristic physical traits associated with MFS. Additional musculoskeletal features were identified during examination, including arachnodactyly (abnormally long fingers), pectus carinatum deformity (protrusion of the chest bone), hind foot valgus (ankle deformity), dolichostenomelia (disproportionately long limbs), scoliosis (spine curvature), dolichocephaly (long head shape), enophthalmos (sunken eyes), downslanting palpebral fissures ('droopy' eyelids), malar hypoplasia (underdeveloped cheekbones), and retrognathia (recessed jaw). 
Furthermore, detailed assessment using the revised Ghent nosology scoring system confirmed a total systemic score of 10, supporting the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.
Cardiovascular Findings:
The patient's cardiovascular evaluation revealed soft first heart sounds along with a grade 4/5 murmur indicative of mitral regurgitation. While there were no signs suggestive of infective endocarditis or cardiac failure at this stage, echocardiography demonstrated prolapse of the anterior mitral valve leaflet accompanied by moderately severe mitral regurgitation. The examination also revealed dilation in both the aortic root and sinuses.
Ophthalmologic Findings:
An ophthalmologic examination conducted by a specialist identified a dense cataract in the left eye with lens subluxation (partial displacement), but no dislocation. The right eye exhibited iridodonesis (trembling of the iris) and myopia, but no evident lens subluxation or dislocation.
Radiographic Findings:
Chest X-ray results showed an increased cardiothoracic ratio exceeding 50%, which indicated an enlarged heart. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed dilation of the aortic root and sinuses resulting in ascending thoracic aorta enlargement. A suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm was also observed; however, it displayed no signs of dissection, thrombi formation, or imminent rupture.
Additional Observations:
The patient presented with dual blood supply to the right kidney: one artery arising from the inferior aspect of the aneurysm and another originating from the normal abdominal aorta inferiorly. The left renal artery, on the other hand, arose solely from within the aneurysm.
Additionally, CT findings indicated that both coeliac axis (supplying blood to abdominal organs) and superior mesenteric arteries originated from within the abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Final Assessment and Treatment Options:
Given these clinical findings, surgical intervention was recommended for mitral valve repair/replacement as well as addressing his dilated ascending thoracic aorta. However, after thorough consultation with his family, he chose to decline surgical intervention.
Conclusion:
This case presentation highlights typical clinical manifestations associated with Marfan syndrome. It underscores features such as musculoskeletal abnormalities including arachnodactyly and pectus carinatum deformity along with cardiovascular implications like mitral regurgitation and dilated thoracic vessels. Ophthalmological evaluations revealed lens abnormalities while radiographic investigations unveiled significant vascular dilation.
Effective management strategies often involve a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing various medical specialties to assess and address specific organ system involvement. Genetic counseling is also crucial to explain the inheritance patterns of MFS, as early diagnosis and subsequent monitoring play vital roles in minimizing potential complications and improving patient outcomes. 
Clinical Case 1:
In this case, the patient underwent an urgent operation to drain a chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) in the frontal-temporal region of both sides of the brain. During the operation, a subdural hematoma escaped from a hole in the bone after opening up the protective covering of the brain (dura), despite high intracranial pressure. The surgery was successfully completed without any complications, and the patient's vital signs remained stable throughout. 
After confirming that there was no more air trapped in the brain (intracranial pneumatosis), a closed drainage system was put in place to drain any excess fluid that may have accumulated after surgery. However, due to worsening consciousness disturbance, an emergency CT scan was performed 2 hours after surgery which showed multiple areas of bleeding within brain tissue (parenchymal hemorrhage). Despite this unexpected finding, postoperative recovery went smoothly.
Instead of opting for surgical intervention for these new bleedings, doctors decided to continue with conservative treatment which included closely monitoring neurological signs for 6 days while being cared for in an intensive care unit dedicated to patients with neurological conditions (NICU). The length of hospital stay was extended to 20 days because mental disturbances persisted following surgery; however, these issues were successfully addressed during this time frame.
Eventually, with no lasting neurological deficits except for some minor language barriers remaining, the patient was discharged from hospital. At a follow-up appointment two months later, no abnormalities were found on CT scan and all remnants of hematoma had been completely absorbed.
Clinical Case 2:
In this case study involving an 82-year-old man with weakness in his limbs and frequent falls over a period of one month following a history of cerebral infarction (stroke), arterial hypertension (high blood pressure), and coronary heart disease while being treated with rivaroxaban medication. A CT scan showed evidence of subdural hematoma on the right side of the brain with compression of brain tissue. The patient also exhibited reduced response time and weakness in his left limbs.
Urgent evacuation of the subdural hematoma was carried out by creating a single hole in the parietal bone on the right side while continuing oral rivaroxaban administration. A drainage catheter was placed routinely in the prefrontal region of the brain. Surprisingly, visual field defects were observed on the right side following surgery, but vital signs remained normal throughout.
Postoperative CT scan revealed a small amount of air trapped in an area at the front part of the brain (prefrontal pneumocephalus) and bleeding in the occipital lobe on the right side (right occipital lobe hemorrhage). However, no acute bleeding was found within that same space where initial subdural hematoma had been present. Removal of drainage tube was delayed until 4 days postoperatively.
As time progressed, gradual absorption of occipital hematoma occurred without requiring any additional surgical intervention. However, slight postural instability was noticed during neurological evaluation, leading to physical therapy for balance improvement. At a 2-month follow-up appointment, there were indications that patient's condition had significantly improved as he could walk unaided and CT scans showed no abnormalities.
Clinical Case 3:
In this instance involving an 80-year-old man experiencing moderate dizziness and headaches persisting for 20 days with a medical history including hypertension (high blood pressure), ischemic heart disease (reduced blood flow to heart muscle), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma; neurological assessment revealed confusion and difficulty maintaining balance while walking. A CT scan revealed a large chronic subdural hematoma on his right side causing displacement of midline structures towards left.
To address this issue promptly, urgent surgery involved creating one burr-hole in the skull followed by evacuation of the subdural hematoma on the right side. A drainage device was placed routinely as part of the surgical procedure. However, on the second day after surgery, a sudden spasm of airway muscles occurred (airway spasm), leading to unstable blood oxygen levels. Emergency tracheal incubation was performed to stabilize vital signs, alongside closing off the drainage device.
An emergency CT scan revealed a small area of bleeding within brain tissue located at the back part of brain (occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage). On day three, due to worsening condition and respiratory distress, patient required transfer to an intensive care unit for further care including assistance with breathing using ventilator support.
In order to aid breathing in long-run and subsequent removal difficulties with normal trachea cannula within short time spans, doctors decided it was necessary for patient to undergo tracheotomy (creation of an alternative air passage through the neck). Removal of drainage tube was delayed until fifth day after surgery.
Patient showed gradual improvement over time and successfully detached from ventilator after one week following surgery. He returned to a general ward while continuing treatment for pulmonary inflammation caused by infection for an additional 10 days. Ultimately, patient was discharged from hospital in stable condition with mild pulmonary inflammation present but no other major complications aside from that. The total hospitalization period lasted one month.
At two-month follow-up examination after discharge, patient remained in good overall health and did not exhibit any evidence suggesting recurrence based on head CT scans that were conducted during this time frame. 
This clinical case presents a complex medical journey of a patient with severe lung involvement and multiple diagnostic challenges. The initial chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities and mediastinal lymphadenopathies, suggesting an inflammatory lung condition. However, all microbiological investigations for infectious causes, including tuberculosis, were negative.
A notable finding in this case was the patient's hypergammaglobulinemia, indicating an abnormal increase in immunoglobulin levels. Other immunological tests were negative, ruling out certain autoimmune conditions. Transthoracic echocardiography showed hyperkinetic left ventricle and mild dilation of the right ventricle with elevated pulmonary arterial pressures (PAPs), indicating potential heart involvement.
Further investigations included bronchial endoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The endoscopy revealed inflammation in the bronchial tree, while BAL indicated lymphocytic alveolitis characterized by an imbalance in CD4 (helper T cells) over CD8 (suppressor T cells) ratio. These findings hinted at possible interstitial lung diseases.
Considering the severity of lung involvement and high endemicity of tuberculosis in their country, despite negative microbiological findings for tuberculosis initially, the medical team decided to begin a trial anti-tuberculosis treatment. Unfortunately, after two weeks of treatment initiation, the patient developed an allergic skin reaction necessitating treatment discontinuation.
Corticosteroids were then initiated due to idiopathic diffuse infiltrating pneumonitis; however, there was no improvement observed over time. Subsequent chest scans revealed worsening interstitial infiltrates and fibrosis progression within 27 days of treatment initiation.
To obtain a definitive diagnosis or identify potential risk factors contributing to the condition, open lung biopsy was performed. The histological examination showed extensive damage to the lung parenchyma with mutilating fibrosis containing inflammatory infiltrate comprising lymphocytes, plasmocytes, and fewer neutrophils and eosinophils. Epithelioid and giant cell granulomas were present without necrosis.
Based on the observed features, a diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) associated with sarcoidosis or berylliosis with acute exacerbation was retained. Since sarcoidosis seemed less likely given the CD4/CD8 ratio in BAL, attention turned to investigating risk factors for chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The patient's occupational history as a glassblower in an artistic glass factory for six months raised suspicion of exposure to beryllium.
Occupational department experts confirmed the presence of beryllium in colored glass compounds at the workplace, confirming CBD as the cause. Steroids were continued while oxygen requirement gradually decreased. The patient was discharged after 55 days with long-term oxygen therapy.
Over time, pulmonary function tests showed severe restrictive impairment; however, slight improvements were noted one year after discharge with partial regression of lung consolidations and ground-glass opacities detected through CT scan. An aspergilloma within a cavity was observed during imaging.
Two years after CBD diagnosis, the patient unfortunately experienced acute respiratory failure requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). An enhanced CT scan revealed further deterioration of pulmonary parenchyma along with pulmonary embolism ultimately leading to a fatal outcome.
In summary, this clinical case demonstrates diagnostic challenges posed by rare conditions such as chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and highlights how occupational history plays a crucial role in identifying potential causes. Despite interventions including anti-tuberculosis treatment and corticosteroids, substantial lung damage occurred leading to progressive fibrosis and eventually fatal complications. 
This clinical case presents the story of a young patient who experienced neurological symptoms and was later diagnosed with Primary Angiitis of the CNS (PACNS). The patient had no previous trauma to the head or history of drug ingestion and his haemoglobin genotype was unknown.
The initial presentation led to suspicion of a stroke, and the patient was admitted to a private hospital where he received subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for two days. Although there was initially some improvement in his clinical state, it later deteriorated, leading to referral to a Federal Medical Centre.
Upon admission at the Federal Medical Centre, general physical examination findings were normal except for specific neurological symptoms. The patient displayed expressive aphasia, right-sided facial weakness, hypertonia in both upper and lower limbs, and weakness of the limbs on both sides. There were also signs of hyperreflexia bilaterally in both upper and lower limbs, absent abdominal reflexes, sustained ankle clonus, positive Babinski sign bilaterally, and signs of incoordination (dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia).
Given these findings along with other system examinations that appeared normal at that time, an initial diagnosis of encephalopathy secondary to encephalitis was made. However differential diagnoses such as space-occupying lesion with raised intracranial pressure (RICP) and sickle cell CNS infarctive crisis were considered.
To confirm or rule out these diagnoses further investigations were carried out including tests for haemoglobin genotype; Full Blood Count (FBC); Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR); Random Blood Sugar (RBS); Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS); blood film for Malaria Parasite (MP); Serum Electrolytes Urea & Creatinine; Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain; Clotting profile with Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT).
The MRI brain revealed multiple areas of subacute cerebral infarction in the parietal and occipital regions. Considering the patient's clinical features and MRI findings, the diagnosis was modified to Primary Angiitis of the CNS (PACNS).
Treatment for PACNS involves a combination of medications including immunosuppressants and corticosteroids. In this case, the patient initially received intravenous dexamethasone along with intravenous fluids due to vomiting on admission. With subsiding symptoms, oral feeds were initiated, and tablets prednisolone were administered twice daily.
As part of supportive care while awaiting further investigation results such as FBC, an intravenous antibiotic (Ceftriaxone) was administered along with an antihelminthic medication (Albendazole). Physiotherapy was also instituted to aid in motor function improvement.
Over time, there was a notable improvement in the patient's condition. Speech became audible though poorly fluent, power increased in both sides but with subtle right-sided facial weakness remaining. Signs of incoordination persisted but there was steady improvement overall.
Treatment approach was then modified by reducing prednisolone dosage to alternate days while adding cyclophosphamide to synchronize with steroid-off days for long-term therapy. The patient and his mother were counseled about the nature of the diagnosis, prolonged therapy requirement, possible residual deficits, and explained that continued physiotherapy and occupational therapy would be necessary.
During follow-up visits at weekly intervals (weeks 5-9), steady improvement continued with normal power returning grossly to limbs; fine motor function improved along with resolution of facial weakness, expressive aphasia, and signs of upper motor neuron lesion. However increased appetite weight gain (with "moon face") persisted along with signs of incoordination.
As recovery progressed further tapering down prednisolone doses occurred from 10mg to 4mg to 2mg on alternate days. By the 12th week following diagnosis, signs of incoordination disappeared and the patient became completely neurologically normal. The medications were eventually stopped after three months, and a repeat MRI was planned.
However, due to financial constraints, reimaging was delayed. The patient was seen again seven months later and by then all signs of incoordination had disappeared. A repeat brain MRI conducted at this time showed marked improvement with complete resolution of certain cortical lesions in the parietal and occipital regions bilaterally.
In summary, this clinical case highlights the journey of a patient with an initial suspicion of stroke but later diagnosed with Primary Angiitis of the CNS (PACNS). Through appropriate treatment including immunosuppressive therapy and corticosteroids as well as supportive care like physiotherapy, the patient showed significant improvement over time with complete resolution of symptoms nearly one year after admission. 
Title: Paratubal Borderline Serous Tumor: A Unique Clinical Case
Introduction:
This clinical case describes the diagnostic journey of a patient who presented with an ovarian cyst. Through various imaging techniques and histopathological analysis, it was determined that the patient had a rare paratubal borderline serous tumor. This article aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of the case, highlighting key diagnostic findings and treatment options.
Case Presentation:
The patient in this case is a postmenopausal woman who experienced menopause at age 48 without any complications. She had no significant medical or surgical history and had not received hormonal therapy. Routine blood tests and serum tumor marker analysis indicated normal levels for carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, CA 125, and human epididymis protein 4.
Diagnostic Imaging:
Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) revealed a left ovarian unilocular cyst measuring approximately 6cm Ã 5cm Ã 4cm. The cyst exhibited low-level internal echoes, a thin wall with smooth margins, and no septa or papillary projections. Pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ECT) confirmed the presence of a unilocular cystic lesion without enhancing solid intramural nodules or lymphadenopathy.
Surgical Intervention:
Due to concerns about possible malignancy based on the progressive growth observed in this postmenopausal woman, laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery was performed. During laparoscopic inspection, it was discovered that the cyst originated from the ampullary and fimbrial regions of the left fallopian tube. The left fallopian tube appeared normal while the left ovary showed signs of atrophy.
Histopathological Analysis:
Frozen sections prepared from surgically removed specimens confirmed that the cyst was benign; however, further examination revealed polypoid lesions with nuclear atypism and stratification. These histological characteristics were consistent with a borderline tumor. The final diagnosis was confirmed as a paratubal borderline serous tumor.
Treatment and Follow-up:
Following the surgical removal of the cyst, hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes) were performed to ensure comprehensive management. While further staging surgery was recommended, the patient opted for close follow-up instead.
Outcomes:
Postoperative evaluation using retrospective CT imaging demonstrated clear separation between the left ovary, fallopian tube, and paratubal cyst. The patient remained asymptomatic during follow-up visits conducted every three months over a 24-month period, with no evidence of recurrence or metastasis observed.
Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights the importance of thorough diagnostic investigations in postmenopausal women presenting with ovarian cysts. Despite initial indications suggesting benignity based on tumor markers and imaging results, surgical intervention was necessary to establish an accurate diagnosis. In this particular case, comprehensive treatment involving hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ensured optimal disease management.
The rarity of paratubal borderline serous tumors necessitates further research to develop standardized treatment protocols and gain better insights into their behavior. Although adjuvant surgical treatment is typically recommended in cases lacking complete staging information as seen here, individual patient preferences should be carefully considered when determining the most appropriate course of action.
It is crucial to underscore that close follow-up through periodic pelvic ECT scans, TVS assessments, and monitoring tumor markers played a pivotal role in ensuring early detection of any potential recurrence or metastasis while providing reassurance for the patient's overall well-being.
In conclusion, this clinical case presents an unusual manifestation of paratubal borderline serous tumor that underscores the need for meticulous diagnostic evaluations in patients with ovarian cysts even when initial findings appear benign. Collaboration between healthcare professionals, patients, and the latest diagnostic tools can ensure accurate diagnosis, optimal treatment decisions, and successful long-term outcomes. 
This clinical case describes a newborn baby who was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit due to health concerns. The initial echocardiography showed mild-moderate pulmonary hypertension with no structural heart defects. Subsequent blood work revealed low levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, indicating anemia and thrombocytopenia. The direct Coomb's test was positive, suggesting Rh incompatibility.
Rh incompatibility occurs when the mother is Rh-negative and the baby is Rh-positive, resulting in the production of antibodies by the mother against the baby's red blood cells. In this case, the mother had a previous pregnancy with an O positive baby while she herself has O negative blood type. It was noted that anti-D antibody testing was not performed during this pregnancy and intrauterine blood transfusion was not given to the fetus.
As a treatment for Rh incompatibility, Rho (D) immunoglobulin (a medication that prevents sensitization of Rh-negative individuals to Rh-positive red blood cells) was administered to the mother after her previous delivery as well as during this pregnancy at 32 weeks gestation. However, despite these measures, the newborn still experienced complications related to hemolytic disease of the newborn.
The baby received several transfusions of packed red cells and underwent an exchange transfusion (a procedure where some of their blood is removed and replaced with donor blood) to stabilize their condition. They were also given antibiotics to prevent infection.
During their hospital stay, it was observed that liver transaminases (AST and ALT) were elevated along with increased bilirubin levels indicating cholestatic jaundice (a type of jaundice caused by impaired bile flow). Ursodeoxycholic acid was administered as a short-term treatment for cholestatic jaundice.
The platelet count initially decreased but eventually normalized without requiring platelet transfusions. Reticulocyte count (immature red blood cells) initially increased but later became inappropriately low compared to hemoglobin levels upon discharge. Elevated serum ferritin levels were attributed to repeated blood transfusions.
The baby was discharged from the hospital after 20 days, with a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, and was scheduled for weekly follow-up appointments. However, at 30 days of age, they were hospitalized again due to anemia and received another packed red cell transfusion.
Since the baby's reticulocyte count remained consistently low with persistent anemia despite transfusions, a bone marrow biopsy was performed to investigate further. The biopsy showed normal cellularity and a diagnosis of hyporegenerative anemia secondary to Rh incompatibility was made.
In order to stimulate the production of red blood cells, recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that regulates red blood cell production, was initiated as treatment on day 32 of life. Over three weeks of EPO treatment, the reticulocyte count increased and stabilized their hemoglobin level.
The EPO treatment was discontinued after four weeks when reticulocyte count reached 1.2%. Subsequently, another transfusion was required after ten days due to decreased hemoglobin levels. Continuing monitoring showed improvement with decreasing bilirubin and ferritin levels over time.
Various investigations were done throughout this case's course including TANDEM mass spectrometry testing for metabolic disorders (negative results), serological tests for infectious diseases (negative results), endocrine work-up (normal results), coagulation profile assessment (normal results), abdominal ultrasound examination (normal results). None revealed any abnormal findings regarding other possible causes for elevated bilirubin or liver dysfunction except Rh incompatibility-related anemia.
At four months old, both bilirubin and ferritin levels normalized while liver function markers normalized at one year. Chelation therapy, a treatment used to remove excess iron from the body, was not needed in this case.
Long-term follow-up showed that the baby achieved normal developmental milestones by 12 months of age. 
In this clinical case, we have a patient with a history of scleroderma and limited involvement of the left scalp and face. The patient did not have any symptoms related to systemic sclerosis, but did mention a history of malnutrition during childhood and an allergy to penicillin. In 2015, the patient started taking methotrexate for her scleroderma.
In February 2016, an MRI was done which revealed some findings. It was noted that there was no involvement of the skin elsewhere in the body. A CT angiogram was also performed, which showed no abnormalities in the blood vessels. Figure 2 presents some features that were discovered on the MRI sequences.
The patient underwent another MRI in May 2016, which showed that the lesion remained stable. At this time, she did not complain of any new symptoms during her visit to the clinic. However, on May 2017, when she had another repeat MRI, it was observed that there was a mild increase in size of the intraaxial lesion. The post-contrast MRI also revealed a small enhancing nodule along the lateral margin of the lesion.
In September 2017, when seen again at clinic follow-up appointment, she reported experiencing mild sensory changes on her right side for several years and requested removal of intraaxial lesion; although she mentioned this symptom had not changed recently.
Neurological examination conducted at this time included assessments such as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), motor strength assessment (which yielded normal results), reflexes check (which were present) as well as no focal neurological abnormalities detected or noted.
Considering surgical options for optimal scalp incisional planning,w ith input from plastic surgeons it was decided to stay medial with opening scalp incision plan.
The risks associated with surgery were explained to her prior to obtaining informed consent from patients tor agreeing for surgery wherein they agreed upon removal after accepting risk factors.
Upon being brought into the operating theatre and with the participation of plastic surgeons, a left frontal craniotomy was performed. Neuronavigation and ultrasound were used during surgery to help locate the tumor, which was found below the scalp lesion and skull defect. A brain needle was then utilized for tapping of the cyst with hemorrhagic fluid which appeared to be chronic in nature (a sample sent cell analysis). The wall of the cyst was resected, revealing a deposit of hemosiderin. Two areas of nodularity were observed, one consistent with that seen on ultrasound and subsequently removed. It appeared to resemble a thrombosed vein or hemangioblastoma nodule primarily.
All specimens obtained during surgery were sent for pathological evaluation.
Upon microscopic examination of histopathology sections obtained from resection area it demonstrated white matter containing multiple blood vessels exhibiting irregular outlines along with paper-thin walls lacking smooth muscle; additionally lined by a single layer of endothelial cells.
Presence of hyalinised connective tissue replacing some obsolete blood vessels noted.
Furthermore white matter displayed signs severe piloid gliosis along with numerous Rosenthal fibers seen scattered throughout.
Multiple clusters containing macrophages laden with hemosiderin detected too ; CD34 staining highlighted thin walled blood vessels further,
On evaluating all findings no evidence for presence neoplastic abnormalities observed .
Ultimately final diagnosis established for this patient as cavernous angioma.
In conclusion, this case highlights an individual who presented initially without any symptoms related to systemic sclerosis but had limited involvement in left scalp and face region sub-analysed at frequent intervals eventually revealed presence abnormality associated cavernous angioma pathology necessitated surgical intervention 
Clinical Case 1:
This clinical case involves a patient who presented with certain laboratory findings and underwent multiple surgeries. The initial presentation was characterized by leukocytosis (an increase in the number of white blood cells) with neutrophilia (an increase in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell) and normal platelet counts. The levels of urea, creatinine, and electrolytes were within normal limits, indicating no significant impairment in kidney function.
After resuscitation, the patient underwent a laparotomy (surgical procedure involving the opening of the abdominal cavity) due to fecal matter leakage from two sites where anastomosis from previous surgeries had been performed. During this surgery, segments of the bowel that were leaking were removed (resected), and an abdominal washout was conducted to clean soiled areas within the peritoneal cavity. An ileostomy was created as part of further surgical intervention.
However, extensive bowel edema made it impossible to achieve fascial closure during surgery. Fascial closure refers to suturing or closing layers of connective tissue surrounding muscles for proper wound healing. Instead, a temporary abdominal closure technique called BogotÃ¡ bag was employed for temporary abdominal compartment syndrome treatment (TAC). The BogotÃ¡ bag is typically fashioned out of either using recommissioned catheter drainage bags or intravenous fluid bags.
Due to limited space availability in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit), the patient's post-operative care continued on a general surgical ward. Throughout his hospital stay, he underwent multiple re-look laparotomies with abdominal washouts due to abscesses formation in his abdomen. Additionally, one laparotomy was performed because there was colonic perforation at his hepatic flexure necessitating a right colectomy.
For fluid administration and antibiotic therapy purposes during treatment phases such as resuscitation or post-operative care, a central venous catheter was inserted. A Foley catheter was used to monitor the patient's urine output, and routine stoma care was provided through the usage of a stoma bag (a specialized bag to collect waste from ileostomy or colostomy). Enteral feeds (nutrition administered through the gastrointestinal tract) were initiated early and maintained throughout his hospital stay, despite him becoming cachectic (experiencing extreme weight loss), with his weight at one point being as low as 37 kilograms.
Despite the challenges associated with caring for an open abdomen in conjunction with an adjacent ileostomy, such as increased risk of complications like entero-atmospheric fistula formation (abnormal connection between the intestine and surrounding atmosphere), this particular patient did not develop such a complication. After spending a total of 121 days in the hospital and achieving adequate weight gain along with contracture of his abdominal wound, he was discharged.
Clinical Case 2:
This clinical case involves a young man who presented to MTRH (name or abbreviation not elaborated) with acute upper abdominal pain accompanied by vomiting and abdominal distension. While he had no remarkable blood counts, laboratory findings included azotemia (increase in nitrogenous compounds in blood), hyponatremia (low sodium levels), and hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). An abdominal x-ray revealed air under his right hemidiaphragm.
After initial fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities, surgery was performed due to suspicion of perforated viscus. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity during surgery, more than 2 liters of succus entericus were found emanating from a gastric wall perforation. A biopsy sample was obtained during surgery for further evaluation, followed by using an omental patch repair technique called Graham patch to close the gastric defect.
However, extensive bowel edema prevented fascial closure once again during surgery necessitating the usage of a BogotÃ¡ bag for TAC. The patient remained stable after surgery, and a second-look laparotomy was performed 48 hours later. During this surgery, it was observed that the gastric repair was intact, bowel edema had subsided, and fascial closure could be successfully achieved.
Following his positive outcome in surgery, the patient was discharged a week later and prescribed a proton pump inhibitor medication to reduce stomach acid levels. At the follow-up clinic appointment, histology results indicated benign findings with no further pathological concerns noted. The patient remained symptom-free throughout his subsequent follow-up visits.
In conclusion, these two clinical cases illustrate complex surgical interventions that required temporary abdominal closure due to extensive bowel edema compromising fascial closure. Despite their challenges and associated complications during post-operative care periods, both patients achieved positive outcomes in terms of wound healing and recovery.

This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a relapsing skin condition characterized by dark erythematous lesions accompanied by erosions, crusts, blisters, pigmentation, and scale at friction sites. The lesions were predominantly seen in the axillae and groin areas. The patient experienced symptoms such as pain, itching, malodor, and fever.
The initial assessment ruled out various conditions including diabetes mellitus, endocrinological disorders, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases like tuberculosis and syphilis, as well as retroviral infection. However, the patient did have a positive family history of similar clinical presentation in his late mother.
Based on the positive family history and characteristic skin lesions in flexure areas along with a relapsing course of the illness, the initial diagnosis was Hailey-Hailey disease. Hailey-Hailey disease is an inherited condition characterized by blisters and erosions mainly affecting flexural areas of the body. However, it is important to note that this patient did not display one of the classical nail plate findings typically associated with Hailey-Hailey disease.
Due to financial constraints limiting further confirmatory testing like biopsy or genetic mutation analysis through polymerase chain reaction (PCR), definitive confirmation of diagnosis was not possible. Therefore treatment was initiated based on clinical suspicion.
The treatment plan included both topical (applied to the skin) and systemic agents (taken orally). Topical cefoperazone tazobactam was administered to address infection-related concerns given the presence of fevers. Symptomatic relief measures were also implemented using injectable glycyrrhizin acid for pain management along with analgesic-codeine phosphate for pain control and anti-histamine cetirizine for itch relief.
As there was limited improvement seen after three days on this regimen combined with laboratory results indicating active disease status (elevated inflammatory markers), an immunomodulator called azathioprine was added to the treatment plan on day 3. Azathioprine is commonly used in the management of various autoimmune conditions due to its ability to modulate immune responses.
Supportive measures were also implemented such as providing a high-quality protein diet and encouraging fluid ingestion in order to address hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin) and elevated uric levels. The patient's condition showed significant improvement after five days on azathioprine, allowing for outpatient management with continued administration of the same medication.
Although most supportive investigations, including laboratory biochemistry tests, complete blood count, serum viral screen, and autoimmune screen came back unremarkable, there were several notable findings. These included increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (a marker of inflammation), a positive skin exudation culture for Streptococcus agalactis (indicating bacterial infection), monocytosis (an increase in monocyte cells), hypokalemia (low potassium levels), hypoalbuminemia(hypoglobuminemia(low globulin) These findings contributed to shaping the treatment plan.
In conclusion,this case describes a patient who presented with relapsing skin lesions that were consistent with Hailey-Hailey disease based on clinical assessment. Due to financial constraints, confirmatory testing could not be performed. The patient showed significant improvement with a combination therapy regimen involving topical and systemic agents along with supportive measures. This demonstrates the importance of considering familial history and clinical features when making diagnoses and tailoring treatment plans even when definitive testing cannot be done due to financial limitations.
 
Clinical Case Explanation:
This clinical case involves a young child who developed seizures and nodding shortly after returning home from an Internally Displaced Peoples (IDP) camp. The child was born without any complications, and his mother reported having a healthy pregnancy with no intake of harmful substances or medications.
Upon examination, the child was found to be dehydrated, febrile (having a fever), and moderately wasted (showing signs of malnutrition). A mass was identified in the right lumbar region, which was tender, indurated (hardened), and non-fluctuant (not filled with fluid). However, there were no palpable abnormalities in the spleen or liver. The rectum had a normal amount of fecal material and there were no signs of rectal bleeding.
Haematological investigations revealed certain abnormalities in the blood picture. There were elevated levels of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell), lymphocytes (another type of white blood cell), monocytes (a type of immune cell), and eosinophils (a type of white blood cell involved in allergic responses). Additionally, immature granulocytes and atypical lymphocytes were observed on the peripheral film report. Liver function tests showed elevated levels for ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST (aspartate transaminase), indicating potential liver damage. Serum protein levels appeared low but renal function tests as well as serum electrolyte levels fell within normal ranges.
An abdominal ultrasound revealed inflammation in the internal and external oblique muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. To address this issue, incision and drainage procedures were conducted at Gulu Hospital with subsequent open wound management for 14 days before secondary wound closure took place. The patient also received supplementary food rehabilitation to combat malnutrition while their seizure medication was changed to Sodium Valproate under direct observation therapy.
After these interventions, which spanned over one month, the child showed significant improvement. Seizures and nodding completely stopped, and the child was able to return to a normal daily life. A follow-up review revealed that renal function tests and serum electrolytes were within normal ranges except for ongoing high liver enzyme levels.
In summary, this clinical case depicts a child who developed seizures and nodding after returning home from an IDP camp. The initial investigation indicated malnutrition, inflammation in the abdominal muscles, and abnormalities in blood counts and liver function tests. With appropriate interventions including wound management, nutritional support, and medication adjustments, all seizure activity ceased with subsequent improvements except for persistently elevated liver enzymes.
Further investigations may be required to determine the cause of the elevated liver enzymes after these interventions. Continued monitoring of this patient's condition is essential in order to ensure effective management moving forward. In order to further understand the clinical case, additional investigations may be necessary to determine the cause of the persistently elevated liver enzymes in the child. The elevated liver function tests (ALT and AST) indicate potential liver damage or dysfunction. This could be due to several factors, including infections, metabolic disorders, toxic injury or drug reactions.
Considering that this patient was born in an IDP camp and has a history of exclusive feeding on relief food provided by WFP during pregnancy, it is important to consider any potential infectious causes that may have contributed to his current condition. Gastrointestinal infections such as viral hepatitis or parasitic infestation could affect liver function and cause abnormal enzyme levels.
Furthermore, the presence of eosinophilia in this case raises suspicion for parasitic infection as well. Eosinophils are involved in immune responses against parasites and their elevation suggests an ongoing immune reaction against a parasitic pathogen. Additional investigations focusing on identifying specific parasites, such as stool examination for ova and parasites or serological tests for specific pathogens like Schistosoma spp., should be considered.
It is also worth noting that the child has a history of seizures which responded well to Sodium Valproate therapy after interventions at Gulu Hospital. This suggests that his seizures were likely related to an underlying condition rather than being solely an independent issue. The initial investigations revealed abnormalities in blood counts with immature granulocytes and atypical lymphocytes seen on peripheral film report indicating possible immune dysregulation.
Given these findings along with persistent elevation of liver enzymes even after interventions, additional immunological evaluations may be warranted. The possibility of an autoimmune disorder affecting multiple systems cannot be ruled out completely without further investigation into autoantibodies associated with organ-specific or systemic autoimmune diseases that may affect both neurological function (seizures) and liver health.
Additionally, considering this patient's history of living in IDP camps where access to healthcare might have been limited and exposure to environmental factors could have been significant, it is crucial to assess if any long-term effects of living in such conditions might be contributing to his current condition. This may involve evaluating for chronic exposure to environmental toxins or other risk factors characteristic of IDP camp settings.
Overall, the clinical case presents a complex scenario with multiple potential contributing factors. Further investigations including stool examination for parasites, autoimmune screening, and evaluation for environmental exposures are necessary to attain a complete understanding of this child's condition and provide appropriate management moving forward. Close monitoring of liver function tests should continue along with the maintenance of appropriate seizure control through medication adjustment and observation therapy. Collaborative care involving specialists from various fields including infectious diseases, gastroenterology/hepatology, immunology/rheumatology, and neurology will be essential in formulating an accurate diagnosis and optimizing treatment outcomes for this patient. 
Clinical Case: Tuberculosis of the Parotid Gland
In this clinical case, we have encountered two patients with primary tuberculosis affecting the parotid glands. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and primarily affects the lungs but can also involve other organs, including the lymph nodes, bones, and glands.
The first patient was a middle-aged woman who presented with suspicious lesions seen on a parotid MRI. The lesions were located between the superficial and deep lobes of the right parotid gland and showed characteristics indicative of malignancy. Additionally, multiple jugulodigastric adenopathies were found on imaging.
To obtain histological evidence for diagnosis, a partial exofacial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve was performed. The examination of resected tissue revealed primary tuberculosis affecting both the parotid gland and cervical lymph nodes. This diagnosis was confirmed through definitive histological examination.
Upon confirmation of tuberculosis involvement, anti-bacillary treatment consisting of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (2RHZ/4RH) was initiated for six months. Subsequently, significant improvement in clinical symptoms was observed even six months after completing treatment.
In contrast to our first patient's case involving right-sided lesions straddling between superficial and deep lobes alongwith adenopathies; our second patient presented as a young woman without any notable medical history or weight loss but complained about pain, fever at 38Â°C (100.4Â°F), slight redness near left sub-angulo-mandibular mass that lasted for four months.
Upon physical examination by an ENT specialist there were no signs of trismus or facial paralysis although slight inflammation around salivary orifices persisted without any pus discharge from them.The oral cavity examination did not reveal any inflammation or pus output either.Tumefaction in the left parotid area was firm, painless, and measured about 4 cm in its long axis. Moreover, there was no limitation in mouth opening or facial paralysis.
Further investigations were conducted to confirm the presence of an abscess within the left parotid gland. Cervical ultrasound revealed a tumor lesion with mixed echostructure and a central liquid predominance at the lower pole of the left parotid gland. A subsequent MRI showed a lesional process predominantly within the deep compartment of the left parotid gland.
Similar to our first patient where tuberculosis was confirmed by histopathological findings; this time also caseous necrosis (soft cheesy tissue) alongwith epithelial-gigantocellular granuloma formation within the cyst wall established primary tuberculosis as its cause which was also confirmed through acid-fast bacilli culture on Lowenstein-Jensen medium.
The young woman received medical treatment for her primary tuberculosis that consisted of an initial phase lasting two months with rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide followed by a consolidation phase lasting four months involving rifampicin and isoniazid only.
Fortunately, both patients experienced favorable outcomes following their respective treatments. The first patient had significant improvement within six months after completion of treatment while complete resolution took about nine months for our second patient after cessation of medical therapy.
In conclusion, these cases emphasize that tuberculosis can affect any organ or gland including locations such as the parotid glands. It highlights how clinical suspicion plays a crucial role in diagnosing rare presentations like tuberculosis involvement in salivary glands where other conditions like neoplastic lesions are more common. Early recognition through appropriate investigations such as imaging studies (MRI) along with histopathological examination helps initiate timely treatment resulting in favorable outcomes for patients affected by primary tubercular involvement even at uncommon sites like parotids 
This clinical case depicts a young woman with a significant family history of colon cancer. Her mother and elder sister both passed away from the same illness, with her sister being diagnosed at a young age and her mother in middle age. The patient denies any smoking or alcohol consumption but mentions using firewood for cooking since childhood.
Initially, the patient sought medical treatment for Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) at various health facilities in Gulu. Despite receiving treatment with antacids and proton pump inhibitors, she only experienced mild relief from her symptoms. A mass was biopsied under ultrasound guidance but the histology results showed non-specific inflammation.
On physical examination, the patient appeared moderately wasted and pale but not jaundiced. She had moderate dehydration, tenderness in the right hypochondrial and lumbar regions of the abdomen, as well as an ill-defined palpable mass in those areas.
Further laboratory investigations revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia, indicating that she had low levels of red blood cells that were smaller than normal. However, liver function parameters and renal function parameters were within normal ranges.
Abdominal ultrasound revealed an ill-defined mass with central echogenicity in the right hypochondrial region measuring approximately 7.2cm wide. There were no signs of intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy or ascites (abnormal accumulation of fluid).
Due to socio-economic reasons, a requested barium enema was not performed to further investigate the condition. The patient's frustrated family requested a transfer to Gulu Regional Referral Hospital for further management.
At Gulu Regional Referral Hospital, a senior surgeon reviewed the case noting both the nature of the mass and positive familial history of colon carcinoma. Considering these factors, an exploratory laparotomy (surgical exploration) was recommended since cost limitations prevented extensive investigations.
During surgery, it was found that there was a firm mobile mass extending from hepatic flexure to the ascending colon. A right hemicolectomy was performed, removing part of the colon and creating an end-to-side anastomosis (surgical connection) between the distal ileum and mid-third of the transverse colon.
Macroscopic examination of the resected tumor indicated a firm, nodular, necrotic mass at the hepatic flexure measuring 7.0cm in diameter. The tumor had not spread beyond the serosa (the outermost layer) of the colon. Histology revealed a well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with clear margins around the resected area.
Postoperatively, the patient recovered well without complications and was discharged on day six after surgery. She was advised to continue attending follow-up appointments at Gulu Regional Referral Hospital as well as visit Uganda Cancer Institute for expert advice and treatment from an oncologist specializing in cancer care.
Three weeks later, a thorough evaluation showed that all physical and clinical parameters remained within their normal ranges. Notably, further review of Lacor Hospital's cancer registry indicated that all female patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin between 2013-2015 were older than 40 years old.
In conclusion, this clinical case presents a young woman with a family history suggestive of hereditary colorectal cancer who initially presented with symptoms resembling Peptic Ulcer Disease but was ultimately found to have well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of her colon. The successful surgical management resulted in favorable postoperative outcomes, but continued care under oncological expertise is advised moving forward for long-term management and monitoring due to her familial history and age at presentation being uncommon for sporadic cases.
 
In both of these clinical cases, the patients presented with pain and swelling in the labia majora. Let's break down each case to better understand the symptoms, management, and possible causes.
Clinical Case 1:
The patient had no previous history of easy bruising or excessive bleeding after trauma. She sought medical care at a nearby health facility where she was hospitalized. The initial treatment involved conservative management with antibiotics and a blood transfusion of 450cc of whole blood. However, her condition worsened with intermittent bleeding and an increase in swelling size.
Upon referral to another health facility, it was noted that she had previously terminated a pregnancy at 8 weeks about 3 years earlier and had given birth vaginally without complications 15 months prior to this current presentation.
The physical exam revealed mild pallor but no tenderness or guarding upon abdominal palpation. However, a large necrotic swelling (measuring 7x6 cm) on the right labia majora was observed. Due to its tense and tender nature, vaginal examination was not possible initially.
To further investigate her condition, a pelvic ultrasound was performed which confirmed proper placement of pelvic organs while also revealing the presence of a hematoma thereby ruling out uterine prolapse. A full blood count indicated that she had normocytic normochromic anemia (9g/dl) while platelet levels were normal.
Vaginal examination/exploration under local anesthesia allowed for debridement followed by applying packed dressing which successfully controlled any further bleeding. Medications administered included antibiotics (ceftriaxone 1g every 12 hours, metronidazole 500mg every 8 hours, gentamycin80mg every12 hours), analgesics (paracetamol1000mg every eight hours), iron tablets supplementation (80mg/day), along with sitz baths and polyvidone iodine for wound care.
The patient was discharged on the third day post-admission and continued with polyvidone iodine ovules and sitz baths. Subsequent follow-up showed no remarkable complications.
Clinical Case 2:
In this case, a 17-year-old female presented to the emergency room with sudden-onset pain and rapidly progressing swelling on the left labia majora. The patient reported that she had noticed the swelling just three hours prior to seeking medical attention. Despite taking painkillers (paracetamol, diclofenac), her symptoms were not relieved.
Upon examination, a tense, tender swelling measuring 9x7 cm was observed on the left labia majora with no skin discoloration. As treatment, the swelling was spontaneously ruptured which allowed for drainage of approximately 500cc of clotted blood. The wound was then packed to control any further bleeding.
The patient received prophylactic antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2g) before debridement and also had fluids administered (normal saline and Ringer's lactate) at a rate of 500cc every twelve hours for twenty-four hours. She was discharged from the hospital after two days with polyvidone iodine ovules and sitz baths for ongoing wound care.
While there isn't enough information provided in these cases to establish a definitive diagnosis, healthcare professionals managing these patients would consider several potential causes for their symptoms:
1. Hematoma: In both cases, the large painful swellings are consistent with hematomas - localized collections of blood outside of blood vessels resulting from trauma or bleeding disorders.
2. Trauma: Though no specific trauma history is mentioned in either case, it's possible that minor injuries or activities such as shaving could have contributed to tissue damage leading to hematoma formation.
3. Coagulation Disorders: Although neither patient had reported easy bruising or excessive bleeding previously, underlying clotting disorders may have contributed to the development or persistence of hematomas.
4. Infection: Since both patients were prescribed antibiotics, infection was likely considered as a possible cause for their symptoms. However, further investigation is necessary to confirm or rule out infectious causes.
It's important to note that this analysis is based on the given information and should not replace a healthcare professional's assessment and diagnosis. 
This clinical case describes a young girl who presents with abdominal distention, tenderness, pain, and positive fluid thrill on examination. The patient also has abnormal laboratory findings including low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Abdominal ultrasound reveals significant ascites with mixed liquid/solid content.
Based on the clinical findings, the decision was made to perform an emergency explorative laparotomy. During the procedure, it was discovered that the peritoneal fluid was purulent and contained an unusually large amount of free fluid. Furthermore, there were multiple caseous nodes scattered throughout the peritoneum and bowel suggestive of miliary peritoneal tuberculosis. Additionally, there were three major perforations in the jejunum with surrounding hyperemic and inflamed tissue indicative of typhoid bowel perforation. However, no perforations were observed in other hyperemic intestinal typhoid lesions.
The surgical approach included lavage of the abdominal cavity to remove pus and exploration of all parts of the bowel for any additional lesions or perforations. The three jejunal perforations were primarily closed using a separate stitch technique to promote healing. Given the severity of contamination found during surgery, a delayed primary closure strategy was employed along with placement of drains and leaving a laparostomy open for future monitoring.
Laboratory analysis from samples taken during surgery revealed acid-fast bacilli on staining consistent with tuberculous infection and positive serology for Salmonella Typhi confirming typhoid fever diagnosis. Despite initiating antibiotic treatment targeting both infectious etiologies (ciprofloxacin for typhoid fever), unfortunately, due to uncertain origin of peritoneal lesions causing miliary tuberculosis; specific treatment for this condition wasn't initiated at this time.
Throughout all procedures performed on this patient's abdomen-based diagnosis coupled with therapy being executed-there persisted severe instability requiring correction via electrolyte rebalancing, fluid replacement, and blood transfusion. Despite the best efforts by the medical team, the patient's condition gradually worsened leading to septic shock and multi-organ failure. Unfortunately, after 18 hours post-surgery, the young girl succumbed to her illness.
Overall, this clinical case highlights a complex scenario of a young girl presenting with abdominal distention and pain indicative of peritoneal disease. The subsequent exploratory surgery revealed multiple pathologies including miliary peritoneal tuberculosis and typhoid bowel perforation. Despite intervention, the severity of contamination coupled with underlying infectious processes led to progressive deterioration in the patient's condition resulting in a fatal outcome. This clinical case presents a challenging scenario with multiple factors contributing to the patient's poor outcome. The presence of ascites with mixed liquid/solid content on abdominal ultrasound, along with the remarkable symmetrical distention and positive fluid thrill, indicated a significant accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. This finding raised suspicions of an underlying pathology such as infection or inflammation.
The laboratory findings further supported this suspicion. The low white blood cell count (1300 cells/mmÂ³) indicated leukopenia, which can be a sign of immune compromise in severe infections. The low hemoglobin levels (7.7 g/dl) indicated anemia, which can be associated with chronic infections or blood loss secondary to bowel perforation. Additionally, the elevated ESR (44 mm/h) suggested ongoing inflammation within the body.
During the exploratory laparotomy, findings revealed purulent free peritoneal fluid measuring approximately 4 liters and retroperitoneal lymphomegaly suggestive of miliary peritoneal tuberculosis as observed through multiple caseous nodules spread across the peritoneum and bowel walls ranging from 0.5 to 4 mm in diameter.
The identification of three major perforations on the jejunum further complicated this case. These jejunal perforations were surrounded by hyperemic and inflamed tissue consistent with typhoid bowel perforation caused by Salmonella Typhi infection.
The surgical procedure included closing these perforations using a separate stitch technique to promote healing and prevent further dissemination of bacteria into the abdominal cavity using healthy portions of tissue near each perforation site for closure purposes.
Given the severity of abdominal contamination detected during surgery, combined management strategies were employed to address both localized infections - ciprofloxacin for typhoid fever - as well as systemic issues - metronidazole was administered intravenously at surgery completion for broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage against anaerobic pathogens involved in intra-abdominal infections.
Unfortunately, despite the prompt initiation of appropriate treatment and efforts to correct fluid and electrolyte imbalances, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly. The presence of septic shock and multi-organ failure suggested an overwhelming systemic response to infection with a high bacterial load in the abdominal cavity. These complications can lead to dysfunction in different organs such as the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, liver, and kidneys, ultimately resulting in a fatal outcome.
It is important to acknowledge that this case posed significant diagnostic challenges due to multiple factors at play: coexistence of miliary peritoneal tuberculosis and typhoid bowel perforation presented with overlapping symptoms and similar clinical features. Although a serological test confirmed the diagnosis of typhoid fever based on positive Salmonella Typhi antibodies, it remained unclear whether the miliary peritoneal tuberculosis contributed significantly or acted merely as an incidental finding.
In conclusion, this clinical case illustrates a complex situation involving multiple pathologies contributing to severe abdominal findings. The underlying conditions involved miliary peritoneal tuberculosis along with typhoid bowel perforation caused by Salmonella Typhi infection. Despite prompt surgical intervention followed by appropriate antibiotic therapy targeting both infections encountered during surgery (typhoid fever was treated with ciprofloxacin), combined with measures aimed at correcting fluid-electrolyte imbalances - unfortunately, these interventions did not alter the course of disease progression leading ultimately to septic shock and multi-organ failure. 
This clinical case describes the presentation, evaluation, and management of a patient with several concerning symptoms and laboratory findings. The initial presentation involves an acutely ill-febrile patient with a high temperature of 38.9Â°C (102Â°F), normal blood pressure, elevated pulse rate, and elevated respiratory rate. Despite these symptoms, the rest of the physical examination appears normal.
The initial laboratory evaluation reveals some abnormalities in the blood work. The leukocyte count is slightly elevated but within a relatively normal range; however, there is an increased percentage of neutrophils indicating possible infection or inflammation. Hemoglobin levels are within normal limits, but there is a low platelet count suggestive of thrombocytopenia. Prolonged clotting times are observed in both APTT and prothrombin time tests which may suggest impaired coagulation function.
Further evaluation shows slight elevation in INR values which can be indicative of liver dysfunction or impaired clotting factors synthesis by the liver. The presence of hematuria indicates blood in the urine but may not necessarily point to specific causes based on this information alone.
Given these findings, treatment begins with intravenous ciprofloxacin for suspected bacterial infection along with metronidazole and parenteral artesunate to address potential parasitic infections such as malaria.
On subsequent review, there are additional changes in the patient's condition including increased tenderness on specific areas indicating possible abdominal involvement along with persistent vomiting. These changes lead to adjustments in antibiotic therapy including switching from ciprofloxacin to ceftriaxone.
Later assessment reveals new symptoms involving rhinorrhea (runny nose), mild throat inflammation without significant lymph node enlargement, decreased breath sounds on lung examination particularly on lower zones that coincide with patchy opacities observed on chest X-ray images predominantly seen on the right side upper and lower lung zones.
Suspecting suboptimal treatment for community-acquired pneumonia, azithromycin is added to cover potential atypical respiratory pathogens.
However, despite these adjustments, the patient's condition worsens with increasing fever, tachypnea (rapid breathing), and low blood oxygen levels. Breath sounds on examination suggest consolidation and obstruction in the right lower lung zone. Laboratory evaluation shows worsening hematuria, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and leukocytosis (high white blood cell count).
Malaria parasite detection tests repeatedly show negative results ruling out that specific infection. The patient requires respiratory support in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to severe dyspnea.
During ICU care, oxygen therapy helps alleviate breathing difficulties while the patient continues to have a high fever along with tachypnea and develops dark-colored stools suggesting gastrointestinal involvement leading to diarrhea.
On the 10th day of admission after a thorough viral hemorrhagic fever screening panel using real-time RNA polymerase chain reaction technique aiming towards identifying RNA from multiple viral agents including Dengue virus confirms positive results for Dengue virus infection.
Supportive management continues as there are no specific antiviral medications available for Dengue virus treatment. After 16 days of conservative management in the hospital, including supportive measures such as fluid replacement and close monitoring of vital signs, the patient eventually recovers without any complications and is discharged home.
During one year of follow-up after discharge from hospital care, blood pressure stabilizes within normal range without requiring medication demonstrating a successful recovery from this illness.
In summary, this clinical case presents a complex scenario where an acutely ill febrile patient initially presents with nonspecific symptoms but eventually develops severe respiratory distress along with gastrointestinal involvement. Despite initial treatments targeting bacterial infections or parasitic diseases like malaria based on laboratory findings indicating neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia alongside prolonged coagulation times may point towards bleeding disorders or systemic infections like Dengue virus infection. Prompt identification of the specific pathogen, supportive management, and careful monitoring in an ICU setting can lead to successful recovery and better patient outcomes. 
In this clinical case, the patient presented with a painless lesion that had been present for 2 to 3 years. The physical examination was mostly normal, except for some abnormal laboratory findings. The patient did not have any risk factors for HIV infection or chronic disease.
The laboratory results showed pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all types of blood cells. This included normocytic normochromic anemia (low red blood cell count), leucocytopenia (low white blood cell count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). The sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels were elevated, indicating inflammation in the body. Serum Protein Electrophoresis showed abnormal results with hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels) and monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (elevated gamma globulins).
Abdomino-pelvic imaging revealed hepatosplenomegaly, which means enlargement of both the liver and spleen. Initially, there were several possible diagnoses considered including brucellosis, typhoid fever, visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and hematological malignancies.
Further tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis. Bacteriological cultures of blood, stool, and urine were negative ruling out bacterial infections such as Salmonella or Brucella. Hepatitis B Virus tests also came back negative. However, testing for Leishmania antibodies using the Leishmania rk39 immuno-chromatography test was positive.
A bone marrow aspiration was performed and found evidence of Leishmania parasites in amastigote forms. Additionally, serological testing confirmed the presence of Leishmania antibodies in the patient's serum.
Molecular testing using real-time quantitative PCR confirmed a high parasitic load in the blood sample but no amastigotes were seen on direct microscopic examination from skin smears obtained from the lesion. However, Leishmania DNA was detected from dermal DNA extracts using the same PCR technique.
Molecular typing of the isolates showed that both the blood and skin samples corresponded to L. infantum species. With these findings, a diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was made, and treatment with intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate was initiated.
During treatment, the patient developed mild renal failure but recovered after adjusting the dose of amphotericin B and providing rehydration. The treatment response was favorable as fever resolved, fatigue improved, appetite increased, and splenomegaly resolved. Blood counts returned to normal ranges with negative real-time PCR results after 28 days of treatment.
However, despite improvement in other symptoms and negative PCR results in blood samples for Leishmania parasites, the skin lesion did not improve over time. A polarized dermoscopy examination revealed characteristics suggestive of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The patient initially refused a skin biopsy but eventually accepted it after a year.
Histopathology examination of the skin biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The tumor was completely excised leading to good recovery without any complications.
In summary, this clinical case initially presented as an unclear etiology with symptoms suggesting VL based on laboratory findings and imaging results. However; further investigation including molecular testing established a diagnosis of VL along with positive serological tests for Leishmania antibodies. Treatment with anti-leishmanial therapy led to resolution or improvement in most symptoms except for an unremitting skin lesion which turned out to be unrelated to VL but rather a basal cell carcinoma requiring surgical intervention for complete resolution.
 
Title: Successful Management of a COVID-19 Positive Pregnant Patient: A Clinical Case Study
Introduction:
This clinical case study highlights the successful management of a pregnant woman with confirmed COVID-19 infection who presented with abdominal pain and uterine contractions. The case discusses the multidisciplinary approach taken for her care, including preoperative preparation, surgical intervention, postoperative care, and follow-up. The effective implementation of infection prevention and control measures ensured the safety of both the mother and her neonate.
Case Presentation:
The patient presented with abdominal pain and uterine contractions suggestive of preterm labor. Upon examination, she tested positive for COVID-19 infection after 48 hours. She was referred to a dedicated hospital ward equipped to manage patients with COVID-19 but lacked specific facilities for infected pregnant women.
Management Strategy:
To ensure optimal care while minimizing risks associated with transmission, the woman was admitted to a private room at an isolation ward prior to undergoing a caesarean section. Multidisciplinary team members consisting of obstetricians, anaesthetists, neonatologists, nurses, psychiatrists, and infectious disease experts were assembled to provide comprehensive care considering all aspects of the patient's health.
Preoperative Preparation:
Given the need for surgery due to worsening symptoms and potential risks from prolonging pregnancy during active COVID-19 infection, various preoperative measures were implemented in line with infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines. These included staff wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), simulation sessions to practice proper IPC protocols before performing surgery on a COVID-positive patient.
Surgical Intervention:
After obtaining remote consent via video call using WhatsApp messaging as an effective communication tool, transport to the operating theatre adhered strictly to IPC precautions. Lower segment caesarean section was performed under spinal anesthesia along with bilateral tubal ligation. Throughout surgery monitoring parameters remained stable maintaining oxygen saturation above 98%. Prophylactic medications such as tranexamic acid and carbetocin were administered during the procedure.
Postoperative Care:
The mother and newborn were nursed in the recovery room of the operating theatre immediately after delivery. The vital signs of both individuals remained stable during this period, and there were no postoperative complications. The newborn was initially fed with breast milk substitute until breastfeeding could be established.
Follow-up and Discharge:
After 48 hours, nasopharyngeal swabs from the neonate tested negative for COVID-19 infection. Both mother and baby remained asymptomatic throughout the postpartum period. The criteria for discharge for the mother included being asymptomatic for more than 14 days from her initial positive COVID-19 test result. Telephonic conversations played a crucial role in frequent communication between healthcare professionals involved in her care.
Conclusion:
This clinical case demonstrates successful multidisciplinary management of a pregnant woman with COVID-19 infection who required surgical intervention due to obstetric indications. Through adhering to proper IPC guidelines, appropriate preoperative preparation, implementing necessary precautions during surgery, delivering optimal postoperative care, effective follow-up measures, safe discharge criteria were achieved while ensuring minimal contact between staff and patient.
The successful outcome emphasizes the importance of coordination among healthcare professionals involved in such cases while ensuring patients receive safe delivery practices even amidst a pandemic situation.
 
Clinical Case: Congenital Defects and Renal Failure in a Neonate
This clinical case describes the evaluation and management of a neonate presenting with multiple congenital abnormalities, including aplasia of the left antero-lateral abdominal muscles, undescended testes, hydro ureteronephrosis, and renal failure.
The delivery was uneventful with normal adaptation to extra-uterine life indicated by reassuring Apgar scores. However, meconium and urine were not emitted immediately after birth. On physical examination, the baby's overall appearance was normal, but several abnormalities were identified.
Firstly, there was asymmetrical distension of the abdomen with crumpling of the abdominal wall particularly on the left flank. Palpation revealed the presence of intestines beneath the skin. The umbilical stump appeared fresh and normally vascularized.
Further assessments showed that external genitalia were masculine but revealed an absence of descended testes in the scrotum. No other sexual differentiation anomaly was noted, and there was a present and permeable anus.
A notable finding from paraclinical exams was an abdominal ultrasound that revealed aplasia of left antero-lateral abdominal muscles. The kidney topography appeared normal with well-differentiated sizes; however, dilatation of ureters and pyelocaliectasis consistent with hydro ureteronephrosis were observed.
Kidney function tests demonstrated altered results with increased blood urea (2.19 g/l), elevated creatinine (33.0 mg/l), and significantly reduced creatinine clearance (5.88 ml/min). Furthermore, delayed micturition occurred 50 hours after birth.
Due to financial limitations, further complementary exams such as cardiac ultrasound and computed tomography scans could not be performed to explore for any additional malformations or complications related to other organ systems.
Despite efforts focused on managing fluid balance through electrolyte correction and maintaining appropriate body positioning, the neonate faced difficulties in breastfeeding and delayed digestion. Consequently, enteral feeding via nasogastric tube was initiated.
Surgical interventions to correct the observed abnormalities were planned but were hindered by renal failure and limited financial resources. The anticipated surgeries included orchidopexy for descended testes, urinary tract reconstruction to address the hydro ureteronephrosis, and abdominoplasty for abdominal muscle aplasia.
Unfortunately, before any surgical intervention could be performed or further investigations carried out due to financial limitations, the neonate succumbed after seven days of life.
This case presents a complex scenario with multiple congenital anomalies involving various organ systems. The presence of aplasia of abdominal muscles highlights an important musculoskeletal abnormality often associated with other genetic syndromes. Additionally, undescended testes are a common anatomical malformation that necessitates surgical correction (orchidopexy).
The most significant concern in this case is renal involvement manifested as hydro ureteronephrosis leading to renal failure. Renal impairment and delayed micturition were evident from abnormal kidney function tests (raised blood urea and creatinine levels) along with reduced creatinine clearance.
The contributing factors responsible for these complications require further investigation; however, limited resources prevented comprehensive diagnostic testing such as trans-fontanellar doppler ultrasounds or imaging studies like CT scans to identify potential associated anomalies or confirmations of diagnoses.
In summary, this clinical case emphasizes the challenges encountered in managing complex congenital defects when resources are limited. Despite efforts to optimize care through maintaining fluid balance and enteral nutrition provision using a nasogastric tube feeding route, complete resolution requires interventions such as orchidopexy for undescended testes and reconstructive surgery addressing musculoskeletal abnormalities' implications on gastrointestinal function.
However, financial constraints significantly impacted treatment options leading to an unfortunate outcome for this neonate affected by multiple congenital anomalies and renal failure. Such cases signify the importance of timely and comprehensive diagnostic evaluations along with adequate facilities to provide optimal care for infants with complex medical problems. 
Clinical Case: Extramedullary Isolated CNS Blast Crisis in a Patient with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)
Introduction:
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid cells. Although CML primarily affects the bone marrow, it can also manifest as extramedullary disease involving other organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). In this clinical case, a pediatric patient with CML developed severe neurological symptoms associated with retinal edema and subsequent CNS blast crisis.
Initial Disease Management:
The patient was initially diagnosed with CML and received a therapeutic regimen consisting of hyperalkalinisation, allopurinol, hydroxyurea, and imatinib - a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting BCR-ABL fusion protein responsible for driving CML. The treatment protocol resulted in complete hematological remission at three months and complete cytogenetic remission at 12 months. However, several months later, the patient presented to the emergency room with severe headache, vomiting, pain, and bilateral visual loss.
Initial Clinical Presentation:
Upon examination during readmission to the pediatric department, the patient appeared pale but was afebrile. Her blood pressure was measured at 100/60 mm/Hg while her heart rate recorded 98 beats per minute. No lymphadenopathy was observed during physical examination their nervous system assessment yielded normal results except for an exophthalmia in both eyes. Pupillary reaction to light was sluggish; fundoscopy revealed bilateral stage III disc edema and retinal hemorrhages.
Diagnostic Workup:
A brain computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to investigate possible leukemic involvement or intracranial events like cerebral edema; however no abnormalities were found. Subsequent tests included bone marrow aspiration which showed no morphologic or molecular evidence of CML or acute leukemia. Cytological evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was also negative.
Potential Side Effect of Imatinib:
Considering the lack of alternative pathology to explain the retinal edema, medical professionals suspected imatinib as a potential cause and temporarily interrupted its administration. The patient was initiated on anti-edema therapy involving mannitol and dexamethasone. Despite these interventions, the patient later returned to the emergency room with recurring headaches, weakness in extremities, and seizures.
Progression and Diagnosis:
Intensified neurological symptoms led to an assessment that revealed neck rigidity, meningeal signs, and lower limb paraplegia during nervous system examination. Brain CT identified chronic subdural hematoma with serpiginous gyriform enhancement around a contusion in the right parietal and occipital lobes. Analysis of CSF collected showed lymphoblasts with a white blood cell count of 11,000 cells/mL. Flow cytometry confirmed lymphoid blast infiltration by demonstrating positivity for cluster differentiation markers (CD34, CD19, CD10) alongside partial positivity for CD45.
Extramedullary Isolated CNS Blast Crisis Treatment:
Given this diagnosis of extramedullary isolated CNS blast crisis (lymphoid type), treatment consisted of high-dose systemic induction chemotherapy along with intrathecal therapy employing methotrexate, arabinoside, and dexamethasone. Imatinib was replaced by dasatinib at a dose of 100 mg per day due to disease progression in the CNS despite systemic therapy response.
Radiation Therapy and Prognosis:
To target CNS lesions further, whole-brain radiation therapy delivering 24 Gy was administered while allogenic stem cell transplantation was deemed unfeasible due to limitations or contraindications determined by the clinical team. Adequate response to systemic chemotherapy and physical therapy resulted in rapid neurological improvements; however, the patient's visual loss did not exhibit any signs of recovery despite intervention.
Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights the development of extramedullary isolated CNS blast crisis in a pediatric CML patient. Prompt diagnosis and treatment were crucial to manage this aggressive manifestation involving the CNS. The use of dasatinib and intensified systemic chemotherapy, coupled with intrathecal therapy and radiation therapy, aimed to control disease progression. Despite neurological improvements, irreversible bilateral optic atrophy resulted in persistent visual loss for the patient.
It is important to note that each case may have variability based on several factors including individual response to treatment and other comorbidities. Medical professionals must evaluate patients individually and adapt treatment strategies accordingly. 
The clinical case presented involves a patient with an initial differential diagnosis of pneumonia, heart failure, and COVID-19. The chest radiograph showed para-hilar opacities and an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Further evaluation through chest computed tomography revealed ground-glass changes typically seen in viral pneumonia. The electrocardiogram displayed sinus tachycardia and diffuse nonspecific disturbances of ventricular repolarization.
Upon admission, laboratory-based tests were conducted which revealed normal hemoglobin levels and platelet count. However, there were indications of inflammation syndrome as evidenced by an elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein level. Blood and urine cultures came back negative, but there were abnormal results for lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and D-dimer levels indicating possible liver and renal dysfunction.
Markers of myocardial injury such as elevated troponin I (Trop I) levels and n-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP) were also observed. Despite two negative nasopharyngeal swab tests for COVID-19 taken one day apart, suspicion for the viral infection remained high given the presence of multiple clinical, biological, and radiological indicators.
Bedside transthoracic echocardiography confirmed an enlarged left ventricle with segmental myocardial hypokinesis contributing to a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Coronary angiography ruled out obstructive atherosclerosis lesions in the coronary artery. Although most etiologic analyses for this dilated cardiomyopathy yielded no significant findings initially.
Further testing using ELISA demonstrated evidence of recent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection based on positive IgM antibodies while IgG antibodies were negative. An extensive biological screening was undertaken to investigate other potential causes of acute hepatitis including ruling out drug-induced or autoimmune hepatitis among others.
Cardiac MR-scan performed on Day 6 revealed subepicardial enhancement in the lateral free-wall of the left ventricle, suggestive of CMV-induced fulminant myocarditis. The patient's hepatitis and pulmonary lesions were likely consequences of primary CMV infection. Treatment involved managing cardiogenic shock and congestive heart failure with intravenous inotropic agents and diuretics, without requiring antiviral medication.
After two days, the patient showed clinical improvement, prompting initiation of supportive medications including oral administration of ramipril, bisoprolol, furosemide, and spironolactone. Over the next week, there was steady progress as liver enzyme levels decreased along with markers related to infection. After 13 days of hospitalization and further assessments such as electrocardiogram readings, chest CT scans and echocardiography returned to normal.
Upon discharge under bisoprolol and ramipril medication regimen with no further episodes of breathlessness reported at a two-week follow-up appointment. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout this period.
In summary, this clinical case involved a complex presentation initially suggesting pneumonia or heart failure but ultimately diagnosed as CMV-induced fulminant myocarditis based on acute clinical symptoms supported by specific laboratory findings. Timely intervention that included management for cardiogenic shock led to significant improvement in the patient's condition over subsequent weeks. The case presented here highlights the challenges in diagnosing a patient who presented with several overlapping symptoms and clinical features. Initially, the differential diagnosis included pneumonia, heart failure, and COVID-19 due to manifestations such as chest opacities on radiograph and ground-glass changes on computed tomography. However, despite negative nasopharyngeal swab tests for COVID-19, the clinical team remained suspicious of its presence due to other supporting evidence.
Further investigations revealed specific laboratory findings that pointed towards CMV infection as the underlying cause of fulminant myocarditis in this patient. The presence of elevated troponin I levels and n-terminal brain natriuretic peptide indicated myocardial injury and impaired cardiac function. Additionally, there were signs of inflammation syndrome with an elevated white cell count and C-reactive protein level.
Serological testing using ELISA confirmed recent CMV infection based on positive IgM antibodies while IgG antibodies were negative. This information played a crucial role in establishing the diagnosis of CMV-induced fulminant myocarditis. It is important to note that most etiologic analyses for dilated cardiomyopathy initially yielded no significant findings.
The treatment approach focused on managing cardiogenic shock and congestive heart failure with intravenous inotropic agents and diuretics while symptomatic treatment for liver dysfunction was initiated as well. Anti-viral medications were not required in this case; however, close monitoring was necessary to ensure improvement in cardiac function.
Throughout the hospitalization period, there was steady progress observed in this patient's condition. As liver enzyme levels decreased along with infection-related markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), it indicated a positive response to treatment interventions along with an improved overall prognosis.
After 13 days of hospitalization, follow-up assessments such as electrocardiogram readings demonstrated normal results confirming functional recovery of the heart muscle along with chest computed tomography scans showing resolution of lung abnormalities.
Upon discharge, the patient was prescribed bisoprolol and ramipril, both of which are commonly used in the management of heart failure to maintain optimal cardiac function. The absence of further episodes of breathlessness during the two-week follow-up indicated successful treatment and resolution of symptoms. 
This case highlights the importance of conducting a thorough evaluation in patients presenting with overlapping symptoms and considering all possible differential diagnoses. It also demonstrates the significance of utilizing various diagnostic tools such as serological testing, cardiac imaging, and laboratory investigations to establish an accurate diagnosis.
Furthermore, this case emphasizes individualized treatment based on the underlying cause while addressing associated complications like liver dysfunction. The successful management ultimately led to clinical improvement and favorable outcomes for this patient.
In summary, through a comprehensive diagnostic approach along with prompt intervention using supportive medications targeted at managing cardiac-related issues, this patient experienced significant recovery from CMV-induced fulminant myocarditis alongside resolution of hepatic abnormalities and pulmonary manifestations. This case contributes to our understanding of similar presentations involving viral infections causing fulminant myocarditis alongside multi-organ involvement necessitating a multidisciplinary approach for effective management. 
This clinical case involves a patient who presented with a concerning wound on the sole of their foot, leading to suspicion of leprosy. The patient, an elderly man, also had a history of hypertension and heart failure. After further evaluation, it was determined that the wound was not due to leprosy but instead diagnosed as pyogenic granuloma.
Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular lesion that commonly occurs on the skin or mucous membranes. It often appears as a rapidly growing and bleeding red or purple bump. In this case, the ulceration on the patient's foot was significant and continued to grow.
To determine the nature of the wound, several tests were conducted. Blood work showed within normal ranges for white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and platelet count (Plt). Fasting blood glucose levels were also within normal limits. Urea levels indicated kidney function at 0.42 G/L, while creatinine levels were slightly elevated at 6.10 mg/l.
Additional tests were performed to rule out other potential causes such as HIV and leprosy. HIV serology came back negative, and tests for leprosy on the wound yielded negative results as well.
Culture analysis of pus collected from the foot revealed Staphylococcus aureus presence but indicated sensitivity to cefixime, amino acidsides, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid combination therapy, and rifampicin antibiotics.
A biopsy was then performed on three different locations within the wound for further analysis under a microscope. The results showed focal ulceration on the surface and superficial dermis with granulation tissue formation containing elongated or oval vascular structures made up of non-atypical benign endothelial cells. There was also a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with fibroblasts and significant fibroblastic proliferation comprised of elongated fusiform cells. Additionally, slight hyperplasia in the surface malpighian epithelium was noted, but no malignant cells were observed.
Based on these findings, the diagnosis for this patient was a pyogenic granuloma, also known as botryomycome.
Treatment options were discussed with the patient's family. However, they refused surgical excision recommended by healthcare providers. As an alternative, the patient was initiated on antibiotic therapy, receiving ceftriaxone 1g twice daily and gentamicin 80mg twice daily for ten days. Daily wound care involved washing with a water-based solution containing betadine.
Unfortunately, after completion of this treatment course, the patient's condition did not significantly improve. Surgical excision was proposed again; however, the family rejected it once more. Considering that rifampicin has been shown to have effects on chronic leprous lesions and considering dapsoneâs pharmacodynamic action in such situations; therefore dapsone/rifampicin combination therapy was suggested to the patient as both medications were available free of cost at their healthcare center.
The patient received dapsone/rifampicin treatment for one month with regular follow-ups scheduled throughout this period. After one month of treatment with this regimen showed very encouraging results; there was remarkable regression of swelling and total disappearance of exuding wounds that used to bleed even on minor contact.
In summary, this clinical case highlights initial suspicion of leprosy due to an ulceration and budding wound on the foot which ultimately led to a diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma upon further examination under microscopy and culture analysis. Despite initially unsuccessful intervention attempts using antibiotics recommended based on culture analysis results alone, subsequent treatment using dapsone/rifampicin combination therapy resulted in a notable improvement in the patient's condition. 
Patient Case: Finger Prosthesis for Rehabilitation
Introduction:
In this clinical case, we discuss a patient who suffered multiple amputations of both hands. The patient expressed a desire to improve their quality of life by requesting finger prostheses. After careful consideration and consent from the patient, a plan was formulated to utilize silicone prostheses as the first stage of treatment. This involved taking measurements by a Certified Prosthetist and following various manufacturing steps to create the customized finger prosthesis.
Impression Taking:
Taking impressions plays a crucial role in creating accurate and well-fitting prosthetics. In this case, due to the amputation of the distal phalanx of the second finger, obtaining an impression on that specific finger was challenging. Instead, an impression was taken on the contralateral finger (opposite side) to ensure proper fitting.
Using hydrophilic vinyl-polysiloxane impression material, two layers were wrapped around the fingers while they were in a relaxed position. After approximately 10 minutes, once the material had set, negative molds were removed from the fingers. This step provided essential information about their shape and size.
Creation of Wax Pattern and Final Mold:
To replicate the hand's anatomy accurately before proceeding with silicone manufacturing, liquid wax was poured into each negative mold retrieved from earlier impressions. This process resulted in positive replicas that served as templates for subsequent steps.
A second impression was then taken from each wax mold to create final molds that would be used for incorporating silicone solution into them later on.
Suspension Cavity Creation:
Ensuring proper suspension is vital when it comes to securing and stabilizing prosthetic devices onto patients' residual limbs effectively. In this case, a suspension cavity was specifically created within each final mold using cast-made pinsâa technique detailed in previous studies referenced [9] [10]. These pins help maintain suspension by gripping onto surrounding tissues or structures inside each mold during prosthetic attachment.
Color-Matching and Aesthetics:
To blend seamlessly with the patient's skin tone, artist's oil colors were mixed with the silicone solution. This color-matching process aims to create a lifelike appearance for the prostheses, further enhancing their natural-looking aspect.
Manufacturing Process and Heat Treatment:
In an ideal setting, an electric oven would be used to heat the silicone solution inside each mold. However, due to unavailability, a kitchen gas stove was utilized as an alternative heating source. The completed molds were closed and placed on the stove for approximately one hour.
To ensure even temperature distribution throughout each cast mold, they were turned periodically on the gas stove surface. This step helped maintain uniformity in heat exposure among different areas of the molds.
Prosthesis Finalization:
Following completion of heating treatment, the finished prostheses were carefully retrieved from their molds. Excess silicone flesh protruding at margins was trimmed off to achieve clean and well-finished edges.
Patient Fitting and Satisfaction:
After receiving education regarding proper care for the prosthesis, including how to don and doff it correctly, the patient tried on their new finger prostheses. With good suspension achieved through earlier techniques outlined above in conjunction with a realistic skin color match obtained during manufacturing stages; these custom-made finger prostheses successfully met both functional and aesthetic requirements according to patient feedback.
The individual reported no pain while wearing them and demonstrated improved grip ability by successfully grasping objectsâa significant positive outcome indicating successful rehabilitation following amputations. Overall satisfaction with both appearance and function was reported by this patient who can now enjoy an enhanced quality of life thanks to these custom finger prostheses.
Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights a successful rehabilitation approach through custom finger prosthesis manufacturing utilizing various techniques such as impression taking, wax pattern creation, suspension cavity formation within molds, color-matching steps using artist's oil colors, and the use of a gas stove for heat treatment. Through careful planning and collaboration between the prosthetist, patient, and healthcare team, a high-quality silicone finger prosthesis was created to meet the patient's individual needs, resulting in improved functionality, comfort, aesthetics, and overall satisfaction. 
This case is of a middle-aged businessman who presented with chest pain that worsened with exertion. It is important to note that he had no history of smoking, alcoholism, or substance abuse. Additionally, there was no known exposure to tuberculosis (TB) or COVID-19 in his family or close contacts, and he had not recently traveled abroad. However, twenty days prior to the onset of symptoms, he had traveled by a domestic airline.
Upon examination, his vital signs were notable for a pulse rate of 108 per minute and arterial blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. His respiratory rate was elevated at 30 breaths per minute.
The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) on room air was 89%, which significantly dropped by 70% after exertion. On auscultation (listening with a stethoscope), crepitation sounds were detected on bilateral middle lung lobesâindicative of abnormal crackling sounds caused by tiny air sacs in the lungs filling with fluid.
Given these findings and the suspicion for concurrent TB and COVID-19 infections due to his recent domestic travel history and clinical presentation, further investigations were advised. These included a chest radiograph (PA-view), sputum microscopy using Ziehl Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilliâa common method to identify mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosisâand a Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CBNAAT) on the sputum sample.
To assess for COVID-19 infection specifically, qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from an oropharyngeal swab was recommended.
Surprisingly, both TB-specific tests revealed presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum samples while confirming absence of Rifampicin resistanceâthe first-line anti-TB medication.
Furthermore, PCR testing confirmed RNA specific to SARS-CoV-2âthe virus responsible for COVID-19.
The chest radiograph showed bilateral consolidations in the middle lung fields with ill-defined bordersâsuggestive of areas of infection and inflammation. Additional laboratory investigations revealed a low lymphocyte count, increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). All these are non-specific markers of infection and inflammation.
To further confirm the diagnosis, a sputum sample was sent for liquid culture using MGIT BACTEC method, which eventually showed growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosisâthe gold standard test for TB diagnosis. However, due to cost-effectiveness and patient preference against performing a computed tomography (CT) scan, this diagnostic procedure was not pursued.
Since the patient met both TB and COVID-19 criteria, he was referred to the nearest designated COVID-19 management center where he received appropriate care following national guidelines.
In addition to managing his confirmed COVID-19 infection, he also initiated four-drug antitubercular treatment according to the guidelines set by the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP).
Post-treatment completion at the designated center, follow-up evaluations were recommended; however, as mentioned in the case description, the patient has not yet reported back for follow-up.
It is worth noting that written informed consent was obtained from this patient prior to using his clinical data and images for publication purposes in this study.
These findings demonstrate a unique case where simultaneous TB and COVID-19 infections were diagnosed based on clinical history, examination findings supported by various diagnostic tests specific to each disease. Proper management according to national guidelines is crucial in ensuring optimal outcomes for patients with dual infections like these. 
In this clinical case, a pregnant patient with a history of two previous vaginal deliveries and no complications presented to the hospital after being diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy on ultrasound. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, typically in one of the fallopian tubes. In this particular case, the patient had a viable intrauterine fetus but also a demised left adnexal fetus.
The patient did not have any constitutional symptoms such as fever or weight loss, and she did not report any significant gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms. She had no medical or surgical history of note and tested negative for HIV. It is important to mention that she had not been screened for cervical cancer before.
On physical examination, the patient appeared conscious and stable with normal blood pressure and pulse rate. However, she felt warm to touch indicating a possible mild fever. Her abdominal examination did not reveal any abnormalities except for bilateral adnexal fullness. Adnexa refers to structures adjacent to the uterus, including ovaries and fallopian tubes.
Laboratory findings showed neutrophilic leucocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) along with normocytic anemia (low red blood cell count), which is often seen in cases of infection or inflammation.
The initial plan was to perform laparoscopy on this patient; however due to limitations in theater availability, it was decided to proceed with laparotomy instead. A Pfannestiel incision (a horizontal cut made just above the pubic area) was created, revealing around 100 milliliters of pus within the abdomen (pyoperitoneum). To further examine all areas of the abdomen, a midline incision was made.
During exploration through these incisions it became evident that there was an ectopic pregnancy on her left side at one end of her fallopian tube which resulted in rupture. As a result, the fallopian tube was removed (salpingectomy) to prevent further complications. An identifiable fetus was noted and no histology (tissue analysis) was performed on it.
Interestingly, a ruptured appendix with a well-organized abscess was also found during the surgery. The remains of the appendix were minimal and all necrotic debris was removed. The rest of the abdomen appeared normal with only scanty fibrinous adhesions, which are bands of scar tissue that can form in response to inflammation or injury.
To ensure thorough cleansing of the abdominal cavity, a saline lavage (washing out with saline solution) was performed before closing up. Unfortunately, due to extensive necrosis (tissue death), there was no viable appendix specimen available for histology.
Postoperatively, the patient received intravenous fluids along with antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole) for infection control purposes and paracetamol for pain management. She recovered well without any complications and was discharged on the fifth day after undergoing laparotomy.
Two weeks later she returned for follow-up review where she reported feeling well and her surgical incision appeared to be healing nicely. Ultrasound confirmed that her intrauterine pregnancy continued successfully; however, further information about its outcome is still pending investigation.
In conclusion, this clinical case describes a pregnant patient who presented with both an ectopic pregnancy requiring surgical intervention as well as an incidental finding of a ruptured appendix during surgery. Prompt management through laparotomy led to successful removal of the ectopic pregnancy and treatment of appendicitis resulting in complete recovery for the patient during her hospital stay.
 
This clinical case involves a patient who presented with various symptoms and laboratory findings that led to a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with lupus nephritis class III, anti-phospholipid syndrome, and primary hyperparathyroidism.
The initial blood count showed low hemoglobin levels (9g/dl) and slightly elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) at 85 Âµ3. Lymphopenia was also observed (400/mm3), while platelets remained within the normal range (450,000/mm3). The direct Coombs test was negative, indicating the absence of red blood cell antibodies. Additional laboratory results revealed low serum albumin levels (25g/l), low total protein levels (50g/l), proteinuria at 3.2g/day, and normal creatinine levels.
Autoimmune markers were assessed in this patient to further investigate the underlying cause of her symptoms. The anti-nuclear antibody panel showed positivity for ANA at a titer of 1/320 with a homogeneous pattern. Anti-dsDNA level was elevated at 160U/ml, indicating the presence of specific antibodies associated with SLE. Furthermore, anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies were detected at a positive level of 25UGPL.
Complement fractions C3 and C4 were found to be low (0.2 g/l and 0.05 g/l), suggesting complement activation commonly seen in autoimmune conditions such as SLE.
Imaging studies played an important role in diagnosing this patient's condition. A chest computed tomography scan revealed proximal pulmonary embolism â a potentially life-threatening complication associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. On the other hand, renal ultrasound did not show any abnormalities.
A renal biopsy confirmed lupus nephritis characterized by immunocomplex deposition with segmental mesangial proliferation â indicative of mild activity according to the World Health Organization's classification of lupus nephritis (class III A/C).
In addition to symptoms related to SLE and lupus nephritis, the patient also exhibited features suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism. Elevated serum calcium levels (132 mg/l) and hypercalciuria (479 mg/24 h) were observed. Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels were also significantly elevated at 628 pg/ml.
Further investigations revealed a lower left parathyroid nodule measuring 2cm x 1 cm on CT scan and ultrasound imaging â confirming the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism.
The combination of lupus nephritis, hypercalcemia, and osteoporosis led to therapeutic interventions targeting each condition. The patient received a pulse of methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone as well as intravenous cyclophosphamide for treatment of lupus nephritis. Maintenance therapy included mycophenolate mofetil and hydroxychloroquine.
For the pulmonary embolism associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin was initiated followed by antivitamin K therapy.
To address severe hypercalcemia caused by primary hyperparathyroidism, intravenous fluids alongside furosemide were administered before surgical removal of the affected parathyroid gland. Histopathological examination confirmed a parathyroid adenoma.
Following surgery, the patient experienced transient hypocalcemia characterized by oral paresthesia â a common complication seen after successful removal of a diseased parathyroid gland. Oral calcium supplementation was required for several months until her calcium levels stabilized.
During her four-year follow-up period, no relapses or significant symptoms related to SLE were observed. Control over proteinuria was achieved without corticosteroid use post-operatively.
In conclusion, this complex clinical case illustrates how multiple conditions such as SLE, lupus nephritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and primary hyperparathyroidism can coexist. A multidimensional treatment approach involving immunosuppressive agents, anticoagulation therapy, surgical intervention for hyperparathyroidism, and supportive measures effectively managed the patient's condition without significant complications. Regular monitoring and follow-up aided in the successful management of her long-term care. 
Title: A Case of Talar Osteomyelitis and Septic Arthritis
Introduction:
This clinical case describes the presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of a patient with talar osteomyelitis (bone infection) and septic arthritis (joint infection). Understanding this case is crucial to highlight the importance of prompt diagnosis, early intervention, and appropriate antibiotic therapy in managing such infections.
Case Presentation:
The patient presented with aggravated symptoms including ankle edema, warmth on palpation, diffuse tenderness, and high fever (39Â°C). Initial diagnostic assessments revealed anemia (hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dl), elevated white blood cell count (18800/mm^3), increased C-reactive protein levels (75 mm/hr), as well as other elevated serum laboratory markers. Although a computed tomography scan showed a fracture of the talus bone in the ankle joint region, talar osteomyelitis with septic arthritis was still suspected based on clinical findings.
Diagnostic Assessment:
Further investigations included an X-ray which displayed a lytic lesion on the posterior-medial aspect of the talus along with soft tissue swelling surrounding the ankle joint. Bone scintigraphy confirmed septic arthritis and bone marrow edema without allowing for an accurate diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Unfortunately, magnetic resonance imaging was unavailable at that time.
Therapeutic Intervention:
Given urgent circumstances to manage this patient's condition promptly, he underwent surgery where exploration of the ankle joint through an anterior approach enabled visualization of false membranes along with turbid fluid accumulation at the junction between bone cartilage in the talus. An opening into this cavity led to drainage and removal of fibrinous pus. Biopsy specimens were obtained for histopathological examination and culture testing at that site. Curettage followed by irrigation were performed before closure using suction drains.
Follow-up & Outcomes:
At first three days post-surgery, febrile peaks persisted. However, blood culture and joint specimen tests isolated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Anatomopathological analysis of the ankle specimen highlighted abscess formation and hyperplastic synovial cells. As a result, intravenous antibiotic treatment was modified and teicoplanin was initiated. Following drainage maintenance for twelve days (until normalization of C-reactive protein), intravenous antibiotics were continued for three weeks. By the third week, peripheral leukocyte count decreased to 8600/mL, and C-reactive protein levels significantly dropped to 2.43mg.
Sustained Progress:
Antibiotics were then shifted to oral pristinamycin for three weeks as inflammatory markers continued to decrease in the fourth week (erythrocyte sedimentation rate-7 mm/hr; C-reactive protein-3 mg/L). In terms of patient outcomes, no pain or limitations in ankle mobility were reported during follow-up visits at six months and eighteen months postoperatively. Radiographic imaging at six months displayed complete healing of the lesion.
Discussion:
This clinical case highlights how prompt diagnosis along with aggressive surgical intervention, appropriate antibiotic therapy targeted against MRSA infection, followed by careful monitoring can yield favorable outcomes.
Conclusion:
Talar osteomyelitis associated with septic arthritis is a serious condition that warrants urgent medical attention due to its potential complications such as joint destruction if left untreated. Close follow-up with appropriate diagnostic modalities like imaging studies is crucial to guide surgical interventions when required. The successful management in this case emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary approaches involving surgeons, infectious disease specialists, microbiologists, nurses - all working together towards optimal patient care and recovery.
Word Count: 600 words 
This clinical case presents a patient with a swollen right lower limb that has dark discoloration from the toes to mid-thigh, indicating poor circulation. The leg is also cold and there are weak pulses in the popliteal and dorsalis pedis areas compared to the opposite limb. Sensation is intact but there is no muscle power. The rest of the physical examination did not reveal any remarkable findings.
Based on these signs and symptoms, a diagnosis of compartment syndrome of the right thigh secondary to Nicolau syndrome was made. Compartment syndrome occurs when increased pressure within a closed muscle compartment impairs blood supply, leading to tissue ischemia (lack of oxygen-rich blood) and potential damage. Nicolau syndrome refers to an uncommon complication following intramuscular drug injections resulting in significant local tissue injury.
To further investigate this case, several tests were performed including full blood count (FBC), urea, electrolytes, creatinine, liver enzymes, INR (international normalized ratio), and doppler ultrasound of the right lower limb. The FBC results came back normal; however, urea and creatinine levels were elevated indicating impaired kidney function with values of 13.5mmol/l and 242.2umol/l respectively.
Liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were significantly elevated at 997.7U/L and 115.6IU/L respectively suggesting liver dysfunction or injury. INR was mildly elevated at 1.57 which can indicate impaired coagulation ability.
Emergency fasciotomy surgery was conducted after approximately 24 hours from presentation when surgeons reviewed the patient's condition intraoperatively revealing bulging osteofascial compartments upon incision with clear fluid but minimal bleeding observed.
Following surgery, broad spectrum antibiotics were administered including imipenem IV three times daily along with metronidazole IV. Analgesia was provided with tramadol IM twice a day. The acute kidney injury (AKI) was managed conservatively by restricting fluid intake and avoiding nephrotoxic drugs. After five days, the AKI resolved with urea and creatinine levels dropping to 3.36mmol/l and 37.26umol/l respectively.
Liver function also improved as ALT and AST dropped to 64.1U/L and 180.3IU/l respectively, while albumin levels were measured at 18.5g/L.
Despite these improvements, there was no recovery of blood circulation in the right leg and foot two days after fasciotomy surgery resulting in dry gangrene where the affected tissues no longer receive adequate blood flow leading to tissue death (necrosis). Planned below knee amputation was suggested as a treatment option but parents denied consent, delaying appropriate management.
As time progressed, the patient's condition deteriorated further with spiking temperatures despite being on imipenem antibiotic therapy for infection control. The swelling worsened with intense pain in the right thigh, accompanied by blister formation on the thigh skin indicating progression from dry gangrene to wet gangrene where bacterial infection is present along with tissue death.
Thirteen days after fasciotomy surgery, a diagnosis of dry gangrene with superimposed wet gangrene was officially made based on physical examination findings as depicted in Figure 3.
Parents were again counseled about the urgent need for amputation but refused consent once more until finally approving an above knee amputation (AKA) four days later due to worsening clinical condition including convulsions attributed to high body temperatures which were controlled using diazepam IV injections.
The AKA procedure revealed cooked muscles in the patient's right thigh due to poor perfusion or inadequate blood supply for an extended period of time resulting in muscle damage due to oxygen deprivation.
Postoperatively, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and tramadol were administered. Fever resolved following the amputation. The surgical wound was exposed 24 hours later and ordered to be cleaned daily.
Once stable, the patient was discharged but required occupational therapy sessions at the physiotherapy department as shown in Figure 4 to aid in her rehabilitation after amputation.
In summary, this case highlights the complications that can arise from a severe condition like compartment syndrome. Delayed treatment due to parental refusal for consent resulted in further progression of gangrene and subsequent amputation. This emphasizes the importance of timely medical intervention and informed decision making for appropriate management of critical conditions like compartment syndrome. 
Title: Abscess Formation due to Migration of a Gallstone: A Challenging Clinical Case
Introduction:
Gallstones are a common affliction that can often be managed through non-invasive methods or surgical interventions. However, complications arising from gallstones migration can sometimes lead to complex and challenging clinical cases. In this case study, we explore the journey of a patient who experienced an array of symptoms before being diagnosed with an abscess caused by the migration of a gallstone. The patient's management and eventual recovery will also be discussed.
Case Presentation:
The patient initially underwent surgery for an unrelated condition, which was followed by discharge without any postoperative complications. However, one month later, the patient reported new onset abdominal pain in the upper right quadrant that progressively worsened over time. On examination in the emergency room, he exhibited signs such as sweating and tenderness during palpation of the right hypochondrium.
Investigations:
Considering his recent surgical history, laboratory tests were conducted which revealed leukocytosis without neutrophilia along with elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). A computerized tomography (CT) scan showed thickening at transverse and internal oblique muscles in the right hypochondrium region, associated with surrounding fat densification and hyper-attenuation.
To further clarify these findings, an ultrasound examination was performed revealing pericentrimetric calcification about 6 cm deep from the skin surface along with adjacent pseudonodular densification suggestive of migrated stone and small surrounding collection.
Management:
The patient was discharged with antibiotics therapy (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) for bacterial infection control. Symptoms improved initially; however intermittent pain persisted during regular follow-up visits.
Subsequently, elective removal of gallstone was proposed but before undergoing surgery again; he returned to the emergency department due to severe abdominal pain associated with fever and right upper abdominal swelling. Abdominal examination revealed a hard, painful mass with signs of inflammation in the right hypochondrium.
Further investigations:
Laboratory work demonstrated leukocytosis without neutrophilia. Ultrasound and CT scan revealed a hypoechoic structure suggesting an abscess or phlegm with possible liquefaction within the abdominal wall. In addition, prominent anterior parietal thickening with deep calcifications was observed, presumably representing chondral alteration and perhaps another gallstone.
Diagnosis and Treatment:
Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with an abscess of the abdominal wall caused by a migrated gallstone. A course of antibiotics therapy was initiated for one week followed by surgery under general anesthesia to extract the gallstone and foreign body granuloma occupying the entire abdominal wall.
During surgery, no evidence of abscess formation was found in the abdominal wall; instead, a foreign body granuloma containing a pigmented gallstone in pre-peritoneal position provided confirmation. The extracted materials were sent for histopathological examination to confirm their nature.
Post-operative period and Follow-up:
The patient's recovery following surgery was uneventful, accompanied by progressive improvement in symptoms. Regular follow-up visits were conducted over a year-long monitoring period, during which he remained asymptomatic without any further manifestations related to lost gallstones.
Conclusion:
This complex clinical case highlights challenges associated with complications arising from migrated gallstones. Early recognition through advanced imaging techniques such as ultrasound and CT scan plays a vital role in accurate diagnosis leading to appropriate management strategies including antibiotic therapy if necessary followed by surgical intervention when indicated. Understanding such cases enhances our ability to provide optimal care for patients facing similar conditions while mitigating potential long-term complications associated with retained foreign bodies or calculi. 
This clinical case describes the journey of a patient with a complex cardiac condition who becomes pregnant. 
The patient had previously undergone phlebotomy due to hyperviscosity, but despite being advised about the risks of pregnancy, she insisted on having a child. At the time of her first pregnancy at age 32, she experienced a miscarriage in the first trimester. However, one year later, she presented to our clinic once again, this time with a seven-week pregnancy.
At this point in the patient's history, she was not on any medication and had only mild effort intolerance (NYHA II). Her blood pressure and pulse rate were within normal limits. However, her oxygen saturations ranged between 86% and 89%, indicating lower than optimal levels. Further investigation through transthoracic echocardiography revealed that her heart anatomy was in line with what was observed during her childhood surgical procedure.
The echocardiogram showed usual veno-atrial and atrioventricular connections but revealed that there was a diminutive outlet portion of the right ventricle without continuity to an arterial segment. Both ventricles were connected to a solitary arterial trunk through sub-arterial VSD (ventricular septal defect). Additionally, large collateral vessels known as major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) were found originating from the descending aorta and appeared to be responsible for pulmonary blood flow.
Despite these findings and signs of pulmonary hypertension on echocardiography, which necessitated emphasizing again the risks of pregnancy to both mother and fetus including termination as an option for management plan discussions â this time with input from various specialists -the patient insisted on continuing with the pregnancy.
With multidisciplinary collaboration among experts including cardiologists obstetrician/gynecologists, cardiac anesthetists), it was determined that close monitoring would be required throughout pregnancy along with considerations regarding deliver As the patient progressed in her pregnancy, her effort tolerance worsened and her oxygen saturation dropped to 80%. Her hemoglobin levels also rose to 19.9g/dl, indicating a higher than normal level of red blood cells. As a result, she was admitted to the hospital at 28 weeks gestation and placed on bed rest with close surveillance and regular fetal monitoring.
To address the risk of thromboembolism, the patient was prescribed elastic compression stockings and anticoagulated with warfarin, targeting an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2 and 3. This medication helps prevent blood clots from forming. Additionally, pelvic scans were performed throughout the pregnancy to monitor fetal development.
Unfortunately, subsequent scans showed signs of oligohydramnios, which indicates a decrease in amniotic fluid volume. Given this finding and concerns for both mother and fetus's well-being at this point in the pregnancy (34 weeks), it was decided that delivery was necessary.
An elective Caesarean section was performed at 34 weeks under general anesthesia. The infant delivered weighed only 1.2 kg but had APGAR scores of 6 at one minute after birth which increased to7 by five minutes post-birth indicating overall good condition.
On the second day following delivery, however,the mother developed congestive heart failure leading to symptoms such as fluid retention and shortness of breath.Based on these symptoms,she received diuretics(furosemideand spironolactone)for effective management . Fortunately,the response was positive,and she responded well to treatment.Following this treatment plan,she remained hospitalized for approximately one week before being discharged.
The newborn baby required initial care inthe neonatal intensive care unit but subsequent echocardiogram showed no evidence of congenital heart defects(CHD). Post-delivery evaluation indicated that the mother's ventricular function remained good on echocardiogram.
Approximately a year after delivery, a computed tomographic angiography was conducted to further evaluate the patient's pulmonary blood flow sources. The results showed that the ascending aorta measured 45mm and had a normal branching pattern.
Furthermore, it was observed that the right lung was supplied by an 18mm MAPCA from the descending aorta and the left lung was supplied by another MAPCA measuring 20mm with origin stenosis. These findings provided valuable information regarding the patient's condition following delivery.
Over time, following up six years post-delivery, both the mother and child have been reported as doing well. Although her effort tolerance has diminished moderately since becoming a mother, she is still able to care for her child and perform her daily tasks reasonably well.
This case highlights the complexity of managing pregnancy in patients with underlying cardiac conditions. It required close collaboration among various specialist teams to develop an appropriate management plan that considered both maternal and fetal well-being. Regular monitoring throughout pregnancy along with careful consideration of risks enabled successful outcomes for both mother and child in this case.
 
Case Summary:
This clinical case involves a 13-month-old child who experienced an episode of fever, followed by convulsions. The child was referred to a tertiary care center and admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) for 15 days with a high-grade fever and refractory status epilepticus. Despite becoming afebrile after three days of admission, the seizures continued until day six. At discharge, the child had a frequency of 10 seizure episodes per day and displayed neuroregression in all developmental domains.
The child exhibited several concerning symptoms upon evaluation. He was unable to hold his neck or roll, had difficulty speaking, and did not respond to visual stimuli. He also showed generalized hypotonia, preferred W-sitting (a seated posture that can lead to muscle imbalances), had tightness in his bilateral hamstrings and calf muscles, engaged in body rocking behavior, chewed on his clothes, lacked eye contact or visual fixation/tracking abilities, and displayed equivocal light perception.
Diagnostic assessments were challenging due to the visual and cognitive impairments observed in the child. Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) was used to evaluate gross motor function classification level IV (indicating severe limitations). The Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS) score was determined as 5 out of possible 56 points.
Physiotherapy intervention played a crucial role in this case. The initial phase involved sustained stretching of both calf and hamstring muscles using functional positions while utilizing unstable surfaces like equilibrium boards and swiss balls for sitting balance challenges. Additionally:
1. A swing system provided vestibular input.
2. Visual stimuli were used to elicit responses.
3 Transitions like supine-to-sit and sit-to-stand were facilitated.
4 Proprioceptive stimulus provided through bouncing on a trampoline with support.
5 Weight-bearing exercises were included.
6 Joint compressions aided proprioception stimulation.
7 The use of a chewy tube addressed sensory needs.
Gradually, the child regained the ability to sit and stand without support and started using a walker (rollator) as a walking aid. The parents were educated about the home exercise program, which they implemented under professional guidance during follow-up visits over two years.
On reassessment, it was observed that the child had made progress. He could walk unsupported on uneven surfaces under supervision and demonstrated improved visual responsiveness. Additionally, behavioral improvements such as decreased body rocking and chewing on clothes were noted. The child showcased increased participation in social gatherings due to enhanced functional abilities.
Ultimately, this case demonstrates how a multidisciplinary approach involving physiotherapy can positively influence the outcomes of patients with complex neurological disorders. A comprehensive treatment plan tailored to each patient's specific needs can lead to significant improvements in motor function, balance control, and overall quality of life.
 The continued physiotherapy intervention played a pivotal role in maximizing the child's functional abilities. In the second phase of regular physiotherapy, which lasted for six months under the supervision of a physiotherapist, the primary goal was to achieve unsupported walking while considering the child's visual impairment.
During this phase, various sessions were conducted to challenge and enhance the child's balance and walking abilities. The therapist incorporated activities that required standing on equilibrium boards and stability discs with minimal support. The child also practiced walking on compliant surfaces, ramps, uneven terrains, and across obstacle courses. Negotiating stairs with moderate assistance while holding onto the railing became part of their routine.
To promote further sensory integration and coordination, proprioceptive (sensations from joints, muscles, and tendons), vestibular (balance-related sensations), and visual inputs were strategically incorporated into each session. These inputs aimed to enhance body awareness, spatial orientation, and overall motor planning skills in order to overcome challenges associated with visual impairment.
Following completion of this intensive course of physiotherapy intervention focusing on gait training and balance control enhancement techniques specific to visual impairments over different terrains/settings/environments/stressors/obstacles; it was observed that remarkable progress had been made by the child.
The child was now able to sit without support and stand independently. He demonstrated improved control during ambulation tasks on uneven surfaces as he successfully negotiated through them with standby supervision only when necessary for safety purposes. Moreover, there were positive improvements observed in his vision as indicated by his responsiveness towards light stimuli while seemingly avoiding collisions or bumping into objects or persons around him more effectively than before.
Psychosocially speaking; these improvements in functional activities greatly increased his participation in social gatherings as he became more mobile independent allowing him to engage freely with peers without constraints relating specifically due solely based upon functional limitations alone.
Further assessments conducted at ages 5 years old completed for adjusted GMFCS Level IV classification and 8 years old showcased the functional abilities and milestones achieved at significantly later time points. These assessments provide valuable evidence of the long-term benefits and impact of early physiotherapy intervention on the child's overall development.
This clinical case highlights the importance of early intervention, multidisciplinary collaboration, and individualized treatment plans when dealing with complex neurological disorders. Physiotherapy techniques incorporating principles such as neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) and sensory integration (SI) have shown promising results in improving motor function, balance control, adaptive behavior, independence in mobility tasks for children with neuroregression post fever-related seizure episodes leading to significant regression across multiple developmental domains.
Beyond motor improvements alone; these interventions also contribute positively towards psychosocial development by improving functional independence that directly translates into improved participation within social environments.
However, it is essential to note that each case is unique, requiring a tailored approach based on an individual patient's specific needs. Close monitoring and ongoing reassessment are crucial to modify treatment plans as necessary in order to achieve optimal outcomes.
In conclusion, this clinical case demonstrates how a comprehensive physiotherapy intervention utilizing various therapeutic approaches can positively influence the functional outcomes for children experiencing neurological regression following fever-related seizure episodes. Continued supportive care along with ongoing evaluation ensures that patients like this young child have access to comprehensive management strategies contributing towards their holistic well-being throughout different stages of their life span whilst living alongside complexity through both physical impairments as well as cognitive aspects impairment too ââ thus promoting improved quality of lives not only for themselves but also those within their familial support networks/community around them far beyond hospital walls or clinic doors alone providing potentially life-changing chances that helps emancipate individuals from disability restrictions often seen upon them due solely based predominantly due solely simply because they were affected by medical conditions entirely out their realms control placed upon since birth albeit temporary or lingering causations stemming from febrile states dressed atop neural sequelae complications. 
Title: A Complex Clinical Case: Diagnosis and Treatment of Neonatal Jaundice
Introduction:
This case report outlines the clinical course, diagnosis, and treatment of a neonate presenting with significant hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, fever, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), and abnormal liver function. The initial suspicion was for biliary atresia due to worsening symptoms over time; however, the ultimate diagnosis turned out to be a congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
Case Summary:
A newborn baby presented with jaundice on the third day of life followed by fever on the fourth day. Initial laboratory investigations revealed unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with an increasing proportion of conjugated bilirubin within 6 days. Additionally, thrombocytopenia (reduced platelet count) led to blood transfusion due to low hematocrit levels.
Further diagnostic tests were performed including a hepatobiliary scan ruling out obvious abnormalities and screening for various infections such as hepatitis B/C and syphilis. As feed tolerance improved initially but weight loss continued despite treatment measures, heightened suspicion for biliary atresia arose.
A repeat ultrasound showed a contracted gallbladder with thickened walls further suggesting possible cholecystitis related to biliary atresia. However, this notion was later disproven by another scan.
With limited diagnostic options remaining in play without indication from specific findings or results from alpha-1 antitrypsin assay screening due to practical constraints - CMV infection became strongly suspected leading to subsequent CMV screening which confirmed high IgM titers indicating recent infection in both mother and baby.
Treatment Approach:
Intravenous Ganciclovir was initiated promptly following confirmation of congenital CMV infection in the neonate which underwent therapy for three weeks before transitioning into oral Valganciclovir for an additional three weeks. Throughout the course of intravenous therapy, frequent phlebitis incidences occurred due to Ganciclovir administration requiring repeated cannulation.
Monitoring:
Weekly full blood count tests were performed during treatment which revealed a decline in neutrophil count, although never dropping to levels classifying as neutropenia. Importantly, liver function parameters consistently improved and eventually normalized by 12 months of age.
Clinical Outcome:
Fortunately, the child experienced no apparent neurological abnormalities during or after treatment and achieved normal developmental milestones within normal limits up until the last follow-up at 15 months of age. Normal hearing and visual tests further supported healthy development.
Conclusion:
This complex clinical case initially raised suspicion for biliary atresia due to progressive symptoms but ultimately resulted in a diagnosis of congenital CMV infection necessitating prompt antiviral therapy. The diligent management and successful outcome underscored the importance of thorough differential diagnosis, extensive testing for viral infections when faced with diagnostic uncertainties, and early initiation of appropriate treatment protocols. Communication between healthcare professionals, including nurses experienced in science communication like myself, plays a vital role in conveying accurate information regarding diagnosis, monitoring, management strategies to caregivers while addressing their concerns throughout such challenging cases.

Understanding the clinical course in this case is crucial for comprehending the complexity of the diagnostic process and subsequent treatment strategies.
The presence of neonatal jaundice, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes initially raised concerns about liver dysfunction. However, the normal clotting profile and serum protein levels helped rule out severe liver impairment or decompensation.
To exclude common causes of neonatal jaundice such as viral hepatitis (Hepatitis B and C), syphilis, and HIV, specific serological tests were performed but all came back negative. This further complicated the diagnosis as no clear etiology was identified based on initial screening.
The progressive increase in conjugated bilirubin levels over time highlighted worsening hepatobiliary dysfunction. Additionally, thrombocytopenia indicated impaired platelet production or function in response to liver dysfunction.
As feed tolerance improved but weight loss persisted despite nutritional support measures, concerns grew regarding biliary atresia - a congenital condition characterized by blocked bile ducts leading to impaired bile flow from the liver into the intestines. However, repeated ultrasound evaluations failed to demonstrate characteristic findings associated with biliary atresia.
Given these diagnostic challenges alongside persistent abnormal liver function parameters such as elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels beyond reference values and a peak value that reached 3,090 IU/L - considerations for alternative diagnoses gained prominence.
Further investigations led to screening for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection due to its potential association with prolonged neonatal cholestasis. The serological tests revealed strong positive IgM titers for CMV infection not only in the baby but also in their mother. This confirmed recent maternal-fetal transmission of CMV during pregnancy leading to congenital infection.
Prompt initiation of intravenous Ganciclovir followed by oral Valganciclovir successfully managed CMV infection in this case. Frequent intravenous cannulation and phlebitis episodes were significant challenges encountered during the administration of Ganciclovir. However, diligent monitoring including weekly full blood count tests ensured appropriate management of potential side effects, including a decline in neutrophil count.
During and after antiviral therapy, liver function parameters showed consistent improvement until they eventually returned to normal by 12 months of age. Remarkably, the child did not demonstrate any visible neurological abnormalities throughout the treatment period and achieved developmental milestones within expected limits.
Follow-up evaluations included hearing and visual tests which indicated no impairments related to CMV infection or its treatment.
This case highlights the diagnostic uncertainties that can arise in complex clinical presentations such as neonatal jaundice with progressive liver dysfunction. It emphasizes the importance of comprehensive screening for various potential causes and considering less common etiologies when initial investigations prove inconclusive.
Moreover, effective communication among healthcare providers is crucial for sharing knowledge, discussing differential diagnoses, collaborating on treatment strategies, providing ongoing support to caregivers, and ensuring a multidisciplinary approach to optimize patient care outcomes.
By actively engaging in science communication as nurses experienced in clinical cases like this one, we lay essential groundwork for facilitating better understanding among patients' families while empowering them with accurate information about their child's condition and potential treatment options available.

This clinical case involves a patient with a history of HIV infection and renal insufficiency, who presented with symptoms suggesting heart and lung involvement. The patient had been on antiretroviral therapy for HIV and had stable kidney disease, but also had risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as smoking and a previous episode of proteinuria.
The initial findings upon admission included low oxygen levels in the blood (desaturation), dilated jugular veins, mild ankle edema, normal blood pressure and pulse rate. An ECG showed a normal heart rhythm but also detected right axis deviation and an incomplete right bundle-branch block. A chest X-ray revealed an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) with clear lung fields.
Laboratory results showed normal white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin level, and platelet count. However, certain values were elevated including creatinine (indicative of impaired kidney function) as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which can indicate liver or bone problems. On the other hand, liver enzymes ALT and AST were within normal ranges.
Arterial blood gas analysis indicated a slightly alkaline pH value along with normal levels of carbon dioxide (PC0 2 ) but reduced oxygen levels in the blood (PO 2 ). Glucose level was elevated above the reference range.
Two-dimensional echocardiography using both transthoracic and trans-oesophageal approaches revealed a large mobile mass located in the right atrium of the heart. This mass was attached to the lower part of the atrium extending into the inferior vena cava (IVC). There was no significant blockage of tricuspid valve flow by this mass, allowing free flow of blood between atrium and ventricle.
Further investigation through abdominal ultrasound confirmed extension of this mass into the IVC without any other notable abdominal findings.
Despite being on anticoagulant therapy for over two years, the mass did not decrease in size. Subsequently, the patient underwent surgery to remove the mass. The surgical findings revealed a creamy-colored mobile atrial mass that originated from the IVC and was easily detached from its junction with the superior vena cava (SVC). The histological analysis of the mass indicated dense fibrous tissue containing red blood cells and extensive calcification, consistent with a calcified thrombus (a blood clot).
Unfortunately, post-operatively, the patient experienced persistent low blood pressure and progressive right heart failure. Upon re-opening of her chest prior to her death, there was evidence of a dilated right atrium and hypokinetic (reduced movement) right ventricle without any fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac surrounding her heart.
Based on these findings, it is most likely that she died due to pulmonary embolism caused by fragments breaking off from the IVC thrombus and traveling to block arteries in her lungs.
This case study highlights several important points: 
Firstly, individuals living with HIV are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease complications. This can be due to both viral infection-related factors as well as lifestyle factors like smoking.
Secondly, chronic kidney disease can contribute to cardiac abnormalities such as cardiomegaly and heart valve dysfunction. Renal insufficiency may also lead to an increased risk of developing venous thrombosis.
Thirdly, this case underscores how anticoagulant therapy may not always prevent further growth or fragmentation of existing clots. Surgical intervention might be necessary in some cases for complete removal.
Lastly, pulmonary embolism is a life-threatening condition that occurs when blood clots dislodge from one part of the body (usually veins) and travel through circulation to block arteries supplying blood flow to lungs. It requires prompt diagnosis and treatment since it can result in significant morbidity or even mortality if left untreated.
In summary, this case demonstrates the complex interplay between HIV infection, renal disease, and cardiovascular complications. It also highlights the challenges in managing thrombotic events in patients with calcified thrombi and the potentially fatal consequences of pulmonary embolism. 
Title: Hemangioblastoma: A Case of Treatment and Recovery
Introduction:
This clinical case revolves around a patient presenting with a balance disorder, accompanied by the inability to walk or stand unaided. Further diagnostics revealed the presence of a cerebellar tumor, primarily composed of fleshy and cystic components. The initial surgical attempt was only partially successful due to the deep localization and potential risks. Subsequently, radiotherapy was recommended as an alternative treatment option. This article aims to shed light on the diagnosis, management, treatment approach, and post-therapy outcomes in a patient with hemangioblastoma.
Clinical Presentation:
At the neurological examination, the patient exhibited symptoms such as widened sustentation polygon (a measure of balance assessment), an inability to walk without assistance (heeling gait), and standing difficulties necessitating support. Notably, no sensory or motor deficits or cognitive impairments were observed during evaluation. Ophthalmological examination indicated that the patient maintained visual acuity at 8/10 with normal fundus findings.
Diagnostic Findings:
Laboratory evaluations including complete blood count, electrolytes, and basic metabolic profile did not reveal any abnormalities within standard reference ranges. Brain CT scan demonstrated a cerebellar tumor process consisting of both fleshy and cystic components measuring 70 mm in diameter. This mass exerted compression on the fourth ventricle leading to significant tri-ventricular hydrocephalus and signs of trans-ependymal resorption of cerebrospinal fluid.
Further investigation through cerebral MRI revealed a solido-cystic cerebellar tumor measuring 70*57*60 mm indicative of a pilocytic astrocytoma resulting in tonsillar involvement.
Surgical Intervention:
Although surgical removal was planned for optimal management, it could only be partially completed due to deep-seated localization within sensitive brain regions associated with potential hemorrhagic risks during operation.
Anatomopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis as hemangioblastoma, a highly vascular benign tumor originating from blood vessels.
Evaluation for Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome:
Considering the nature of the tumor, a whole-body CT scan was performed to evaluate any possible associated lesions related to Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Both pancreatic, renal, and adrenal processes were examined; however, no detectable abnormalities were found in alignment with negative findings from an earlier fundus examination. Thus, it was concluded that Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome was unlikely in this patient.
Radiotherapy Treatment:
Given the partial nature of surgical removal and persistent clinical symptoms, radiotherapy became an integral part of treatment. The patient received three-dimensional conformal external radiotherapy with a total dose of 50.4Gy delivered in 28 fractions over 5.6 weeks. Daily treatment involved a fraction dose of 1.8Gy delivered once per day across five sessions per week.
Radiation planning aimed to reduce radiation exposure to critical structures such as the brain stem, optic chiasm, optic nerves, retina, and pituitary gland while simultaneously delivering optimal radiation doses to effectively target the tumor site using 6-MV photons via conformal techniques guided by computed tomography imaging (3D conformal radiotherapy).
Treatment Outcome and Post-Radiotherapy Evaluation:
The administered radiotherapy demonstrated good tolerance by the patient throughout its course with no significant side effects except for mild grade I alopecia (hair loss). In parallel with weekly evaluations during treatment by medical professionals responsible for care continuity and monitoring side effects or complications associated with therapy administration,
Remarkably positive improvements were observed after one month post-radiotherapy completion despite partial surgical removal: balance improved significantly without occurrence of nausea or vomiting symptoms along with enhanced visual acuity â indicating a successful therapeutic response.
Three months after radiation therapy completion; cerebral MRI performed on the patient showed a decrease in the size of the cerebellar process, indicating tumor shrinkage and response to treatment.
Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights the challenges faced in managing deep-seated cerebellar tumors. Despite a suboptimal surgical outcome, complementary treatment through three-dimensional conformal external radiotherapy proved effective and well-tolerated by the patient. The positive response was demonstrated by outcomes such as improved balance, visual acuity, and reduction in tumor size as seen on follow-up imaging.
Successful multidisciplinary collaboration between neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, radiologists, ophthalmologists, and other healthcare professionals played an essential role in both diagnosing and treating this complex case. Continual monitoring of post-therapy progress remains crucial to allow early detection of any possible recurrence or further intervention requirements. 
Clinical Case 1:
The clinical case involves a patient who presented with persistent fever even after receiving treatment for malaria. The initial treatment included parenteral antimalarial medication (artesunate) along with oral relay therapy (artemisinin combination therapy) for three days. Additionally, the patient was given an antipyretic to lower the body temperature. However, after 48 hours, the fever persisted and blood cultures were done to identify any potential septicemia. Ceftriaxone, a broad-spectrum antibiotic used in treating bacterial infections, was prescribed for 72 hours but failed to resolve the fever. Second-line antibiotic therapy with imipenem and amikacin was then given for another 72 hours, yet the fever persisted.
After six days of continuous monitoring and unsuccessful attempts at identifying an infectious site, other potential causes of persistent fever were investigated in children including inflammatory diseases and hematological malignancies. Biologic workups showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), transaminases (glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase - GOT and glutamic pyruvic transaminase - GPT), ferritin levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and triglycerides.
Further testing including rheumatoid factor screening, antinuclear factor assessment, anti cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody testing, blood smear analysis for malignant cells or parasites, as well as viral serology showed no significant abnormalities. Based on this comprehensive evaluation of clinical presentation and laboratory findings a diagnosis of Still's disease â also known as systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis â was made.
Treatment involved administering corticosteroids over a month in progressively decreasing doses combined with methotrexate starting from the second week. Twelve hours after initiating corticosteroid therapy there was complete regression of fevers along with considerable improvement in the patient's overall clinical state.
Clinical Case 2:
This clinical case involves a 10-year-old boy who was admitted to the hospital due to persistent fever and asthenia (weakness) that had lasted for ten days. The patient reported experiencing odynophagia (painful swallowing) two days before the onset of fever. The physical examination revealed an altered general state with a high temperature but no signs of meningeal irritation or clinically evident portal of entry for infection. However, there was class II splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen), along with small swollen lymph nodes located in the inguinal region and upper right cervical chain.
The patient had previously received appropriate outpatient treatment for malaria as well as empiric antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid followed by ceftriaxone at the correct dosage. Despite these treatments, he continued to have a persistent fever. Laboratory investigations showed severe inflammation with elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as sedimentation rate, CRP, leukocytosis along with neutrophil polynucleosis, elevated ferritin levels and increased triglycerides.
Three sets of blood cultures were sterile, indicating no bacterial infection was present. The fluid obtained from arthrocentesis (joint aspiration) revealed inflammation without any infectious agents being identified. Viral serologies including those for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV were negative. Further tests such as liver and kidney function assessment came back normal while calcium phosphate levels remained within normal range; however, LDH levels were slightly elevated.
Imaging studies including chest X-ray showed no signs of lung infection or consolidation while an ultrasound examination revealed intra-articular effusion in the right hip joint but did not find any underlying cause for concern in other body regions like lymphadenopathy in abdominal ultrasound examination.
Based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings consistent with systemic inflammation but non-specific evidence from imaging studies or culture results, a diagnosis of Still's disease was made.
The patient was promptly started on corticosteroid therapy at a dose of 1mg/kg and within 24 hours there was resolution of the fever. In addition to corticosteroids, bed rest was recommended during relapses along with a diet low in salt, sugar, and fat. Methotrexate at a low dose (10 mg/m2 of body surface area) was gradually introduced. With this treatment regimen, the patient showed favorable progress.
In conclusion, both clinical cases highlight the challenges faced in diagnosing patients with persistent fever without obvious infectious etiology. Through comprehensive evaluation including biological workups and screening for other potential underlying causes such as inflammatory diseases or hematological malignancies, an accurate diagnosis can be made leading to appropriate treatment interventions. 
This clinical case involves a patient who underwent a soft tissue reconstruction surgery of the right upper limb with tendon transfer. The aim of the surgery was to improve the patient's strength and alleviate their symptoms. Specifically, the tendons of flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus were harvested and attached to tendons of extensor digitorum communis and extensor pollicis longus respectively.
Following the surgery, the patient's right forearm was placed in a plaster cast for a period of 3 weeks. Once the plaster cast was removed, the patient visited the physical therapy department for rehabilitation. However, they experienced pain over their wrist joint and difficulty in holding objects between their thumb and fingers on their right hand.
The pain reported by the patient was described as a dull ache, along with tingling sensations over their distal forearm. They also experienced numbness and paraesthesia in their palm, with a numerical pain rating scale indicating moderate pain (6/10). A scar was noticed on both dorsal (back) and volar (palm-side) aspects of the distal forearm.
Table 1 represents range-of-motion measurements taken during physical examinations. The examination also included testing muscle strength in various areas such as elbow flexors/extensors, wrist flexors/extensors, thumb flexors/extensors using medical research council grading system (1/5 indicating severe impairment to 5/5 representing normal strength). Overall muscle strength appeared to be lower than optimal.
Despite these challenges faced by the patient during rehab sessions initially, superficial and deep sensations were intact throughout his upper limb.
Rehabilitation spanned four weeks with each week focusing on different interventions. During week one, treatment included electrical stimulation using faradism under pressure for visible contractions while performing passive movements involving wrist joint mobility exercises performed for ten repetitions each session along with scar immobilization incorporating stretching techniques lasting two hours per session daily.
In week two, ultrasound with a 3 MHZ frequency was used for seven minutes followed by hot fomentation to optimize the range of motion in the wrist joint. Wrist and finger extensors were stimulated using intermediate galvanic current during passive movements to enhance muscle re-education.
The therapy protocol for week three introduced resistance training exercises targeting wrist flexors/extensors, forearm supinators/pronators involving resistance devices. These exercises required a 3-second hold and 15 repetitions per session. Additionally, various objects were utilized to help improve grip function.
On the first day of week four, electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) parameters shifted to faradic current for re-education purposes. Strengthening exercises continued with progressive increments in intensity and duration based on clinical improvements observed throughout recent sessions.
At the end of the rehabilitation period (day 28), significant improvements were noted across several measures: pain intensity decreased (NPRS score reduced from 6/10 initially to 2/10), muscle strength improved (graded as 3+/5), range of motion results became more favorable compared to baseline measurements outlined in Table 1. The patient-specific functional scale score also rose from initial baseline value of 2/10 to a final score of 7/10 indicating improved functional outcome after rehabilitation intervention.
Furthermore, evaluation through strength-duration curve testing indicated restored innervation status post-rehabilitation.
In conclusion, this clinical case demonstrates a patient's journey through soft tissue reconstruction surgery followed by a comprehensive rehabilitation program that incorporated various modalities ranging from electrical stimulation techniques like faradism under pressure and EMS, along with specific therapeutic exercises targeted towards improving strength and functionality within their right upper limb. The individual experienced significant improvements across multiple areas following structured physical therapy interventions over four weeks post-surgery. 
This clinical case involves a patient who presented with several symptoms and findings that ultimately led to a diagnosis of Pott's disease, also known as tuberculous spondylitis. Pott's disease is a form of tuberculosis that affects the spine, resulting in inflammation and destruction of the vertebrae.
The initial presentation of the patient included an epithelioid granulomatous inflammatory process seen on pleural biopsy. However, tests for mycobacteria infection using Ziehl-Neelsen stain and culture were negative. Despite not having respiratory symptoms, the patient had significant spinal tenderness and limited range of motion in the dorso-lumbar spine.
Further evaluation revealed anemia (hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dl) and mild leukocytosis with predominance of polymorphonuclear cells (72%). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated at 80 mm and C-reactive protein (CRP) was also increased at 27 mg/l, indicating ongoing inflammation.
Imaging studies such as lumbar x-ray showed osteocondensation in L1-L2 vertebrae, while chest x-ray revealed a small pleural effusion on the left side. A dorso-lumbar MRI demonstrated features suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis involving L1-L2 vertebrae along with epiduritis. Additionally, there was evidence of abscess formation in the left psoas muscle which communicated with collections within the vertebral bodies.
In order to alleviate symptoms and drain the psoas abscess, CT-guided evacuation was performed, revealing purulent material that did not grow in cultures or stain positive for bacteria using Gram or Ziehl-Neelsen methods.
Given a high prevalence rate of tuberculosis in this patient population along with previous history of pleural tuberculosis and characteristic MRI findings, a diagnosis of Pott's disease was made. Treatment was initiated and prolonged to 9 months, along with the use of a spinal brace for stabilization of the vertebral column.
Despite adherence to treatment, the patient's low back pain worsened after 6 months. Subsequently, purulent collections were identified in gluteal and left trochanteric regions. Imaging studies confirmed spondylodiscitis in L1-L2 vertebrae and an enlargement of the left psoas abscess. GeneXpertÂ® MTB/RIF testing detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis with resistance to Rifampicin, while HainÂ® test revealed high-level resistance to Isoniazid and Ofloxacin but sensitivity to Kanamycin and Amikacin.
Due to these drug resistances, the patient was transferred to a multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis unit for further management. Drainage of superficial collections in gluteal and trochanteric areas was performed under ultrasound guidance.
The patient then initiated second-line anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) consisting of amikacin, clofazimine, prothionamide, linezolid, delamanide, pyrazinamide, et ethambutol based on susceptibility testing results. Over time, inflammatory lumbar pain improved significantly while weight gain occurred along with resolution of soft tissue collections.
After 20 months of second-line ATT therapy without adverse events other than limb paresthesias managed with vitamin therapy, imaging follow-up demonstrated no residual collections in thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scans. The MRI showed a vertebral fracture at L1-L2 and only a small collection measuring less than 1 cm without enhancement after gadolinium injection.
This comprehensive treatment resulted in stabilization of vertebral lesions without any new collections formation or worsening symptoms.The patient completed therapy and was declared cured; subsequently participating in a rehabilitation program involving stretching and strengthening exercises for the spinal muscles.
In summary, this case highlights the challenges faced in diagnosing and treating Pott's disease, a form of tuberculosis that affects the spine. Despite drug resistance and complications such as abscess formation, aggressive treatment with second-line ATT led to successful recovery and favorable outcomes for the patient. 
This clinical case involves a patient who presented with an obstructed left ureteric calculus at the vesicoureteric junction (VUJ). The patient's blood workup revealed elevated creatinine and potassium levels, indicating obstructive uropathy with acute kidney injury. As a result, the patient underwent emergency cystoscopy, left ureteroscopy, stone fragmentation, and Double J (DJ) ureteric stent insertion.
During the procedure, it was discovered that the patient had significant distal left ureteric narrowing at the VUJ with a calculus proximal to the narrowing. The stone was fragmented successfully and a DJ stent was placed to promote urinary drainage. Additionally, a Foley catheter was inserted to assist in urine flow.
In post-operative recovery, however, the patient experienced desaturation with oxygen saturation dropping to 80-85% on room air. To maintain adequate oxygenation, he required 8 L/min of oxygen supplementation through a face mask. Due to this complication and other concerns related to his condition after surgery, he was transferred to a ward for further monitoring and management.
Around 12 hours after being transferred to the ward, his vital signs showed tachycardia at 130 beats per minute along with low blood pressure readings ranging from 80/50 mmHg to 90/60 mmHg. On examination, he appeared alert but had cool and clammy extremities. Bilateral basal crepitations were observed during respiratory examination.
Further investigations revealed an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) with ST-segment depressions and T wave inversion in anterior and inferior leads compared to his preoperative ECG. Moreover, troponin-T levels were significantly elevated at 174.1 pg/ml (normal range: 0-14 pg/ml), suggesting myocardial damage or injury.
Additional laboratory parameters indicated abnormalities as well: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 494 IU/L (normal range: 135-225 IU/L), pro-BNP at 375 pg/ml (normal range: 0-125 pg/ml), procalcitonin at 1.67 ng/ml (normal range: 0-2 ng/ml), C-reactive protein (CRP) at 312 mg/L (normal range: 0.5-5 mg/L), INR of 1.15, ferritin levels elevated to 1531 Âµg/l (normal range:22-322 Âµg/l), and D-dimer levels slightly elevated to 0.63 Âµg/ml (normal range:0-0.5 Âµg/ml).
A portable chest x-ray exhibited bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates with some coalescence observed in the periphery of the lungs, a pattern consistent with CO-RADS classification level 5, highly suggestive of COVID-19 infection. This diagnosis was later confirmed by a nasopharyngeal swab using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Due to his deteriorating condition and the presence of myocardial injury, the patient was transferred to an isolation intensive care unit where he began receiving anticoagulant therapy as part of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) protocol. The treatment included subcutaneous enoxaparin, clopidogrel, aspirin, and atorvastatin.
Unfortunately, within hours of transfer to critical care, the patient's clinical status worsened rapidly leading to intravenous inotropic support being initiated. Subsequently, he required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.
Despite medical efforts and attempts made according to American Cardiac Life Support guidelines during cardiopulmonary resuscitation following a cardiac arrest episode, resuscitation measures were unsuccessful after approximately 30 minutes. The patient was ultimately pronounced dead.
In summary, this clinical case involves a patient presenting with an obstructive left ureteric calculus, which required urgent intervention. However, post-surgery complications arose including desaturation, tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Further investigations revealed evidence of acute kidney injury, COVID-19 infection with pulmonary involvement (CO-RADS 5), and myocardial damage as evidenced by elevated troponin levels and abnormalities in the ECG. Despite intensive care management and resuscitation efforts following a cardiac arrest event, the patient unfortunately did not survive. 
Case Presentation: Mandibular Angle Fracture
In this clinical case, we have a 21-year-old male who suffered an isolated mandibular angle fracture following a road traffic accident. The patient expressed a desire for an early return to work, and upon further investigation using a CT scan, a torsional deformation was observed on the fracture fragments. As a result, the decision was made to perform an open reduction.
The surgical procedure for this patient took place under general anesthesia. Induction was accomplished using thiopentone sodium, and nasotracheal intubation was performed to secure the airway. To achieve maxillo-mandibular fixation and proper occlusion during surgery, the oral cavity had to be kept free from obstruction.
Maintenance of anesthesia during the procedure involved the use of isoflurane and/or sevoflurane gases. Prior to commencing the surgery, the surgical site and incision line were marked with marking ink for reference. Local anesthesia containing lidocaine with adrenaline in 1:1000 concentrations was then infiltrated along these marked lines.
The incision itself is crucial in this approach as aesthetic considerations are given prime importance when designing this surgical access point. Care must be taken to ensure that the incision follows accurately along the curvature of the angle of the mandible. Additionally, it is important that suture lines are visualized beforehand so that they can be completely hidden within shadows caused by anatomical landmarks.
In terms of technique, it appears that a combination of postramal Hind's incision and submandibular Risdon's incision was used for this case. However, due to its proximity to the angle of the mandible (around 1 cm away), it can be considered distinct from either standard approach or perhaps as their modification specific for close proximity fractures at mandible angle.
To achieve clean and precise results when making incisions, a sharp blade with a number 15 edge is imperative to avoid any jaggedness along the incision line. The initial stroke should only expose the skin and subcutaneous tissue, with tight control achieved using skin hooks that hold the surrounding tissue away. This technique provides a clear view of the underlying subcutaneous structures.
Dissecting through the platysma muscle is typically straightforward and can be accomplished using scissors or a scalpel blade. During this step, it is important to be cautious not to disturb the superficial layer of deep cervical fascia which lies beneath. Attention then turns toward dissecting through this deep fascia, which can prove challenging due to its proximity to vital structures such as facial nerves and blood vessels.
Upon incising the deep fascia, locating and identifying the facial nerve becomes crucial. Techniques such as nerve stimulation may aid in properly identifying and retracting this delicate nerve within the upper flap of tissue for protection during further steps of surgery. Additionally, care must be taken when locating and handling facial artery and vein if necessary.
Once these nerves have been addressed appropriately in terms of protection or ligation if necessary, attention shifts towards exposing the pterygo-masseteric sling beneath them. Once identified, a precise incision on this sling allows for optimal visualization at mandibular angle level â this particular plane is relatively avascular with minimal bleeding associated.
With clear exposure achieved at the mandibular angle, fracture fragments can be easily manipulated back into proper alignment for reduction purposes. The next step involves placing miniplates followed by successful fixation techniques based on surgical expertise regarding anatomical considerations.
Throughout surgery irrigation ensures clean working field continuously keeping visibility maintained followed by closure achieved in layers emphasizing delineation between different anatomical spaces encountered during access phase including reapproximation of subcutaneous tissues that reflects very well planned surgical approach resulting into excellent post-operative scar leaving no suture tracks seen within conversational distance. 
This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a variety of symptoms and findings, leading to a diagnosis of disseminated infection and multiple complications. The patient had a history of hypertension and took daily medications for this condition. He also had a history of working on cruise ships as a welder.
Initially, the patient was found to be dyspneic (having difficulty breathing), desaturating (decreased oxygen levels) on room air, febrile (having a fever), and tachycardic (elevated heart rate). On examination, he showed signs of jaundice with pale skin, bilateral lower limb edema (swelling), and an erythematous patch on his right leg that was warm and tender to touch. Fine crepitations were heard in his lungs upon auscultation. Abdominal examination revealed distension with tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
Initial blood work showed several abnormalities including elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia indicating infection, anemia with low hemoglobin levels suggesting possible bleeding or destruction of red blood cells, elevated CRP indicating inflammation, increased PCT indicating severe bacterial infection or sepsis, elevated D-dimer suggesting evidence of clot formation or thrombosis. The patient also had elevated direct bilirubin levels suggesting liver dysfunction.
Radiological investigations revealed parenchymal infiltrates suggestive of infections in his lungs along with metastatic abscesses in various locations including the liver, lower limb muscle and skin tissues as well as bone marrow involvement suggestive of osteomyelitis. CT scan showed non-enhancing cystic liver lesions while Doppler ultrasound indicated both superficial and deep vein thromboses.
Further investigations ruled out HIV infection as well as other commonly tested infections such as amoebiasis. Chest CT angiography ruled out pulmonary embolism but did not find any abnormality in brain imaging except mild cortical atrophy.
Due to the severity of his condition, the patient was admitted to intensive care and placed on high-flow oxygen. He received broad-spectrum antibiotics initially with Imipenem and Cilastatin along with Metronidazole. Antifungal therapy was also started empirically but discontinued due to an allergic reaction.
During his hospital stay, the patient reported loss of vision in his left eye, which upon examination was found to be suggestive of endogenous endophthalmitis (inflammation within the eye). His vision loss may have been due to the disseminated infection reaching his eyes.
Additionally, he experienced worsening breathlessness which was attributed to a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) based on elevated cardiac markers. However, coronary angiography showed normal arteries and only 2D echocardiography revealed septal hypertrophy without any regional wall motion abnormalities.
Blood cultures eventually grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacteria commonly associated with severe infections and antibiotic resistance. The strain isolated from this patient responded well to Ceftriaxone treatment.
To manage the complications arising from this disseminated infection, intravitreal Vancomycin was given for endophthalmitis along with oral ciprofloxacin. Gradually, the patient improved as evidenced by resolution of fever and difficulty breathing along with significant improvement in infectious markers.
After 25 days in the hospital, he was discharged home with a recommendation for continued intravenous ceftriaxone treatment for another four weeks or until radiological resolution of abscesses is determined.
In summary, this clinical case highlights a complex presentation involving multiple organs affected by disseminated infection likely caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The patient experienced various complications including lung infiltrates, liver abscesses, deep vein thrombosis as well as involvement of skin tissues and bone marrow. Prompt identification and appropriate management played crucial roles in his eventual improvement. 
In these clinical cases, we see the potential impact of self-medication and delayed diagnosis on the transmission and spread of diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, and Ebola virus disease. Each case highlights different aspects of the challenges faced in diagnosing and managing these illnesses in a resource-limited setting.
In the first case, we have an 18-year-old woman who initially presented with symptoms consistent with uncomplicated malaria. However, instead of seeking medical care at a healthcare facility, she chose to self-medicate with antimalarial drugs along with antibiotics and analgesics. This decision resulted in her symptoms disappearing after three days without proper evaluation or admission into an Ebola treatment center (ETC). It is important to note that self-medication can be dangerous as it may lead to incorrect or incomplete treatment which can further complicate the patient's condition.
The second case involves a 7-month-old infant who exhibited symptoms of fever and diarrhea. The initial diagnosis was malaria and acute gastroenteritis. Unfortunately, his condition worsened over time, manifesting as hematemesis (vomiting blood). The baby was then transferred to a designated Ebola treatment center where he tested positive for Ebola virus by RT-PCR but sadly died on the same day. This tragic case reveals how unrecognized early signs could be indicative of more serious conditions like Ebola virus disease.
Furthermore, both parents were found to have antibodies against Ebola using serological tests despite testing negative through RT-PCR at that point in time indicating that they had been exposed to the virus but were not actively infected at that specific moment. It is crucial for individuals who have been exposed or experienced symptoms related to infectious diseases like Ebola to undergo proper testing even if their initial tests come back negative.
The third case illustrates fear-driven behavior during an epidemic outbreak leading individuals to hide from contact tracing teams out of fear rather than seeking appropriate medical attention promptly. Both AB and ZM experienced symptoms consistent with Ebola virus disease, including fever, headache, joint pain, and physical asthenia. AB initially sought outpatient care from a cardiology department where he was given antimalarial treatment along with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. It was only when his symptoms persisted that he visited a traditional healer before eventually being located by the contact tracing team. On the other hand, ZM promptly sought admission to an ETC after presenting with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Both individuals tested positive for Ebola virus by RT-PCR.
In these cases, it is noteworthy that despite the potential for transmission to close contacts due to shared living spaces and promiscuity within households or communities such as in the third case mentioned above; no further spread occurred within any of these contact networks. This may suggest that timely identification of cases through contact tracing efforts can effectively mitigate further disease transmission.
It is essential to emphasize the importance of seeking proper medical care instead of self-medication during outbreaks or when experiencing symptoms related to infectious diseases like malaria or Ebola virus disease. Early diagnosis enables appropriate management strategies which are essential not only for individual patient outcomes but also for overall public health efforts aimed at controlling and preventing further spread of diseases within communities.
In conclusion, these clinical cases serve as reminders of the critical role healthcare facilities play in identifying and managing infections like malaria, typhoid fever, and Ebola virus disease effectively. They also highlight how delays in diagnosis or reluctance to seek medical care can contribute to increased transmission risks within families and communities during epidemic situations.

In this clinical case, we are presented with four individuals who have been diagnosed with 11Î²-hydroxylase deficiency (11Î²-OHD), a rare genetic disorder that affects the adrenal glands and leads to various symptoms and complications.
Patient 1 is a 36-year-old male who was diagnosed with homozygous p.Gly379Val mutation in the CYP11B1 gene. At the age of 25, he developed grade 3 hypertension along with hypokalemia (low potassium levels). He was prescribed Calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and Beta-blocker (atenolol) to manage his hypertension. Despite poor compliance with treatment, he did not experience acute adrenal deficiency during his follow-up. However, he had occasional episodes of abdominal pain which were relieved after correcting his hypokalemia. Later on, at the age of 36, spironolactone was added to manage persistent hypokalemia. Over time, patient 1 experienced progressive weight gain and developed metabolic syndrome characterized by android fat distribution (increased waist circumference) and low HDL levels.
Patient 2 is a 35-year-old female who was diagnosed with 11Î²-OHD at birth due to virilization of external genitalia. She underwent corrective surgery for her genital abnormalities but had normal blood pressure throughout her regular check-ups. However, she did experience hypokalemia and was initially treated with hydrocortisone medication without any acute adrenal deficiencies observed during her follow-up period. Patient 2 also developed metabolic syndrome along with class I obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) since the age of 28. The diagnosis of PCOS was made based on symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), alopecia (hair loss), and elevated testosterone levels.
Patient 3 is a female aged 33, diagnosed with 11Î²-OHD prenatally. Her mother had received treatment with dexamethasone during pregnancy to manage the condition. Patient 3 also had virilization of the external genitalia and underwent corrective surgery at birth. She had an irregular follow-up and was initially treated with hydrocortisone medication without experiencing acute adrenal deficiency. However, she developed PCOS with hirsutism and irregular menstrual cycles and was treated with estrogen therapy (estradiol) along with cyproterone acetate to manage her symptoms.
Patient 4 is a male who was diagnosed with 11Î²-OHD at the age of 2 due to peripheral precocious puberty. Unfortunately, patient 4 did not have a genetic analysis performed and passed away at the age of 12 due to a postoperative infection following orthopedic surgery for scoliosis.
In addition to these patients, there are two remaining family members: patient 5, a sister aged 28 who is married and has two healthy children, and patient 6, another sister aged 21 who is currently undergoing treatment for depression in psychiatry.
Overall, this clinical case highlights the diverse range of symptoms and complications associated with 11Î²-hydroxylase deficiency (11Î²-OHD). Patients may present with hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic syndrome features such as obesity and PCOS in females, as well as genital abnormalities. It emphasizes the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis in order to provide appropriate management strategies tailored to each individual's needs. Patient 1's case demonstrates the impact of the p.Gly379Val mutation in the CYP11B1 gene. This mutation affects the enzyme responsible for converting 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol and leads to an accumulation of steroid precursors, such as 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and corticosterone. The excessive accumulation of these precursors contributes to hypertension and electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia.
The development of grade 3 hypertension in patient 1 may be a result of increased levels of DOC, which has mineralocorticoid activity. The elevated DOC can lead to sodium retention and potassium loss, resulting in fluid overload and high blood pressure. To manage this hypertension-related complication, patient 1 was prescribed a combination therapy including calcium channel blockers (amlodipine) and beta-blockers (atenolol). These medications help lower blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels or reducing cardiac output.
Despite poor compliance with treatment, patient 1 did not experience acute adrenal deficiency during his follow-up period. Acute adrenal deficiency refers to a sudden drop or absence of cortisol production by the adrenal glands. It is essential for patients with adrenal insufficiency to adhere to their hydrocortisone medication regimen because inadequate cortisol levels can lead to life-threatening situations during periods of stress or illness.
Patient 2's case shares similarities with patient 1 as both have been diagnosed with homozygous forms of p.Gly379Val mutation in the CYP11B1 gene; however, their clinical presentations differ significantly. While patient 2 displayed normal blood pressure throughout her regular check-ups, she experienced hypokalemia similar to her male sibling. Patient 2 also developed metabolic syndrome characterized by obesity (class I) along with PCOS symptoms such as spaniomenorrhea (irregular menstrual cycles), hirsutism, alopecia, and hyperandrogenism. This suggests that the p.Gly379Val mutation can result in varied clinical manifestations, likely due to additional genetic or environmental factors.
The presence of PCOS in patient 2 could be influenced by hormonal imbalances caused by increased production of adrenal androgen precursors due to the deficiency in the enzymatic activity of CYP11B1. The excess androgen production leads to symptoms associated with PCOS, such as irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism, which contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome features like obesity.
Patient 3's case demonstrates a prenatal diagnosis of 11Î²-OHD due to maternal administration of dexamethasone during pregnancy. Maternal treatment with glucocorticoids is currently recommended for pregnant women carrying female fetuses affected by classic forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), including 11Î²-OHD. The early intervention aims to minimize virilization effects on external genitalia development. However, this patient still presented with genital abnormalities requiring corrective surgery at birth.
Patient 3 has significant irregularities in her follow-up care but was treated initially with hydrocortisone medication without experiencing acute adrenal deficiency. In addition to the symptoms related to hormonal imbalances seen in patient 2 (PCOS features), she also struggles with depression for which she is seeking psychiatric treatment.
The tragic case of patient 4 highlights the impact of this condition if left untreated or not managed adequately. Patient 4 developed peripheral precocious puberty as a result of CYP11B1 enzyme deficiency generating excessive levels of sex hormones at an early age. Unfortunately, this individual did not undergo genetic analysis, potentially missing an opportunity for earlier interventions or tailored management strategies that could have positively impacted their quality and length of life.
It is crucial for remaining family members, namely patients 5 and 6, to undergo genetic analysis since they share a familial link with patients diagnosed with homozygous p.Gly379Val mutation. Genetic analysis would help identify whether they also carry this mutation and allow for appropriate management recommendations to prevent or address potential complications associated with 11Î²-OHD.
In summary, this clinical case highlights the variable presentations and complications of 11Î²-hydroxylase deficiency (11Î²-OHD) resulting from mutations in the CYP11B1 gene. It underscores the importance of genetic analysis for accurate diagnosis and personalized care plans tailored to each individual affected by this condition. Early interventions targeting hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic syndrome features like obesity and PCOS symptoms, as well as close monitoring for adrenal insufficiency or other potential complications, can significantly improve patient outcomes and their overall quality of life. 
In this clinical case, we are presented with two patients, both siblings, who have similar dental and nail abnormalities.
The first patient is a young girl whose nails were small and discolored at birth but improved with age. She also has missing permanent teeth with retained deciduous teeth and severe attrition. Generalized pit and fissure caries were found on all the posterior teeth, as well as deep caries on the left maxillary anterior teeth. Maxillary palatine tori (bony growths in the roof of the mouth) were noticed, along with poor gingival and periodontal condition. The oral mucosa appeared normal.
Upon investigation through a panoramic radiograph, it was confirmed that there was periapical infection in the right maxillary anterior teeth and generalized absence of permanent tooth bud in both the maxillary and mandibular arches.
The second patient is a 14-year-old girl who is also a sibling of the first patient. She has similar nail abnormalities to her elder sister, including spoon-shaped slow-growing small fragile fingernails with onychorrhexis (brittle nails) and deformed toenails. Like her sister, she also has missing permanent teeth with retained deciduous teeth. Generalized pit and fissure caries was observed on posterior teeth along with deep caries on right mandibular posterior teeth. Poor periodontal condition characterized by generalized stains and calculus was noted as well. The oral mucosa appeared normal.
A panoramic radiograph was obtained for this patient as well, which showed generalized absence of permanent tooth bud in both maxillary and mandibular arches.
Based on family history, clinical manifestations, radiological findings, a provisional diagnosis of partial anodontia (absence or lack of development of some permanent teeth) was given considering mesoectodermal dysplasia (a genetic disorder affecting tissues derived from embryonic mesoderm and ectoderm), ectodermal dysplasia (a group of genetic disorders affecting the hair, nails, teeth, sweat glands, and skin), and tooth and nail syndrome (a condition characterized by nail dysplasia with hypodontia or missing teeth) as differential diagnoses.
Genetic investigation was conducted on both patients to further understand the underlying cause. DNA extraction was performed using blood samples collected from the patients. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes using a standard kit. Sanger sequencing was then performed to validate the identified mutation in the MSX1 gene.
MSX1 is a vital gene involved in tooth development. The DNA sequences were analyzed and compared with a reference using alignment software, while chromatograms were viewed and analyzed for mutations. A point mutation on exon 1 of MSX1 (1A;c.731G > A) was observed in both patients.
The result of this study suggests that MSX1 gene variants are contributing to familial hypodontia in these two siblings. However, it is important to note that while MSX1 mutation may play a role, there could be other genes and mutations that are more predominant factors contributing to hypodontia in these patients. Further analysis through whole exome or whole genome sequencing of patient samples could help identify additional genetic factors involved.
In conclusion, this clinical case presents two siblings with similar dental abnormalities including missing permanent teeth along with nail abnormalities such as small size and discoloration at birth. Genetic investigation revealed a mutation in the MSX1 gene which is associated with tooth development but may not be solely responsible for the phenotype observed in these patients.
 
This clinical case involves a child who was previously diagnosed with a genetic and hematologic condition. The child attends a special school for the blind and has been very successful, showing independence in everyday living and having normal intellectual capabilities. In February 2012, the child presented to the hospital with an intertrochanteric fracture of her left femur following a trauma.
Upon admission, the child's general status was impaired and she was unable to ambulate, requiring the use of a wheelchair. She had a plaster splint on her left lower limb and exhibited tachycardia (heart rate up to 140 beats per minute) with blood pressure at 100/65 mmHg. Physical examination revealed an enlarged liver palpated below the ribs and an enlarged spleen at umbilical level, both of which had abnormal consistency.
No signs of increased pressure within the skull or irritation of nerves stemming from the meninges were detected. However, attempts at passive movement in the left hip joint elicited extreme pain for the patient. X-rays confirmed an intertrochanteric fracture with slight deformity and indicated features consistent with her underlying genetic condition - diffuse sclerosis without differentiation between cortical (outer) and spongy bone affecting various bones throughout her body.
Hematologic investigations conducted prior to surgery revealed severe anemia (low hemoglobin levels), decreased platelet count, low fibrinogen levels (a clotting protein), but no other abnormalities related to blood disorders were present.
To prepare for surgery, replacement therapy was administered including erythrocyte concentrate (red blood cells), plasma, and platelet concentrate under sterile reanimation conditions. On February 20th, 2012, surgical treatment commenced with suitable hemoglobin levels restored through transfusion therapy.
The surgical technique employed involved open reduction (realignment) of the femoral fracture followed by fixation using a stable metal osteosynthesis procedure utilizing plates designed specifically for pediatric patients. Due to the hardness of the patient's bones, the surgical team encountered difficulties during plate application, necessitating the use of a specialized drill with low speed and high torque and frequently changing original steel drill bits.
The operation lasted 2 hours and 25 minutes with minimal blood loss. However, additional fissures in the femoral neck were discovered on postoperative X-rays due to complications arising from drilling holes for screw placement. Despite these fissures, there was no compromise in stability or subsequent bone healing.
In the early postoperative period, standard antibiotic prophylaxis was administered to prevent infection. Physical therapy commenced on the first day after surgery with active movement exercises. Over time, guided walking using a stable walker was introduced as part of a customized physiotherapy program adapted specifically for blind patients.
Treatment also included ongoing hematologic substitution therapy provided by a pediatric hematologist to manage any associated aplastic anemia (a decrease in red blood cell production). After three months post-surgery, education in crutch walking began through further sessions of physiotherapy.
By six months post-surgery (March 2013), X-rays displayed consolidation of the fracture along with normal alignment between the femoral neck and shaft. The child experienced minimal leg length discrepancy (<0.5 cm) and had improved range of motion in her operated hip joint - 90Â° active flexion, 5Â° extension, and 30Â° abduction without pain.
With substantial progress on her gait improvement journey, she returned to her specialized school for blind students at appropriate grade level after completion of one year follow-up from surgery. 
Title: Lip Repositioning Procedure for Gummy Smile Correction: A Safe and Effective Esthetic Solution
Introduction:
Orthognathic surgery and lip repositioning procedure (LRP) are two treatment options available to patients with a gummy smile or vertical maxillary excess (VME). This clinical case presents a patient who opted for LRP to address their gummy smile, aiming to avoid the higher morbidity and costs associated with orthognathic surgery. This article explores the technique of lip repositioning, its benefits, risks, post-operative care, and long-term outcomes.
Lip Repositioning Procedure:
During the lip repositioning procedure, local anesthesia is administered to the vestibular mucosa and lip using Mepivacaine 2% with adrenaline 1:80,000. The incision outline is marked on the dried tissue using mucogingival junction as a reference line. Incisions are made in the surgical area from maxillary right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar. Partial thickness flaps are raised superiorly and inferiorly in this surgical area. An epithelial band of approximately 10-12 mm is excised leaving underlying connective tissue exposed. Care is taken not to damage any minor salivary glands in the submucosa.
Post-operative Care:
Following surgery, immediate improvement in facial appearance and smile aesthetics is observed. Post-operative instructions given include maintaining a soft diet, limiting facial movements, avoiding brushing around the surgical site for 14 days, placing ice packs over the upper lip as needed for swelling management, rinsing gently with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate twice daily for two weeks along with prescribed antibiotics (Amoxicillin) and analgesics (Ibuprofen).
Outcome Evaluation:
The patient's healing process occurs smoothly without significant post-operative complications such as bruising or extraoral swelling. The suture line heals as a concealed scar in the upper lip mucosa, remaining invisible when smiling. The patient reports minimal post-operative pain during smiling that lasts for approximately one week. Two weeks after the procedure, sutures are removed.
Long-term Follow-up:
To assess the effectiveness and sustainability of the lip repositioning procedure, follow-up appointments with the patient are scheduled every three months. Gingival display measurements are taken at each visit. At baseline, the patient's gingival display was measured at 7-8 mm, significantly reducing to 3 mm at both three and six months postoperatively. There is no significant difference observed between these two time points regarding changes in gingival display. However, a partial relapse is noticed after 12 months.
Discussion:
The lip repositioning procedure has proved to be a safe and effective surgical technique for correcting gummy smiles caused by excessive gingival display. It limits SMAS (elevator smile muscles) retraction by excising an epithelial band while maintaining esthetic outcomes for patients.
Benefits of LRP include lower morbidity compared to orthognathic surgery and reduced cost-effectiveness due to lesser surgical complexity and duration. Furthermore, LRP allows patients to avoid substantial jaw movement or bony adjustments.
However, it should be noted that like any other surgical intervention or esthetic procedure, there are potential limitations associated with LRP as well:
1. Partial relapse: The case study reports partial relapse observed after one year following surgery.
2. Individual variation: Patient anatomy and muscle function may influence treatment outcomes.
3. Careful case selection: A thorough assessment of individual expectations is necessary before offering LRP as an alternative treatment option.
4.Safety Profile: While this method minimizes side-effects such as extraoral swelling or bruising, all patients should be aware of potential complications related to anesthesia or wound healing.
Conclusion:
The lip repositioning procedure offers patients an alternative surgical solution to correct gummy smiles with significant aesthetic improvements. This case report emphasizes risk clarification, obtaining informed consent, and managing patient expectations regarding potential outcomes and the possibility of relapse.
Despite some limitations such as possible partial relapse observed after a year, this esthetic procedure has proven to be a safe and reliable technique supported by minimal side-effects. Long-term follow-up is vital to monitor post-operative results and shape realistic patient expectations for successful outcomes in gummy smile correction.

Case 1:
In this clinical case, the patient presented with a lesion in the right mandibular crest that had been evolving for one month. The neurological examination revealed a decreased sensation in the lower lip and chin on the same side, indicating possible nerve involvement suggestive of malignancy. Further imaging using craniofacial CT scan showed infiltration of the soft tissues around the right mandible along with an osteolytic lesion affecting the mandibular crest near tooth number 45. Additionally, multiple enlarged lymph nodes were found bilaterally, including submandibular, supraclavicular, and jugulo-carotid lymph nodes. The largest lymph node measured 20 mm.
A biopsy of the lesion was performed and histological analysis led to the conclusion that it was a large B-cell lymphoma originating from the gingiva of the mandible. The tumor cells exhibited clear cytoplasm and marked nuclear atypia. Numerous mitoses (cell divisions) and apoptotic bodies (cell death indicators) were observed within the tumor tissue. There were also significant necrotic changes present.
Immunohistochemical examination further confirmed its nature as a large B-cell lymphoma by demonstrating strong and diffuse expression of CD45 and CD20 markers on tumor cells while ruling out expression of CD3 and CK markers.
Given these findings, it was determined that chemotherapy would be an appropriate treatment approach for this patient's large B-cell lymphoma. Following initiation of chemotherapy cycles, there was a noticeable improvement in her condition.
Case 2:
The second case involves a 16-year-old male patient who initially presented with acute articular rheumatism but later experienced worsening general health status leading to hospitalization in General Surgery Department. Initially presenting symptoms included epigastralgia (abdominal pain located near upper stomach), vomiting, influenza-like illness accompanied by symptomatic relief measures.
Subsequently, he developed progressive pain localized to the right lower abdomen, diarrhea-like transit disorders, and a left mandibular swelling suspected to be of dental origin. Clinical examination revealed palpable left cervical lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes in the neck) without limitations in mouth opening. Intraoral examination displayed an extensive gingival mass extending from teeth 34 to 37 and mobility of the involved teeth for about three weeks.
Neurological evaluation demonstrated a hypoaesthesia (decreased sensation) along the path of the left inferior alveolar nerve. Radiological assessment revealed bone destruction affecting furcations (areas where tooth roots diverge) of teeth on the left side of molar region. Furthermore, an abdominal CT scan showed a tumor mass at ileocecal junction as well as peritoneal carcinomatosis (spread of cancerous cells within the abdominal cavity) and multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes with one measuring 31*21mm.
Biological analysis indicated elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker indicating inflammation, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which suggests tissue damage. HIV serology results were negative.
Given these findings, an association between oral lesion and abdominal tumor was suspected, raising concerns about cancer potentially originating from lymphocytes. A biopsy was performed on the oral lesion while surgical intervention occurred for removal of abdominal tumor by general surgery department.
Histopathological examinations confirmed Burkitt lymphoma as diagnosis with primary location in abdomen and secondary involvement in oral cavity. Microscopic evaluation revealed diffuse proliferation pattern consisting predominantly small to medium-sized basophilic cytoplasm lymphocytes with numerous mitoses observed under high magnification imaging. Immunohistochemistry supported this finding by demonstrating CD20 (+), CD10 (+), heterogeneous Bcl6 expression on B-lymphocytes. Furthermore, Ki67 staining indicated highly proliferative nature with all Ki67-positive cells demonstrating active cell division.
Upon completion of surgery and following oncology guidelines, the patient was referred to onco-hematology department for initiation of chemotherapy treatment. Unfortunately, the patient passed away one month later.
Both cases highlight the importance of prompt identification and management of malignancies arising from oral tissues. In both instances, a multidisciplinary approach involving dental professionals, surgeons, pathologists, and oncologists was crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning. 
In this clinical case, a patient presented with a gunshot wound to the left knee that resulted in an exit wound on the medial aspect of the knee. The external genitalia appeared normal upon inspection, and there was no urethral meatus bleeding. However, there was a laceration in the left leg.
Initial blood tests showed normal results for complete blood cell count, electrolyte profile, liver function, and coagulation. The only abnormal finding was an elevation in white blood cell count (14,000mg/dl), indicating some form of infection or inflammation.
A focused assessment with ultrasonography for trauma (FAST) did not reveal any free fluid in the abdominal cavity. A plain film of the left leg revealed a small fracture in the talus bone.
After resuscitation measures were taken, the patient underwent urgent scrotal exploration due to concerns about possible testicular damage from the gunshot wound. The patient was informed that an orchiectomy (removal of one or both testicles) might be necessary if repair was not feasible.
During scrotal exploration, approximately 200ml of hematoma (blood clot) was drained and removed. Both testes were exposed and found to be completely damaged along with some fragments from the gunshot identified and removed. The scrotum was thoroughly irrigated with 3000ml of normal saline solution.
Debridement (removal of necrotic tissue) of the ruptured testis tissue was performed; however, primary closure could not be achieved due to extruded seminiferous tubules and significant tissue defects in tunica albuginea (the tough fibrous layer surrounding each testicle).
A graft procedure using tunica vaginalis as graft tissue was conducted by using Vicryl suture bilaterally to create neocapsulae around the remaining viable testicular parenchymal tissue. Vas deferens-epididymis damage was observed, and it was recommended for a delayed repair with a microsurgical procedure.
A Foley catheter (thin tube placed into the bladder to drain urine) Fr 16 was inserted. The laceration on the left leg was irrigated with 2000ml of normal saline and repaired by an orthoptist (a specialist in orthopedic procedures).
Ceftriaxone, an antibiotic, was administered at a dosage of 2 grams daily during the patient's hospital stay. Joint care between urology and orthopedics teams ensured comprehensive management of the patient's injuries.
Three days after the operation, both the drain and catheter were removed. The patient was discharged one week later with plans for outpatient follow-up care. A three-week course of cephalexin (an antibiotic) and ibuprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) were prescribed for post-operative management.
Unfortunately, there were complications during the post-operative period, specifically fever and discharge from the surgical site. Additionally, it was determined that the left testis was not viable during follow-up at one week post-surgery necessitating orchiectomy (removal).
A four-month follow-up Doppler ultrasonography indicated that the right testis remained viable but had minimal atrophic changes. The patient reported normal erections post-surgery. Hormonal analysis revealed borderline normal serum hormone concentrations: serum testosterone level - 6.27ng/ml, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) - 120.3nl/ml, luteinizing hormone (LH) - 63.69nl/ml; prolactin level -11.05ng/ml.
Semen analysis showed a total sperm count of 12 million with a volume of 2.5cc; however, motility assessment revealed nonviable sperm cells despite having a relatively high percentage of normal forms (~70%). The patient expressed satisfaction with the cosmetic results of the procedure.
It should be noted that ethical considerations were taken into account, and the patient provided written informed consent for participation in the study discussed. 
In these two clinical cases, we see infants presenting with a condition known as aplasia cutis congenita. Aplasia cutis congenita is a rare disorder characterized by the absence of skin at birth. It can occur anywhere on the body, but most commonly affects the scalp. 
Case 1 involves a baby with a large defect on the vertex of the scalp over the parietal bone bilaterally extending to the occipital region. In addition to this scalp defect, the baby also presented with low set ears, irritability, tense anterior fontanelle (soft spot on top of the head), and respiratory distress. These symptoms raised concerns for possible meningitis in this case.
The diagnostic process included physical examination and imaging techniques such as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI revealed an absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally extending from behind the anterior fontanelle down to posterior fontanelle. The brain structures were normal in morphology and signal intensity.
Treatment for this case involved routine care protocols including oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, antibiotics at meningitis doses due to suspicion of infection, and wound dressing with sofra-tulle and normal saline soaked gauze. The baby responded well to treatment; respiratory distress subsided, oral feeds were tolerated well, and multidisciplinary team management involving neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons was implemented.
In preparation for future intervention to cover up the scalp defect through autologous skin grafting using flap cover procedures developed by burns and plastic unit specialists along with neurosurgeons consultation.
 
Case 2 involves another infant presenting with aplasia cutis congenita; however additional complications were present including desquamating or peeling skin epidermal structures like nails not being fully developed . There was also a midline subcutaneous tissue defect extending from frontal area all way back till right parietal region that caused cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage. The infant was febrile, cyanosed, hypertonic and a heart murmur was detected.
In this case, there were financial constraints preventing further diagnostic investigations such as brain MRI, echocardiography and chromosomal studies. The patient required treatment with parenteral antibiotics to address the meningitis that was likely present. Wound care included daily cleaning and dressing with betadine.
The infant experienced complications such as CSF leakage and meningitis which resolved over time with appropriate treatment. Plans were made for future intervention involving the use of prolene mesh/titanium mesh and latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap cover by burns and plastic unit specialists.
While these cases share the common feature of aplasia cutis congenita causing scalp defects, they also highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving specialized physicians from various fields such as neurosurgery, plastic surgery, neonatology along with nurses to provide comprehensive care to these infants.
It is essential for healthcare providers to maintain open lines of communication with families affected by aplasia cutis congenita in order to understand their concerns and provide appropriate support throughout the diagnostic process and subsequent management. Additionally, healthcare professionals must be aware of potential complications associated with this condition that may require prompt intervention to prevent further morbidity or mortality.
 In both cases, we see infants who presented with aplasia cutis congenita, a condition characterized by the absence of skin at birth. This condition can have various causes, including genetic factors, vascular abnormalities during fetal development, and exposure to certain medications or toxins during pregnancy.
In Case 1, the baby had a large defect on the scalp that was well-demarcated and irregularly shaped. The presence of a yellow layer of membrane covering the defect suggests the formation of granulation tissue or connective tissue filling in the area where skin is absent. The baby also had physical features such as low set ears and an irritable disposition.
Aplasia cutis congenita can present as an isolated finding or in association with other congenital abnormalities or syndromes. In this case, meningitis was also suspected due to symptoms like irritability and tense anterior fontanelle. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually caused by infections.
To confirm a diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita and determine its extent, imaging studies were performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that there was an absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally extending from behind anterior fontanelle down to posterior fontanelle without involvement into vital underlying brain structures.
Treatment for this case involved providing supportive care to ensure proper hydration with intravenous fluids while addressing potential infection through antibiotic therapy at doses appropriate for treating meningitis. Wound dressing included using sofra-tulle along with normal saline-soaked gauze for optimal wound healing conditions.
A multidisciplinary approach involving neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons was implemented to plan future interventions for closing the scalp defects through autologous skin grafting using flap cover procedures developed by specialized burn units.
In Case 2, similar concerns arose regarding aplasia cutis congenita due to observed subcutaneous tissue defects in multiple areas of the scalp. In addition to this, the baby presented with other anomalies such as desquamating skin, hypoplastic finger and toe nails, dilated abdominal wall veins, and a cardiac murmur suggesting congenital heart disease.
Further investigations were limited due to financial constraints; however, appropriate treatment was administered based on clinical findings. Parenteral antibiotics were given to address the suspected meningitis caused by blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infection. Wound care involved regular cleaning and dressing with betadine.
Complications such as CSF leakage and meningitis were managed during the hospital stay until discharge. Plans for future interventions involving prolene mesh/titanium mesh and latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap cover were made by burns and plastic surgery specialists.
It is important to note that while both cases presented aplasia cutis congenita as a main finding, Case 2 also included multiple other congenital anomalies. The presence of additional anomalies suggests the possibility of an underlying genetic disorder or syndrome predisposing these infants to multiple abnormalities.
In conclusion, aplasia cutis congenita is a rare condition where infants are born with skin defects typically affecting the scalp but can occur elsewhere on the body. It can present as an isolated finding or in association with other abnormalities or syndromes. Accurate diagnosis through physical examination and imaging studies helps guide treatment decisions involving wound care protocols in preparation for future interventions aimed at closing scalp defects. Multidisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals plays a crucial role in ensuring comprehensive management for these infants affected by aplasia cutis congenita.
 
Title: Unveiling the Intersection of Cryptococcus Meningoencephalitis and IgA-Î» Multiple Myeloma: A Clinical Case
Introduction:
In this clinical case, we present a patient with seemingly contradictory symptoms - a neurological presentation featuring bilateral paralysis of the sixth cranial nerve and bilateral hypo-acousia, alongside laboratory findings suggestive of immunodeficiency. The subsequent diagnosis revealed the coexistence of Cryptococcus meningoencephalitis and IgA-Î» multiple myeloma.
Clinical Presentation:
The physical examination unveiled a temperature recording of 38.5Â°C. The neurologic examination indicated that the patient was conscious, well oriented in space and time, without any signs of meningeal or vestibular syndrome. However, bilateral paralysis of the sixth cranial nerve and hypo-acousia were identified. Notably, there were no sensori-motor deficits or other localizing neurological signs.
Laboratory Findings:
The basic metabolic panel displayed several abnormalities warranting further investigation - elevated C-reactive protein levels, lymphopenia (low lymphocyte count), hyper-fibrinogenemia (high fibrinogen levels), and anemia. Additionally, an eye fundus examination revealed stage I papilledema bilaterally.
Diagnostic Investigations:
Cerebral computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal any significant abnormalities related to the patient's symptoms. However, an audiogram exhibited bilateral perceptive deafness. Subsequent lumbar puncture demonstrated elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure along with analyzed abnormalities such as increased white blood cell count mainly consisting of lymphocytes.
Cryptococcus Detection:
India ink staining detected Cryptococcus in CSF samples while serum testing for cryptococcal antigens returned positive results for both blood and CSF cultures confirmed by the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans. Sensitivity testing was also performed to determine the most effective antifungal therapy.
Immunodeficiency Evaluation:
Given the unusual occurrence of Cryptococcus infection in an immunocompetent patient, investigating potential causes of immunodeficiency became important. Serological tests for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. However, serum protein electrophoresis indicated hypo-albuminemia and hypogammaglobulinemia.
Multiple Myeloma Diagnosis: 
The presence of monoclonal IgA-Î» paraproteinemia along with Bence Jones proteinuria suggested the existence of IgA-lambda type multiple myeloma. Further laboratory analysis exhibited abnormal levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM concentrations, with a substantial elevation in lambda chains compared to kappa chains.
Confirmation and Management:
Bone marrow aspiration confirmed plasma cell infiltration exceeding 10%, confirming multiple myeloma diagnosis based on International Myeloma Working Group diagnostic criteria. To manage this condition, the patient received amphotericin B combined with flucytosine as treatment for Cryptococcus meningoencephalitis. Reduction of CSF pressure was achieved through repeated drainage during induction treatment followed by oral fluconazole for twelve weeks. During consolidation treatment for infection resolution, chemotherapy involving thalidomide, melphalan, and prednisone was initiated to address multiple myeloma.
Outcome:
Following successful management comprising antifungal therapy and chemotherapy regimen tailored specifically for multiple myeloma subtype IgA lambda type, no complications were reported during nine months post-treatment episode both clinically and on imaging examinations related to neurological complications associated with either condition.
Conclusion:
This clinical case illustrates a rare yet intriguing scenario where an opportunistic Cryptococcus infection coincides alongside immunodeficiency-related malignancy such as multiple myeloma. Prompt diagnosis facilitated targeted management resulting in favorable patient outcomes. Understanding the complexities of such interconnected diseases aids healthcare professionals in providing comprehensive care to patients facing similar challenges. 
This clinical case presents a patient with a gradually worsening pain in the right lower limb, along with bluish discoloration of the skin. The patient denies any history of trauma, fever, weight loss, or bleeding from other areas of the body. There is no history of anticoagulation therapy or bleeding disorders. It is noted that this is the second episode, with a similar one occurring four years prior and resolved gradually. The patient has a significant history of alcohol consumption and was previously diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease.
Upon examination, the patient has normal blood pressure but an elevated heart rate. The right thigh shows pitting edema extending from the foot to gluteus and there is a significant difference in circumference compared to the left limb. Ecchymosis (bruising) is present on the posterior thigh. The thigh is tender to touch and movement is limited.
The abdomen appears distended with ascites (accumulation of fluid). No splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) or peripheral stigmata (visible signs) of chronic liver disease are observed. Laboratory investigations reveal severe macrocytic normochromic anemia (low red blood cell count), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), hypoalbuminemia (low albumin level), elevated liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as an elevated INR indicating impaired blood clotting function.
Further tests show increased total bilirubin levels suggesting liver dysfunction, while viral screens for hepatitis B and C are negative. Doppler ultrasound reveals extensive tissue edema with a possible hematoma in the right gastrocnemius muscle without any venous clots being noted.
The CT angiogram shows no abnormalities in major arterial vessels supplying blood to the lower limb.
Considering all these findings together, this clinical case suggests a few possibilities. The symptoms and signs of acute limb ischemia (lack of blood flow to the limb) are present: worsening pain, discoloration, swelling, and decreased range of motion. Additionally, this patient has underlying liver disease with associated coagulopathy (impaired blood clotting) indicated by the elevated INR and prolonged PT.
Taking into account the patient's alcohol consumption history and alcoholic liver disease diagnosis, this case is most consistent with an acute hematoma in the right gastrocnemius muscle due to bleeding. Chronic liver disease can contribute to impaired synthesis of clotting factors leading to coagulopathy. Alcohol-induced bone marrow suppression can also contribute to anemia and thrombocytopenia seen in this case.
The management approach involved treating the underlying issues: transfusions of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma were administered to correct anemia and provide clotting factors. Tranexamic acid was given as a medication that helps prevent breakdown of clots, while vitamin K was used to normalize clotting function by increasing production of clotting factors.
Pain relief medications were provided along with thiamine supplementation due to alcoholism being associated with thiamine deficiency.
Overall, this case highlights the importance of considering both localizing symptoms related to a specific body part (such as lower limb pain) as well as systemic manifestations (such as liver dysfunction) when evaluating patients. Effective communication about prognosis and lifestyle modifications is crucial for long-term management in cases like these where alcohol cessation is necessary for optimal outcomes.
 
This clinical case describes a patient who presented with truncal obesity, gynecomastia, early bilateral knee osteoarthritis, hypertension, and diabetes. The patient had a history of heavy alcohol consumption for 40 years but had stopped drinking 6 years prior to the onset of his symptoms. He also stopped attending social gatherings. During routine investigation, the patient opened up to a radiologist about his concerns and was then referred to the plastic surgery clinic.
Upon examination, the patient was found to be an elderly man who appeared obese but in no obvious distress. He had a moody affect and weighed 123 kg with a height of 1.8 meters, resulting in a BMI of 38 kg/m2. His waist circumference was significantly increased at 145 cm compared to the normal measurement for males which is around 102 cm.
Musculo-skeletal examination revealed bilateral knee tenderness without swelling or crepitus. The patient also had bilateral gynecomastia and lipoma on his right thigh. Based on these findings along with his medical history of hypertension and diabetes, a diagnosis of truncal obesity in an elderly man with associated comorbidities was made.
Further investigations were performed including ultrasound imaging of the abdominal wall which showed variable thickness ranging from 7-10 cm in the upper quadrants and about 14-20 cm in the lower quadrants along with sonologically significant intra-abdominal fat deposition. No organ pathology was observed through these tests.
Laboratory investigations such as serum electrolytes, urea and creatinine levels, fasting blood sugar level analysis, complete blood count assessment, serum protein analysis, serum lipid profile evaluation as well as an echocardiography were all within normal ranges.
Following consultation with both a cardiologist and anesthesiologist who independently confirmed him fit for surgery after their respective assessments; informed consent from the patient was obtained for abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) surgery, potentially combined with liposuction. However, liposuction was later excluded due to concerns regarding the patient's age and co-existing health conditions.
The surgical procedure involved general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation after failed epidural anesthesia. Approximately 1.7 liters of Hunstad fluid were also infused for hemostasis (control of bleeding) and hydro-dissection (separation of tissues). The conventional abdominoplasty technique was used, making a traditional incision in the lower abdomen and excising the protruding infra-umbilical tissue which weighed around 8.4 kg.
Additionally, the rectus sheath (a layer of fibrous tissue that surrounds the rectus abdominis muscles) was plicated (tightened) in two rows, allowing for a flatter abdominal appearance. The patient's umbilicus was also transposed to its new position on the tightened abdominal wall before closing the surgical wound using sutures over two redivac drains, which are placed to remove excess fluid post-operatively.
During surgery, there was an estimated blood loss of 750 ml and the patient received a transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells as required. Post-operative complications included a blood transfusion reaction and surgical site infection resulting in partial wound dehiscence (separation).
However, these complications were successfully managed through wound dressings using povidone iodine solution and antibiotics ultimately leading to their resolution. The patient experienced significant improvement in his quality of life following surgery including returning to his business ventures and social activities that had previously been limited by his physical appearance.
One year after abdominoplasty, it was noted that he weighed 116 kg with a BMI decrease to 35.8 kg/m2. Waist girth decreased to 112 cm compared to pre-operative measurements while abdominal girth at umbilical level decreased considerably from 141 cm to 123 cm. The point of maximal enlargement was reduced significantly as well from 151 cm located at 20 cm below the umbilicus pre-operatively to only 125 cm located just 10 cm below the umbilicus post-operatively.
A post-operative ultrasound of the abdominal wall demonstrated a reduced and more uniform thickness ranging from 1.3-4.4 cm, indicating successful surgical outcome in terms of removal of excess adipose tissue and improvement in abdominal contour.
The patient was advised to continue abstinence from alcohol consumption along with dietary control measures for long-term health benefits and weight management.
 
Title: Treatment and Recovery from Expansive Cell Granuloma in the Hand
Introduction:
Expansive Cell Granuloma (ECG) is a rare, benign bone tumor that can occur in various parts of the body. This clinical case describes the diagnosis, treatment, and recovery of a patient presenting with chronic pain, finger enlargement, and limited joint mobility in the hand. A surgical technique known as Tsuge's method was employed to successfully remove the tumor.
Case Presentation:
The patient complained of chronic pain in her fifth finger along with other symptoms such as paresthesia (tingling sensation), tactile pain, swelling in the ulnar region of her hand, crepitation (cracking sound), and restricted flexion of her proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP). Upon clinical examination, a palpable mass with considerable volume was observed on her phalanx. X-ray images revealed complete absorption of cortical periosteal calcification leading to increased dimensions of the phalanx. Additionally, radiographs indicated a well-demarcated pathologic fracture with cortical thinning along with a radiolucent mass within this fractured area.
Diagnosis:
Hematochemical analysis ruled out any rheumatic disease or elevated uric acid levels as potential causes for these symptoms. These findings allowed for exclusionary diagnosis leading to ECG as a probable cause. Tinel's sign and Phalen's maneuver were negative during physical examination.
Treatment Approach:
Based on these observations and diagnostic results, surgical intervention using Tsuge's technique was selected for this case. The surgery involved disarticulating the fifth metacarpal bone together with amputation of that specific ray within the hand structure under axillary block anesthesia.
Surgical Procedure:
A volar Z-Brunner type incision followed by a dorsal longitudinal extension along digit five allowed sufficient exposure for tumor excision. An incision pattern resembling Y-shaped began dorsally at the base of the fifth metacarpal and continued toward the fourth metacarpal. It then merged into a V-shaped incision on the palmar side near the proximal transverse palmar plica. The dorsal skin flap was carefully separated to expose both the fourth dorsal interosseous muscle and bone segment requiring resection.
Key aspects of this procedure included an oblique mid-diaphysis osteotomy of the fifth metacarpal bone while maintaining its base for distal extensor attachment, sectioning tendons aligned with digit five extensor muscles, ligature and cauterization of vessels and nerve endings, removal of distal fifth metacarpal bone section, suture closure between tendon remnants and nearby muscles to fill gaps created by bone removal, palm suturing followed by dorsal hand skin closures with a bandage applied postoperatively.
Rehabilitation:
Functional rehabilitation commenced two weeks after surgery with a focus on improving range of motion and grip strength in the hand. A one-year post-operative check-up indicated no subjective problems reported by the patient. The patient demonstrated complete functional recovery with satisfactory cosmetic results.
Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights an uncommon presentation of expansive cell granuloma in a patient complaining of chronic pain, paresthesia, limited joint mobility, swelling, and finger enlargement. Through successful surgical intervention following Tsuge's method, which involved disarticulation of affected bones within digit five along with soft tissue repair techniques for tendon reattachment, this patient experienced complete functional recovery within one year post-surgery.
This case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis using comprehensive clinical examinations along with imaging techniques like X-rays. Surgical management guided by well-established techniques can enable successful treatment outcomes and substantial post-operative recovery in patients presenting symptoms associated with expansive cell granulomas in their hands. 
This clinical case describes a pregnant patient who presented with severe symptoms and complications related to high blood pressure (hypertension) and liver dysfunction. The initial presentation included a blood pressure reading of 180/110 mmHg, positive findings on obstetric ultrasound indicating a healthy fetal heart rhythm, and abnormal laboratory results such as significant proteinuria (4+), elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), along with other abnormalities including platelet count, bilirubin levels, and hemoglobin levels.
To address the hypertensive crisis, the medical team administered antihypertensive medications: intravenous nicardipine as a bolus dose and oral methyldopa every 8 hours. In addition to controlling the blood pressure, magnesium sulfate was given to prevent seizures in this patient. As there was also concern for premature delivery of the baby due to the complications observed in both mother and fetus, betamethasone was administered to enhance fetal lung maturity.
Despite these interventions targeting symptomatic relief for both mother and baby, it became evident that they were ineffective in stabilizing the patient's condition. Thus an immediate cesarean delivery was deemed necessary for maternal rescue.
Post-delivery complications emerged rapidly within two days after birth. The patient experienced intense epigastric pain accompanied by several abnormal laboratory findings indicating organ damage including severe anemia (hemoglobin dropped to 9.1 g/dl), further elevation of liver enzymes (AST & ALT), decreased platelet count suggestive of thrombocytopenia, raised LDH levels indicative of tissue breakdown or damage, prolonged prothrombin time suggesting impaired clotting ability along with elevated renal markers like serum creatinine reflecting kidney dysfunction.
Based on these observations combined with previous findings from pregnancy-specific tests such as proteinuria and deranged liver function tests during pregnancy-induced hypertension assessments initially performed outside MICU care suggests that this patient likely developed HELLP syndrome - Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count.
As a result of this diagnosis, the patient was promptly transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for possible liver subcapsular hematoma related to HELLP syndrome. In MICU, further examination revealed right hypochondrial sensitivity and decreased breath sounds on physical examination. Ultrasonic imaging demonstrated hyperechoic areas within different hepatic segments along with extensive hydrothorax.
To provide a comprehensive picture of the situation and identify potential complications, a thoraco-abdominopelvic CT scan was performed. This scan revealed diffuse poorly defined hypodense plaques distributed throughout all liver segments with no signs of hemorrhage within those areas or increased portal or subhepatic vascular permeability. The CT findings were consistent with massive hepatic infarction. Furthermore, intra-peritoneal and pleural effusions were also observed during the CT scan.
The treatment approach continued by administering antihypertensive drugs orally along with prophylactic anticoagulants and proton pump inhibitors to manage blood pressure control, prevent clot formation in risk areas like blood vessels within damaged liver tissue while reducing gastric acid production respectively.
Unfortunately, complications persisted as the patient developed respiratory distress evidenced by worsening pleural effusion on chest X-ray along with fever and deteriorating laboratory results including severe anemia (hemoglobin = 4.6 g/dl), platelet levels dropping even lower (20000/ul), elevated white blood cell count indicative of infection (26000/ul), increased C-reactive protein as an inflammation marker reaching 340 mg/l), decreased albumin reflecting poor nutritional status (16 g/l), prolonged PT reflecting impaired clotting ability(50%).
Treatment at this stage incorporated administration of antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam combination therapy for a period of two weeks and amikacin for three days additionally providing supportive measures, such as red blood cell and platelet transfusions, albumin infusions, and pleural effusion drainage.
Over the subsequent six days in MICU care, the patient demonstrated clinical improvement. Liver function tests began to show a downtrend by postoperative day 5. Over time, all laboratory abnormalities gradually normalized within 11 days. The CT scan performed to monitor hepatic areas showed stable findings after 15 days.
Eventually, on day 17 of her hospitalization journey, the patient was deemed stable enough for discharge with scheduled follow-ups to further assess her ongoing recovery process. 
In the first clinical case, a patient presented with a lesion in their right mandibular crest that had been developing for about a month. The neurological examination revealed reduced sensation in the lower lip and chin on one side, which raised concerns about malignancy. Further imaging with a craniofacial CT scan showed that the soft tissues of the right lateral mandible were infiltrated and there was an osteolytic lesion affecting the mandibular crest near tooth 45. Additionally, multiple lymph nodes were found bilaterally in locations such as submandibular, supraclavicular, and jugulo-carotid regions. The largest lymph node measured 20 mm.
To determine the nature of the lesion, a biopsy was performed. Histological analysis combined with immunohistochemical examination revealed that it was a large B-cell lymphoma originating from the gingiva of the mandible. Microscopically, there were large tumor cells with abundant cytoplasm and nuclei showing significant atypia (anomalous features). Mitoses (cell divisions) and apoptotic bodies (cell death marks) were also observed at relatively high levels within the tumor tissue. Furthermore, necrotic changes (tissue death) were extensive within this tumor specimen.
In immunohistochemistry staining for specific markers present on cells' surface or inside them), it was found that tumor cells strongly expressed CD45 and CD20 markers diffusely throughout their population but did not express CD3 or CK markers. Based on these findings, treatment for large B-cell lymphoma was initiated in consultation with an oncologist-hematologist department where chemotherapy-based therapy began.
Notably, after receiving several cycles of chemotherapy treatment as per protocol guidelines for this type of lymphoma management appeared to be improving significantly for this patient.
Moving onto our second case study - involving a 16-year-old male patient - he had been previously diagnosed with acute articular rheumatism and had a history of erysipelas (a skin infection) at the age of 7. This patient was admitted to the General Surgery Department due to a worsening general condition. Initially, he experienced epigastric pain, vomiting, and flu-like symptoms for which he received symptom-based treatment.
The patient's condition deteriorated further with increasing pain in the right lower abdomen associated with diarrhea-like bowel movements. He was referred to the department where I work for assessment and management of a swelling in his left mandible that was suspected to be an abscess originating from dental issues.
Upon examination, we found palpable lymph nodes on the left side of his neck along with normal mouth opening. The intraoral examination revealed an extensive mass affecting gingiva between teeth 34 and 37. Terminal mobility (looseness) of these teeth had been progressing over three weeks' time. Neurological examination revealed sensory changes in the area supplied by the left inferior alveolar nerve.
To assess this patient thoroughly, radiological imaging was performed, revealing bone destruction involving tooth furcation or bifurcation (area where roots separate) in the left molar region.
Further investigations included abdominal CT scan which indicated a tumor mass near ileocecal junction (where small intestine meets large intestine), along with peritoneal carcinomatosis (spread within abdominal cavity). Multiple lymph nodes were also found within mediastinal regions as determined by CT scans; notably, one lymph node measured around 31*21mm in size.
Blood tests showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an indication of inflammation or tissue damage within body systems - CRP value at 117 - as well as increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme levels - LDH at 789 IU/L).
Taking all these findings into consideration alongside negative HIV serology results suggesting absence of HIV infection, we suspected an association between the oral lesion and the abdominal tumor, raising concerns about lymphoma as a possible cancer type.
To confirm the diagnosis, a biopsy of the oral lesion was performed, and surgical intervention was carried out in the general surgery department for removal of the abdominal tumor. Results confirmed our suspicion of Burkitt lymphoma with primary manifestation in abdominal region that had metastasized to secondary oral locations.
Histologically, there was diffuse growth pattern observed consisting of small to medium-sized lymphocytes with basophilic cytoplasm. The presence of numerous mitoses suggested rapid proliferation rates within these malignant cells. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated B-cell phenotype with positive staining for markers CD20 and CD10, while expression level for Bcl6 marker varied among various cells. The proliferation index Ki67 indicated an extremely high proliferative rate at 100%.
After surgical management and postoperative care without any evident complications or concerns, this patient was referred to onco-hematology department where chemotherapy treatment began following standardized protocols as per evidence-based guidelines.
Unfortunately, despite prompt initiation of treatment, this patient's clinical course rapidly deteriorated due to aggressive nature of Burkitt lymphoma resulting in his death approximately one month after diagnosis.
It is crucial to note that both cases illustrated here exemplify aggressive forms of lymphomas - large B-cell type in first case; Burkitt lymphoma in second case - requiring prompt diagnosis and early initiation/interventions via chemotherapy treatments provided by competent healthcare professionals experienced in managing hematologic malignancies such as onco-hematologists. 
Title: Unfortunate Progression of Ewing's Sarcoma: A Case Study
Introduction:
This clinical case explores the tragic progression of Ewing's sarcoma in an infant who faced considerable challenges due to financial constraints and limited access to healthcare services. The inability to receive timely diagnostics, appropriate treatment, and continuous care significantly impacted the patient's prognosis.
Background:
Ewing's sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that primarily affects children and young adults. It typically develops in bones or soft tissues, most commonly in the long bones such as the arms or legs. Early diagnosis followed by comprehensive treatment offers the best chance of a favorable outcome.
Case Presentation:
In this case, a child presented with an initial complaint of swelling in the left forearm that gradually spread to involve the elbow joint. The early manifestation included pain upon touch and limitation of joint movement. The patient later developed intermittent low-grade fever along with axillary lymphadenopathy on examination.
Diagnostic Challenges:
The lack of antenatal care allowed for speculation about potential exposure during pregnancy, but no definitive history was available for any known risk factors. Multiple herbal preparations were used during pregnancy; however, their role could not be ascertained clearly due to limited data.
Progression Pathway:
Upon physical examination, an extensive swelling with hyperemic skin involving the left forearm was observed. An ulcer had also formed at one location in this area. Blood tests initially indicated sepsis-like patterns requiring antibiotic therapy; however, further investigations were hindered by financial constraints.
A subsequent biopsy disclosed a small blue cell tumor but did not provide certainty regarding its origin - Desmoplastic small cell tumor, Ewing sarcoma,Ew Lymphoma were among potential differential diagnoses.
Further immunohistochemistry testing provided conclusive evidence leading to a final diagnosis of Ewingâs sarcoma.
Unfortunately,the delay in obtaining necessary investigations subsequently led to skeletal involvement observed on X-ray imaging.
Treatment Complications:
Surgical intervention, involving disarticulation of the left arm with an above-elbow amputation, was performed to address the progressive disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide was recommended but not attainable for this patient due to financial constraints.
Challenges Faced:
The inability to procure cytotoxic drugs significantly impeded the patient's potential response to anticancer treatment. The financial burden persisted throughout the hospital stay, obstructing the requisition of further investigations such as a chest X-ray and a thoracolumbar spine X-ray.
Final Outcome:
Despite receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy during the hospital stay along with efforts to manage diarrhea and dehydration episodes promptly, intermittent fevers persisted during treatment. Eventually,suspected sepsis led to an unfavorable outcome, resulting in the patient's untimely demise after two months on admission.
Conclusion:
This case highlights several significant challenges faced by patients when financial constraints hinder their access to healthcare services. In resource-limited settings where comprehensive care is hindered by limited resources or lack of health insurance coverage, early detection and effective management of rare diseases like Ewing's sarcoma become extremely difficult.
Efforts towards improving access to healthcare facilities,promoting awareness about early signs and symptoms among communities,and advocating for affordable medications are crucial in preventing similar tragedies from occurring in vulnerable populations.
 
Case NÂ°1:
In this clinical case, the patient presented with symptoms that initially did not suggest COVID-19 infection. However, upon further investigation, it was discovered that the patient had a positive PCR test for COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer levels, indicating potential coagulation abnormalities.
The patient also experienced repeated paroxysmal seizures without returning to normal consciousness between seizures, which led to a diagnosis of status epilepticus. The electroencephalogram (EEG) performed during the intercritical phase revealed theta activity and epileptogenic graphoelements suggestive of multifocal epilepsy.
The patient received treatment according to the protocol for managing status epilepticus including Clonazepam, Phenobarbital infusion, and Thiopental as recommended by the neurologist. A brain CT scan did not show any specific abnormalities.
After the confirmation of COVID-19 infection and discontinuation of chloroquine sulfate due to recurrent seizures, corticosteroid therapy was initiated along with symptomatic management. The patient remained seizure-free for one month before being discharged under neurologist's prescription.
Case NÂ°2:
In this case involving an 11-year-old patient who was being treated with chloroquine sulfate for confirmed COVID-19 infection, loss of consciousness occurred along with generalized tonic-clonic seizure and other associated symptoms such as tongue biting and loss of urine control. The clinical examination revealed respiratory distress but no fever.
The neurological examination showed persistent mental confusion for more than an hour during the intercritical phase. Metabolic balance sheet results were within normal limits but there were indications of a non-specific inflammatory syndrome in other biological parameters. An electrocardiogram (ECG) indicated a heart rhythm disorder.
Urgent brain CT scan or intracranial EEG was not performed at this stage due to limited availability. Chloroquine sulfate was discontinued while clonazepam IV benzodiazepine was initiated as needed. Background antiepileptic treatment (levetiracetam) was also started following the second seizure.
After recovery from COVID-19 infection and being seizure-free for three weeks, a brain scan and EEG were performed, which showed normal results. The patient was discharged with a recommendation for neurological surveillance.
Case NÂ°3:
In this case, a 16-year-old patient who tested positive for COVID-19 and was receiving treatment with chloroquine sulfate experienced loss of consciousness accompanied by Bravais Jacksonian clonic seizures on the right side of the body. There was no personal or family history of epilepsy.
The clinical examination did not reveal any notable findings apart from focal epilepsy with rolandic paroxysm. The metabolic assessment showed normal results while other biological parameters indicated a non-specific inflammatory syndrome.
Similar to previous cases, chloroquine sulfate was discontinued and clonazepam IV benzodiazepine was initiated as needed. Following a repeat attack after chloroquine discontinuation, levetiracetam treatment was instituted. The patient remained seizure-free for 16 days before discharge with two negative RT-PCR tests.
Post-recovery brain CT scan and EEG detected no abnormalities in this case as well.
These three cases demonstrate various neurological complications associated with COVID-19 infection in different age groups without prior history of epilepsy. While some patients experienced status epilepticus or generalized seizures, others had focal seizures or epileptiform activity detected on EEG recordings.
Management involved discontinuing chloroquine sulfate due to its potential role in triggering or exacerbating seizures and initiating appropriate antiepileptic medications based on the type of seizures observed. Symptomatic management along with corticosteroid therapy were provided when necessary in order to control inflammation caused by COVID-19 infection.
Long-term follow-up is important to monitor any potential recurrence of seizures or other neurological complications associated with COVID-19 infection in these cases. 
This clinical case description presents the case of a patient with skin complaints that were initially suspected to be tuberculosis verrucosa cutis. The patient denied any previous history of allergies or family history of similar complaints. However, there was no known information about immunization history.
The patient had previously been treated at a local hospital with oral medication and ointments but did not experience significant improvement. Despite this, the patient was otherwise healthy, with a normal body weight of 64 kg.
Upon dermatological examination, the right knee showed an erythematous plaque with a verrucous surface, elevated edge, erythematous base, and crusting. Likewise, the left dorsum pedis had erythematous macules and plaques accompanied by crusting.
Several differential diagnoses were considered in this case including tuberculosis verrucosa cutis, lupus vulgaris (a form of skin tuberculosis), chromoblastomycosis (a fungal infection), and neurodermatitis (a chronic eczematous condition).
Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis (an increase in white blood cell count). Other complete blood count results along with blood sugar levels and liver function tests were within normal range. Skin scraping examination did not reveal any acid-resistant bacilli or fungus growth in tissue culture.
Considering these findings along with negative Mantoux test results (which assess for exposure to tuberculosis bacteria), suppurative chronic inflammation suggestive of cutaneous TB was observed on histopathological examination.
To obtain a conclusive diagnosis, further tests were conducted including M. tuberculosis culture using skin tissue samples; Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) which assess for immune response to TB antigens; and GeneXpert method examining M.Tuberculosis using tissue samples.
While these additional tests did not demonstrate the presence or growth of M.Tuberculosis through culture methods after four weeks nor by GeneXpert method analysis; IGRA examination resulted in a positive finding. This positive IGRA result along with the history, physical examination, and supporting tests led to a final diagnosis of tuberculosis verrucosa cutis.
The patient was then prescribed category 1 antituberculosis therapy trial based on their body weight. Treatment involved administering four tablets of fixed-dose combination antituberculosis drugs once daily for four weeks, in addition to a B Complex tablet as supplementary support.
After 21 days of treatment, significant improvements were observed including thinning of the plaque and reduced itching. Furthermore, no adverse reactions were reported by the patient. Consequently, this regimen was continued for two months before transitioning to the maintenance phase in the third month.
During the maintenance phase, two tablets of fixed combination drugs consisting of isoniazid and rifampicin were administered daily. At the end of the six-month treatment period, there was significant improvement evident.
In summary, this clinical case describes a patient who presented with skin lesions initially suspected to be tuberculosis verrucosa cutis. Through comprehensive evaluation including history taking, physical examination findings such as erythematous plaques with crusts and laboratory investigations (including histopathological examination), a diagnosis was established and appropriate antituberculosis treatment resulted in significant improvement over time.
It is crucial to note that each individual's case may differ; therefore consulting with healthcare professionals is essential for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management plan tailored specifically to their condition. 
This is a clinical case of a child who presented with failure to thrive (FTT) along with acyanotic heart disease and right bronchopneumonia. Further assessment revealed a diagnosis of Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) and Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). It was determined that the child would need surgery to close the VSD and ligate the PDA.
Prior to surgery, various investigations were done to evaluate the child's overall health. These included a full blood count (FBC), serum electrolyte levels, urea, and creatinine â all of which were found to be within normal ranges. The patient was assigned an American Society of Anaesthesiology (ASA) grade 2, indicating mild systemic disease.
On the day of surgery, specific preparations were made regarding fasting and medication administration. The child was fasted from 12 midnight for solid foods but allowed breast feeding until 3:00 am prior to surgery. A peripheral line was secured in the morning using a 24G needle for easy access during anesthesia.
In the operating theatre, standard monitoring equipment such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximeter were attached to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation levels respectively. The patient was gently sedated using ketamine and midazolam while manual ventilation with 100% oxygen support was initiated.
To facilitate intubation â insertion of a tube into the trachea - vecuronium was administered after inducing anesthesia with ketamine. Mechanical ventilation started at low tidal volume with an adjusted respiratory rate according to medical guidelines. Analgesia in the form of intermittent fentanyl was given as required during surgery while isoflurane maintained anesthesia.
During surgery for VSD repair and PDA ligation, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) â a technique that temporarily takes over cardiac function -was employed for about 55 minutes. The surgeon used an aortic cross clamp for a total of 55 minutes to stop blood flow temporarily. Following successful weaning off CPB, it was noted that the radial artery blood pressure waveform appeared dampened, indicating some abnormality.
Further investigation revealed an interrupted aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery, where the PDA was supplying both upper and lower limbs. This unexpected finding required immediate reattachment of the subclavian artery to both ascending and descending segments of the aorta. To carry out this repair, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) was performed gradually by cooling down the patient's body temperature.
Once DHCA at 16Â°C was achieved, sustained for about 33 minutes while surgery took place. Gradual rewarming back to normal body temperature occurred over approximately 22 minutes after completion of repairs. Heparin reversal using protamine sulfate took place at this stage as well.
Throughout surgery, various medications were administered including adrenaline infusion for hemodynamic support after coming off CPB, milrinone infusion for improved cardiac contractility, and sildenafil for vasodilation.
After chest closure and stabilization in ICU post-surgery, management continued with supportive care including fluid management using furosemide to maintain urine output and medication such as paracetamol (analgesia), pantoprazole (gastric protection), methylprednisolone (anti-inflammatory), meropenem (antibiotic treatment), albumin (due to low levels), levosimendan infusion (for further cardiac support).
The child continued on mechanical ventilation overnight until extubation could be performed on day 3 post-operation when stable respiratory status allowed it. Oral rehydration salt solutions were started along with oral sildenafil and aldactone administration.
Over time in ICU recovery period ongoing treatment included dexmedetomidine â sedative pain relief â eventually leading towards discontinuation of infusion after the fifth hour in ICU. The child progressed well, with the crucial hemodynamic parameters remaining stable.
On Day 4 post-op, echocardiography results demonstrated satisfactory cardiac performance following surgery. Oral feeds commenced on Day 5 along with adjustments to medication regimens.
The child was eventually discharged home on day 11 in good condition and scheduled for a follow-up appointment four weeks post-surgery.
Throughout this case, a multidisciplinary team including anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, and intensive care specialists played essential roles in ensuring patient safety and successful surgical outcomes. 
This clinical case describes a rare condition called ulcerated disseminated basidiobolomycosis in an immunocompetent girl. Basidiobolomycosis is a fungal infection caused by the fungus Basidiobolus ranarum.
The patient described in the case presented with several symptoms. She had poor general condition and functional impotence when walking. Upon examination, her palpebral and bulbar mucous membranes were pale and anicterical, respectively. She also had a fever of 40ÂºC and a steady tachycardia at 100 beats per minute.
The dermatological examination revealed large, indurated, erythematous, warm plaques that were mobile with respect to the deep plane but adhering to the superficial plane. The edges of the plaques were clearly delineatable by fingers and were present on her lower limbs, back, abdomen, pubis, and vulva. Within these plaques were hollow ulcers with polycyclic contours, fibrinous necrotic bottoms, detached edges, and no pigmentation in the peri-ulcer area.
Additional findings included lymphoedema on the back of her left foot and inflammatory inguinal lymphadenopathy bilaterally. The left knee was also blocked in flexion causing functional impotence to walk.
Further diagnostic investigations were conducted to confirm or rule out potential causes for this clinical presentation. Ziehl Nielsen staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium ulcerans by gene amplification of a specific genome sequence known as IS2404 (which is typically associated with Buruli ulcer). However direct examination of a punch biopsy sample showed yeasts and mycelial filaments suggestive of basidiobolomycosis.
Complementary examinations revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia along with leukocytosis predominated by eosinophils. The C-reactive protein level was elevated at 192mg/L. Serologies for HIV and hepatitis B infection were negative.
Histopathology findings showed well-differentiated epidermis with discreet orthokeratosis and a dermal site of significant inflammatory fibrosis. The inflammation within the dermis consisted of numerous eosinophilic polynuclear cells associated with epithelioid granulomas and giganto-cellular granulomas centered by extracellular eosinophilic masses and bulky mycelial filaments, which is known as Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon - a characteristic finding in basidiobolomycosis.
Although mycological culture and PCR to identify the specific fungus were not done due to technical reasons, based on the clinical presentation, direct examination findings, and histopathology results, the diagnosis of ulcerated disseminated basidiobolomycosis in an immunocompetent girl was made.
Treatment for this condition involved oral ketoconazole (100 mg per day) to target the fungal infection. Additionally, correction of anemia using oral iron suspension (5 mg per day) was initiated along with improved nutrition through enriched porridges and a high protein diet. Regular transaminase assays were performed to monitor liver function during treatment.
Surgical management was also carried out, which involved removing the ulcers initially and then performing a cutaneous mesh transplant to facilitate healing of large ulcers. Physiotherapists were involved in correcting the knee flexion anomaly, promoting extremity recovery and walking ability, as well as managing lymphoedema.
The patient's progress was favorable after 14 weeks of complete medical treatment including resolution of lymphoedema, flexum correction, ulcer healing without recurrence noted after 6 months or one year of follow-up.
In conclusion, this case highlights an uncommon fungal infection called basidiobolomycosis, which presented with characteristic dermatological findings, systemic symptoms, and associated complications like lymphoedema and knee flexion impairment. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment led to a favorable outcome for the patient. 
This clinical case describes a patient who initially presented with symptoms suggestive of an acute ischemic stroke, specifically a partial Wallenberg (medullary) syndrome. The patient had palatal weakness, impaired gag and cough reflex, nasal quality in speech, but normal extra-ocular movements. However, a 1.5 tesla MRI of the brain with MR angiogram revealed no abnormalities.
Due to the patient being a hypertensive male and having an acute presentation of symptoms without diurnal variation in intensity or fatiguability, myasthenia gravis (MG) was not considered initially. Instead, the diagnosis was thought to be an ischemic stroke.
The patient was admitted and started on various medications including antiplatelets, low molecular weight heparin, neurotropics, antihypertensives and statins. Nasogastric (NG) tube insertion was planned to prevent aspiration of food since the patient exhibited difficulty in articulation of speech and persistent nasal speech.
Routine blood investigations were conducted along with thrombophilia blood workup, a 2D echocardiogram, and 24-hour holter monitoring as part of young stroke workup; all results were normal. Throughout the hospital stay, the patient experienced elevated blood pressures on multiple occasions but they were controlled by optimizing antihypertensive medication.
Upon discharge after a week's stay in the hospital, signs of bulbar weakness persisted such as hyponasal voice and nasal regurgitation. Feedings continued via nasogastric tube to prevent further aspiration.
During subsequent follow-up consultations after one month from discharge date showed persistent palatal weakness and associated dysphagia. Further evaluations including fluoroscopic evaluation of deglutition revealed weakness in base tongue muscles hindering normal deglutition which resulted in determining that the NG tube should remain in place.
Continued worsening symptoms led to consideration for myasthenia gravis as a differential diagnosis. Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) test and estimation of acetyl choline receptor (AchR) antibody in serum were conducted, both of which confirmed a diagnosis of generalized MG. The AchR antibody levels were strongly positive. Treatment was initiated with pyridostigmine and oral prednisolone.
The patient showed significant improvement in bulbar weakness and fatiguability after two weeks on the treatment regimen. A CT scan of the thorax ruled out thymoma, a common finding in MG patients.
Therapy with neostigmine, pyridostigmine, and oral prednisolone was continued for two more months leading to further reduction in symptoms, eventually weaning the patient off the NG tube. By three months, he became symptom-free.
During a review in March 2020, his symptoms remained absent. Improvement was also observed in his previously furrowed/fissured and atrophied tongue upon continuing the same management approach.
This case highlights the importance of considering alternative diagnoses when initial findings do not align with expectations. In this instance, myasthenia gravis was not initially considered due to potential confusion with acute ischemic stroke symptoms. The appropriate investigations eventually led to an accurate diagnosis and successful treatment outcome for the patient.
1) Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3985575/ This clinical case describes the course of treatment for a patient who initially presented with symptoms resembling an acute ischemic stroke but was eventually diagnosed with myasthenia gravis (MG). After the diagnosis was confirmed through repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) testing and measurement of acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibodies, the patient's treatment regimen was adjusted accordingly.
The patient began receiving a low dose of pyridostigmine, a medication commonly used to improve muscle strength by enhancing neuromuscular transmission. Additionally, oral prednisolone, a corticosteroid with immunosuppressive properties, was prescribed to help manage inflammation associated with MG. Both medications are effective in managing symptoms and improving quality of life for MG patients.
Follow-up evaluations were conducted to monitor the progression of the disease and evaluate response to treatment. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax was performed to rule out thymoma, a tumor commonly associated with MG that can exacerbate symptoms. Fortunately, no thymoma was found in this case.
As treatment continued over two months, there was marked reduction in the patient's bulbar weakness and fatiguability. This improvement allowed for weaning off the nasogastric (NG) tube since swallowing function improved gradually over time.
During subsequent follow-up consultations after three months from initial diagnosis and initiation of treatment, the patient remained symptom-free. The previously observed furrowed/fissured appearance and atrophy in his tongue had also improved significantly under continued management.
It is worth noting that managing MG requires long-term care because it is a chronic autoimmune condition that may require adjustments in medication dosages or additional therapies based on individual needs. Close monitoring is necessary to maintain optimal symptom control while minimizing side effects from medications.
This case emphasizes several important points related to clinical practice:
1. Accurate Diagnosis: It illustrates how differentiating between various conditions that present with similar symptoms is crucial for providing appropriate treatment. The initial suspicion of an acute ischemic stroke was reconsidered when the patient's clinical course did not align with expectations, ultimately leading to the correct diagnosis of MG.
2. Multidisciplinary Approach: The management of complex cases like this one often requires input from various healthcare professionals, including neurologists, radiologists, and speech therapists, among others. Collaboration among these specialists allows for a comprehensive evaluation and optimal treatment plan.
3. Timely Evaluations: Due to the fluctuating nature of MG symptoms, it is important to conduct regular follow-up evaluations to monitor disease progression and therapy response. Adapting treatment strategies as needed ensures that patients receive appropriate care based on their individual needs.
In conclusion, this clinical case highlights the importance of considering alternative diagnoses during differential diagnosis processes and emphasizes the need for thorough investigation when initial findings do not align with expectations. Effective communication between healthcare providers and multidisciplinary collaboration play a critical role in achieving accurate diagnoses and implementing appropriate treatments for complex conditions like myasthenia gravis.
 
Title: Successful Treatment of Congenital Vaginal Agenesis: A Case Report
Introduction:
Congenital vaginal agenesis is a rare condition where the lower third segment of the vagina is absent, leading to various reproductive and psychosocial challenges. In this case report, we present the successful treatment of a patient diagnosed with congenital vaginal agenesis using perineal vaginoplasty.
Case Presentation:
A young adult female presented with pelvic pain and an unusual finding during vaginal examination. Instead of the introitus, a vaginal cup was observed, suggesting hematometrocolpos. Ultrasonography confirmed a normal-sized uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervix along with fluid retention in the emptiness line of the uterus and upper third segment of the vagina related to hematometrocolpos. Pelvic MRI further revealed morphological changes consistent with congenital vaginal agenesis.
Diagnosis and Decision-making:
Hormonal analysis indicated no abnormalities, and karyotype analysis showed 46XX constitution ruling out any chromosomal anomalies. With these findings, congenital vaginal agenesis on functional uterus was diagnosed as per standard clinical criteria.
Treatment Approach:
The patient's legal guardian provided informed consent for treatment after being counseled about fertility prognosis. The surgical intervention chosen was perineal vaginoplasty which involved several steps:
1. Vaginal Traction: The upper two-thirds of normally formed vagina were gently pulled downwards externally.
2. Subcutaneous Fixation: The traction allowed for subcutaneous fixation (suturing) in order to form a neo-introitus.
3. Incision and Dissection: A transverse incision through the existing vaginal cup removed fibrous masking material till normal tissues were reached.
4. Blood Drainage: Any collected blood from hematometrocolpos was drained.
5. Uterine Evaluation: Hysterometer insertion ensured uterine emptiness and normal bottom length.
6. Vaginal Mucosal Repair: The normal vaginal mucosa was repositioned and attached radially to the subcutaneous border with single points spaced 5 mm apart.
7. Probing and Re-epithelialization: Silicone vaginal probes lubricated with estrogen gel were used to keep the new introitus open until re-epithelialization of tissues occurred.
8. Post-operative Care: Cicatrisation was completed within four weeks, and counseling on sexual health was provided.
Outcome:
The patient experienced a remarkable improvement in symptoms, including regular menstrual cycles and diminished pelvic pain. This successful intervention resulted in an improved quality of life for the patient, who subsequently reported a satisfying sex life alongside achieving pregnancy and delivering a healthy baby boy.
Conclusion:
Perineal vaginoplasty is an effective surgical intervention for patients with congenital vaginal agenesis. This case report underscores the importance of early diagnosis, appropriate counseling on fertility prognosis, informed consent from legal guardians, meticulous surgical technique, diligent post-operative care, and comprehensive follow-up for optimal outcomes.
Ethical Considerations:
This case report has undergone ethics approval prior to publication. Written informed consent was obtained from both the patient (or her legal guardian) allowing participation in this publication as well as consenting to image usage. Copies of these consents are available upon request by the Editor-in-Chief.
Keywords: Congenital vaginal agenesis; hematometrocolpos; perineal vaginoplasty; reproductive health; case report Discussion:
Congenital vaginal agenesis, also known as MÃ¼llerian agenesis or Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, is a rare developmental disorder characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the vagina and uterus. The reported incidence of MRKH syndrome is approximately 1 in 4,500 female births.
The specific cause of MRKH syndrome is not fully understood but is believed to involve genetic and environmental factors. Mutations in several genes involved in embryonic development are thought to contribute to this condition. In most cases, MRKH syndrome occurs sporadically without any clear familial pattern; however, there have been some reports of familial clustering.
Clinically, patients with MRKH syndrome typically present with primary amenorrhea during adolescence due to the absence of menstrual bleeding. Most patients have normally functioning ovaries and secondary sexual characteristics. However, vaginal agenesis can lead to reproductive challenges such as infertility and difficulty with sexual intercourse.
In this case report, the patient presented with hematometrocolpos resulting from obstructed menstrual flow due to absent lower third segment of the vagina. Hematometrocolpos refers to blood collection within the uterus and upper portion of the vagina that results from menstrual blood unable to exit due to an obstruction.
To address both functional and psychological concerns associated with genital anomalies like MRKH syndrome, a multidisciplinary approach combining gynecology, psychology/psychiatry and fertility counseling is essential. Prioritizing patient education about their diagnosis along with establishing realistic expectations regarding fertility options play a crucial role in their overall care.
Perineal vaginoplasty has emerged as a reliable surgical intervention for patients with congenital vaginal agenesis who desire restoration of vaginal function for sexual activity or potential reproduction through assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) using gestational surrogacy or traditional surrogacy.
The perineal vaginoplasty technique described in this case involved traction of the upper two-thirds of normally formed vagina and subcutaneous fixation to create a neo-introitus. The removal of fibrous masking material, drainage of collected blood, and repositioning of normal vaginal mucosa not only resolved the hematometrocolpos but also allowed for improved sexual function.
Post-operative care involves maintaining vaginal patency during re-epithelialization. This is achieved by using silicone vaginal probes lubricated with estrogen gel, which helps prevent adhesions and promotes epithelial growth. Close follow-up after surgery is crucial to address any complications or concerns, ensure proper healing, and provide comprehensive support for psychosocial well-being.
The successful outcome presented in this case report underlines the effectiveness of perineal vaginoplasty as a treatment option for patients with congenital vaginal agenesis. Regular menstrual cycles and alleviation of pelvic pain suggest that fertility may be possible through assisted reproductive techniques such as IVF or surrogacy.
Moreover, the patient's reported satisfaction with her sex life highlights the positive impact such interventions can have on quality-of-life outcomes. The ability to experience pregnancy and childbirth further exemplifies how effective management can restore hope regarding family planning options in these individuals.
Conclusion:
Congenital vaginal agenesis represents a complex condition that requires integrated care involving gynecology, psychology/psychiatry counseling, fertility specialists, surgeons experienced in reconstructive techniques like perineal vaginoplasty, along with empathetic nursing support. By providing early diagnosis, thorough counseling on fertility prognosis based on individual circumstances, well-executed surgical interventions supplemented by optimal post-operative care including psychosocial support; healthcare professionals can significantly improve patients' overall wellbeing and reproductive outcomes within this clinical context.

This clinical case describes a patient presenting with a syndrome of inflammation and liver cytolysis. The laboratory findings suggest an elevated sedimentation rate (SV), fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as abnormal liver function tests. Furthermore, there are indications of hemophagocytosis on the myelogram.
The patient's blood work reveals significant inflammation, with an elevated sedimentation rate (SV) of 49 mm in the first hour and increased levels of fibrinogen (5.1 g/l) and CRP (86 mg/l). These markers indicate an ongoing inflammatory process in the body.
Liver enzymes are also elevated, including aspartate transaminase (ASAT) at 348 UI/L, alanine transaminase (ALAT) at 49 UI/L, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) at 96 UI/L, alkaline phosphatases at 158 UI/L, and total bilirubin at 59 mg/l. These findings suggest liver damage or dysfunction.
Other notable abnormalities include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels of 1234 UI/L, which can be indicative of tissue damage or increased cell turnover. Triglyceride levels are significantly elevated at 5.72 mmol/l; normal range is typically between 0.35-1.7 mmol/l. High triglyceride levels can be associated with various metabolic disorders.
Additionally, ferritinemia is raised to 2017 g/l; normal range is typically between 30-400 g/L). Elevated ferritin levels can occur during periods of systemic inflammation or as a result of conditions such as hemochromatosis.
To investigate for possible infectious causes that may contribute to these findings, extensive testing has been performed including blood cultures and serology for various pathogens such as herpesviruses (HSV1/2), parvovirus, varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus (HHV6/8). The results of these tests are negative, suggesting that an infectious cause is unlikely.
Further investigations into gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections were also performed with negative results on coprocultures and PCR testing.
The myelogram reveals numerous images of hemophagocytosis, which is the engulfment of blood cells by phagocytic cells in the bone marrow. This finding suggests the presence of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a severe and potentially life-threatening complication characterized by excessive immune system activation.
One week after admission, an axillary lymphadenopathy develops. It is described as a 1 cm x 1 cm solid, mobile mass that causes pain. Emergency removal of the lymphadenopathy was carried out, and subsequent examination revealed modified architecture along with infiltration by mononuclear inflammatory cells arranged in layers. A few giant cells are present along with fibrosis scattered throughout the pulp of the node. There are rare enlarged nucleus cells with prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm; this finding supports sclerodular lymph histiocyte disorder. Immunohistochemical staining further confirms this diagnosis by detecting positive anti-CD30 antibodies and MUM1 antigen but negative CD15 antibodies.
To determine disease extension since resources for a positron emission tomography (PET) scan are limited, a cervico-thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan is performed. This reveals involvement of mediastinal and left axillary lymph nodes along with hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen) that appears homogeneous on imaging studies alongside multiple effusions in body cavities such as pleural or peritoneal spaces.
Screening for viral hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is negative, indicating the absence of these viral infections. The patient also undergoes an echocardiography, which demonstrates a ejection fraction of 75%, indicating normal heart function.
For treatment, the patient receives four courses of dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg/day followed by ABVD chemotherapy regimen (doxorubicin, vinblastine, bleomycin, dacarbazine) for eight cycles. This results in partial remission. Subsequently, the patient undergoes ICE second-line chemotherapy protocol which consists of etoposide , holoxan , mesna , and carboplatin for four additional cycles with good response to treatment.
In conclusion, this clinical case reveals a complex presentation with evidence of systemic inflammation and liver dysfunction. The presence of hemophagocytosis on myelogram suggests macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Axillary lymphadenopathy biopsy confirms sclerodular lymph histiocyte disorder involvement in bone marrow infiltration. Imaging studies reveal widespread lymph node involvement as well as hepatosplenomegaly and multiple effusions. The patient has been treated with multiple courses of chemotherapy resulting in partial remission thus far. Close monitoring will be required to assess response to therapy and overall prognosis in this stage IVb sclerodular LH diagnosis. 
In this clinical case, a patient presented with several concerning symptoms and findings that required further investigation and management. The initial assessment showed that the patient did not have a fever (apyretic) but had evidence of metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap. Additionally, the patient had low potassium levels (hypokalaemia) and normal lactate levels. Despite absence of ketone bodies on urine dipstick test, the diagnosis of diabetes decompensation was made.
The first step in treatment involved conditioning the patient and implementing a hydration regimen to correct hypokalaemia along with insulin therapy for diabetes management. However, due to non-improvement in the patient's neurological condition, they were referred to intensive care for additional management.
Further investigations were performed to determine possible causes for the worsening neurological state. A brain scan revealed multiple parietal ischemic foci (areas of reduced blood supply), indicating potential cerebral issues that could be contributing to symptoms. A chest scanner also showed thickening of the septum (the wall between heart chambers) and bronchial dilation without signs of COVID-19 related lung infection. An abdominal ultrasound did not show any abnormalities.
Additional diagnostic tests were conducted including an electrocardiogram which showed no electrical signs of hypokalaemia or repolarization disturbances, as well as other imaging studies like transthoracic echocardiography (normal), and ultrasound examination of supraortic trunks (normal).
Laboratory findings included an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level indicating inflammation but negative procalcitonin levels ruling out serious bacterial infection. The white blood cell count was slightly raised with elevated neutrophils (PNN â polymorphonuclear neutrophils), low lymphocytes count within normal range, no thrombocytopenia or abnormalities in ferritin concentration or fibrinogen levels.
Importantly, testing for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs and COVID-19 serology (IgM and IgG) were both negative, indicating that COVID-19 infection was not the primary cause of the patient's symptoms.
Due to the presence of ischemic lesions in the brain scan, prophylactic anticoagulation, antiplatelet aggregation with aspirin, statins for cholesterol control and antibiotic therapy at a meningeal dose with ceftriaxone were initiated. Lumbar puncture was performed to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which showed elevated protein levels but normal glucose levels. Bacterial culture from CSF was negative after 24 hours of incubation.
On day 2 of admission, a cerebral magnetic resonance angiography showed signs suggesting vascular leukopathy (a condition affecting blood vessels in the brain), along with calcifications in basal ganglia (brain structures involved in movement control) and cortical atrophy. Electroencephalogram findings indicated epilepsy-like signs which led to the diagnosis of nonketotic hyperglycemia-related epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsant treatment with sodium valproate was started.
Despite efforts to correct metabolic acidosis and manage comorbidities, including intubation on day 3 of admission due to worsening neurological status, there was no progressive lesion observed on a cerebral computerized tomography scan.
As lymphopenia (reduced lymphocyte count) developed along with increased CRP levels, further tests were conducted. Multiplex RT-PCR performed on samples obtained from distal bronchial regions as well as CSF revealed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF confirmed its presence but had a high cycle threshold indicating low viral load. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 encephalopathy was made.
The patient remains in the intensive care unit, receiving ongoing medical care and support.
In summary, this clinical case presented a patient with various complex symptoms and findings. The initial diagnosis of diabetes decompensation was made despite the absence of ketone bodies. Further investigations revealed cerebral ischemic foci, signs of vascular leukopathy, and epileptic seizures. Although COVID-19 infection seemed unlikely at first due to negative RT-PCR and serology results, later testing confirmed SARS-CoV-2 presence in CSF with high CT values suggesting a low viral load. The management plan included anticoagulation therapy along with treatment for diabetes-related complications and encephalopathy caused by the virus. 
This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a giant sub-capsular hematoma in the liver, along with symptoms of fever, pain in the right hypochondrium (upper right abdomen), and altered blood laboratory test results. The incident was spontaneous and not caused by trauma or any underlying liver tumor.
The patient's initial physical examination showed a general condition scored WHO 2, indicating that they were moderately ill. Their blood pressure was 132/80 mm Hg, which is within the normal range, but their heart rate was elevated at 105 beats per minute. The patient also had a high temperature of 38.9Â°C.
During palpation of the right hypochondrium area, severe pain was reported by the patient. However, the remainder of their physical examination appeared to be normal.
The blood laboratory tests revealed several findings that were abnormal. Hemoglobin levels were at 10.1 g/dl, which is lower than the reference range for healthy individuals. The leukocyte count was significantly increased at 13,370 elm/ml (normal range: 4-11 x10^3 cells/Âµl), with predominantly polynuclear cells present (8,300 elm/ml). There was no lymphopenia observed (3,400 elm/ml). Platelet count came out to be at a normal level of 276 x10^3 cel/ÂµL.
Furthermore,his hepatic transaminase levels were slightly elevatedâ aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 76 IU/ml and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at72 IU/mlâindicating some degree of liver injury or dysfunction.Surprisingly,the hemostasis or clotting profile seemed unaffected;other coagulation parameters like prothrombin ratio,international normalized ratio(INR)and KCT(also known as PTT)were within their respective ranges.The absence
The patient had a prior abdominal computerized tomography (CT-scan) that was done nine days prior to admission, which confirmed the presence of a giant sub-capsular hematoma in the liver. The hematoma measured 136 mm x 80 mm and involved segments VI, VII, and VIII.
An abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed on the day of admission, confirmed the diagnosis. It showed that the hematoma was undergoing resorption but did not identify any traumatic or hepatic tumor pathology as an underlying cause for bleeding.
To treat this condition, ultrasound-guided drainage of the hematoma was performed using a G10 diameter nephrostomy drain under local anesthesia. During placement of the drain, 800 ml of blood was drained from the hematoma. Bacteriological study of this fluid did not show any bacterial contamination.
After drainage, an abdominal CT-scan was conducted on the first day to assess drain placement and consider its mobilization. However, radiological signs consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in lung cuts during this scan. A subsequent thoracic CT-scan revealed ground-glass opacities with moderate pulmonary involvement estimated between 15% and 20%. These findings suggested that along with their existing condition, such as severe hepatic hematomas;the patient also contracted a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Interestingly enough,during review of previous radiological examinations conducted at other facilities for managing their liver problem,SAME lung abnormalities were noted.But those scans' radiologists did NOT report these changes.Following these observations,a sample from their nasopharynx sent for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing came back positive for Gene N and Gene E-subtypes used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection.Thus,it seems that this patient had contracted COVID-19 without them noticing it before,due to lack/not properlyreported lung abnormalities in previous radiology scans.
In line with the national protocol,the treating team prescribed a combination of Azithromycin 500mg on the first day followed by 250 mg for the next four days,and Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg three times a day for ten days to tackle their COVID-19 infection. The patient's condition improved fairly quickly, with symptom drying up by day two and fever resolving on day three. Their general condition also improved following removal of the drain.
With uncomplicated progression, the patient was discharged on day seven from hospitalization. They were advised to continue self-isolation at home for another 14 days as per guidelines to ensure complete recovery and prevent further transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In summary, this clinical case describes an individual who was admitted with a spontaneous sub-capsular liver hematoma along with symptoms indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite involvement of a critical organ like liver in hematoma,the individual responded well to treatment aimed at managing both conditions and eventually showed favorable outcomes before being discharged.Definitely,this case highlights an interesting phenomenon where concomitant pathologies can occur without diagnosis or apparently asymptomatic state .Understanding such cases is crucial to provide comprehensive care as missing associations like herein may have led exclusionary diagnostic errors thus hampering timely management interventions or delaying containment strategies related to co-infections etc 
This clinical case involves a child who presented with several symptoms and was eventually diagnosed with a diaphragmatic hernia. Let's break down the case step by step:
On arrival, the child had oxygen saturation of 99%, a heart rate of 164 beats per minute, and a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius. The child had experienced a head injury and was initially seen by a paediatrician who requested consultation from a paediatric surgeon.
The paediatric surgery examination revealed that the child had no visible lesions on the head, normal eye pupil reactions to light, soft abdomen without signs of irritation, and absence of bowel sounds. However, there were intermittent peripheral acrocyanosis (bluish discoloration) observed.
Due to deterioration in the child's condition during examination, blood samples were taken and attempts were made to perform chest and abdominal x-rays. However, before this could happen, the mother accidentally breastfed the child which resulted in vomiting and loss of consciousness.
Without establishing a definite diagnosis due to lack of x-ray results, an anesthesiologist was called in for intubation as well as stabilization of vital signs. A CT scan of the entire body was performed due to unclear diagnostic focus from previous findings such as head injury possibility or undiagnosed heart disease or gut volvulus (intestinal twist).
The CT scan showed that almost all loops of gastrointestinal tract occupied the right chest cavity with thickening walls indicative of gastrointestinal issues which resulted in partial collapse (atelectasis) of portions within right lower lobe lung. The scan also revealed displacement and distortion within mediastinum blood vessels but no other abdominal organ abnormalities were found.
Based on these findings from CT scan images alone, it became clear that there was diaphragmatic hernia present. Thereafter, emergency measures were taken such as patient transfer to operation theater for exploratory laparotomy surgery after obtaining parental consent.
During surgery through a transverse incision in the right upper abdomen, a defect in the right diaphragm was found. The intestine, including small bowel and colon loops, were gently retracted back into the abdominal cavity through the defect. No signs of strangulation were noted.
While retracting abdominal viscera, approximately 150ml of serous (watery) pleural fluid was aspirated from the right thoracic cavity. A chest tube was inserted to allow for further drainage. The diaphragmatic defect was then closed according to Mayo technique and remaining bowel examined for any abnormalities.
The patient spent 5 days in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in stable condition after surgery. Bowel sounds returned on the second postoperative day and bowel movements occurred on the third day. Endotracheal tube cuff was deflated and extubation took place on same day as well.
During recovery at PICU, nasogastric tube feeding started without difficulties except for two episodes of vomiting over subsequent days. Chest tube removal took place on sixth postoperative day along with discontinuation of intravenous antibiotic administration using a second-generation cephalosporin.
A consultation with a pediatric cardiologist took place due to possible association between diaphragmatic hernias and other congenital anomalies detected during preoperative CT scan evaluation including coronary artery position discrepancies in this case.
At discharge on seventh postoperative day, general condition of the infant remained excellent with no wound infections or difficulty thriving reported even after outpatient follow-ups at 15 days, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months postoperatively.
As it stands now when this case is reported, this child has experienced full recovery from her operation without any medical problems associated with her surgical history thus far.
In summary: This clinical case involved a child who presented with head injury symptoms but was eventually diagnosed with a diaphragmatic hernia through CT scan images. The child underwent emergency surgery to correct the diaphragmatic defect and subsequently recovered well without any complications.
