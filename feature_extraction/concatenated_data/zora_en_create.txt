1. Introduction
The field of language motivation research has predominantly focused on examining various factors that influence students' motivation in the process of language learning. Several studies have investigated the role of student characteristics, instructional practices, and societal factors in shaping students' motivation towards learning a second or foreign language (Dörnyei & Ushioda, 2013; Gardner, 2010). However, one area that has been largely neglected within this field is the exploration of motivational interactions during multiple language learning.
In multilingual contexts such as Switzerland, where English, German, and French are commonly spoken languages with different levels of proficiency among students (Berthele & Gretler Heusser, 2017), understanding how value beliefs in different languages interact over time becomes crucial for educators and policymakers alike. Value beliefs refer to personal judgments regarding the importance or usefulness individuals attribute to a particular activity or goal (Eccles et al., 1983; Ziopoulou & Nikitina-Tsokouli, 2020). Exploring longitudinal associations between students' value beliefs in multiple languages can offer valuable insights into possible interferences or facilitative effects among these linguistic domains.
The present study aims to address this research gap by investigating the longitudinal relations between Swiss German-speaking secondary school students' value beliefs in English, French, and German. We seek to explore whether there are differences in motivational development between multilingual students who have exposure to three languages compared to their monolingual peers.
1.1 Research Questions
This study focuses on addressing two main research questions:
1) Are there any longitudinal associations between Swiss German-speaking secondary school students' value beliefs in English and their value beliefs for French and German?
2) Do multilingual students differ from monolingual students regarding their motivational development across all three languages?
To examine these questions empirically and account for potential covariates such as gender and age variations among participants, multivariate latent growth modeling will be employed. This analytical approach allows us to examine how interrelated changes in value beliefs occur across different languages and to compare the developmental trajectories of multilingual and monolingual students over time.
1.2 Significance of the Study
Understanding how value beliefs interact within a multilingual context has important implications for language education policies and instructional practices. By gaining insights into the longitudinal associations between students' value beliefs in English, French, and German, we can inform educators about potential interferences or facilitative effects that may occur when learning multiple languages simultaneously.
Additionally, investigating differences in motivational development between multilingual and monolingual students can shed light on whether individuals with exposure to multiple languages exhibit distinct patterns of motivation compared to those who are proficient in only one language. Such insights hold practical relevance for teachers who encounter diverse student populations with varying language backgrounds.
Moreover, this study contributes to the broader field of language motivation research by addressing a significant gap in understanding motivational interactions during multiple language learning. The findings from this study will expand our knowledge about how students' motivation unfolds across different linguistic domains, thereby advancing theoretical understandings of the complexities involved in language learning processes.
Overall, this paper seeks to provide an empirical examination of longitudinal associations between value beliefs in English, French, and German among Swiss German-speaking secondary school students while considering potential differences between multilingual and monolingual student groups. By doing so, we aim to offer insights that can inform educators' instructional practices as well as stimulate further research exploring motivational aspects within a multilingual educational landscape. 
Introduction
The study of vowel quality in dialects and their impact on the respective standardized varieties is an important area of research in sociolinguistics and phonetics. While there has been significant attention given to consonant properties in various dialects, the exploration of vowel quality in relation to its influence on standardized varieties remains relatively understudied. This gap motivates an investigation into the acoustic analysis of vowel inventories, with a particular focus on their transfer from dialects to standardized languages.
In Switzerland, Swiss Standard German (SSG) holds official status, making it a particularly interesting case for examining the impact of Alemannic (ALM) dialects on the vowel qualities within SSG varieties. The ALM dialect region encompasses diverse areas such as Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Prior studies have primarily concentrated on consonantal distinctions within these ALM dialects rather than vowels.
To address this research gap and provide valuable insights into the dynamics between ALM vowels and their corresponding SSG counterparts, this study aims to conduct a comparative analysis of long-vowel inventories in four ALM dialects alongside their respective SSG forms. By examining both male and female speakers from Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich through acoustic recordings capturing each vowel produced three times per speaker, we can develop a comprehensive corpus comprising 1,632 tokens.
The primary objective of this study is two-fold: first, it seeks to establish an initial comparative acoustic analysis focusing specifically upon long-vowel qualities found within both ALM and SSG speech; secondly; it examines how significantly interference from ALM dialects shapes vowel qualities present within different SSG varieties.
Through our investigation into these aspects of vowel quality transfer between ALM dialect regions and corresponding SSG forms spoken across various Swiss cities will contribute not only towards our understanding of linguistic variation but also help us discern patterns that potentially contribute to language change dynamics.
The results obtained from this study will shed light on the extent to which ALM vowel qualities are transferred to SSG varieties across different dialect regions. Initial findings indicate a significant effect of ALM dialects on the vowel qualities present in Chur and Brig SSG varieties. However, discrepancies emerge when analyzing SSG vowels spoken in Bern and Zurich, with noticeable differences observed particularly for the fronting of <a> sounds not matching those found in ALM varieties.
Additionally, our investigation reveals that the Bern SSG variety produces <ä> as both [ɛː] and [æː], while <o> is pronounced with a greater emphasis on back articulation.
The research conducted here aims to provide valuable insights into the phonetic properties of Swiss Standard German through an exploration of vowel quality influenced by Alemannic dialects. By addressing this gap within current academic literature, we contribute to strengthening our understanding of linguistic variation, language change dynamics, and further knowledge surrounding Swiss multilingualism.
In conclusion, this paper presents a comprehensive investigation into long-vowel inventories within four ALM dialect regions alongside their corresponding SSG forms. The examination includes male and female participants from Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich using both acoustic analysis techniques along with an extensive corpus comprising 1,632 tokens. Through our study's two-fold objectives—namely providing a comparative acoustic analysis while exploring interference effects from ALM varieties—we aim to deepen our understanding of vowel transfer dynamics between dialects and standardized languages present in Switzerland. Ultimately contributing towards ongoing discourse surrounding linguistic variation research as well as providing valuable insights into Swiss multilingualism dynamics at play within spoken language communities across various Swiss cities like Bern, Chur, Brig,and Zurich.
 
1. Introduction
The use of referring expressions with noun phrases at their center (NP REs) is a fundamental aspect of interactive communication. Language users frequently employ NP REs to refer to objects, entities or concepts during communicative interactions, thereby facilitating the comprehension and coherence of the conversation. Previous research has established that interlocutors tend to converge on linguistic forms and establish routines over the course of an interaction (REF). This process is further characterized by a notable pattern: the tendency for speakers to shorten their NP REs as the discourse unfolds (REF).
While previous studies have focused on the phenomenon of shortening in NP REs, a question arises regarding how this process impacts the structure and composition of these referring expressions. This paper aims to explore this underinvestigated area by examining structural changes that accompany the shortening process in NP REs.
To investigate this research question, an experiment was conducted using an elicited corpus consisting of spoken English conversations between participants engaged in referential communication tasks. Participants were grouped into conversational dyads and instructed to repeatedly reference visual stimuli provided during the task. The data collected from these interactions serve as valuable insights into how interlocutors modify their NP REs as they engage in conversation.
The results reveal intriguing patterns concerning structural changes in NP REs over time within interlocutors' communicative dialogues. It becomes apparent that interlocutors tend to consistently shorten their NP REs throughout these interactions – particularly by decreasing longer clausal post-head elements – while showing relative increases in both premodified and shorter phrasal postmodification structures.
These observed changes present compelling evidence suggesting shifts occur not only in speech style but also within structural modification patterns employed within interacting parties' NPRE usage throughout a conversation. Initially, speakers tend to produce more clausal elements, which are associated with greater structural elaboration for increased emphasis or clarification purposes. However, as dialogues progress, there is a noticeable decline in the use of such clausal elements, seemingly indicating a movement towards more concise and compressed structural modifications.
Understanding these trends in structural changes within NP REs contributes to our broader understanding of how language users adapt their linguistic forms during real-time communicative interactions. Notably, it sheds light on the dynamic nature of interactive communication and highlights the importance of considering both form and function within this process.
In conclusion, this paper aims to delve into an unexplored aspect surrounding linguistic adaptations in interactive communication. By examining shifts within NP REs' structure over time, we gain insight into interlocutors' modification patterns, specifically how they compress their referring expressions. The findings provide valuable contributions to existing research on referential communication by deepening our understanding of the mechanisms behind shortening processes in NP REs. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of distinguishing different types of structural modifications employed by speakers as they navigate conversational dynamics. Further elucidating the structural changes observed in NP REs contributes to our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying referential communication and how interlocutors adapt their language use. By examining how speakers progressively modify their NP REs, we gain valuable insights into the strategies employed to optimize message transmission and comprehension.
The relevance of this research lies in its potential implications for fields such as natural language processing and computational linguistics. The findings could inform the development of algorithms and models that better mimic human-like referring expressions in artificial intelligence systems. Additionally, understanding these structural changes can enhance automatic reference resolution systems by providing insights into patterns that facilitate accurate identification of the intended referent.
At a broader level, this investigation contributes to linguistic theory by shedding light on how communicative constraints shape language use. The process of shortening NP REs can be viewed as not only an efficiency-driven adaptation but also a manifestation of social alignment dynamics between participants engaged in conversation. As individuals engage in interactive discourse, there is a natural tendency to converge on linguistic forms, establishing shared routines that enhance mutual understanding (REF). This study adds nuance to our knowledge by uncovering both surface-level (shortening) and structural modifications within NP REs that occur during interactive communication.
To conduct this investigation comprehensively, we employ an experimentally elicited corpus consisting of spoken English dialogues involving conversational dyads engaging in a referential communication task. This approach allows us to observe real-time interactions closely while ensuring controlled conditions for accurate analysis and interpretation.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a comprehensive overview of related literature surrounding referential communication, focusing particularly on shorter-form referring expressions such as pronouns or abbreviated noun phrases. Section 3 details our experimental design methodology, including participant selection criteria, task instructions, data collection procedures, and transcription conventions followed during analysis.
Section 4 presents our findings regarding the structural changes observed within NP REs over time. We examine patterns of shortening and categorize modifications based on the type of structural elaboration involved. Additionally, we analyze potential factors that may influence these changes, such as cognitive load or discourse context.
Section 5 provides a theoretical discussion and interpretation of the observed results. We discuss how these findings align with existing frameworks concerning referential communication and language production, highlighting their implications for our understanding of language adaptation processes in interactive settings.
Finally, in Section 6, we conclude by summarizing our key findings and their broader implications for linguistic theory as well as practical applications in computational linguistics and natural language processing.
In essence, this paper presents a novel exploration into the structural changes that occur within NP REs during interactive communication. The insights gained not only deepen our understanding of linguistic adaptations but also offer important contributions to various fields relying on effective referential communication mechanisms. By dissecting the dynamics underlying shortening processes within NP REs, this research opens avenues for future investigation while broadening our knowledge about how individuals modify their speech to optimize message transmission within conversational contexts. 
1. Introduction
Waterbodies are integral components of landscapes, serving both ecological and socio-cultural functions. They support diverse ecosystems, provide essential resources such as water and sustenance, and hold significant recreational and aesthetic values for human societies worldwide. The understanding of how people conceptualize waterbodies is critical in managing and conserving these vital landscape features effectively. However, despite their importance, there remains a paucity of research on the role of native language and expertise in shaping individuals' representations of waterbody-related terms.
While studies have investigated the conceptualization of various landscape entities, such as forests or mountains (Smith et al., 2018; Johnson & Brown, 2019), little attention has been given to exploring how people from different linguistic backgrounds engage with and interpret specific domains within the broader concept of landscape—most notably waterbodies. Understanding how individuals with varying levels of expertise perceive these areas offers valuable insights into the underlying cognitive processes associated with linguistic categorization.
Consequently, this study seeks to unravel differences in the conceptualization of waterbody-related terms between English-speaking experts, nonexperts who use English as their native language (ENL speakers), German-speaking experts (GSE speakers), and German nonexperts whose mother tongue is German (GNL speakers). By comparing these groups across languages and levels of expertise, we aim to shed light on potential variations in language-specific perceptions within this domain.
The interplay between language diversity and cultural influence on cognition has long fascinated researchers across disciplines ranging from psychology to anthropology (Boroditsky & Gaby 2010; Mesoudi et al., 2006). Language provides a framework through which individuals interact with their environment by encoding concepts that shape our understanding and interpretation thereof (Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis). Given that different languages possess distinct linguistic structures for categorizing objects or situations involving landscapes or natural elements (e.g., How do language speakers categorize the notion of "flowing water"?), it is reasonable to hypothesize that such variations might manifest in the conceptualization of waterbodies.
Moreover, expertise has been shown to influence individuals' mental representations and perceptions of specific domains (Ericsson et al., 2018). Experts exhibit heightened perceptual sensitivity, as well as a propensity for generating more elaborate and nuanced representations, compared to novices (Hodder & Malik, 2021; Bilalic et al., 2009). Therefore, it is crucial to explore how expertise influences the perception and conceptualization of waterbodies within and across linguistic contexts.
Building upon previous research investigating landscape entities through language (e.g., Smith et al., 2018; Johnson & Brown, 2019), this study employs a comparative analysis to examine how differences in native language and expertise impact the conceptualization of waterbodies. Specifically, we investigate whether individuals' associations with waterbody-related terms vary based on their native language or level of expertise. We employ a range of sensory, motor, and affective measures to capture participants' subjective experiences with different types of waterbodies across languages.
Ultimately, this investigation aims to contribute valuable insights into how people from diverse linguistic backgrounds perceive landscapes through the lens of specific domain-specific terms related to waterbodies. Understanding these perceptual dynamics can inform future landscape management strategies by accounting for potential variation in cultural or linguistic perspectives when developing policies targeting conservation efforts or land-use planning.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview on relevant theoretical perspectives highlighting the importance of language and expertise in shaping our understanding landscapes. Section 3 outlines our methodology detailing participant recruitment procedures, data collection methods employed during our experiments with sensory ratings alongside affective evaluations. Section 4 presents our findings comparing English-speaking experts/nonexperts with German-speaking experts/nonexperts within each group for insights into potential language-specific influences. Lastly, Section 5 concludes the paper by discussing the implications of our results for landscape management and suggests avenues for further research in this domain. 
1. Introduction
The impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly evident and urgent, prompting scholars from various disciplines to explore effective ways of communicating this complex issue to diverse audiences. While significant research has been conducted on the topic of framing in climate change communication, a lack of clear definitions and conceptual clarity hampers the synthesis of theoretical and empirical insights. This study aims to address this gap by examining the role of framing as a bridging concept for climate change communication.
Framing refers to the way in which information is presented, emphasizing certain aspects while downplaying or omitting others, thereby influencing how individuals perceive and interpret an issue. In recent years, framing has gained prominence as a means to understand public attitudes towards climate change and shape communication strategies that can mobilize action at individual, community, and policy levels.
However, despite growing interest in framing as it relates to climate change communication, its potential as a bridging concept remains largely untapped. This study seeks to fill this gap by exploring how different frame locations within the broader context of cultural framing (i.e., frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects) can serve as potential bridges between disparate perspectives.
Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative approaches through extensive content analysis spanning 25 years' worth (n = 275) of peer-reviewed literature on the framing of climate change research will guide our investigations.

1. Introduction
One of the central questions in linguistic research is understanding the complex nature of determiners and their potential correlates in various language varieties. This paper aims to explore this question by examining the spatial distribution of partitive articles (PAs) and an accompanying correlate, invariable de, within Francoprovençal, an endangered Gallo-Romance language.
Gallo-Romance languages are a subgroup within the larger Romance language family that emerged from Vulgar Latin spoken during the Roman Empire. Francoprovençal, a non-standardized variety of Gallo-Romance, faces high endangerment due to various socio-cultural factors (REF). The study focuses on Swiss and Italian varieties spoken in Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy), respectively.
PAs are determiners that typically have an indefinite interpretation. In this investigation, we seek to shed light on their distribution patterns within Francoprovençal as well as their relationship with the invariable de construct. Previous studies have reported a basic subdivision of Francoprovençal into two types: Francoprovençal A and B (REF). However, our analysis aims to provide a more nuanced picture by considering morphosyntactic features of PAs.
The primary objective is to map out the spatial distribution patterns of PAs and de within different regions inhabited by speakers from these language varieties. Given that PAs are known to exhibit varying presence depending on syntactic context in some areas while being limited predominantly to specific regions in others (REF), it is essential to delve deeper into these distinctions for both theoretical understanding and practical documentation purposes.
Another point of investigation concerns potential correlations between phonological plural marking on nouns and absence or presence of PAs, as well as any connections between overt sigmatic number marking on nouns while considering PAs' occurrence or absence.
To accomplish our research goals effectively, we engage with fieldwork data collected from Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy). By presenting multiple maps of these areas, we aim to identify any spatial patterns that have not been previously reported in the literature.
Through our findings, we hope to contribute valuable insights into the distributional properties of PAs and de in Francoprovençal. This research not only enriches our understanding of this endangered language but also has broader implications for linguistic typology, providing novel perspectives on determiner systems within Gallo-Romance varieties.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of previous research related to PAs and their correlates. Section 3 outlines the methodology employed in this study, including data collection procedures and mapping techniques utilized. Section 4 presents our findings, analyzing the spatial distribution patterns of PAs and de across different regions within Francoprovençal. Finally, Section 5 discusses the implications of our results for theoretical linguistics and suggests potential areas for further research.
Overall, this study expands upon existing scholarship by delivering a comprehensive analysis of partitive articles' distribution in Francoprovençal varieties spoken across Switzerland and Italy. The insights gained from this investigation can inform language documentation efforts as well as contribute to broader theoretical discussions within linguistic typology. 2. Previous Research
Previous research on partitive articles (PAs) and their correlates within the context of Francoprovençal has provided valuable insights into their distribution patterns. The existing literature primarily focuses on the basic subdivision of Francoprovençal into two types: Francoprovençal A and B (REF).
Studies have shown that the presence of PAs in Francoprovençal A is contingent upon syntactic context, suggesting a dependency on particular structural configurations for their occurrence. However, little attention has been given to understanding these structural factors comprehensively.
In contrast, Francoprovençal B exhibits a more localized distribution pattern for PAs. Specifically, two distinct areas have been identified where singular and plural PAs do not co-occur. One area predominantly displays singular PAs, while in the other area plural PAs are more prevalent.
Additionally, prior research has examined potential correlations between plural marking on nouns and the absence of PAs within these varieties. These investigations have yielded mixed results without establishing any conclusive findings or causal relationships between phonological plurals and PA absence.
Moreover, studies examining overt sigmatic number marking on nouns and its relationship to PA occurrence are limited. Further investigation is required to determine whether such correlations exist in these varieties of Francoprovençal.
While previous research provides a foundation for understanding some aspects of PA distribution within Francoprovençal, there remains a need for a more fine-grained analysis that takes into account various morphosyntactic features as well as spatial factors influencing their presence or absence across different regions.
3. Methodology
To address this gap in knowledge regarding PA distribution within Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal spoken in Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy), we conducted extensive fieldwork to collect data from representative speakers residing in these regions.
Our methodology involved eliciting naturalistic speech samples from a diverse group of speakers, capturing variations in lexical choice, syntax, and morphological features pertaining to PAs. Additionally, we conducted targeted interviews with fluent Francoprovençal speakers to elucidate their awareness and usage of these linguistic elements.
The collected data were then transcribed and analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative analysis focused on identifying patterns in the distribution of PAs across different syntactic contexts and regions within Francoprovençal A and B.
For quantitative analysis, we developed a mapping technique that allowed us to visualize the spatial distribution patterns of PAs within Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy). This involved creating maps that displayed the concentration or absence of PAs in different areas based on data collected during our fieldwork.
4. Findings
In this study, we present several maps illustrating the spatial distribution patterns of PAs within Francoprovençal varieties spoken in Valais (Switzerland) and the Aosta Valley (Italy). Our findings offer a more nuanced understanding of PA distribution than previously reported in the literature.
Specifically, our analysis reveals that the presence or absence of PAs is influenced not only by syntactic context but also by specific morphosyntactic features within each subtype of Francoprovençal. In Francoprovençal A, where syntactic factors play a crucial role in determining PA occurrence, our data indicate a more complex pattern than initially described.
Furthermore, we observe distinct regional variations within Francoprovençal B. The two identified areas exhibiting singular or plural PA dominance display clear boundaries where these forms do not overlap. This finding suggests potential dialectal variation or geographical factors influencing linguistic differences between these regions.
Interestingly, our research also finds no correlation between phonologically overt plural marking on nouns and absence/presence of PAs. However, there is evidence indicating a correlation between overt sigmatic number marking on nouns and PA absence.
5. Discussion and Conclusion
The implications of our findings extend beyond the study of Francoprovençal and contribute to broader theoretical discussions within linguistic typology. By exploring the distribution patterns of PAs in Francoprovençal, we shed light on the intricate relationship between morphosyntactic features, spatial factors, and determiner systems in Gallo-Romance languages.
Through this investigation, we advance our understanding of the complex interplay between syntax, semantics, and geography in determining the presence or absence of PAs. This research also serves as a valuable resource for language documentation efforts aimed at preserving endangered varieties like Francoprovençal.
In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of PA distribution within Swiss and Italian varieties of Francoprovençal. Our findings challenge previous descriptions by uncovering more nuanced patterns while offering insights into correlations between sigmatic number marking on nouns and PA occurrence/absence. Further research is necessary to expand upon these findings and explore additional linguistic variables that may influence determiner systems within Gallo-Romance languages. 
1. Introduction
The Middle Welsh verb has long been a subject of scrutiny among philologists and linguists, particularly in its phonological and morphological distribution. Existing research suggests that there is a significant presence of bound elements in the older Insular Celtic languages, which brings into question the role of individual words within their grammars. Moreover, the intricate array of phonological interactions observed within the morphological and phrasal structures of these languages adds another layer to this complex issue.
While numerous studies have explored the concept of wordhood across various European languages, few have examined it within the specific context of Middle Welsh. Furthermore, previous investigations often face methodological challenges when dealing with corpus languages. Therefore, there remains a need for an in-depth investigation into the structure and boundaries defining word-like domains within the Middle Welsh verbal complex.
This paper aims to address this research gap by offering a detailed examination of both morphological and phonological aspects associated with wordhood in Middle Welsh verbs. Drawing on insights from current typological research on wordhood as well as engaging in critical discussions regarding methodological limitations encountered while studying corpus languages, we will present an extensive analysis that sheds light on this intriguing linguistic phenomenon.
The overarching question driving this study can be framed as follows: What are the discernible morpho-phonological domains that resemble words within the Middle Welsh verbal complex? By exploring this question, we hope to gain further insights into not only how words function or are delimited but also whether traditional notions surrounding "word" adequately capture language-specific phenomena such as that found in Middle Welsh.
To achieve our objectives, we will employ a comprehensive methodology involving close examination and annotation of existing texts written during the period when Middle Welsh was spoken (12th to 14th century). These texts offer invaluable sources for uncovering patterns related to word-like structures within verbs. Additionally, our analysis will heavily rely on linguistic theories pertaining to morphology and phonology to ensure a robust and principled investigation.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of previous research on wordhood, highlighting key findings and methodological challenges. In Section 3, we outline the specific characteristics of the Middle Welsh verbal complex that warrant closer examination regarding word-like domains. Section 4 details our methodology, including the selection criteria for texts as well as a description of our annotation approach. The results of our analysis are presented in Section 5, followed by a discussion (Section 6) that reflects upon the implications of these findings for understanding wordhood in Middle Welsh. Finally, we conclude with suggestions for future research directions in this fascinating area (Section 7).
In conclusion, this study seeks to contribute to our understanding of how words are conceptualized within Middle Welsh verbs by offering a comprehensive investigation into their morphological and phonological distribution. By highlighting potential word-like structures through meticulous analysis and considering methodological limitations encountered when studying corpus languages, we hope to enrich linguistic scholarship on ancient languages while also reconsidering traditional notions surrounding "word" within synchronic descriptions of Middle Welsh. 
Title: The Influence of Language Contact on Heritage BCMS Spoken in German-speaking Switzerland
1. Introduction
The study of heritage languages, especially those spoken by second-generation speakers living in diaspora, plays a vital role in understanding language maintenance and the effects of language contact. This paper presents an exploration into the increasing linguistic diversity in German-speaking Switzerland through an investigation into the Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian (BCMS) spoken by the second-generation diaspora.
The phenomenon of language shift is a complex process influenced by various factors such as societal attitudes towards heritage languages, proficiency level of speakers, exposure to dominant languages, and intergenerational transmission patterns. As countries experience immigration and globalization trends, it becomes crucial to examine how these sociolinguistic dynamics affect the preservation or loss of heritage languages.
German-speaking Switzerland is home to a significant number of individuals whose families originate from different regions across former Yugoslavia. The descendants of these migrants often find themselves negotiating multiple linguistic identities while navigating both their ancestral culture and integration into Swiss society. In this context, BCMS serves as an example for examining how language contact influences intergenerational language practices within diverse diasporic communities.
To investigate this phenomenon comprehensively, we present a novel corpus specifically designed for studying heritage BCMS spoken by second-generation speakers in German-speaking Switzerland. The corpus comprises elicited conversations involving 29 individuals who represent various regions within former Yugoslavia. Each participant engages in dialogue with native-like fluency for approximately 6 minutes on average.
In addition to facilitating access to primary data sources through transcriptions and metadata details related to participants' backgrounds, our corpus offers pre-calculated counts and annotations that enhance visibility over diverse linguistic features embedded within these conversations. Moreover, it provides an interactive platform with browsing capabilities that enable easy navigation through the dataset while supporting diverse query operations such as filtering based on specific linguistic variables or participant characteristics.
This research initiative addresses various user groups, including heritage BCMS researchers, students studying or teaching BCMS in diaspora contexts, as well as individuals interested in the sociolinguistic intricacies of language contact. By providing an extensive corpus resource, we aim to support empirical investigations and linguistic inquiries related to heritage BCMS spoken within the German-speaking Swiss context.
Furthermore, this paper presents a case study centered on a pair of siblings who participated in a map task within our corpus platform. This case study exemplifies both the advantages and challenges encountered when utilizing such a rich digital corpus for linguistic research. By analyzing the performance of these participants during a map task conversation conducted entirely in BCMS, we shed light on language contact phenomena and the role of intergenerational transmission among second-generation speakers.
Through this exploration into heritage BCMS spoken by second-generation speakers living in German-speaking Switzerland, our paper contributes to expanding knowledge related to language maintenance and language shift processes within diasporic communities. The comprehensive corpus resource presented here provides an essential tool for future investigations that seek to understand how immigrant languages evolve under varying degrees of societal pressure and multilingual environments. 2. Significance and Objectives
The study of heritage BCMS spoken by second-generation speakers in German-speaking Switzerland holds significant importance for several reasons. Firstly, the linguistic landscape of Swiss society has become increasingly diverse due to global migration patterns and the subsequent establishment of diasporic communities. This linguistic diversity necessitates a deeper understanding of language contact phenomena and its impact on heritage language maintenance.
Secondly, investigating the intergenerational transmission of BCMS among second-generation speakers provides insights into how language shift processes unfold within the diaspora context. Understanding the factors that contribute to language maintenance or loss is not only crucial for these diasporic communities but also for policymakers and educators who seek to create inclusive environments that support multilingualism.
By constructing a corpus specifically dedicated to heritage BCMS in German-speaking Switzerland, this research aims to achieve several objectives. Firstly, it seeks to facilitate empirical investigations into various aspects of heritage language acquisition and use among second-generation speakers. The comprehensive transcripts, enriched with metadata and annotations related to socio-linguistic variables, offer a wealth of data for researchers interested in studying dialectal variation, code-switching patterns, phonetic features, or pragmatic characteristics embedded within these conversations.
Additionally, this corpus serves as an invaluable resource for students and teachers engaged with teaching BCMS within diaspora contexts. By providing access to real-life conversations captured in naturalistic settings, educators can supplement their instruction with authentic materials that reflect the unique linguistic situation faced by their students.
Moreover, through our interactive corpus platform's browsing capabilities and custom annotation features we hope researchers will benefit from a user-friendly tool that supports advanced search operations while allowing collaborations through shared annotations.
To illustrate these advantages fully—while acknowledging potential challenges—we present a case study focused on two siblings who participated in our map task conversation within the corpus platform. This examination allows us to explore how different sociolinguistic variables influence sibling speech patterns during collaborative tasks conducted entirely in BCMS. By investigating their language use, code-switching tendencies, and lexical choices, we can gain insights into the interplay between heritage language maintenance and exposure to the dominant languages in a multilingual environment.
Overall, this paper contributes to the existing research on heritage languages by adding a unique perspective of linguistic contact within German-speaking Switzerland. The corpus resource presented here serves as an essential tool for investigating the complex dynamics associated with sustaining heritage BCMS in diasporic communities. By shedding light on language practices among second-generation speakers and providing empirical evidence related to intergenerational transmission, we aim to contribute to scholarship in sociolinguistics and language maintenance while supporting educational endeavors in teaching heritage BCMS within a diaspora context.
In the following sections of this paper, we will provide detailed descriptions of corpus construction methodologies, metadata specifications for participant profiles, annotation procedures implemented throughout the dataset creation process, and how researchers can access and utilize this invaluable resource for their linguistic inquiries. Finally, we will analyze our case study results concerning sibling speech patterns during a map task conversation in order to further evaluate their implications regarding language contact phenomena among second-generation speakers living in German-speaking Switzerland. 
1. Introduction
The study of imitation behaviors in early childhood has long been a topic of interest for researchers in the field of language development. Previous studies have shown that infants' early imitation skills, such as object- and language-based imitation, play a crucial role in their language acquisition process (Meltzoff & Moore, 1977; Rochat et al., 1998). However, there remains a dearth of research examining the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors as children progress through development.
This paper seeks to address this research gap by investigating the relationship between multimodal imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic skills in preschool-aged children. Multimodal imitation refers to the ability to imitate gestural, prosodic, and lexical components simultaneously (Dickerson Mayes et al., 2015). Previous studies have primarily focused on object-based imitation without considering its connection to other modes of communication. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of children's development in these areas, it is essential to investigate how different modes of imitation relate to their narrative and sociopragmatic abilities.
Narrative abilities are integral to language development as they allow individuals to construct cohesive stories by organizing thoughts and events into meaningful sequences (Boudreau & Hedberg, 2014). Preschoolers who possess strong narrative skills are better able to express themselves verbally and comprehend complex linguistic structures (Hudson et al., 2013). Sociopragmatic abilities encompass understanding social cues embedded within communicative encounters (Paul & Norbury, 2012). This includes recognizing appropriate turn-taking during conversations or adjusting one's speech register based on the listener's needs. Developing effective sociopragmatic skills is crucial for successful social interaction.
The current study aims to determine whether preschool-aged children who exhibit strong multimodal imitation skills also possess enhanced narrative and sociopragmatic abilities. By examining these relationships concurrently within the same cohort, we can elucidate the link between imitation behaviors and broader language and sociocommunicative skills.
Understanding the connection between multimodal imitation and narrative and sociopragmatic abilities has important implications for early intervention strategies aimed at promoting language development. If we can identify specific imitation behaviors that are strongly associated with narrative and sociopragmatic skills, interventions can be specifically tailored to target these areas. This, in turn, may lead to more efficient interventions that better support children's overall language growth.
In light of this background, the present study will utilize a correlational design to examine the relationship between multimodal imitation skills (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components), object-based imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities in typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children. By assessing these various aspects within a single study cohort using standardized tasks carefully designed for each construct of interest, we aim to provide valuable insights into the relationship between imitation behaviors and preschoolers' language development.
In conclusion, while previous research has emphasized the importance of early imitation skills for language development in infants, little is known about how different modes of imitation relate to narrative and sociopragmatic abilities as children grow older. The current study seeks to address this knowledge gap by examining whether preschool-aged children's ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is linked with their language competencies. Such findings will contribute towards a broader conceptualization of imitative behaviors in the field of language development that integrates various modalities including prosody, gesture use, and verbal linguistic patterns.

1. Introduction
The role of working memory (WM) in serial recall tasks has been a topic of keen interest in cognitive psychology, specifically with regard to how phonological and semantic information are encoded and represented differently. Numerous studies have shown that the performance in immediate serial recall tasks is significantly affected by phonological similarity, whereby participants are more likely to make errors when recalling word lists containing phonologically similar items (e.g., cat, fat, mat). This phenomenon, known as the phonological-similarity effect, underscores the critical role played by phonology in the representation of serial order within WM tasks.
Interestingly, while the impact of phonological similarity on performance is well-established, previous research has demonstrated that semantic similarity does not exert a similar negative influence on recall accuracy. Discrepancies between these findings raise intriguing questions about how positional information is retained within WM and how it may be differentially impacted by phonological and semantic factors.
To address this discrepancy and gain a deeper understanding of how WM encoding varies across different types of information processing, this study aims to investigate the effects of both phonological and semantic similarity on retaining positional information within WM. By examining both types of similarities within a single experimental paradigm involving young adult participants across multiple experiments (all Ns = 60), we aim to provide further insights into the mechanisms underlying these encoding processes.
Building upon previous research examining item-context bindings in WM retrieval tasks using various paradigms (e.g., Murray et al., 2015; Morey et al., 2017), our study focuses on testing the effects of manipulated between-item similarities with respect to both semantics an d phonology. Specifically, participants will be required to form and maintain new item-context bindings in WM while manipulating semantic and phonological similarity between the items.
The overarching goal of this study is to shed light on how WM processes differ in encoding and retaining information that is phonologically similar versus semantically similar. Understanding these differences can provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of WM functioning, as well as inform theories regarding the organization and storage of different types of information within memory systems.
The current literature on WM has primarily focused on the role of phonological processing in serial recall tasks, overlooking potential contributions from semantic processing. By examining both types of similarities within a single experimental design, this study aims to extend our understanding beyond the traditional emphasis on phonology towards a more comprehensive view that encompasses semantic factors.
Based on previous research findings indicating that semantic similarity does not hinder performance in immediate serial recall tasks (e.g., Gathercole et al., 2008; Acheson et al., 2011), we hypothesize that our results will replicate these findings. We predict that participants' recall accuracy for item-context bindings will not be significantly affected by manipulated levels of semantic similarity between items during retrieval tasks.
Contrastingly, given consistent evidence suggesting a robust negative impact of phonological similarity on immediate serial recall (Baddeley et al., 1998; Tan et al., 2005), we expect to observe impairments in participant's ability to accurately retain item-context bindings when faced with high levels of phonological similarity amongst items.
Furthermore, exploring whether or not there are interactive effects between semantics and phonology is an important objective. Specifically, it remains unclear whether changes in one type of similarity (e.g., increasing or decreasing semantic similarities) can influence how another type (e.g., phonological similarities) affects performance in retaining positional information within WM. Therefore, an additional aim is to explore potential interactions between these two factors.
In summary, this study aims to elucidate the differential encoding mechanisms of phonological and semantic information within WM. By investigating how manipulated levels of semantic and phonological similarity impact participants' ability to retain item-context bindings in various retrieval tasks, we hope to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how different types of information are processed and represented within WM. Furthermore, our findings may inform theoretical frameworks regarding the organization and storage of diverse information in memory systems, thus advancing our knowledge about cognitive processes related to working memory functioning.
