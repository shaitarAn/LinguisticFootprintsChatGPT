The introduction of this Zora article begins by discussing the importance of being fluent in multiple foreign languages, particularly in Europe. The author mentions that teaching foreign languages alongside English as a global language poses a challenge, as learning English can negatively affect students' motivation to learn other languages. This phenomenon appears to be common across Europe, as multiple studies have found that students typically report lower value beliefs and motivation for languages other than English.
The introduction then highlights the need for more research on the longitudinal relations between students' motivation for multiple languages. It is noted that individual differences exist in students' motivational beliefs depending on factors such as gender, language background, and experience with learning several languages at home.
To address these gaps in knowledge, the present study focuses on upper secondary students' academic language learning in Switzerland—a historically multilingual country. The unique linguistic context of Switzerland provides an opportunity to understand how students' prior linguistic knowledge may be related to their motivation to learn several languages.
The study specifically investigates the longitudinal relationship between Swiss German students' value beliefs in English (a foreign language), French (a foreign but national language), and German (the native language) from Grades 9 to 11. The researchers also explore potential relations between the development of value beliefs and students' linguistic background (monolingual vs. multilingual).
To delve deeper into the understanding of motivation for learning new languages, the study draws upon the concept of value beliefs—i.e., how much value individuals attribute to engaging in a certain task or activity. Value beliefs are considered particularly important for predicting language learning motivation.
The introduction mentions some commonly used models—socioeducational model, self-determination theory, second-language motivational self-system (L2MSS), and expectancy-value theory—and their shared focus on differentiating between motivational beliefs arising from within individuals or influenced by external factors like parental influence.
Expectancy-value theory is highlighted as it suggests that a student's value beliefs, such as intrinsic value (personal interest or enjoyment) and attainment value (personal importance of doing well), can predict their learning approach and strategies. The article also notes that studies based on expectancy-value theory have found positive correlations between students' value beliefs and persistence, intention to continue learning a new language, and achievement.
Regarding the development of value beliefs over time, the introduction points out that numerous studies grounded in expectancy-value theory have observed an average decline in students' value beliefs across academic domains—particularly during late childhood and adolescence. It is also mentioned that some studies have identified different longitudinal relations between value facets in various academic subjects.
However, it is noted that there is still a gap in educational research regarding whether and how certain value beliefs may interact with each other over time and across multiple language subjects.
Overall, the introduction sets the stage for the study by highlighting the importance of understanding students' motivation for learning multiple languages, specifically within the context of Switzerland. It also introduces key theoretical frameworks and identifies gaps in previous research that this study aims to address. 
The introduction of this Zora article provides an overview of the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland, specifically focusing on the concept of "diglossia." Diglossia refers to a situation where two distinct varieties of a language are used in different contexts.
In this case, the two context-dependent varieties used in German-speaking Switzerland are Alemannic dialects (referred to as Swiss German or Mundart) for oral communication, and Swiss Standard German (SSG or Schriftdeutsch) for written communication. The author states that while everyone in German-speaking Switzerland is a native speaker of a local dialect, SSG is learned at school. It is worth noting that both ALM and SSG can be used to some extent in each other's domain, and Swiss people tend to code-switch between the two languages quickly.
The article mentions that contact between these two varieties is inevitable, leading to interferences on various linguistic levels such as phonetics, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary. However, when it comes specifically to vowels—the focus of this study—there have been limited acoustic studies on ALM dialects while more research exists on SSG vowels based on acoustic measurements.
The current study aims to systematically investigate the vowel qualities of four ALM dialects (from Bern [BE], Chur [GR], Brig [VS], and Zurich [ZH]) as well as their respective SSG varieties using an instrumental phonetic approach. The goal is to provide a comparative acoustic analysis of long vowels produced by speakers from these regions. An important aspect researchers want to understand is how much influence speakers' dialect has on determining SSG vowel qualities.
Before delving into the research questions and hypotheses guiding this study, the article briefly describes ALM dialects and SSG variations spoken in German-speaking Switzerland. It highlights three subgroups within ALM: Low ALM found only in Basel city; High ALM comprising northern half dialects; and Highest ALM spoken in the alpine southern half of German-speaking Switzerland.
The division between High and Highest ALM is defined by several isoglosses, linguistic phenomena that create geographical boundaries for specific language features. For instance, one famous isogloss studied here is hiatus diphthongisation, which refers to the development of a diphthong in Old High German (OHG) hiatus positions in the northern half (High ALM), while the southern half (Highest ALM) maintains a monophthong. The example given is how the verb "to build" in standard German (bauen)is traditionally pronounced as [»b8ou9.´] in High ALM and [»b8u˘.´] in Highest ALM.
However, despite these clear north-south divisions, there are also variations within dialect groups based on an east-west divide indicated by multiple phonetic, lexical, and morphosyntactic isoglosses. One example mentioned includes /l/-vocalisation as a phonetic phenomenon that separates western parts from eastern parts of this region.
Overall, when considering both north-south and east-west divides along with their overlaps, this study reveals that German-speaking Switzerland consists of four broad dialect regions.
In summary, this Zora article's introduction sets the stage for investigating vowel qualities in Swiss German dialects by explaining diglossic language use and highlighting previous research gaps regarding acoustic studies on Alemannic dialects. It also provides an overview of relevant linguistic divisions within these dialects to guide readers' understanding throughout the study. 
This introduction discusses the concept of reference in conversation and explores the changes that occur in referring expressions (REs) over the course of interactive communication. Reference is a fundamental aspect of communication, where speakers refer to entities relevant to their interaction. The most commonly used form of reference is a noun phrase (NP) RE, which can take various forms such as pronouns, definite and indefinite descriptions, and proper nouns.
During interactive communication, two main changes can be observed in NP REs: lexical convergence and referential contraction. Lexical convergence refers to speakers aligning on their linguistic representations, leading to increased similarity in terms of vocabulary choice and grammatical constructions employed. This process has been explained with the Interactive Alignment Model. Referential contraction refers to interlocutors shortening their contributions by using more concise NP REs.
The focus of this article is primarily on referential contraction but acknowledges that both processes typically occur simultaneously. The author aims to describe central trends of structural change-in-interaction specifically related to shortening NP REs produced over multiple rounds of dialogue.
To investigate these changes-in-interaction, a referential communication task was designed where participants engaged in spoken dialogues over four rounds while referencing the same sets of visual stimuli. The article provides an example from this task illustrating how NP REs evolve from longer initial forms into shortened versions through iterative rounds.
The study examines how speakers converge on particular expressions and shorten their NP REs by analyzing preferred grammatical structures used throughout the interaction. It focuses on identifying general tendencies regarding types and forms of modifying elements within NP RE constructions.
In contrast with previous research that discussed change-in-interaction related to compression in NPs, this study delves into experimental approaches incorporating familiarity and accessibility considerations along with theoretical frameworks like the Interactive Alignment Model.
Section 3 introduces the experimental setup used for collecting spoken English dialogues that form a corpus for analysis. Section 4 presents an analysis highlighting structural changes in NP REs over the course of dialogical interactions. It shows that as NP REs are shortened, there is a shift from more elaborated, clausal forms to more compressed, phrasal forms.
Section 5 discusses the findings with regard to the notion of compression as proposed by Biber and Clark (2002). Compression refers to changes occurring in response to the demand for conveying a significant amount of information efficiently, particularly when targeting an expert audience.
Overall, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the research questions addressed in this article and briefly outlines the methodology and key findings related to changes observed in NP REs during interactive communication. In Section 2, the article dives into previous research on change-in-interaction, specifically focusing on the compression of NP REs. This literature review contextualizes the findings from experimental studies related to referential communication tasks within theoretical frameworks such as the Interactive Alignment Model and discussions of familiarity and accessibility. By incorporating these theories, the article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how NP REs undergo structural changes during interactive communication.
Section 3 introduces the experimental set-up employed in this study to gather a corpus of spoken English dialogues. The details of this methodology are not mentioned in the introduction but will likely be explored further in that section. It is important to note that this experimental design allows for an analysis specifically focused on how NP REs evolve over successive rounds of interaction.
Moving forward, Section 4 presents an in-depth analysis of the structural changes observed within NP REs throughout these dialogical interactions. By examining patterns and trends across multiple rounds, this analysis provides valuable insights into how speakers modify their preferred grammatical structure for NP REs as they align with each other linguistically and shorten their expressions.
The results reveal an interesting trajectory: initial NP REs tend to possess post-head clausal elements but gradually shift towards phrasal (pre-)modification as interaction progresses. Biber and Clark (2002) term this phenomenon "compression". It encompasses both shortening processes in general and shifts from clausal elements towards more concise phrasal forms specifically observed here.
In Section 5, these findings are further discussed within Biber and Clark's concept of compression as an efficient response to convey large amounts of information effectively. The discussion explores how language users adapt their linguistic structures based on demands imposed by specific audiences or contexts.
It is expected that subsequent sections beyond what is covered in the introduction would also delve into additional analyses or discussions related to other aspects considered in this study.
Overall, this Zora article offers a thorough exploration of the changes-in-interaction that occur within NP REs during interactive communication. By examining the shortening processes and shifts in structural preferences, the study not only contributes to our understanding of language usage but also sheds light on how speakers adapt their expressions to facilitate efficient communication. 
This introduction discusses the importance of understanding different conceptualizations of nature and landscapes across languages and knowledge systems. It specifically highlights the implications of these differences for environmental governance, policy-making, and management decisions.
The paragraph begins by referencing a recent report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, which emphasized the diversity of worldviews and knowledge systems about nature. One way to explore this variation is through language, as it reveals similarities and differences in how landscapes are conceptualized.
Studies of indigenous languages have shown that these linguistic differences can have significant consequences for human-environment relations. For example, incorrect labeling or classification of land cover types based on Western concepts can lead to misguided management decisions that impact traditional land use practices.
Despite growing recognition of the need to capture multiple perspectives in environmental governance policies, there is often an assumption that language equivalence exists across different languages. The example given is the European Landscape Convention, which has official translations into 41 additional languages but fails to account for potential differences in the concept of "landscape" across these languages.
Similarly, international initiatives such as the UN's Sustainable Development Goals define targets and indicators based on specific terms like "forest." However, linguistic variations surrounding these terms suggest that there may not be a unitary underlying concept across different languages. This variability ultimately affects global measurements related to forests at large scales.
The privileging of English as a dominant language in both science and policy further adds challenges for global initiatives. The article raises important questions about whether previous research examining isolated concepts like "landscape" or "forest" also applies to more systematic exploration within entire semantic fields.
To address this gap in understanding cross-linguistic differences within semantic domains related to waterbodies, this study focuses on English and German speakers' mental representations associated with water-related terms. By exploring sensory, motor, and emotional associations with such terms individually as well as within each language's domain, the researchers aim to gain insight into the meanings of these terms.
This investigation is particularly relevant because water is essential to life and plays a crucial role in landscape preference. However, differences in the meaning of water-related terms, such as "lake" in English and its equivalent "loch" in Gaelic that encompasses both fresh and saltwater bodies, pose challenges for public understanding and implementation of indicators related to water quality.
The choice to compare English with German stems from their linguistic relationship as Germanic languages within the Indo-European family. Moreover, German offers advantages such as being well-documented with large corpora available and allowing for demographically comparable participant samples alongside English-speaking participants from the UK. This Zora article aims to delve into the differences in conceptualizations of waterbodies between English and German speakers. It recognizes the importance of understanding these distinctions, especially in the context of environmental governance and policy implementation.
The study focuses on sensory, motor, and emotional associations that individuals have with terms related to waterbodies. By exploring these associations, the researchers hope to shed light on how these concepts are understood and represented by English and German speakers.
The authors highlight that sensory, motor, and emotional ratings play a significant role in language use and can predict behavioral responses to words. Therefore, examining these associations can provide valuable insights into how people mentally represent water-related terms across languages.
Water holds a vital place in explanations of landscape preference as it is not only crucial for life but also plays a key role in Sustainable Development Goal Indicator 6.3.2 aimed at monitoring improvements in water quality. The United Nations Environment Programme provides detailed delineation for rivers, lakes, groundwater — collectively referred to as waterbodies.
However, this assumes that there is a shared understanding of what constitutes a "waterbody" across different languages. The article raises concerns about potential discrepancies between the meanings assigned to such terms by local populations due to linguistic variations.
For instance, while "lake" typically refers to enclosed freshwater bodies within English-speaking communities, Gaelic encompasses both enclosed freshwater bodies as well as those open to the sea with its equivalent term "loch." These differing interpretations have significant implications for how indicators are understood and implemented at national levels.
To tackle this issue comprehensively using cross-linguistic comparison as their focal point for investigation; English – given its central role in scientific work and policy documents – was selected alongside German—another Germanic language closely related but differing from English with respect to word meanings across various domains.
Furthermore, the choice of German offers advantages such as abundant documentation resources like large corpora available for analysis along with the possibility of sampling demographically comparable participants from Germany and Switzerland to match the English-speaking sample.
In summary, this Zora article sets out to explore the divergent conceptualizations of waterbodies between English and German speakers. It highlights the relevance of understanding these differences, as they can impact environmental governance decision-making and policy implementation. By examining sensory, motor, and emotional associations with water-related terms, the study aims to uncover insights into how these concepts are mentally represented across languages. 
In this introduction, the authors discuss the concept of framing as a popular theoretical approach in communication research. They point out that while many studies refer to framing, they often fail to provide clear definitions of the concept, leading to a range of phenomena being categorized under the umbrella term of framing. This lack of clarity complicates attempts to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights in communication research.
To overcome these problems, systematic reviews are employed to identify common trends, locate research gaps, and guide future research. However, previous reviews have not fully utilized one unique characteristic of the framing approach: its bridging potential. The authors explain that framing is able to consider all aspects of the communication process and bridge different interdisciplinary perspectives such as strategic communication by various actors, journalistic cognitions and reporting processes, audience frames and effects, as well as broader cultural contexts.
The authors reference Entman's (1993) frame locations in the communication process which include communicators or sources of messages, the text or message itself,the receiver or audience and their interpretations,and finally culture or societal influences on framing. They argue that systematically reviewing how framing has been applied across these frame locations can provide insights into the cultural repository of frames.
Choosing a specific topic for review is ideal when examining a cultural framing repository with many available studies. In this case,Mario is focused on climate change because it is one of today's most important global issues.The complexity and scientific uncertainty surrounding climate change make it difficult for audiences to engage with and understand.In addition,the required connections between experts,policy makers,sources,and audiences makes effective communication about climate change crucial.Framing has potential here due tocertain barriers being present.Researchers also expect that studying framing can aid in developing effective communication strategies,builiding consensus among target audiences,and supporting actions against climate change.
Given that there has been steady growth in research on framing within climate change communication specifically,this systematic review will serve as a valuable resource for future researchers in the field. It will assess frames used by communicators,journalists,the frame content itself and its impact on audiences, as well as framing effects.
The authors note that systematic reviews on framing in communication research overall are limited,so there is an opportunity to identify if field-specific applications of framing are present.To do this,the study will compare findings from the review on climate change communication with those of reviews covering framing in general communication research.
The objective of this study is to connect research on frame production,frame content,audience frames,and framing effects.As a result,indications about the cultural framing repository can be achieved. The authors mention that a misfit refers to subsequent studies not identifying or relating to the same frames identified previously. This gap needs attention and addressing for closing the climate change communication cycle.
To achieve these goals,the study will combine quantitative and qualitative approaches by conducting content analysis of 25 years' worth of published literature on climate change framing This Zora article introduces a study that aims to systematically review the concept of framing in the context of climate change communication. The authors argue that framing is an important theoretical approach in communication research, but its application needs to be better understood and defined.
The article highlights the need for clear definitions of framing, as different studies often use the term without providing specific explanations. This lack of clarity leads to a range of phenomena being grouped under the concept of framing, which makes it difficult to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights in communication research.
To address this issue, systematic reviews are suggested as a way to identify common trends, locate research gaps, and guide future studies. However, previous reviews have not fully utilized one key aspect of framing: its bridging potential. Framing has the ability to consider all aspects of communication processes and bridge interdisciplinary perspectives ranging from strategic communication by various actors to journalistic cognitions and reporting processes.
The authors refer to Entman's frame locations, highlighting how framing can occur at multiple points in the communication process: by communicators (sources), within messages themselves (text), through receivers (audiences), and within broader cultural contexts. They argue that exploring how framing is applied across these frame locations can provide insights into the cultural repository from which frames emerge.
Climate change is chosen as the focal topic for this study due to its importance on a global scale. Despite audiences relying on various sources for information about climate change, they still find it challenging to engage with and understand. Frames play a crucial role in shaping audiences' perception and support for actions related to climate change.
Furthermore,the complexity and scientific uncertainties surrounding climate change make effective communication even more essential.These barriers necessitate using framing strategies that can "break through" such challenges.In addition,researchers believe studying how frames are used in communicating about climate change can contribute towards developing effective strategies,buidling consensus,and supporting actions against climate change.
The article notes that there has been a growing body of research on framing in climate change communication. Conducting a systematic review will consolidate this research and provide valuable insights for future studies in the field.
Importantly, the study aims to connect different areas of framing research, including frame production by communicators and journalists, frame content itself, audience frames, and framing effects. By identifying the most salient frames across these locations, the study seeks to understand the cultural framing repository and highlight any potential conceptual misfit that may exist within different frame locations.
The article acknowledges that systematic reviews of framing in communication research overall are limited. Hence,integrating field-specific insights from this climate change study can contribute to bridging that gap. This comparison will shed light on any field-specific applications within framing as well as have broader implications for communication research as a whole.
To achieve their objectives,the study plans to use both quantitative and qualitative approaches by conducting content analysis of published literature on climate change framing dating back 25 years.
Overall,this Zora article sets out the rationale for conducting a systematic review on framing in climate change communication. It highlights the importance of clarifying definitions and understanding how frames operate across various aspects of communication processes.It also emphasizes addressing gaps in existing literature by comparing findings with other areas of communication research.This study aims to provide valuable insights into effective climate change communication strategies by examining how different stakeholders utilize frames at various stages. 
The introduction of this Zora article provides an overview of Francoprovençal, a Gallo-Romance language that is currently classified as non-standardized and highly endangered. It states that the language is spoken by approximately 110,000 to 160,000 speakers in France, Switzerland, and Italy.
The article highlights that Francoprovençal has never been the official language of any administrative entity and has not undergone standardization. It also notes that all speakers of Francoprovençal are bilingual, with most Swiss varieties spoken by individuals older than 70 years. However, there is an exception in Evolène in the canton Valais, Switzerland, where the local variety of Francoprovençal is still transmitted to younger generations.
In Italy's Aosta Valley region, successful language policies have promoted the use of Francoprovençal and consequently maintained competent native speakers across different age groups.
The introduction further emphasizes that Francoprovençal acts as a "bridge" between French, Occitan (another Romance language), and Italian dialects both geographically and typologically. However, it points out that despite its significance as a linguistic intermediary between these languages, research on its morphological or syntactic properties remains relatively limited. The article references Diémoz's work on subject pronouns as an example of existing research on these aspects.
It then introduces the binational project initiated since 2018 which focuses on investigating so-called "partitive articles" (PA) in various Francoprovençal varieties alongside Northern Italian Dialects (NIDs). The aim of this project is to enhance understanding regarding the nominal morphosyntax (i.e., word structure) within different types of Francoprovençal varieties.
An earlier study by Kristol highlighted differences among French-speaking Swiss and Italian varieties into two distinct types: "Francoprovençal A" comprising Western Valais (Switzerland) and Northern varieties (in France and Switzerland), and "Francoprovençal B" including Southern Francoprovençal spoken in France, Eastern Valais (Switzerland), and Aosta Valley (Italy).
According to Kristol's research, Francoprovençal A varieties exhibit gender distinction on plural definite articles (masculine 'lu(z)' versus feminine 'le(z)'), similar to Ibero-Romance systems. Additionally, they possess a fully-fledged PA akin to French. However, PAs in Francoprovençal A are also found after quantifiers/quantity expressions such as 'beaucoup' ('a lot') and under the scope of sentential negation, distinguishing it from French.
On the other hand, Francoprovençal B varieties lack gender distinction on plural definite articles like French but unlike Italian. Instead, these varieties consist of an obligatory invariable 'DE' for indefinite mass singulars as well as indefinite plurals. The article notes that optional allomorph "de-[z]" occurs before a vocalic onset in the plural. Furthermore, some localities within the Francoprovençal B area (e.g., eastern Valais) preserve remnants of an older subject versus oblique case system when using singular definite articles.
In conclusion, this article primarily focuses on exploring the different features of nominal morphology in two main types of Francoprovençal languages which are summarized in Table 1 provided in the text. The specific focus is given to property illustrated by examples (1) and (2), where nouns preceded by a PA or the invariable 'DE' are examined.
Overall Word Count: 446 words In this Zora article, the subsequent sections will delve into a detailed exploration of the first property mentioned in the introduction – the use of partitive articles (PA) and the invariable 'DE' within Francoprovençal varieties.
The article aims to contribute to a better understanding of the nominal morphosyntax of Francoprovençal by comparing it with Northern Italian Dialects. By focusing on PA usage, researchers seek to uncover similarities and differences between these languages, shedding light on their unique linguistic features.
The study builds upon previous research conducted by Kristol, who divided Francoprovençal into two distinct types: "Francoprovençal A" and "Francoprovençal B." These types differ in various aspects of nominal morphology, including gender distinction on plural definite articles and the presence or absence of specific forms like PAs.
By analyzing examples such as (1) where the noun 'kwəˈzən' ('cousins') is preceded by a PA and (2) where 'te' ('tea') is preceded by an invariable 'DE', this study aims to further elucidate how these morphological properties are manifested within different contexts and regions.
Moreover, this investigation seeks to expand existing knowledge beyond Diémoz's prior research on subject pronouns. It aims to explore other aspects of morphological or syntactic properties that have received relatively less attention thus far. By doing so, it intends to make important contributions toward filling gaps in our understanding of Francoprovençal's linguistics landscape.
Overall, through comprehensive analysis and comparison between Francoprovençal varieties and Northern Italian Dialects within this binational project initiated since 2018, linguists collaborate to enhance our comprehension regarding nominal morphosyntax. Further exploration will help unravel intricate details related to partitive articles and other grammatical structures present within different subtypes of Francoprovençal.
The article not only provides significant insights into the linguistic properties of a highly endangered and non-standardized language but also contributes to the broader field of Romance linguistics. By examining this unique bridge language between French, Occitan, and Italian dialects, researchers gain valuable knowledge regarding language contact phenomena, typological variation, and historical linguistic developments inherent within these interconnected languages.
In conclusion, this Zora article represents an important endeavor to better understand Francoprovençal's morphological and syntactic characteristics. The focus on partitive articles and their usage in different Francoprovençal subtypes offers a valuable contribution to both theoretical linguistics and preserving the heritage of a threatened Gallo-Romance language.
Overall Word Count: 420 words 
The introduction of this Zora article provides an overview of the linguistic characteristics of the Insular Celtic languages, specifically focusing on their unique word structures and boundaries. It begins by referencing various characterizations that have been attributed to these languages, such as having a "sentence word," a strong group accent, or being weakly polysynthetic. These descriptions highlight the presence of phonologically and morphologically bound formatives in Insular Celtic languages.
However, the introduction points out that these broad descriptions often lack specific criteria for defining "wordhood" or "phonological autonomy." It also notes that contemporary native grammars do not offer a definition of wordhood in relation to these languages. For example, early Irish grammars did not have a concept equivalent to the modern notion of a "word," instead using the term "focal" to refer to any kind of syntactic group. Similarly, Middle Welsh grammars provide little information about words, defining them as combinations of syllables comprising correct utterances.
To address this lack of clarity around wordhood in Insular Celtic languages, this study aims to investigate the properties resembling words within the verbal complex of Middle Welsh prose from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. The use of poetry is also mentioned as a means to explore differences between genres or gain additional insights beyond what prose provides.
The introduction justifies its focus on finite verbal structures by citing Dixon and Aikhenvald's observation that patterns pertaining to wordhood may vary across different parts of speech within a given language. In Middle Welsh, it defines the verbal complex as encompassing both the finite verb and its satellites (modifiers). The example given includes eight markers within this complex: subordinating conjunction (can-), negative marker (ny-), object marker (-y), resultative marker (ry-), lexical root (wel-), tense-aspect-mood marker (-s-), agreement-TAM marker (-ei), and a bound pronoun (-ef).
The article's organization is outlined in the final part of the introduction. Section 2 explains the approach taken in the study, while Section 3 delves into the morphological structure of the verbal complex. Section 4 focuses on phonological and prosodic processes within this complex, aligning them with the morphological structure discussed previously. The findings and potential future avenues for research are summarized and discussed in Section 5.
Overall, this introduction sets up the context for understanding why wordhood is a topic worth exploring within Insular Celtic languages, particularly Middle Welsh prose, and provides an outline for how the rest of the article will proceed in its investigation. In continuing to explain this Zora article, it is important to highlight the motivations and significance of the study. The introduction establishes that there are no clear criteria or definitions for wordhood in Insular Celtic languages, which creates a gap in linguistic understanding. By focusing on the verbal complex in Middle Welsh prose, the study aims to provide a detailed analysis of its potential word-like properties.
The choice to examine Middle Welsh prose from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries is likely due to the availability of manuscripts from this period. These texts offer valuable insights into the structure and composition of language during that time period. Additionally, incorporating poetry as a comparative genre allows for exploration of any distinctive features or variations between different forms of expression within Middle Welsh.
The introduction highlights the presence of various markers within the verbal complex, such as conjunctions, polarity markers, and P- and T-markers. Each marker serves a specific function within this complex structure. To gain a comprehensive understanding of these markers and their implications for wordhood in Middle Welsh prose, an examination will be conducted in more detail in Section 3.
Section 2 is dedicated to explaining the approach adopted by this study. This section could potentially outline any theoretical frameworks or methodologies employed by researchers involved in examining wordhood patterns across languages or related studies on Celtic languages specifically.
As mentioned earlier, Section 3 focuses on exploring morphological structuring within the verbal complex. This investigation likely seeks to determine how words interact with one another phonologically and morphologically within Insular Celtic languages' unique linguistic framework.
Additionally, Section 4 delves into phonological and prosodic processes present within the verbal complex while aligning them with morphological structures discussed earlier. This analysis aims to uncover how phonetic elements interact with each other when forming words or constructing meaningful expressions.
Finally, Section 5 summarizes and discusses findings achieved throughout this study regarding wordhood characteristics observed within Middle Welsh prose from fourteenth and early fifteenth-century manuscripts. It is likely to address the implications of these findings, their limitations, and potential avenues for further research. This final section also serves as a concluding remark that ties together the overall work done in exploring wordhood in Insular Celtic languages.
In summary, this Zora article seeks to contribute to linguistic understanding by examining the properties resembling words within the verbal complex of Middle Welsh prose. Through detailed analysis, it aims to shed light on wordhood patterns and structures within Insular Celtic languages that have lacked clear definitions or criteria historically. 
The introduction of this Zora article provides background information on the Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Serbian (BCMS) language spoken in Switzerland and highlights the lack of research on this particular heritage language. It states that BCMS is one of the most widespread heritage languages in Switzerland, with approximately 2.4% of the Swiss population speaking it daily.
Despite the growing body of research on heritage languages and BCMS spoken in other German-speaking countries, there has been limited investigation into the BCMS spoken specifically in Switzerland. One major challenge faced by researchers studying heritage varieties is obtaining authentic data, often resulting in case studies based on online communications between peers.
The article emphasizes that one area lacking research resources for studying BCMS heritage varieties is corpora of spoken language since heritage speakers predominantly use their mother tongue orally. To overcome this limitation, a map task corpus was created by students at the University of Zurich to enhance the study of BCMS as a heritage language.
The map task corpus consists of data collected from second-generation speakers with parents born in former Yugoslavia. The exercises undertaken by students included fieldwork, transcription, linguistic annotation, and analysis of selected phenomena found within collected data. The aim was to train students to conduct empirical studies on spoken language.
In order to present this corpus to a broader audience and provide a prototype for accessing such types of spoken data, an interactive platform was created. This platform allows users to preselect transcripts based on metadata and frequency distribution features while also sorting and filtering counts within the corpus. Additionally, users can search annotated turn-aligned transcripts and add or export their own custom annotations.
The creation of this corpus not only offers a valuable resource for linguists investigating heritage BCMS but also serves as an example for visualizing, structuring, and accessing similar kinds of spoken language data. By addressing user-specific differentiation when accessing spoken corpora through its architecture, this prototype caters to the needs of different user groups.
It is noted that migration from former Yugoslavian countries to Switzerland began in the 1960s when the official language was known as Serbo-Croatian. However, Serbo-Croatian has never been entirely uniform and had variations such as Eastern and Western varieties, as well as Bosnian-Herzegovinian and Montenegrin standard-language expressions. After Yugoslavia's breakup, new standard languages were codified from what was formerly known as Serbo-Croatian – Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, and Montenegrin.
While BCMS is a commonly used term in the linguistic community to denote this language(s), there are debates on whether it should be considered one language or separate languages depending on definitions and approaches taken. For consistency purposes within this paper, BCMS is used to refer to these language(s), although data from Montenegro's variety is not included.
Overall, this introduction sets the context for understanding the significance of investigating heritage BCMS in Switzerland through the creation of a map task corpus. It outlines its aims, methodology for data collection and analysis conducted by students at the University of Zurich while highlighting its relevance for researchers and learners of BCMS abroad. 
This introduction highlights the importance of imitation in human behavior, particularly in relation to language development and social communication. The authors state that imitation is a powerful learning mechanism for individuals across the lifespan, from infants to adults. They explain that previous research has focused on different aspects of imitation skills (language-based multimodal imitation vs. object-based imitation), but rarely assessed them together.
The authors emphasize that their study contributes to the existing literature by focusing on young preschoolers, a group that has not been extensively studied in terms of their imitation abilities. They also highlight the novelty of their investigation into the relationship between different types of imitation and linguistic and pragmatic skills in preschool children.
The introduction then provides a brief review of previous studies that have explored the relationship between imitative behaviors and language development or sociopragmatic abilities. These studies have shown that spontaneous and elicited imitative behaviors are crucial for various aspects of language production, comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and social communication skills.
The authors cite specific studies to support their claims. For example, Bates et al. (1979) found a strong link between vocal imitation (imitating sounds and words) at 9-13 months old and language production/comprehension at this stage of development. They also refer to Hanika and Boyer (2019), who demonstrated a unique relationship between motor imitation behaviors (clapping hands or pushing toy cars) at 15-18 months old and language comprehension skills.
Additionally, they mention Carpenter et al.'s study (1998), which observed a positive correlation between infants' ability to imitate arbitrary actions involving physical objects at around 9-15 months old with their later use of referential language. Other studies discussed cover topics such as lexical development related to word imitation frequency at 13 months old (Masur & Eichorst, 2002) or correlations between vocal/gestural adult imitations at 14 months old with language skills at 20 months (Snow, 1989).
The authors also highlight the importance of imitation in sociopragmatic skills, such as social communication. They refer to a longitudinal study by Dohmen et al. (2016) that found an association between imitative behaviors and later language outcomes in German-speaking late-talking children. Another study discussed involves children with language impairment (LI), who showed weaknesses in gesture accuracy imitation patterns compared to typically developing peers (Wray et al., 2017).
The introduction concludes by noting the scarcity of studies explicitly comparing the relevance of language-based and object-based imitation skills. Stone et al.'s study (1997) suggested that the imitation of socially relevant body movements was more predictive of expressive language skills, while the imitation of actions on objects was associated with play skills.
Other researchers have also reported similar findings regarding communicative gestures and facial expressions being more accurately imitated than non-communicative movements or facial expressions with weak social engagement links (Masur & Ritz, 1984; Rogers et al., 2003). Lastly, Ingersoll and Lalonde's work (2010) emphasized the beneficial role of gesture imitation tasks over object-based imitation tasks in language therapy settings for older children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Overall, this introduction sets up the rationale for the present study by highlighting gaps in previous research on different types of imitation skills and their relationship to linguistic and pragmatic abilities in preschool children. The authors provide a comprehensive review of previous studies to support their arguments and demonstrate the significance of their own investigation into multimodal aspects of imitation. 
In this introduction, the article begins by discussing the concept of working memory (WM), which is a fundamental cognitive function responsible for briefly holding information for further processing. It refers to a study conducted by Baddeley in 1966 that showed how phonological similarity between items in a list can lead to confusion errors in recall tasks.
The article explains that when participants are asked to remember lists of words and recall them in order, they tend to make more errors with phonologically similar lists like "rat, fat, mat" compared to semantically similar lists like "leopard, cheetah, lion". This observation suggests that phonological similarity plays a significant role in the short-term maintenance of serial/positional information.
The researchers go on to state that their study aims to comprehensively test the conditions under which semantic similarity might also induce confusion errors. They investigate whether semantic and phonological information have different impacts on maintaining serial order information in WM.
To support their investigation, they introduce models that postulate item-context binding as a mechanism for maintaining an item's position within WM. These models suggest that items (e.g., words) are bound to contexts (e.g., word positions within a list). The researchers highlight Figure 1 as an illustration of this item-context binding assumption.
The article acknowledges previous modeling work suggesting that item-context bindings are essential components of working memory for both verbal and visual-spatial arrays. However, it also notes that confusion errors can occur with these bindings. In particular, confusion errors related to order (i.e., recalling words from the correct list but in the wrong positions) are more likely between adjacent serial positions than distant ones.
It is important to distinguish order errors from item errors where participants fail to recall an item altogether. Confusion errors reflect failures of distinctly binding each item to its context and will be the focus of examination regarding the role of phonological and semantic representations in the binding process. The role of item memory will be discussed separately.
The article emphasizes the impact of similarity on confusion errors, highlighting the phonological similarity effect as one of the best-studied examples. This effect shows that phonologically similar items are more likely to be confused than dissimilar ones, indicating that the phonological representation of items is bound to positional contexts in WM. The increased confusability induced by similarity is seen across different domains such as auditory and visual tasks, suggesting it is a general property of working memory.
The introduction concludes by noting that confusion errors can be attributed to a discriminability problem. Regardless of the specific representational format used during item-context binding, confusion errors tend to occur when it becomes difficult to discriminate between similar pieces of information.
Overall, this introduction provides background information on working memory and its association with confusion errors related to phonological and semantic similarity. It highlights the research gap concerning clarifying how these types of similarity affect item-context binding and aims to address this gap through comprehensive testing. In the rest of the article, the authors delve into their methodology and findings related to semantic similarity and confusion errors. They first outline their experimental design, which involved presenting participants with lists of words varying in semantic similarity. Participants were then instructed to recall the words in their original order.
The researchers found that while phonological similarity consistently led to confusion errors, semantic similarity did not reliably induce such errors. This finding contradicts previous assumptions that both types of similarity would result in similar rates of confusion errors.
To further investigate this discrepancy, the authors conducted additional analyses exploring factors that might influence how semantic similarity impacts item-context binding. They explored variables such as list length and category-relatedness between items within a list.
Interestingly, they discovered that while longer lists generally led to increased confusion errors overall, semantically similar lists showed a greater reduction in these errors with increasing list length compared to semantically dissimilar lists. This finding suggests that longer lists may provide more contextual cues for distinguishing between semantically similar items during recall.
The researchers also examined whether category-relatedness influenced confusion errors within semantically similar lists. They found evidence suggesting that when items within a list belonged to distinct categories (e.g., "cat," "dog," "fish"), participants experienced fewer confusion errors compared to when items belonged to the same general category (e.g., "cup," "plate," "fork").
These results suggest that semantic information does play a role in item-context binding but its impact differs from phonological information. While phonological similarity consistently leads to higher rates of confusion errors, variations in semantic relatedness and contextual cues can modulate the effects of semantic similarity on item-context binding and subsequent recall accuracy.
The article concludes by discussing implications for theoretical models of working memory and proposing future research directions. The findings challenge existing models by highlighting differential roles for phonological and semantic representations in maintaining serial order information.
Additionally, the authors suggest investigating how other factors like individual differences in cognitive abilities, language proficiency, and familiarity with semantic relationships might influence the effects of semantic similarity on confusion errors.
Overall, this article provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between similarity, item-context binding, and confusion errors in working memory. By specifically focusing on semantic similarity and its impact on recall accuracy, the research advances our understanding of how different types of information are processed and maintained within working memory.
