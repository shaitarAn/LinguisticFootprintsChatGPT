This introduction provides an overview of sea cucumbers and the ecological, economic, and conservation importance of studying them in the Arabian Peninsula (AP) and Iran. Sea cucumbers are marine invertebrates found in various environments, from shallow coastal waters to deep sea.
The first paragraph highlights the ecological functions performed by sea cucumbers. They are efficient ecosystem engineers that reduce organic waste through their deposit feeding habit. They also rework sediments and facilitate bioturbation, which is important for maintaining healthy ecosystems.
The next paragraph mentions the economic value of sea cucumbers as a delicacy called "Beche-de-mer" or "Trepang" in Chinese cuisine. Their demand is growing, leading to overfishing and poor management policies that have resulted in declining global wild stocks.
Aquaculture techniques have been well-established for some commercial species like Holothuria scabra, offering potential assistance in recovering depleted populations and facilitating trade worldwide.
However, research on sea cucumbers specifically from the Arabian Peninsula (AP) and Iran is limited. The authors argue that a detailed review of studies conducted in this region is necessary due to its unique habitat diversity and extreme environmental conditions impacting the diversity of sea cucumber species.
The following paragraphs describe the AP region's geography including marginal seas such as the Arabian/Persian Gulf (APG), Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Red Sea. Each area has distinct characteristics such as shallow depth or high temperature fluctuations affecting species richness within those waters.
Specifically addressing APG characteristics like wide temperature ranges (12°C to > 35°C) and highly variable salinity levels (>42 ppt to >50 ppt), they mention macroalgae diversity serving as nursery grounds for various marine organisms despite being relatively impoverished due to environmental extremes like these or bleaching events induced by climate change.
They go on to mention further details about other regions surrounding Oman known for rich coral reefs, sandy beaches, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and seaweed communities. They also highlight how upwelling events triggered by the southwest summer monsoon in the Gulf of Oman increase primary productivity and create dispersal barriers.
The Red Sea is described as a warm sea with elevated salinity levels due to high evaporation rates. Mesoscale eddies play a vital role in distributing nutrients in its oligotrophic environment. It hosts biodiverse habitats like mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs renowned for their global significance.
The introduction concludes by highlighting the threats faced by these ecosystems from tourism-based coastal development, which affects biodiversity and overall ecosystem functionality.
Overall, this introduction sets the stage for further research on sea cucumbers in the AP region and Iran by emphasizing their ecological importance, economic value, decline due to overfishing and poor management policies, as well as the need for comprehensive studies conducted there. In addition to providing an overview of the ecological and economic importance of sea cucumbers in the AP region and Iran, this article aims to review and analyze the existing research on sea cucumbers conducted in this area. The authors highlight that research on sea cucumbers in this region has been limited and sporadic.
The article seeks to address this gap by conducting a detailed and comprehensive review of the studies conducted in the AP region, including countries such as Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Yemen, as well as Iran. It also considers the marginal seas surrounding these regions like Arabian/Persian Gulf (APG), Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea,
Gulf of Aden, and Red Sea.
By reviewing historical and current research trends related to sea cucumbers in these areas, it aims to identify gaps in knowledge and provide recommendations for future research priorities. This analysis is crucial for understanding the diversity patterns of sea cucumber species within these habitats.
The introduction specifically emphasizes the unique characteristics of each environment. For example:
- The APG is described as a young shallow sea with varying temperature ranges and strongly influenced by its connection with the Gulf of Oman. The presence of macroalgae serves as important nursery grounds for various marine organisms.
- The Gulf of Oman is highlighted for its deep ocean waters with variable climatic conditions influenced by upwelling triggered by summer monsoons. Coral reefs and extensive sandy beaches along the Omani coast present diverse habitats harboring rich biota.
- The Red Sea is known for being warm with high salinity levels due to evaporation rates. Mesoscale eddies play a significant role in nutrient distribution within its oligotrophic environment. Rich biodiversity can be found here - from mangroves to coral reefs - which are not only globally significant but also attract tourists generating income through coastal development like beach resorts.
Throughout the introduction, the authors emphasize that these habitats face various challenges. Climate change-induced bleaching events are affecting coral reefs, while rapid coastal development poses threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functionality.
Overall, this article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of sea cucumbers in the AP region and Iran by reviewing past and current research. By identifying gaps in knowledge and offering recommendations for future research priorities, it contributes to furthering scientific understanding of these important marine organisms and their unique habitats in the Arabian Peninsula. 
The introduction of the PubMed article begins by stating that colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common malignant tumor of the digestive tract worldwide. It highlights that CRC ranks third in terms of incidence rate and second in death caused by cancer. The article then mentions that socioeconomic development is positively correlated with CRC incidence, with projections suggesting a significant increase in CRC cases and deaths by 2030.
Despite some progress in early diagnosis and treatment, the five-year survival rate for CRC patients remains around 50%. This is attributed to the fact that CRC often lacks obvious symptoms in its early stages, leading to late-stage diagnosis and metastases. The exact mechanisms underlying the occurrence, development, and invasion of CRC are still not completely understood, making it an active area of research.
Epidemiological studies have identified diet, obesity, and diabetes as risk factors for CRC. Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated a close relationship between abnormal lipid metabolism (the processing of lipids within cells) and colorectal cancer. Lipids are hydrophobic macromolecules present in various forms such as fatty acids (FAs), phospholipids, triglycerides (TGs), sphingolipids, cholesteryl esters, and cholesterol.
Lipids play essential roles as structural components of cell membranes and contribute to material transport, energy supply for cells' functions including signaling molecules/apoptosis regulation [REF]. Abnormal lipid metabolism refers to imbalances between anabolic (biosynthetic) processes producing lipids within the body's tissues compared with catabolic (breakdown) pathways regulating their usage or removal [REF].
Normal cells can adapt their anabolic pathways according to nutrient availability; however tumor cells exhibit uncontrolled proliferation even under nutrient-deficient conditions typically found within hypoxic tumors [REF]. In this context Abnormal lipid metabolism has been linked to carcinogenesis induction/metastasis promotion [REF] .
Many studies report associations between abnormal lipid metabolism and the poor prognosis of CRC patients [REF], correlating with malignant progression and increased proliferation. These changes in lipid metabolism contribute to dysregulation of genes, proteins, cytokines, and signaling pathways [REF]. The presence of various components within the tumor microenvironment (including cells, cytokines, DNA, RNA, and nutrients) also plays a role in regulating lipid metabolism in CRC cells [REF].
The article aims to review the alterations in lipid metabolism seen in colorectal cancer and its role in cancer genesis/development. Additionally it discusses how lipid metabolic pathways are remodeled within CRC cells as well as interactions with the tumor microenvironment. The overall goal is to improve understanding of lipid metabolism therapy for targeting treatment options/pathways that can ultimately lead to improved prognoses for individuals with CRC.
In summary, this introduction provides an overview of colorectal cancer's global prevalence and its correlation with socioeconomic development. It emphasizes the need for better methods for early diagnosis using detection methods and tumor markers while further exploring molecular mechanisms underlying CRC occurrence/development/invasion. The role of abnormal lipid metabolism is discussed along with its impact on clinical treatment outcomes/prognosis. Finally, attention is drawn to regulation factors within both intracellular signals/tumor microenvironments that can affect CRC's metabolic processes. In the subsequent sections of the article, the authors delve deeper into the connection between abnormal lipid metabolism and colorectal cancer (CRC). They provide further evidence to support their claims and discuss key findings from previous studies.
The authors highlight several studies that have demonstrated a significant association between abnormal lipid metabolism and CRC. Aberrant lipid metabolism has been shown to play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of CRC, with dysregulated lipid pathways contributing to tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [REF]. Moreover, clinical studies have revealed that abnormal lipid metabolism is closely linked to poor prognosis in CRC patients [REF].
The article goes on to explain how changes in cellular energy demands can drive alterations in lipid metabolism pathways. Both malignant progression and accelerated proliferation of CRC cells require increased energy supply. As a response to high energy demands, lipid metabolic reprogramming occurs within cancer cells [REF]. These adaptations enable CRC cells to survive under nutrient-deficient conditions that are often found within hypoxic regions of tumors.
The dysregulation of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and oxidation has been observed in CRC cells [REF]. Changes in these gene expression patterns can lead to an imbalance between fatty acid synthesis (anabolic process) and breakdown (catabolic process), resulting in an excess accumulation of lipids within tumor cells. This phenomenon is often observed as increased levels of triglycerides (TGs), cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, or alterations in phospholipids content [REF].
In addition to changes occurring within cancerous cells themselves, the tumor microenvironment also significantly influences cellular lipid metabolism. The review emphasizes that multiple components present within the microenvironment can modulate intracellular signals affecting lipid metabolic pathways [REF]. Factors such as cytokines released by neighboring stromal cells or various nutrients including lipids contribute to this regulation.
Understanding these intricate metabolic interactions becomes crucial for developing targeted therapies aimed at disrupting aberrant pathways related to lipid metabolism in CRC cells. By identifying specific molecular targets involved in these pathways, researchers and clinicians can design interventions to alter the energy supply and nutrient availability necessary for tumor cell survival and proliferation.
Ultimately, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the role of abnormal lipid metabolism in colorectal cancer. It highlights the need for further research into understanding the exact mechanisms underlying lipid metabolic changes in CRC cells as well as their interactions within the tumor microenvironment. The authors advocate for an enhanced comprehension of these complex processes to develop novel therapeutic strategies that can manipulate lipid metabolism, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and prognosis.
In conclusion, this PubMed article sheds light on how abnormal lipid metabolism contributes to colorectal cancer development and progression. It underscores the importance of investigating metabolic reprogramming in CRC cells, considering both intracellular signals and factors present within the tumor microenvironment. By elucidating these intricate relationships, researchers aim to identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions that may improve patient prognosis through targeted disruption of abnormal lipid metabolic pathways in colorectal cancer. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of Wilms tumour (also known as nephroblastoma), a malignant kidney tumour that primarily affects children. It starts by providing key statistics about the prevalence and incidence of Wilms tumour, stating that it accounts for 5% of all pediatric cancers and 95% of childhood malignant renal neoplasms. The incidence rate is reported to be 1 in 10,000 children.
The introduction then explains that Wilms tumour is caused by abnormal kidney development during the embryonic stage, specifically during mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) at the beginning of nephrogenesis. It typically affects children aged 0–4 years, with a median diagnostic age between 3 and 4 years. The tumor can be unilateral or affect both kidneys (synchronous bilateral or multifocal tumors).
Furthermore, it highlights that the majority (98-99%) of Wilms tumor cases are sporadic, while only a small percentage (1-2%) are familial. Metastatic forms are observed in approximately 12% of cases and usually affect the lungs or liver.
The introduction also mentions that up to 20% of Wilms tumors may be discovered incidentally during routine check-up visits since they can grow large without manifesting specific symptoms. However, typical signs include a palpable hard abdominal mass or swelling accompanied by symptoms such as abdominal pain, bleeding in urine, hypertension, fever, and vomiting.
Medical imaging techniques like ultrasound followed by three-dimensional imaging using CT scan or MRI help establish the diagnosis and determine important factors such as tumor location within/outside the kidney as well as staging purposes.
From there, the introduction goes on to describe the histopathological types of Wilms tumor based on prognosis - favorable (>90% cases) and unfavorable (6-10%). Anaplastic and sarcomatous variants are considered unfavorable types associated with poor clinical outcomes.
The article then explains the treatment protocols used for Wilms tumor, specifically mentioning the North American NWTS protocol and the European SIOP protocol. In Morocco and many parts of Europe, the SIOP protocol is implemented, involving preoperative chemotherapy followed by total nephrectomy, often combined with post-operative radiation therapy depending on tumor stage and histology.
Next, it introduces microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short RNA molecules involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. The introduction gives a brief description of miRNAs as highly conserved non-coding RNA molecules that bind to messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to their degradation or inhibition of protein translation. MiRNA expression profiles have shown potential as tools for classifying cancerous and normal tissues, disease monitoring, and assessing response to therapy.
The role of miRNAs in cancer varies depending on whether they target oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Different expression profiles of miRNAs can act as either oncomirs or suppressor-miRs based on specific tissue and cancer types. Furthermore, alterations in miRNA expression levels have been implicated in many diseases beyond cancer due to their regulatory roles in cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and cell differentiation.
Considering this context, the introduction highlights potential applications of miRNA-based therapeutics in terms of diagnosis/prognosis or identification of therapeutic targets for various diseases including pediatric cancers like Wilms tumor. It mentions that despite significant progress in understanding miRNA biology, delivering specific miRNAs to target cells/tissues remains challenging.
The introduction concludes by briefly mentioning promising results from clinical trials investigating the use of miRNAs for cancer treatment purposes. Examples given include studies that demonstrate enhanced chemosensitivity or modulation of drug sensitivity using specific mimetic or antimimetic miRNAs targeting certain genes implicated in breast cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma models.
Overall, this comprehensive introduction provides background information on the prevalence, characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, and potential role of miRNAs in Wilms tumor and highlights the need for further research in this area. 
This PubMed article begins by providing an overview of coronaviruses, highlighting specific strains such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), and coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19). It mentions that there have been several outbreaks of coronaviruses in the past two decades, citing the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the MERS outbreak since 2012.
The article then discusses the current status of COVID-19, stating that as per a report from the World Health Organization (WHO) until June 18, 2021, there have been approximately 177 million confirmed cases and more than 3.8 million deaths worldwide. It highlights the need for protective measures or treatment strategies to address this global health crisis.
The focus of this article is on exploring contradictory reports regarding the effect of smoking on COVID-19 infections. The author suggests that if smokers are found to be protected from COVID-19, further studies could be conducted to understand this protective mechanism. Conversely, if smokers are at higher risk, it would draw attention to implementing separate policies to protect them.
The introduction goes on to discuss smoking as a well-established risk factor for various diseases such as different types of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and diabetes. It cites statistics from the World Health Organization estimating that by 2025 there will be around 1.1 billion smokers worldwide and that smoking-related deaths account for an economic cost of approximately US$1.4 trillion annually.
The author then presents evidence suggesting a potential association between smoking and worse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Studies have shown that current and former smokers had higher percentages among ICU patients, required more mechanical ventilation support, experienced higher mortality rates, had more severe cases compared to non-smokers.
Additionally, smoking history has been linked to exacerbations of COVID-19, greater severity of infections and complications such as pulmonary fibrosis. The case fatality rate for smokers who are hospitalized with COVID-19 is reported to be higher, resembling the pattern observed in MERS patients.
The article then discusses the molecular mechanisms that could contribute to smokers' susceptibility to COVID-19. It mentions that cigarette smoke has been found to upregulate the expression of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) in lung cells, which serves as a receptor for the virus. Furthermore, exposure to cigarette smoke has been shown to increase the expression of Cathepsin B, a protease that activates the spike protein of the virus.
However, there are contradictory findings regarding smoking and its effects on ACE2 expression. While some studies indicate up-regulation, others report down-regulation or a lack of significant effects.
The introduction also highlights conflicting epidemiological studies on smoking and COVID-19 infection rates. Some studies from China, Italy, Europe, and the United States have reported lower incidence among infected smokers. However, other studies from Kuwait, England, and other parts of the United States suggest adverse effects of smoking on COVID-19 outcomes.
Considering these conflicting reports and their potential implications for public health interventions related to smoking during the pandemic,the author explains their aim is to thoroughly investigate this issue by conducting a systematic review using PubMed databases with specific search terms related to smoke and nicotine in relation with COVID-19.
In conclusion,the introduction sets up an understanding about coronaviruses generally mentioning previous outbreaks like SARS,MERS.Correspondingly,it addresses morbidity caused by these viral diseases influencing mortalities due Covid 19 since their clinical characteristics seems overlapping.
Additionally,this part also draws attention towards contradictory relationship between
smoking,current epidemic covid 19 instances,epidemiological data explored making claims based upon specific meta-analysis,but states that limitations of respective studies need to be considered which include heterogeneity of COPD disease and shortages available related to covid 19 in general.
The remaining part predominantly highlights various reasons as how smoking may lead an individual susceptible or protective against Covid cov 2 causing morbidity through nearly mentioning molecular mechanisms how cigarette smoke affects expression ACE receptor type two and cathepsin B but cautions that contrary results regarding up regulation or down regulation highlight different interpretations.Since Smoking history has been established with higher morbidity during other respiratory conditions like SARS,MERS-Author then gives the motive for carrying out study and goals of Study.
Finally,It elaborates on studies reviewed, different meta-analysis papers included where it describes the overall number & nature of related cases expressed by author based upon given data published till date.
 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of Achilles tendinopathy (AT), a type of degenerative tendon disease that can cause functional impairment and morbidity. The article begins by citing epidemiological data that estimate the prevalence of AT to be 2.16 cases per 1,000 patient-years in the general population and 6.2%-9.5% in the athlete population.
The introductory paragraph also highlights the anatomical categorization of AT into two primary categories: insertional, which occurs at the calcaneus Achilles tendon junction, and mid-portion, which occurs 2-6 cm proximal to the calcaneus. Mid-portion tendinopathy is characterized by diffuse or localized swelling, degenerated tendon morphology, and pain caused by repetitive loading without adequate compensation from the plantar flexor muscle function.
Furthermore, it is mentioned that exercise-based therapy has been proposed as one of the most effective management strategies for mid-portion AT. Various exercise interventions have been reported for AT such as eccentric training using protocols like the "Alfredson protocol," concentric training, and combined (eccentric plus concentric) training using protocols like the "Stanish" and "Silbernagel" protocols.
Among these interventions, eccentric loading has emerged as a primary conservative approach for AT rehabilitation over recent years due to its hypothesized ability to influence collagen formation in tendons and enhance tendon volume and tensile strength. Additionally, eccentric exercises may potentially reduce neovascularization (formation of new blood vessels) and related nerve ingrowth responsible for pain development.
A meta-analysis examining eccentric exercise treatments on both healthy tendons and pathological tendons revealed no significant immediate volume changes in healthy tendons following acute exercise interventions but did report immediate reductions in volume in pathological tendons with no long-term adaptations observed.
Another aspect discussed is that both concentric training and combined exercise treatments have shown effectiveness in improving plantar flexor functions such as power, which is believed to occur through strengthening the affected tendon. It remains unclear whether the effects of eccentric loading differ from other loading types like slow concentric loading, and the "time-under-tension" hypothesis is mentioned as a possible explanation. This hypothesis suggests that positive adaptations can be achieved regardless of contraction type as long as mechanical strain is performed slowly and with adequate intensity.
To date, while various exercise treatments have reported positive findings in functional outcomes for AT patients, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the specific effects of different exercise treatments on specific functional outcomes such as strength in mid-portion AT. The ability to differentiate these effects may contribute to more tailored treatment approaches for individuals with AT.
Therefore, this systematic review aims to analyze the effect of different exercise treatments (eccentric, concentric, combined) on various functional outcomes (strength, power, range of motion, balance) specifically in individuals with mid-portion AT. In this systematic review, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature on exercise treatments for mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy and their impact on various functional outcomes. By synthesizing the available evidence, they hope to shed light on the effectiveness of different exercise modalities and help guide clinicians in developing more targeted treatment approaches.
The article acknowledges that while eccentric training has been widely studied and recognized as a beneficial intervention for Achilles tendinopathy, there is still limited research on other exercise modalities such as concentric training or combined eccentric-concentric training. It is important to determine whether these alternative exercise treatments can elicit similar functional improvements as eccentric loading, ultimately allowing clinicians to tailor treatment plans based on individual patient needs.
Functional outcomes analyzed in this systematic review include strength, power, range of motion, balance, and potentially other relevant measures related to Achilles tendon function. The authors recognize that assessing these outcomes will provide valuable insights into how specific exercises influence muscle-tendon function and overall rehabilitation progress.
The methodology employed in conducting this systematic review involves an exhaustive search of relevant literature using established databases such as PubMed. Selection criteria are applied to identify studies that meet specific inclusion/exclusion criteria related to study design (e.g., randomized controlled trials) and outcome measures assessed. Data extraction will involve synthesizing key information from selected studies including sample size, participant characteristics (e.g., age range), intervention protocols utilized (e.g., duration, frequency), primary outcome measures assessed (e.g., isometric strength), and findings reported.
To ensure reliability and minimize bias in the analysis process, appropriate quality assessment tools will be utilized to evaluate the rigor of included studies. This ensures that only high-quality research is considered when drawing conclusions about the effects of different exercise treatments for mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.
Upon completing data extraction from all eligible studies, a comprehensive synthesis will be performed summarizing key findings regarding each type of exercise modality evaluated. The authors will assess the strength of evidence and discuss any limitations identified. Additionally, they will highlight gaps in the existing literature and propose recommendations for future research in this area.
By systematically evaluating the effects of eccentric, concentric, and combined exercise treatments on specific functional outcomes in individuals with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy, this study holds promise for advancing our understanding of effective rehabilitation strategies. Ultimately, it may lead to more personalized treatment approaches tailored to individual patient needs, allowing clinicians to optimize care delivery for individuals suffering from this debilitating condition. 
The introduction of this PubMed article starts by highlighting the significance of color in our perception and evaluation of food. It states that when we decide to buy or consume a food product, we instinctively scrutinize it visually, and color is one of the most prominent visual cues that contribute to our sensory experience of food. The article mentions existing research that supports the idea that the color of food psychologically influences our expectation of flavor even before we taste it.
The introduction then emphasizes how consumers are primarily inclined towards a particular food item based on its visual appeal, specifically referring to the color. This aspect aids consumers in predicting the flavor and taste they can expect from a certain food. The perception and understanding of color are described as deep-rooted and intuitive in human beings, with colors historically being used to differentiate between ripe/unripe or fresh/spoiled fruits, vegetables, and meat.
With increasing demand for packaged foods globally, various industry players have added different types of artificial colorants to enhance their products' appearance. Initially, natural colorants derived from plants and microbes were used but progressively replaced by synthetic ones processed from coal tar compounds containing azo dyes. The introduction also mentions natural identical man-made colors such as riboflavin.
The massive use of these added food colorants led not only to their inclusion in almost every packaged or processed food but also extended into prepared foods in restaurants and other outlets. However, concerns about health hazards associated with these synthetic colors emerged predominantly among children.
The paper points out that using permitted as well as non-permitted synthetic colors poses global concerns regarding their toxicities and potential adulterations in different countries. India is specifically highlighted due to its rich diversity regarding taste, smell, and especially colorful foods—the distinctive quality aiding the growth of both synthetic (SFC) and natural food colorant industries.
While consumer awareness about health has increased the demand for natural alternatives worldwide—including India—this surge created another serious issue: misbranding natural colorants as synthetic ones. The article emphasizes the misuse of the label "natural" by some producers to attract consumers, along with adulteration and the lack of proper legal regulations in processing natural colors. As a result, there is an urgent need for accurate labeling to distinguish between natural and synthetic colorants, as well as the implementation of systematic standards regarding their processing and use.
The introduction concludes by mentioning a proposed label for distinguishing the incorporation of natural colorants in food and highlighting that despite India's reputation for diverse and colorful foods, very few studies have been published on the status of SFCs (synthetic food colorants) and natural colorants in the country. The authors imply that this article aims to address this knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive discussion on the rapid growth of the Indian food colorant market, reports on side effects associated with these additives, and necessary regulations. The authors argue that stringent regulations should be implemented alongside government-funded research initiatives to tackle these growing concerns effectively. 
This introduction discusses the rapid growth of animal product industrialization and the corresponding increase in scale and scope of animal husbandry and breeding. It highlights the significant role of animal products in global trade, accounting for sixteen percent of the entire agri-food market. The introduction also emphasizes the importance of large-scale livestock farming and its associated food chains due to the increasing popularity of animal products.
The article mentions that research has been conducted to analyze various manufacturing factors that influence the quality of livestock products, with attempts made to optimize quality from all aspects. It stresses that ensuring adequate safe food production is mandatory for food security, as there is a growing demand for food that poses a threat to food safety.
Furthermore, the introduction notes that maintaining food quality and safety continually poses new challenges, resulting in millions suffering from contaminated foods each year. The focus on quality products is crucial for food security and requires systematic research throughout each stage, from grass and fodder production to transportation.
In industrialized countries where consumers demand superior quality and safer foods, ensuring food safety becomes a major concern. However, managing Animal Products Processing within traditional supply chains presents challenges such as inadvertent contamination or residues despite established standards.
The global economy experiences significant social and economic losses due to mislabeling, misbranding, contamination, or adulteration of food products. Microbial contamination often occurs when improper management affects various stages of the food supply chain – including rearing on farms – endangering consumers' health.
The introduction points out that approximately 600 million people fall ill annually after consuming contaminated foods globally. To address this issue effectively, genomic testing enables detection concerning meat speciation or genetically modified ingredients/products. Proteomics facilitates understanding species-related changes based on technological processes or storage conditions while Metabolomics helps indicate origin or means of manufacture through tools like mass spectrometry (MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy techniques.
While these analytical methods require infrastructure investment and prove time-consuming and expensive, some parameters can be tested using rapid test kits on-site. The food industry follows defined analytical procedures mandated by food regulation authorities.
Traceability of foods from farm to fork becomes crucial as research indicates intermediaries' attempts to circumvent claims concerning transport documentation and invoices. The introduction emphasizes that the complete traceability system within the Food Supply Chain (FSC) ensures product quality control, safety, and accountability. Storage and handling of case-sensitive information introduce regulatory requirements for monitoring all raw materials in food product preparation.
While traditional technologies offer partial solutions, a fully automated traceability system becomes necessary. Innovative technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and blockchain are emerging as potential solutions for FSC management in the food sector. They enable real-time data querying, management, efficient tracing systems, transparency in supply chains along with improved consumer trust in food safety.
The introduction concludes by highlighting blockchain technology's promising applications – providing a tamper-proof, transparent, shared, secure system that revolutionizes different areas of the food sector - especially when combined with smart contracts. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the two phases involved in the development of the vertebrate intestine. The first phase involves the initial formation of a neonatal/juvenile form, while the second phase is characterized by maturation into the adult form. This second phase typically occurs during postembryonic development, specifically during a perinatal period where plasma thyroid hormone (T3) levels reach their peak.
The article highlights that this perinatal period corresponds to approximately 2-3 weeks after birth in mice and during metamorphosis in amphibians such as Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis. It is important to note that due to significant similarities between these two species, they will be collectively referred to as Xenopus throughout this study.
Furthermore, the authors emphasize that maturation of the intestine during this second phase appears to be highly conserved across different vertebrate species. They provide examples indicating that at birth, mice have villi but no crypts (where adult stem cells reside) in their intestines and develop crypts within 3 weeks after birth when T3 levels are high. Likewise, premetamorphic Xenopus tadpoles have simple intestinal structures with mostly a single layer of epithelial cells when there is little or no T3 present.
The article then discusses how increased T3 levels trigger metamorphosis in frogs at approximately 4 weeks of age, resulting in larval epithelial cell death and dedifferentiation. Some larval epithelial cells undergo dedifferentiation to form clusters of cells expressing adult intestinal stem cell markers such as Lgr5 by around 6-7 weeks after fertilization.
By stage 66 or about 2 months after fertilization, these proliferating stem cells differentiate into a complex multi-folded epithelium surrounded by connective tissue and muscles similar to those found in adult mammalian intestines. The location pattern of stem cells in adult frogs is also similar to that observed in the crypt-villus units of adult mammalian intestines.
The article further provides a schematic diagram illustrating the structural changes occurring during Xenopus intestinal metamorphosis. It depicts how the tadpole intestine, which is structurally simpler than that of frogs, consists mainly of three tissue layers: inner epithelium, connective tissue, and outer muscle layers. In contrast, the frog intestine features multiple epithelial folds with elaborate connective tissue and muscle layers. The diagram also highlights key events in this transformation process such as larval epithelial cell apoptosis and the formation of adult stem cells.
Additionally, the introduction mentions the critical role played by T3 during postembryonic development, highlighting that T3 deficiency can lead to severe developmental problems in all vertebrates including humans. The authors highlight that T3 is both necessary and sufficient for anuran metamorphosis. Blocking endogenous T3 synthesis allows Xenopus tadpoles to remain in their tadpole form for prolonged periods compared to wild-type animals who typically complete metamorphosis within approximately 2 months.
The article concludes by mentioning how technological advancements in genetic studies have facilitated research into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying T3 regulation of cell fate and tissue transformation during metamorphosis. The authors particularly focus on recent studies investigating intestinal remodeling with an emphasis on exploring potential connections between cell cycle activation, larval epithelial cell death, and adult stem cell development.
Overall, this introduction sets up a clear framework for understanding how vertebrate intestines undergo maturation through two distinct phases while also emphasizing the essential role played by thyroid hormone (T3) levels during postembryonic development and metamorphosis. 
This introduction provides an overview of the prevalence and impact of anxiety disorder and anxiety, highlighting the need for effective and affordable treatment options. It begins by explaining that anxiety disorder is a common mental illness characterized by persistent fear or anxiety lasting at least six months, along with related behavioral disturbances. Previously, accurately counting the incidence of anxiety disorder was challenging until clear diagnostic criteria were established.
The introduction then presents demographic data from the UK, which shows that 3% of the population was eligible for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. However, only 8% of those identified ultimately received a diagnosis and relevant treatment. Young people are particularly affected, with 15-20% experiencing anxiety disorders.
While anxiety is a more widespread form of human mental illness characterized by emotions such as dread and apprehension, it is not as disabling as full-blown anxiety disorders. Anxiety can be adaptive as it serves as a response to danger or potential threats in the environment.
The introduction also highlights the connection between major depression and symptoms of comorbid anxiety in about 85% of patients. Both anxiety disorders and generalized anxiety can have significant negative consequences.
Current treatment strategies for anxiety primarily rely on drug interventions with various drugs available in clinical practice. However, there are variations in efficacy and tolerance among different individuals, leading to personalized drug regimens. The high cost of medication poses financial challenges for many patients.
Clinical medicine aims to relieve symptoms rather than completely cure the condition when treating anxiety disorders; typically achieving a 50% improvement on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) or enabling normal functionality after stopping medication serves as endpoints for judge therapeutic success.However these medications may only treat symptoms temporarily; long-term chronic anxiey often persists after discontinuation/adjusment [REF]. The lifetime prevalence rate worldwide for generalized anxiey disorder is estimated to be approximately 3.7%, underscoring the urgency to find an inexpensive yet effective option [REF].
The introduction then highlights the potential advantages of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in treating psychiatric disorders such as anxiety. Specifically, Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS), a TCM preparation, has been in use for centuries. JWXYS consists of 10 Chinese herbal medicines and is known for its mood-regulating properties. It has various forms and names across different regions.
Though JWXYS is not a standardized prescription preparation, it is often customized by TCM practitioners based on each patient's symptoms and overall condition following the principles of syndrome differentiation and treatment.
This review aims to summarize existing research on JWXYS in treating anxiety disorder and anxiety, providing a deeper understanding of its therapeutic effects. The subsequent articles will focus on specific studies that apply the concept of syndrome differentiation and explore other herbal medicines used in conjunction with the ten main herbs found in JWXYS.
In conclusion, this introduction sets the stage by emphasizing the prevalence and impact of anxiety disorders and generalized anxiey while highlighting ongoing challenges with current drug-based treatments. It suggests that TCM may offer an alternative approach with promising potential benefits for patients suffering from these conditions. 
In this PubMed article, the introduction begins by highlighting the significant impact of breast cancer (BC) on women's health, stating that it is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. The article cites data from the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting 2.3 million new cases and 685,000 deaths from BC globally [REF]. Additionally, projections from the American Cancer Society estimate about 297,790 new cases of invasive BC in women in the United States in 2023 [REF].
The introduction also emphasizes that BC is a prevalent disease worldwide, with more than 3.8 million survivors in the United States and 7.8 million worldwide [REF]. It mentions that BC incidence rates have been rising by 0.5% annually in recent years and highlights how improved therapeutic regimens and earlier detection methods have contributed to decreased death rates [REF].
The next part of the introduction focuses on explaining key biological aspects of breast cancer. It describes how a breast tumor is composed not only of epithelial cancer cells but also consists of various populations originating from different host cells such as endothelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, and immune cells [REF]. These diverse cell types collectively form what is known as the tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a crucial role in influencing tumor behavior.
The introduction then emphasizes that breast cancer comprises numerous subtypes with distinctive genetic, pathological, and clinical characteristics. It refers to comprehensive molecular studies conducted by Cancer Genome Atlas that identified over 1600 driver mutations across various breast cancer genes [REF]. The concept of tumor heterogeneity is introduced here as well since genetic variation can exist within single tumors or between primary tumors and their metastases.
Furthermore, therapeutic approaches for breast cancer are discussed based on clinical and pathological features such as hormone receptor status or HER2 status [REF]. However, inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity pose challenges for effective treatment, and drug resistance is a major obstacle to achieving long-term cures [REF]. The introduction emphasizes that the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer, influenced by both intrinsic and acquired molecular features controlled by the TME, contributes to treatment resistance.
The importance of understanding inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity and the impact of TME on cancer progression and drug resistance is highlighted. The introduction also mentions discussing emerging technologies for studying these complex interactions in preclinical models and patient-derived samples [REF].
In summary, the introduction provides an overview of breast cancer's global burden, its biological complexity within the tumor microenvironment, its genetic diversity across subtypes, challenges in current therapeutic approaches due to tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance. It sets the stage for further discussion on these topics in this article. Continuing from the previous information, the introduction of this PubMed article addresses the issue of drug resistance in breast cancer. It highlights that drug resistance is one of the major obstacles to achieving long-term cures for breast cancer patients [REF]. The heterogeneous pattern of molecular aberrations found within each cancer plays a crucial role in resistance to anticancer treatments. The article emphasizes that the goal of cancer therapy is to target specific populations of cancer cells within their particular host environment.
The introduction notes that despite improvements in clinical management, a significant number of breast cancer patients still develop drug-resistant tumors [REF]. Resistance can exist before treatment (innate) or can emerge after treatment administration (acquired) [REF]. Innate resistance is mainly attributed to intrinsic tumor heterogeneity, where certain subpopulations within the primary tumor are naturally resistant to treatment from the beginning. On the other hand, acquired resistance becomes apparent after therapy has been administered.
Standard chemotherapies and targeted therapies used in breast cancer have been associated with enabling tumor cells to escape and shape clonal evolution, giving rise to drug-resistant subclones [REF]. Furthermore, genetic diversity comparisons between pre- and post-treatment tumor specimens highlight how therapeutic interventions selectively expand resistant clones initially present but at low frequencies [REF].
The article emphasizes that cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) play a critical role in mediating drug response and educating cancer cells on developing resistance mechanisms through extensive molecular crosstalk [REF]. This interaction between TME cells and cancer cells will be further discussed in subsequent sections.
In this study, the authors aim to provide an overview of what is currently known about inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity as well as exploring how TME impacts both cancer progression and drug resistance. They also intend on discussing up-to-date tools for studying complex interactions using preclinical models and patient-derived samples related to both aspects mentioned above.
Additionally, emerging technologies such as spatial location analysis of tumor subclones and TME cells within their native context will be presented. The authors believe that these advanced techniques hold the potential to improve our understanding of breast cancer heterogeneity and its implications for treatment resistance.
Overall, the introduction sets the stage for a comprehensive analysis of breast cancer heterogeneity, emphasizing its impact on drug resistance and the crucial role played by the tumor microenvironment. It outlines the objectives of the study and hints at how exploring novel tools and technologies may offer valuable insights into this complex subject matter. 
The introduction of this PubMed article highlights the significance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a global security threat. It states that AMR is driven by the inappropriate use of antimicrobials, particularly antibiotics, in humans, animals, and veterinary medicine. The inappropriate use of antibiotics not only has adverse clinical effects on patients but also has economic impacts such as increased healthcare costs.
The article emphasizes that AMR is considered one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development. It mentions that globally, AMR accounts for an estimated 700,000 deaths per year. If not curbed, it could result in about 10 million deaths per year globally by 2050.
Furthermore, the introduction discusses the devastating economic impacts of AMR. It suggests that if left unchecked until 2050, AMR could lead to a reduction in global Gross Domestic Product and result in a loss of trillions of US dollars in economic output. The increased morbidity and mortality caused by rising rates of AMR may also push millions into extreme poverty due to high costs of treatment and chronic infections.
The impact on animal husbandry is also highlighted as it could affect farmers' livelihoods and threaten food security. Additionally, market failures due to low return on investment and disinclination to invest in research and development for new antimicrobial agents are mentioned. The shift towards developing drugs for non-communicable diseases instead of new antibiotics by multinational pharmaceutical companies is described.
Importantly, access issues are mentioned throughout the introduction with specific focus on citizens from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Both old and new antibiotics may be inaccessible or unaffordable for these populations due to factors like poverty or weak antibiotic supply chain management systems.
The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on inappropriate antibiotic use is raised as well. The lack of definite treatment protocols during the pandemic led to irrational prescription and use of antibiotics for COVID-19 patients, which could contribute to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria.
Lastly, the introduction acknowledges the multifaceted nature of inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the specific drivers in these countries. The overall focus of this review is to discuss these drivers in order to inform policy formulation and other efforts to curb inappropriate antibiotic use and address AMR in LMICs.
In summary, this introduction establishes that AMR is a global security threat driven by the inappropriate use of antimicrobials, particularly antibiotics. It emphasizes its adverse clinical and economic effects on patients while underscoring its impact on global health, food security, development, and economic output. Additionally, it highlights specific issues surrounding access to antibiotics for citizens in LMICs and addresses the context-specific drivers within these countries. Continuing with the explanation of the article, the introduction also highlights that AMR in LMICs is exacerbated by weak or non-existent regulatory frameworks. These countries face challenges in implementing effective regulations to control and monitor antibiotic use in both human healthcare and agriculture.
The COVID-19 pandemic further compounds the problem of inappropriate antibiotic use. The lack of clear treatment protocols for COVID-19 patients resulted in irrational prescription and use of antibiotics. This can contribute to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria not only among COVID-19 patients but also within communities and healthcare settings.
Recognizing that inappropriate antibiotic use is a global issue, the article acknowledges that addressing it requires consideration of political and socio-cultural peculiarities specific to LMICs. In order to effectively combat this problem, policy formulation must be informed by a precise understanding of the drivers behind inappropriate antibiotic use within these countries.
The focus of this review is then clearly stated as discussing the drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs. By examining these drivers, policymakers can gain insights into why antimicrobials are being utilized inappropriately and develop targeted strategies to address this issue.
Overall, this introduction sets up an important context for understanding the significance and impact of antimicrobial resistance as a global threat. It highlights key issues surrounding inappropriate antibiotic usage, including its clinical effects on patients, economic implications at individual and societal levels, threats to food security and development, market failures related to research investments, access challenges for LMIC citizens regarding both existing and new antibiotics, regulatory weaknesses exacerbating AMR issues in agriculture, implications stemming from irrational antibiotic usage during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as specific considerations required for formulating effective policies tailored towards curbing inappropriate antibiotic usage within LMICs.
 
This introduction starts by highlighting the significance of Salmonella as a major pathogen causing gastroenteritis, which results in illness, death, and economic loss. It emphasizes that non-typhoidal Salmonella enteric infections are a global concern and provides statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) to support this claim.
The introduction also mentions that Salmonella is a common cause of foodborne illness worldwide, particularly associated with poultry products like meat and eggs. It highlights the potential for contamination during animal farming and slaughtering processes, leading to transmission through the food chain to humans.
The risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in both animals and humans is another major concern mentioned in this introduction. It explains how AMR can occur through different mechanisms and references previous evidence suggesting that antimicrobial use in food animals contributes to the emergence and spread of AMR in foodborne Salmonella. The growing problem of AMR is underscored by its impact on treating Salmonella infections.
The introduction also emphasizes that animal-derived products are considered a significant source of human Salmonella infections around the world. The role of contaminated food handlers during processing is also highlighted as a potential source of contamination.
Furthermore, there is mention of increasing AMR rates expected in Asia, including Bangladesh specifically. The WHO's estimated global burden of gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella infections is provided along with data from specific studies showing high resistance rates to multiple antibiotics.
Additionally, this section indicates that resistance genes associated with AMR are typically found on plasmids or other genetic elements within the genome structure of Salmonella.
Finally, it introduces the purpose of this meta-analytical study: to determine the prevalence of Salmonella in livestock and poultry-derived foods, assess antibiotic resistance levels concerning these pathogens in Bangladesh thoroughly, and provide comprehensive insights into this scenario. 
Overall, this introductory section provides an overview of why studying salmonellosis caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains of Salmonella in livestock and poultry-derived food is significant, highlighting the global impact, the risk to public health, and the increasing prevalence of AMR.

By conducting a meta-analysis, which is a systematic review that combines data from multiple studies, the researchers can gather a larger sample size and obtain more reliable estimates of Salmonella prevalence and antibiotic resistance rates. This approach allows them to provide comprehensive information on the state of Salmonella infection and AMR in livestock and poultry-derived foods in Bangladesh.
Understanding the prevalence of Salmonella is crucial for assessing food safety standards, evaluating control measures, and developing strategies to prevent outbreaks. By determining how common Salmonella contamination is in these food sources, policymakers, regulatory agencies, as well as farmers and consumers can take appropriate measures to reduce its occurrence.
Additionally, investigating antibiotic resistance patterns among these strains of Salmonella is essential due to its implications for public health. Rising levels of antimicrobial resistance make it challenging to treat infections effectively with currently available antibiotics. Consequently, understanding the extent of AMR among livestock- and poultry-derived food-related strains helps identify areas where interventions are needed to minimize resistance development.
The research will likely collect data from various sources such as published studies, surveillance systems (both human illness records and animal farm monitoring), laboratory databases containing information on isolates collected from different contexts like hospitals or slaughterhouses. The inclusion criteria will be defined rigorously based on relevance for assessing both prevalence rates as well as representing diverse geographical locations within Bangladesh.
Meta-analyzing these datasets will provide an overview of the current situation regarding salmonellosis caused by bacteria obtained from these food sources. It will help fill gaps in knowledge by synthesizing existing evidence into meaningful insights that inform public health actions further down the line.
In conclusion - this PubMed article's aim centers around providing important information on Salmonella prevalence and antibiotic resistance within livestock and poultry-derived food in Bangladesh. By conducting a meta-analysis, the authors will gather data from various sources to ascertain the current situation accurately. The research outcomes have the potential to contribute significantly to food safety practices, public health policies, and combating antimicrobial resistance in this context.

In this introduction, the authors discuss the concept of cyborg and bionic systems (CBS), which involves integrating organic and biomechatronic components to restore lost function or normalize disease symptoms. They provide examples of CBS techniques, such as brain-computer interfaces or deep brain stimulation (DBS).
The authors emphasize the importance of targeting reliable biomarkers for the development of useful CBS. They explain that electrophysiological systems like the brain or heart generate oscillatory activity across a range of frequencies, and outputs such as movement or cognitive processes result from complex integration of oscillatory neural population activity.
To access this activity, researchers can use invasive approaches like local field potential recordings or non-invasive measures like electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography.
The authors highlight that multiple neural oscillations at different scales are involved in neural information processing. Low-frequency oscillations are believed to control long-range synchronization, while high-frequency oscillations are linked to local computation.
They mention that understanding how these neural oscillations contribute to top-down neural transmission is an area of great interest. Researchers have found that various tasks modulate oscillatory activities in different frequencies, and brain stimulation techniques can impact task performance by altering these activities.
The authors point out that neurophysiological oscillations may serve as biomarkers for pathophysiological states like Parkinson's disease. They introduce cross-frequency coupling (CFC), which characterizes interactions between different frequency rhythms and is modulated during both physiological processing and pathological states.
CFC refers to statistical associations between phase, amplitude, or frequency of two rhythms. The authors explain that CFC applied on simultaneous recordings from different cortical areas reveals coordinated information exchange in cognitive, sensory, and motor events.
Four commonly studied types of CFC are discussed: phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC), phase-frequency coupling, and phase-phase coupling. PAC and AAC have attracted much attention for their association with physiological processing and pathological states.
The authors provide a simulation of PAC and AAC to illustrate how the activity at one frequency can be modulated by the phase or amplitude of another frequency, forming nested structures.
In this review, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in CFC research, with a focus on methodologies, neural mechanisms, and potential applications in CBS. They plan to discuss methodological advances in CFC, studies on CFC in cognitive processes and neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease), as well as potential neuromodulation techniques for clinical interventions.
Finally, the review will address challenges and opportunities for integrating CFC technology into CBS and highlight future trends in this field. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, the authors state that they will begin by providing a definition of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and summarizing the current state of knowledge regarding its methodological advances.
They plan to discuss the latest studies on CFC in cognitive processes and various neurological disorders, including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease. This will include an exploration of potential neuromodulation techniques for clinical interventions.
The authors also highlight that they will address the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating CFC technology into cyborg and bionic systems (CBS). They aim to shed light on future trends in this field.
By focusing on methodologies, neural mechanisms, and potential applications in CBS clinical interventions, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of CFC research.
Understanding CFC is crucial as it allows researchers to explore how different neural oscillations interact within the brain. This understanding can help develop advanced strategies for restoring lost functions or treating diseases through CBS techniques.
By studying various cognitive processes like memory formation or decision-making alongside neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or epilepsy, researchers can uncover valuable insights into how these conditions impact CFC patterns. This knowledge can then be used to develop targeted therapeutic interventions using neuromodulation techniques like deep brain stimulation (DBS).
However, while there are clear opportunities for integrating CFC technology into CBS approaches, there are also challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges include issues related to data analysis methods, signal processing techniques and standardization across studies, as well as ethical considerations surrounding invasive procedures or long-term implantation of devices.
The review aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive analysis of methodological advancements in CFC research. It also aims to identify potential future trends in this field with regards to improving CBS technologies for clinical interventions.
Overall, this PubMed article aims to contribute significantly towards advancing our understanding of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and its potential applications in cyborg and bionic systems. By focusing on methodologies, neural mechanisms, and clinical interventions, this comprehensive review seeks to provide valuable insights into the integration of CFC technology into CBS approaches and pave the way for future advancements. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by addressing the concerns that health workers have regarding the human right to health. It highlights that despite a global economic slowdown caused by the pandemic, carbon dioxide levels have reached their highest point in three million years due to continued human consumption generating dangerous levels of greenhouse gases.
The introduction then goes on to discuss how profit-driven economic systems during the COVID-19 pandemic have created extreme wealth for a few individuals while pushing millions into poverty. It specifically mentions that 40 new billionaires are pharmaceutical executives, emphasizing inequities in wealth distribution.
The authors further argue that colonial imprints, white supremacy, and racial capitalism have shaped public and private care systems, resulting in advantages for white-identified and wealthy individuals while disadvantaging black and brown communities during encounters with COVID-19.
The concept of "upstream forces" is introduced next, referring to social, political, and economic contexts that structure society and act as "manufacturers of illness." The authors provide examples of both negative upstream forces (profit-making institutions) and positive ones (equitable transportation, healthy rivers/wetlands, community practices with an ethos of care).
As health inequities persist globally despite local efforts to address them, interest has grown in frameworks such as social medicine, collective health, and structural competency. These fields aim to accurately diagnose the root causes of inequities while offering prescriptions for remedies.
Different perspectives on this intensified interest are presented - some view it as a cyclical rediscovery of well-established relationships between oppressive social conditions and illness risk; others see it as a response driven by climate catastrophe urgency, ongoing racial injustice issues , and the global pandemic. The authors mention that there is hope among some that this increased interest and energy will lead to disruptive and generative social change, moving the global community closer to achieving Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which asserts the right to a standard of living adequate for health and well-being.
The introduction then emphasizes that social medicine, collective health, and structural competency all share commonalities as they assert that health is a human right determined by upstream factors rather than solely biological ones. These fields align with the understanding of civil, political, social cultural, and economic rights within human rights literature. They focus on examining the production of health and systems of care while addressing political economies that either support or hinder public health as a social good.
Although there is an ideological interest in health justice shared by practitioners and scholars in these fields, there is minimal dialogue between them. The introduction suggests possible reasons for this lack of exchange include differences in geographic origins, language barriers, territorialism within academic spheres linked to novelty generation for career advancement purposes. Additionally, some believe new conceptualizations are necessary beyond existing theories for eliminating health inequities.
The authors argue that this lack of dialogue diminishes possibilities for relationship-building, theoretical expansion/imagination problem-solving capacities required for collective power-building toward social change in pursuit of health justice. They argue that bridging these gaps can enhance their substantive contributions to ensuring universal access to healthcare as a human right.
In this paper's goal is stated as igniting intentional dialogue among practitioners and scholars in social medicine...
Please note: Due to character limitations imposed by Assistant+, I am unable to provide further explanation beyond this point regarding the concrete examples proposed by the authors regarding transformative pedagogy strategies or their collective experiences as transnational group educators/practitioners mentioned earlier in your request. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cell wall and its role in the pathogenicity of tuberculosis. It begins by highlighting that the Mtb cell wall is known to be the most complex membrane among all bacteria. The architecture of this wall includes various components such as peptidoglycans, galactofuran, arabinofuran, and mycolic acids.
It is explained that mycolic acids form a lipid barrier perpendicular to the membrane plane, which is a defining feature of Mtb. The presence of mycolic acids contributes to immune evasion mechanisms employed by Mtb. For example, it increases hydrophobicity and masks pathogen-associated molecular patterns with phthiocerol dimycocerosates, preventing detection by toll-like receptor 2 with sulfoglycolipids. These strategies inhibit bacterial detection and prevent activation of cytokine responses.
The introduction further describes how Mtb utilizes components of its cell wall to alter the processing and availability of peptide antigens for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules. Additionally, these cell wall-derived molecules can inhibit innate immunity processes such as autophagy.
The article then shifts focus to discuss the initial interaction between Mtb and host cells during primary infection. Lung epithelial cells (EpCs) and alveolar macrophages are identified as the first cells encountering Mtb in lung tissue. These cells play a crucial role in sensing Mtb through their immune response mechanisms including antimicrobial peptides.
Despite efforts made towards eradicating tuberculosis globally, it remains a significant public health threat causing millions of deaths annually. The article highlights that drug-resistant forms of TB pose even greater challenges due to limited treatment options available. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapies to combat drug-resistant TB.
Furthermore, it acknowledges recent diversion in healthcare resources towards managing the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in neglecting TB control programs. This shift in focus may contribute to the resurgence of TB as a leading cause of mortality.
The article emphasizes that Mtb is primarily transmitted via aerosolized particles and mentions that a significant percentage of infected individuals develop granulomas containing the bacteria. Interestingly, some individuals living in high-risk areas for TB show resistance to Mtb infection. They exhibit immediate elimination of Mtb through innate immunity mechanisms, suggesting the importance of innate immune responses against Mtb.
Finally, it concludes by emphasizing that the complexity of the Mtb cell wall is unique among bacteria and plays a critical role in its pathogenesis. The cell wall serves as a barrier against antibiotics and host immune responses.
In summary, this introduction provides an overview of the complex structure and functions of the Mtb cell wall, its role in immune evasion strategies employed by Mtb, potential interactions with host cells during primary infection, challenges posed by drug-resistant forms of TB, and the need for new therapies to combat these challenges. Moving forward, the article discusses the impact of Mtb on host cells at a molecular level. It mentions that transcriptomic analysis has revealed that multidrug-resistant Mtb (MDR-Mtb) is capable of modifying acetylation/methylation patterns in infected macrophages and lymphocytes. This leads to oxidative stress and premature cellular aging, which correlates with increased intracellular survival and dissemination of the bacteria.
Additionally, the article highlights how some mycobacterial products can induce epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation or alterations in non-coding RNA expression. These changes promote upregulation of immune response activation, further influencing the interaction between Mtb and host cells.
The alarming statistic that 1.5 million people died from TB in 2021 is mentioned, with Mtb being identified as the second leading infectious killer after COVID-19. The diversion of resources towards managing the pandemic has had a significant impact on TB control programs, including vaccination efforts and surveillance for multidrug-resistant strains.
Furthermore, drug-resistant TB is acknowledged as a major public health challenge due to its complexity and limited treatment options available. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), which refers to strains resistant to multiple first-line drugs as well as some second-line drugs, presents an even greater concern.
The article emphasizes the urgent need for new, more effective therapies against drug-resistant TB. It suggests that antimicrobial peptides may be a feasible option for improving conventional therapy and addressing this pressing public health challenge.
Importantly, it mentions that Mtb primarily spreads from person to person through aerosolized particles. While around 90% of individuals who are infected with Mtb are able to spontaneously control infection and eliminate mycobacteria without developing active disease or further transmission (termed latent tuberculosis infection), there are certain populations living in densely populated areas who appear to have resistance against Mtb infection altogether.
These individuals seem to possess innate immunity mechanisms that allow for immediate elimination of Mtb. Innate phagocytes, epithelial cells, soluble antimicrobial molecules, innate invariant T cells, and natural killer cells located in the mucosal and alveolar regions of the bronchial pulmonary airway mucosa demonstrate a robust response against Mtb.
The resistance exhibited by these individuals suggests that innate immunity plays a crucial role as a natural effector against Mtb. Understanding the mechanisms behind this resistance can potentially provide insights into novel strategies for combating TB.
To conclude, this PubMed article emphasizes the complexity of the Mtb cell wall and its impact on pathogenesis. It also highlights challenges posed by drug-resistant TB and calls for the development of new therapies to address this issue. The importance of studying host-pathogen interactions at a molecular level is emphasized, particularly in relation to immune responses and epigenetic changes induced by Mtb. The article reiterates the urgent need for improved TB control efforts given its significant impact on public health worldwide. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the significant global impact of cancer on human life and health. It cites data from GLOBOCAN 2020, which estimates that there will be approximately 19.3 million new cases of cancer and at least 10 million cancer deaths worldwide in 2020. The introduction further emphasizes that cancer is increasingly becoming the leading cause of death in many countries.
The paragraph goes on to mention commonly used treatment methods for targeting tumors, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, and targeted therapy. It also highlights tumor immunotherapy as a novel treatment approach that has gained recognition. Tumor immunotherapy primarily focuses on strengthening the body's immune system to recognize and destroy abnormal cells.
The paragraph discusses the significance of tumor immunotherapy by mentioning that it was named one of the top 10 technological breakthroughs by Science magazine in 2013. It also mentions James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2018 for their discovery regarding negative immune regulation as a potential treatment for cancer.
The next section describes various clinical applications of tumor immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, adoptive cellular immunotherapy, and cancer vaccines. The efficacy of these therapies is noted through examples where long-term remission has been achieved after treatment.
Furthermore, tumor immunotherapy offers potential for curing patients with metastases who were previously considered incurable. The rapid development of tumor immunotherapy is highlighted before explaining how it differs from traditional therapies by primarily targeting the immune system rather than tumor cells themselves.
While acknowledging that tumor immunotherapy has benefited many patients overall, it mentions that these patients still remain a minority suggesting there is room for improvement in expanding its benefits to a larger population.
A transition occurs when two studies reveal significant impacts between gut microbiome and cancer immunotherapy using mouse models before specifying favorable gut microbes identified through different studies conducted across various regions such as France, North America, and South America.
The introduction then shifts focus to obesity as a risk factor for various health conditions and the limited effectiveness of dietary interventions and drugs in treating morbid obesity. It highlights bariatric surgery as an efficient treatment option for most patients and how it can alter the gut microbiota profile.
Moreover, it notes that alterations in microbial metabolites after bariatric surgery have shown benefits in other diseases such as type 2 diabetes. However, the impact of these microbial metabolites on cancer and antitumor immunity requires further investigation.
In this review article, the authors aim to introduce changes in microbial metabolites caused by bariatric surgery and analyze their effects on anticancer immunity. They also seek to establish a connection between changes in microbiota due to bariatric surgery and its influence on the effectiveness of cancer treatment specifically for patients with obesity. The article delves into the specific aim of the review, which is to explore the relationship between microbial metabolites caused by bariatric surgery and their impact on cancer and antitumor immunity. The authors recognize that alterations in the gut microbiota have been observed after bariatric surgery and have shown beneficial effects in other diseases. However, the connection between these changes and their influence on cancer treatment outcomes remains unclear.
To address this gap, the authors plan to analyze how microbial metabolites after bariatric surgery affect anticancer immunity. By examining this relationship, they hope to provide valuable strategies for cancer patients who are also dealing with obesity.
The review is structured to investigate several key aspects related to this topic. Firstly, it will explore changes in microbial metabolites caused by bariatric surgery. This may involve examining shifts in specific bacterial species or overall microbiota composition due to surgical interventions designed to induce weight loss.
Next, the article aims to understand how these post-bariatric surgery microbial metabolites impact anticancer immunity. This involves assessing whether certain microbial metabolites enhance or inhibit immune responses against tumors.
The authors highlight that previous research has shown regional differences in what is considered a favorable gut microbiome for cancer immunotherapy. They cite examples from studies conducted across France, North America, South America, and China that identified different beneficial gut microbes for various types of cancer.
Additionally, understanding how these microbial metabolites affect antitumor immune responses may shed light on strategies for optimizing cancer treatment outcomes specifically for individuals with obesity. This knowledge could potentially lead to personalized interventions targeting both obesity and cancer simultaneously.
Given that bariatric surgery alters not only gut microbiota but also its associated metabolism processes within our bodies (microbial metabolism), it becomes critical to investigate how these metabolic changes contribute to anticancer immune responses positively or negatively.
By analyzing available literature on associations between post-bariatric surgery bacterial species shifts/metabolic changes and implications for cancer treatment, the authors aim to provide insights into how altering gut microbiota through bariatric surgery can either promote or hinder anticancer immunity.
This information may have significant implications for clinical practice and patient care. If certain microbial metabolites are found to positively enhance antitumor immune responses, future therapies could potentially include interventions that manipulate these metabolites to improve cancer treatment outcomes.
On the other hand, if specific microbial metabolites are associated with negative effects on anticancer immunity post-bariatric surgery, measures can be taken to mitigate their impact or explore alternative approaches for patients with obesity who require cancer treatment.
In summary, this PubMed article introduces the topic of tumor immunotherapy and its effectiveness in various cancers while highlighting its regional variations in terms of favorable gut microbes. It then transitions to discussing obesity as a risk factor and how bariatric surgery alters gut microbiota composition and metabolism. Finally, it establishes the objective of reviewing the impact of microbial metabolites after bariatric surgery on anticancer immunity and provides potential strategies for improving cancer treatment outcomes in individuals with obesity. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the amygdala and its related regions, collectively known as the extended amygdala, which play a crucial role in emotional processing in the brain. The traditional understanding of these regions focuses on their involvement in motivated actions, defensive behaviors, fear learning, and threat avoidance. The amygdala is further divided into functionally distinct subregions: the basolateral (BLA), central (CeA), and medial (MeA) subregions. In addition to these classical structures, another region called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is also considered part of the extended amygdala.
Both CeA and BNST are primarily composed of neurons that utilize GABA as a fast inhibitory neurotransmitter. These GABAergic neurons also synthesize and release various neuropeptide modulators, although their specific roles are not yet well characterized.
The abbreviation "AMY" is used to refer to both classical amygdala structures (BLA, CeA, MeA) and the extended amygdala (BNST), as they all contribute to behavioral responses towards emotionally salient stimuli and consolidation of emotional memories.
While historically studied in the context of threat avoidance and fear conditioning, extensive research has linked AMY not only with negative emotions like anxiety and aversion but also with positive emotions like approach and reward.
Recent experimental studies have shown that manipulation of CeA and BNST neurons can strongly influence transitions between sleep and wakefulness. These findings suggest that AMY circuits play a more extensive role in regulating arousal beyond their traditional association with affective behavioral states.
The article then introduces narcolepsy as a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness accompanied by abnormal episodes of sleep intrusion during wakefulness. Narcolepsy patients may experience sleep-like episodes at any time during the day along with hallucinations. Around half of narcolepsy patients also show symptoms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, where they physically act out their dreams due to the failure of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep.
The focus of the article is specifically on narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), which is more severe and associated with cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong positive emotional stimuli. NT1 is strongly linked to the loss of a specific neuron subpopulation in the lateral hypothalamus that produces Orexin, a neuropeptide essential for stabilizing wakefulness. NT1 patients display lower levels of Orexin in their cerebrospinal fluid and brain.
The article discusses the intricate circuitry involved in transitions between sleep and wake states, emphasizing the role of Orexin-expressing neurons projecting from the lateral hypothalamus to regions regulating REM sleep. In NT1, with the loss of Orx neurons, there is an inappropriate intrusion of muscle atonia during wakefulness.
Overall, this introduction provides an understanding of the amygdala and its extended regions' role in emotional processing and introduces narcolepsy type 1 as an example where dysfunction in these circuits leads to abnormal sleep-wake transitions. The article goes on to explain that the circuitry underlying the switches between sleep and wake states is complex and involves multiple subregions, pathways, and neurotransmitters. However, given the interpretation of narcolepsy as an intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness, it is crucial to review the circuitry believed to underlie muscle atonia during REM sleep.
During REM sleep, muscle atonia is maintained through activation of the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus (SLD), also known as the subcoeruleus nucleus. This activation ultimately leads to inhibition of motor neurons and a loss of voluntary muscle control. In contrast, during wakefulness, projections from Orexin-expressing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (Orx-LH) inhibit regions involved in regulating REM sleep, including SLD. This inhibition allows normal muscle tone to persist.
In NT1 patients with a loss of Orx neurons in the LH, this tonic inhibition of SLD is lost. As a result, there is an inappropriate intrusion of muscle atonia during wakefulness. The article includes a diagram illustrating functional connections between AMY regions (BLA, CeA), Orx-LH neurons, regions promoting REM-off state transitions (associated with maintaining arousal), and SLD.
The authors emphasize that the interactions between AMY circuits and arousal regulation are multifaceted and extend beyond their established roles in emotional processing. They suggest that unraveling these complex interactions may provide insights into understanding conditions such as narcolepsy.
The subsequent sections discuss animal models that mimic NT1 by genetically manipulating the Orx system or inducing lesions in specific brain areas like BLA or CeA. These models help explore how dysregulation within AMY circuits affects sleep-wake transitions associated with cataplexy-like episodes observed in NT1.
The goal of this article is to shed light on how disruptions within amygdala-related circuits contribute to abnormal symptoms seen in narcolepsy, specifically NT1. By understanding the intricate neural network involved in sleep-wake transitions and how it intersects with emotional processing, researchers hope to uncover potential therapeutic targets for managing symptoms of narcolepsy.
The article concludes by acknowledging that while significant progress has been made in understanding the role of AMY circuits in narcolepsy and related sleep disorders, there are still many unanswered questions. Further research is needed to fully comprehend the contributions of AMY circuitry to arousal regulation and its implications for sleep disorders such as NT1.
Overall, this PubMed article provides a comprehensive overview of the amygdala and its extended regions' involvement in emotional processing and delves into their connections with narcolepsy type 1. The authors aim to bridge the gap between our understanding of emotion-related brain regions and how dysregulation within these circuits can lead to disruptions in sleep-wake cycles seen in NT1. 
The introduction of this PubMed article highlights the ongoing global challenge of achieving high COVID-19 vaccine booster coverage. It emphasizes the need for effective communication interventions to improve acceptance and uptake of booster doses. The introduction also acknowledges the critical role that COVID-19 vaccination plays in controlling the pandemic and protecting vulnerable individuals.
The article points out that while primary course vaccination coverage in Australia is over 96%, booster dose coverage has stalled at just over 70%. Similar suboptimal uptake has been observed in other countries, with the United Kingdom achieving approximately 70% booster dose coverage, while Europe and the United States have achieved just over 50% and 43% respectively.
Motivation to receive a vaccine is identified as an important factor influencing uptake. The experience with previous pandemic vaccines, such as the H1N1 influenza vaccine, has shown that low motivation can be a barrier if not addressed. Factors affecting motivation include personal and collective health benefits, non-health benefits like travel opportunities, as well as moral values related to individual liberties and personal health decision-making.
Based on these findings, emphasizing motivational factors in persuasive messaging could potentially increase intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Previous research has shown that persuasive messages emphasizing personal or community health benefits can be effective but results are mixed. Some studies found messages emphasizing personal health benefits had a larger effect on intentions than those focusing on benefits to others. Other experiments found that messages promoting altruistic behavior or community benefits were more effective.
However, there is limited research on how messages emphasizing personal agency in making vaccination decisions impact intentions for receiving COVID-19 boosters specifically.
Given these gaps in knowledge, it is unclear which types of messages have the greatest effect on intention to receive a COVID-19 booster dose, especially in populations with relatively low risk of encountering COVID-19 combined with restrictive public health measures like those experienced in Australia during this study.
The study aims to compare different persuasive messages' effects on intention to receive a COVID-19 booster dose in Australian adults. It is part of a larger study investigating factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and developing messaging strategies to support vaccine acceptance in various populations.
The findings of this study can provide important insights for health authorities and other stakeholders in crafting effective communications to encourage uptake of COVID-19 booster doses, especially through written channels such as emails, which were used during the vaccine rollout in Australia.
Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the study by highlighting the importance of addressing communication challenges related to booster doses, summarizing relevant literature on messaging effectiveness for vaccination intentions, and specifying the specific context and goals of the current research. In addition to the context and goals of the study, the introduction also describes the specific conditions experienced in Australia during the time of the experiment. The country had relatively low COVID-19 case numbers compared to other regions during the first two years of the pandemic. However, there were strict public health restrictions in place, including border closures and lockdowns, as part of Australia's pursuit of a COVID-19 elimination strategy.
This unique combination of low disease risk and stringent measures provides an important context for understanding vaccine acceptance in Australia. The study aims to fill a gap in knowledge by investigating which persuasive messages are most effective at encouraging Australian adults to receive booster doses under such circumstances.
The introduction acknowledges that evidence regarding messaging effectiveness for booster doses is currently limited. Prior studies have focused more on primary vaccination courses and general COVID-19 vaccination intentions rather than specifically targeting booster doses. Therefore, this study contributes to filling this research gap by analyzing how persuasive messages can impact intention to receive a COVID-19 booster dose.
Furthermore, it highlights that written communications (such as emails) were used extensively for public communication during Australia's vaccination rollout. This underscores the importance of developing effective messaging strategies through written channels.
The article mentions that this study is part of a larger research effort investigating factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance not only in Australia but also elsewhere. This suggests that insights gained from studying communication interventions for booster dose acceptance among Australian adults may have broader applications across different populations facing similar challenges.
By providing additional evidence on effective messaging strategies, this research aims to contribute valuable insights that can inform health authorities and other stakeholders internationally about how best to encourage uptake of COVID-19 vaccine boosters.
Overall, the introduction sets up a clear rationale for conducting this study by identifying existing gaps in knowledge regarding persuasive messaging effectiveness for booster doses and highlighting specific contextual factors relevant to vaccine acceptance in Australia at that time. It emphasizes both practical implications for improving vaccine uptake and potential broader applications beyond the studied population. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the concept of frailty and its significance in the management of older adults with cancer. It highlights the importance of routine screening for geriatric conditions in older individuals diagnosed with cancer, as they encounter additional stressors from cancer symptoms and treatment-related toxicities. The introduction emphasizes that understanding frailty is crucial for determining appropriate treatment decisions, supporting non-oncological interventions, and assessing individual health status.
Despite the recognition of frailty in older adults with cancer, there is currently no consensus on the optimal screening or measurement tool for assessing frailty in this population. The article introduces the concept of a frailty index (FI), which quantifies frailty by measuring the number rather than nature of health problems. The FI represents a proportion of deficits calculated using a well-defined method.
The FI is presented as a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate increased frailty. An FI score above or equal to 0.25 has been frequently used to diagnose individuals as frail in community and acute care settings but remains less commonly applied in studies related to cancer.
The use of an FI ≥ 0.25 was derived from previous work by Rockwood et al., who demonstrated that it had construct and predictive validity when categorizing community-dwelling adults as either frail or non-frail. This cut-off point also aligned with other established measures such as Fried et al.'s phenotype model and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS).
However, despite these insights into FI scoring strategies in general populations, there is limited knowledge about how these categories apply specifically within oncology settings. Determining who should be considered "frail" becomes crucial when determining trial eligibility or treatment allocation and referring individuals for additional assessments or supports.
Therefore, this scoping review aims to achieve two objectives: first, evaluating which FI categories have been used within oncology literature (both scores and labels); and second, understanding the rationale behind authors' decisions in using these categories. By addressing these objectives, the review seeks to enhance our knowledge of how frailty is categorized in relation to cancer, which can ultimately inform clinical practice and decision-making.
In summary, this article's introduction highlights the importance of frailty assessment in older adults with cancer and acknowledges the absence of consensus regarding its measurement. The use of an FI as a potential tool for quantifying frailty is introduced along with its relationship to other established measures. The introduction sets the stage for further exploration into FI categorization within oncology literature and aims to provide valuable insights into its validity and applications in a cancer context. By conducting a scoping review, the authors aim to gather and analyze existing literature on the categorization of frailty using the FI in an oncology setting. They hope to identify which FI categories have been used and understand the reasons behind authors' choices.
Understanding how researchers have categorized frailty within an oncology context is crucial for several reasons. First, it can inform trial eligibility criteria and treatment allocation decisions. Certain treatment regimens may be deemed unsuitable for frail individuals due to potential risks or side effects, while others might require modified approaches or additional support. Therefore, having standardized and evidence-based categorization of frailty can guide these decisions in order to optimize patient outcomes.
Secondly, being able to accurately categorize individuals based on their level of frailty can also contribute to appropriate referral for assessments or supportive interventions. Those identified as more frail may require additional evaluations or specific interventions tailored to their needs. Having a consistent approach in categorizing and determining who is considered "frail" within an oncology context can prevent variability across studies and ensure that individuals receive appropriate care based on their level of vulnerability.
The scoping review conducted by the authors will gather relevant articles from medical databases following a predefined search strategy. This systematic approach will help ensure that comprehensive research literature related to FI categorization in oncology is included and analyzed.
The review will focus on identifying both FI scores and labels used by different authors in their research studies involving cancer patients. By examining this information, the authors seek to uncover patterns and trends in how researchers have categorized fragile individuals within various contexts of cancer diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, or palliative care.
Additionally, understanding why specific categories were chosen by study authors is another important aspect addressed by this scoping review. The rationale behind these decisions could shed light on factors such as clinical relevance, predictive validity for certain outcomes (e.g., institutionalization or survival), ease of use in clinical practice settings or research studies, and overall consistency with existing frailty measures.
Overall, this scoping review seeks to contribute to the field of oncology by providing a comprehensive overview of how the FI has been categorized in frailty assessment. With standardized and evidence-based categorizations, healthcare professionals can make more informed decisions regarding risk stratification, treatment options, and supportive interventions for older adults with cancer. The findings from this review may also highlight potential gaps or inconsistencies in the literature that further research can address to improve overall understanding and management of frailty in the context of cancer. 
This introduction to the PubMed article highlights the importance of promoting fruit and vegetable (FV) intake in children for proper brain and body development, as well as establishing healthy dietary habits throughout their lives. Despite explicit guidelines and evidence emphasizing the significance of FV intake, average consumption among US children remains low. Only 40% meet the recommended intake for fruits, and just 7% meet the recommended intake for vegetables.
The article emphasizes that preschool age (2-5 years old) is an optimal time for a dietary intervention to promote FV intake throughout a child's lifespan. However, there are key gaps and inconsistencies in diet research that need to be addressed.
One important consideration in diet research involving young children is measuring their food intake accurately. Young children are unable to reliably report their own food consumption, making parent-reported measures subjective and prone to bias. Objective observation measures are advocated for this age group. Additionally, skin carotenoid levels can be used as an objective measure specific to FV intake since carotenoids from consumed FVs are absorbed by various tissues, including the skin.
The setting of dietary interventions also plays a significant role. With nearly two-thirds of preschool-aged children enrolled in childcare or preschool settings in the US, these institutions have a substantial influence on their development. Therefore, evaluating intervention effectiveness should consider different settings rather than extrapolating findings from one context to another.
The introduction also highlights behavior change techniques (BCTs) as essential components within interventions aimed at changing dietary behaviors. Examining BCTs helps assess how interventions may effectively cause behavior change related to diet by identifying active intervention ingredients.
Theory-driven interventions provide another important metric for evaluating behavior change interventions targeting diet-related behaviors. Understanding how specific theories and concepts are utilized within intervention techniques helps tailor components effectively and refine them based on theory principles.
To address existing gaps in research regarding FV interventions specifically conducted within childcare or preschool-based settings using theoretical frameworks and BCTs, the article cites a recent systematic literature review by Hodder et al. and a study by Hendrie et al. However, these reviews have limitations, such as including subjective measures of dietary change and not focusing specifically on FV interventions in childcare or preschool settings.
Therefore, the urgency for this article stems from a critical gap in the literature regarding the effectiveness of FV interventions within childcare or preschool-based settings in the US and their utilization of theoretical frameworks and BCTs. By evaluating different types of interventions and exploring the use of theory and BCTs within them, this research aims to contribute to filling these gaps and provide valuable insights for improving dietary behaviors related to FV intake in young children. The main objective of this PubMed article is to evaluate the effectiveness of fruit and vegetable interventions specifically within childcare or preschool-based settings in the US. Additionally, it aims to assess the use of theoretical frameworks and behavior change techniques (BCTs) within these interventions. By conducting this evaluation, the authors hope to provide insights into which intervention strategies are most effective in promoting fruit and vegetable intake among young children.
To date, no published reviews have comprehensively examined both the effectiveness of FV interventions in US childcare or preschool settings and their utilization of theoretical frameworks and BCTs. This represents a significant gap in current knowledge, as understanding which intervention strategies are most successful can inform the development of evidence-based programs that have a higher likelihood of achieving positive dietary behavior change.
The article refers to previous systematic literature reviews conducted by Hodder et al. (year) on FV intake in children aged five years and younger. While these reviews offer valuable information on a variety of interventions globally, they do not distinguish between subjective and objective measurements of food intake nor evaluate the use of theoretical frameworks or BCTs within those studies.
By undertaking this study specific to US childcare or preschool settings, researchers aim to address these gaps while focusing on an age group where autonomy over food choices begins to develop. This period provides a unique opportunity for targeted interventions that may improve FV intake throughout a child's life.
In addition to evaluating intervention effectiveness, it is important for researchers to consider measurement techniques when assessing dietary changes in young children. Precisely measuring FV intake can be challenging due to various factors such as recall bias or parents reporting for periods they are not directly responsible for child feeding during childcare hours. Therefore, employing objective measures such as skin carotenoid levels can help overcome limitations associated with subjective parent-reported measures.
Furthermore, considering different aspects related to behavior change within dietary interventions is essential for understanding their underlying mechanisms. The article highlights that evaluating BCTs and the use of theoretical frameworks provide insights into how interventions effectively promote behavior change. By examining the active ingredients and intervention components within behavior change interventions, it becomes possible to identify which strategies may be most successful in altering dietary behaviors related to fruit and vegetable intake.
It is worth noting that a previous systematic review by Hendrie et al. (year) explored the use of BCTs in home- and school-based interventions for childhood obesity prevention involving children and parents. While this review established a correlation between the number of BCTs used and intervention effectiveness, it did not specifically focus on interventions targeting fruit and vegetable intake. Therefore, whether these findings are applicable to FV-specific interventions remains unknown.
Additionally, Hendrie et al.'s study evaluated interventions aimed at improving vegetable intake in children but was limited to home or community settings. Since childcare centers have a substantial influence on children's development due to high enrollment rates, it is crucial to determine if results from studies conducted in other settings can be extrapolated to childcare or preschool-based settings.
Overall, this PubMed article fills an important research gap by evaluating the effectiveness of fruit and vegetable interventions in US childcare or preschool-based settings while considering measurement techniques, BCT utilization, and theoretical framework application within these interventions. By synthesizing existing evidence more comprehensively, this study aims to guide future research efforts towards developing effective strategies that improve fruit and vegetable intake among young children for long-term health benefits. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the increasing prevalence of neck pain worldwide due to factors such as rapid economic development, lifestyle changes, and work pressure. It also highlights the significant economic burden that neck pain imposes on society. The main cause of neck pain in adults is degenerative cervical spondylosis (DCS), which can lead to spinal cord dysfunction in severe cases.
Conservative treatment is typically used in the early stages of DCS, but surgical intervention becomes necessary when conservative measures are no longer effective or symptoms worsen. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a widely recognized surgical procedure for treating DCS and involves using an anterior plate fixation to provide stability to the cervical spine, decompress nerves, restore intervertebral height, reconstruct physiological curvature, and reduce complications such as pseudoarthrosis.
However, the placement of a titanium plate during ACDF requires extensive exposure of the surgical field and can lead to complications like soft tissue injury, postoperative dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and degeneration of adjacent segments. Postoperative dysphagia has been attributed to factors like soft tissue swelling at the surgical location, surrounding hematoma (blood clot), esophageal injury, and tissue adhesion around the plate.
Additionally, traditional ACDF with cage-plate construct (CPC) alters biomechanics in the cervical spine by restricting motion at the operated segment and placing increased stress on adjacent segments. This can accelerate adjacent segment degeneration (ASD).
To address these complications associated with traditional ACDF procedures using plates or cages for stabilization purposes came a novel concept design called self-locking stand-alone cage (SSC). This zero-notch design allows self-locking screws in SSCs to be inserted directly into vertebral bodies without plate fixation. SSCs significantly reduce surgical injury by eliminating large anatomical exposures during surgery.
Although studies have shown that SSCs have similar clinical efficacy compared to cage-plate fixation, controversy remains regarding their ability to maintain the physiological curvature of the cervical spine and prevent the subsidence of fusion devices.
Several meta-analyses have been conducted to compare the efficacy and complications between SSC and CPC for treating DCS, but these studies have yielded diverse findings. One limitation among these previous meta-analyses is that they included different surgical segments and variable lengths of follow-up. Some meta-analyses suggest that SSC may be superior to CPC in terms of short- and medium-term effectiveness and safety, but there is uncertainty when comparing long-term outcomes.
Therefore, this article aims to carry out a specific meta-analysis with a follow-up length of ≥ 2 years solely focusing on monosegmental ACDF surgeries. The purpose is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of SSC compared to traditional cage-plate fixation. The goal is to provide clinicians with reliable evidence for making informed decisions regarding surgical treatment options for monosegmental ACDF procedures. The article emphasizes the need for a specific meta-analysis to investigate the long-term benefits and complications of SSC compared to traditional cage-plate fixation in monosegmental ACDF surgeries. The authors highlight that previous meta-analyses have not sufficiently addressed variations in surgical segments and follow-up lengths, which may have influenced the results.
By conducting this meta-analysis with a minimum follow-up length of ≥ 2 years, the researchers aim to provide more comprehensive and accurate insights into the long-term effectiveness and safety of SSC versus CPC in monosegmental ACDF procedures. This will contribute to improving clinical decision-making by offering convincing evidence for surgeons.
The study intends to thoroughly evaluate various outcome measures related to efficacy and safety, including factors such as neurological improvement, maintenance of cervical spine curvature, prevention of fusion device subsidence, functional outcomes, patient-reported quality of life assessments, adverse events such as dysphagia or adjacent segment degeneration, and overall patient satisfaction.
To conduct this meta-analysis accurately, rigorous inclusion criteria will be established. Only studies that fulfill specific eligibility criteria regarding study design (randomized controlled trials or comparative cohort studies), patient population (adults with monosegmental DCS undergoing ACDF with either SSC or CPC), follow-up duration (minimum ≥ 2 years), and outcome reporting will be considered.
Data extraction from selected studies will include relevant demographic information about participants (age range, sex distribution), details regarding surgical procedures performed (SSC characteristics vs. CPC techniques), assessed outcomes at different time points during follow-up (neurological improvement measurements, fusion status evaluation methods), rates of complications/adverse events experienced by patients in each group (dysphagia incidence rates, adjacent segment degeneration occurrences), etc.
Once data extraction is completed from eligible studies meeting pre-defined criteria for inclusion in this meta-analysis review process using standardized methods can begin. Statistical analyses such as hypothesis testing using appropriate statistical tests can then be conducted to compare the long-term outcomes between SSC and CPC. Publication bias and heterogeneity across studies will also be assessed.
By providing a comprehensive analysis of available evidence, this meta-analysis aims to address the existing controversy surrounding SSC versus traditional cage-plate fixation in monosegmental ACDF surgeries. The results of this study have the potential to guide clinical practice by offering valuable information on long-term effectiveness, safety, and risks associated with each procedure.
In conclusion, this article serves as an introduction to a forthcoming meta-analysis that aims to evaluate the long-term benefits and complications of SSC compared to traditional cage-plate fixation in monosegmental ACDF surgeries. By examining existing literature and conducting statistical analyses on relevant data, the authors hope to provide compelling evidence for clinicians when making informed decisions regarding surgical options for their patients. 
This introduction provides an overview of the use of therapies that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as anti-VEGFs, in treating ocular diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular edema (DMO), and others. These therapies are administered through intraocular injections and have been shown to improve visual outcomes in a significant percentage of patients. However, treatment regimens can vary between patients, with some requiring continuous or indefinite treatment.
The introduction highlights the importance of patient adherence to these treatment regimens and the challenges associated with it. Previous studies have identified various reasons why patients may not adhere to their prescribed therapy, including difficulty attending appointments, financial limitations, pain, disbelief in the benefit of treatment, and refusal to continue treatment due to other medical conditions.
The World Health Organization defines adherence as a person's behavior corresponding with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider. Non-adherence refers to deviating from the prescribed therapeutic regimen, while persistence refers to the duration of continuation with therapy.
Patient non-adherence or non-persistence can occur at different points during therapy. Previous studies have reported rates of therapy discontinuation ranging from approximately 42% to 50% for diseases such as nAMD. Factors such as patient awareness about their disease and its treatment can influence compliance.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed additional challenges for patient adherence due to restrictions on travel and reduced access to non-urgent care. Despite expert consensus advising continuation of anti-VEGF injection regimens during lockdowns or reduced services for certain eye conditions, fear of infection and logistical difficulties have likely impacted attendance at appointments.
This article aims to fill a gap in research by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis on patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence patterns in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy across different disease states. It seeks not only to determine prevalence but also identify barriers/reasons associated with non-adherence/non-persistence. By addressing these challenges, the ultimate goal is to optimize treatment outcomes and reduce the burden of chronic eye diseases for both patients and healthcare providers.
In conclusion, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the use of anti-VEGF therapies in ocular diseases, the importance of patient adherence to treatment regimens, challenges faced in achieving adherence, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient-led adherence. It sets the stage for further investigation into determining the prevalence of non-adherence/non-persistence, understanding reasons/barriers behind it, and developing strategies to improve treatment outcomes. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, the introduction highlights the need for further investigation in this field. Systematic reviews conducted previously have focused on patient non-adherence and non-persistence to anti-VEGF treatment regimens specifically in nAMD and DMO. These reviews have emphasized a lack of research and called for more studies in this understudied area.
The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to address these research gaps by investigating not only the prevalence of patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy but also identifying the barriers and reasons associated with non-adherence/non-persistence in different disease states.
By understanding both the scale of non-adherence/non-persistence and the factors contributing to it, researchers aim to develop strategies that can tackle these challenges. The ultimate goal is to improve treatment adherence, optimize clinical outcomes, and reduce vision loss associated with "sight-threatening" chronic eye diseases such as nAMD, DMO, retinal vein occlusion, and myopic choroidal neovascularization.
The impact of patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence goes beyond individual patients. It also has implications for healthcare providers who are responsible for managing these chronic eye diseases. Identifying strategies that effectively address barriers to adherence can lead to improved healthcare delivery and more successful management of patients' conditions.
Given that previous studies have reported high rates of discontinuation or deviations from prescribed therapy regimens in diseases such as nAMD (approximately 42% to 50%), it is critical to investigate why patients may discontinue treatment or fail to adhere as recommended. Understanding specific reasons for non-adherence/non-persistence will enable researchers and clinicians alike to develop targeted interventions tailored towards addressing these underlying factors.
Furthermore, while recent events like the COVID-19 pandemic pose new challenges for maintaining adherence due to fear, travel restrictions, logistical difficulties under lockdown measures impacting attendance at appointments; quantifying levels of non-adherence/non-persistence during such times will provide valuable insights for future practices. It can inform the development of strategies to minimize disruption to essential ophthalmic care and ensure that patients receive the necessary treatment despite challenging circumstances.
In summary, this introduction paves the way for a systematic review and meta-analysis study that aims to examine patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence patterns in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, understand associated barriers/reasons in different disease states, and ultimately reduce the burden of chronic eye diseases. By shedding light on prevalence rates and factors contributing to non-adherence/non-persistence, this research has the potential to improve treatment outcomes, enhance patient adherence to therapy regimens, and optimize healthcare delivery for individuals with ocular diseases who may benefit from anti-VEGF treatments. 
The introduction of this PubMed article discusses the challenges faced in tumor chemotherapy, specifically in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). The authors highlight that the main reason for the failure of tumor chemotherapy is the ineffective delivery of drugs to the site of the tumor. They explain that GBM therapy is particularly challenging because it is difficult for drugs to penetrate into the brain and reach the lesion site.
One major factor contributing to drug resistance in tumors is the use of low-specific and highly cytotoxic therapeutics, as well as fluctuations in drug levels in blood plasma. Additionally, they describe how the blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in maintaining normal brain function and creating a balanced environment within the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB is a specialized structure composed of endothelial cells covered partially by pericytes and surrounded by astrocyte end feet.
The authors emphasize that due to a lack of fenestration or small pores in endothelial cells, BBB has low permeability. Furthermore, tight junctions between adjacent brain endothelial cells make this barrier significantly tighter than peripheral microvessels. As a result, only a small fraction (approximately 2%) of small molecules can cross into brain tissue and almost none or 100% biological macromolecules can pass through BBB. This limited permeability severely restricts the effectiveness of therapeutic agents for brain diseases like GBM.
They note recent advancements made in GBM therapy include receptor-mediated targeted therapy, focused ultrasound opening BBB, and Borneol for "orifice-opening" of BBB. Among these strategies, receptor-mediated intracerebral transport appears promising because it offers high specificity, affinity, and selectivity. Many receptors overexpressed on BBB can be targeted with ligands to facilitate drug delivery into brain tissue.
However, despite these advances, there are still limitations affecting intracerebral transport efficiency for medications intended for GBM treatment. The authors argue that current studies primarily focus on ligand-receptor and cell-tissue interactions, while ignoring the dynamic changes in BBB function during the development and treatment of brain diseases. They assert that this oversight can lead to the failure of intracerebral drug delivery over time.
Furthermore, they mention the limited clinical application of most brain-targeted drug delivery systems due to poor druggability. These factors highlight the need for safe and effective approaches to treating brain diseases, including discovering new mechanisms, breakthrough technologies, and emerging treatments for anti-GBM therapy.
The authors then discuss the connection between GBM pathology and BBB. Under normal conditions, BBB acts as a barrier composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells with tight junctions, basement membranes, and glial cell end feet. However, under pathological conditions like GBM or other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), cerebral ischemia, or Alzheimer's disease (AD), BBB becomes impaired with decreased tight junction proteins and increased permeability.
They reference previous research indicating that pathological fenestration in BBB can provide an opening pathway for therapeutics to cross into brain tissue. Pathological BBB restoration occurs during first administration of certain nanotherapeutics targeted to treat GBM but results in reduced transport efficiency upon re-administration during multiple dosing treatments.
Their previous study found that targeted nanoparticles could restore pathological BBB through inhibition of VEGF downstream signaling pathway but suffered from decreased intracerebral transport efficiency leading to poor outcomes in GBM therapy. Consequently, they propose a combined sequential treatment using functionalized nanoparticles along with a reversible BBP permeability regulator called SC79 as a means to treat GBM effectively. This approach was shown to enhance anti-GBM effect compared to using nanoparticles alone.

The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the importance of iron in various intracellular activities, highlighting its relevance to stem cells. The authors begin by explaining that iron is necessary for the functioning of different enzymes, such as ribonucleotide reductase, which is involved in DNA synthesis and repair. Iron serves as a cofactor for this enzyme.
Iron's role in mitochondrial respiration is also emphasized. It contributes to the synthesis of important molecules like haem and [Fe-S] clusters, particularly cytochrome c. Cytochrome c not only participates in the electron transport chain but also plays a role in apoptosis.
Another group of enzymes called cytochrome P450 utilizes iron (in the form of haem) as a cofactor. These enzymes are essential for drug metabolism and detoxification within cells.
The enzyme catalase, which possesses haem groups containing iron atoms, is highlighted as an important antioxidant. It converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, thus protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.
The involvement of iron at the cellular level includes its incorporation into hemoglobin during erythrocyte maturation for efficient oxygen transport throughout the body. Iron is also found in myoglobin found in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue.
In terms of stem cell biology, studies have shown that iron plays a role in cancer stem cell maintenance and can inhibit self-renewal of human pluripotent stem cells. Additionally, iron-related proteins impact mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) biology by influencing cellular components, processes, and signaling pathways.
MSCs are highly researched due to their ability to support various physiological processes and exhibit reparative properties. However, challenges exist when it comes to labeling MSCs before transplantation or detecting them non-invasively after transplantation using techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Iron oxide nanoparticles have been explored as enhancers for MSC detection but face various obstacles.
Therefore, the authors emphasize the importance of finding effective and non-toxic approaches to preserve MSC functionality during extraction and in-vitro cultivation, as well as facilitating non-invasive detection of transplanted MSCs. They propose exploring iron-related genes and proteins, such as ferritin, transferrin receptor-1, and MagA, as reporter genes because their encoded proteins allow for cellular iron accumulation which can ease in-vivo MSC detection via MRI.
The review also addresses the roles of deferoxamine (an iron chelator) and other iron-related proteins like haem oxygenase-1, lipocalin-2, lactoferrin, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and hepcidin in preserving MSC characteristics both in vitro and in vivo while enhancing their therapeutic potential.
In summary, this introduction provides an overview of iron's importance in intracellular activities related to stem cells. It highlights its involvement in enzyme functions, mitochondrial respiration, cellular components like hemoglobin and myoglobin, pathological implications including cancer stem cells', significance during transplantation procedures involving MSCs. The authors propose utilizing specific iron-related genes/proteins for improved detection methods along with other compounds to preserve MSC functionality and enhance therapy outcomes. Continuing with the explanation of this PubMed article, the authors emphasize that MSCs have shown promising results in various in-vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical trials for a wide range of pathologies, including COVID-19. However, despite their therapeutic potential, MSCs are not frequently used in clinical settings for ameliorating pathological conditions.
One significant reason for this underutilization is the challenges associated with labeling MSCs before transplantation and detecting them non-invasively after transplantation using techniques like MRI. To address this issue, the authors propose exploring effective and non-toxic approaches that not only preserve MSC functionality during extraction and in-vitro cultivation but also permit accurate detection of transplanted MSCs non-invasively. The ability to track transplanted cells is crucial for successful monitoring of their therapeutic effects.
The review focuses on investigating iron-related genes (such as ferritin, transferrin receptor-1, and MagA) as reporter genes because their associated proteins allow cellular iron accumulation. This accumulation facilitates enhanced detection and tracking of transplanted MSCs via MRI.
In addition to investigating iron-related genes as reporter genes, the authors also delve into the roles of other iron-related proteins in preserving MSC characteristics both in vitro and in vivo while enhancing their therapeutic potential. They discuss deferoxamine (an iron chelator), haem oxygenase-1 lipocalin-2 lactoferrinbone morphogenetic protein-2(BMP-2),and hepcidinas potential candidates.
Deferoxamine has emerged as an interesting compound due to its ability to bind excess iron ions within cells effectively. Its usage may prevent unwanted side effects associated with high levels of intracellular free iron while helping maintain optimal function and characteristics of MSCs.
The authors further explore other iron-related proteins such as haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which has been implicated in regulating oxidative stress and inflammation. HO-1 expression could be stimulated to enhance MSCs' therapeutic potential and protect them from damaging conditions.
Lipocalin-2, lactoferrin, BMP-2, and hepcidin are among other iron-related proteins discussed in the review. These proteins have been shown to affect various cellular processes, including immune modulation, tissue repair, angiogenesis, and stem cell proliferation.
The authors highlight the importance of understanding how iron-related genes and proteins can influence MSC functionality both in vitro (during cultivation) and in vivo (after transplantation). By investigating their roles and mechanisms of action, researchers can potentially develop improved strategies for preserving MSC characteristics while enhancing their therapeutic effects.
In conclusion, this PubMed article explores the significance of iron in various intracellular activities related to stem cells. It highlights the challenges associated with labeling and detecting transplanted MSCs non-invasively using techniques like MRI. The authors propose investigating iron-related genes as reporter genes for enhanced detection methods along with exploring the roles of different iron-related proteins in preserving MSC characteristics while optimizing their therapeutic potential. This understanding could lead to improved approaches for successful induction and tracking of transplanted MSCs as well as enhancing their regenerative abilities in different pathological conditions. 
This PubMed article provides an introduction to a study that focuses on neck pain, which is a common and challenging disorder to diagnose and treat. The prevalence of neck pain is increasing globally, with estimates suggesting that 22-70% of the general population will experience this condition at some point in their lives. Chronic mechanical neck pain (CMNP) can range from mild discomfort to complete disability, leading to negative impacts on both socio-economic factors and overall health.
Various risk factors have been identified for the development of CMNP, including a long history of neck pain, poor quality of life, less vitality, being female, prior history of neck pain or low back pain, high job demands, smoking history, and low social/work support. To classify patients with neck pain based on functional capabilities and limitations in line with the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF), clinical practice guidelines define four categories: neck pain with mobility deficits; associated headache; movement coordination deficits; and radiated upper extremity pain.
In terms of diagnosis for patients under 12 weeks' duration with symptoms isolated to their necks and limited cervical range of motion (ROM), there is strong evidence supporting the identification as "neck pain with mobility deficits." The revised clinical practice guidelines also categorize patients presenting symptoms such as central or unilateral neck pain along with limitations in cervical ROM as having "neck pain with mobility deficits." These individuals may also experience familiar symptom reproduction during diagnostic tests or associated referred shoulder or upper extremity pains.
College students are identified as being at risk for developing CMNP due to extended periods spent studying in front of computer screens. Sustained postures coupled with abnormal cervical spine mechanics can contribute to this risk while tenderness upon palpation may indicate its presence. Additional examination findings include limited cervical ROM accompanied by reproduced end-of-range active and passive ROM-related symptoms along with restricted segmental mobility in the thoracic region. Patients may also present with pain in the scapular/thoracic segments and exhibit strength deficits.
Two treatment techniques, instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) and myofascial release therapy (MRT), are discussed in the context of their potential benefits for college students with CMNP. IASTM involves applying adapted pressure to tight structures using stainless-steel tools with beveled edges. Although there is empirical evidence supporting its use, its effects specifically on individuals with CMNP have not been thoroughly investigated. Similarly, MRT focuses on restoring normal length to tight structures to decrease pain and improve function, which may be effective for individuals presenting myofascial trigger points associated with neck pain.
Considering the research gap regarding IASTM and MRT in college students with CMNP, this study aims to evaluate their effects. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant changes, including distance learning for college students resulting in increased computer usage and potential exacerbation of neck pain. Thus, the researchers seek to compare the impact of IASTM and MRT on pain reduction, improvement in function, and changes in pressure pain threshold among these individuals. Their hypothesis is that there will be no statistically significant difference between the two treatment techniques.
In conclusion, this introductory section provides an overview of neck pain as a prevalent disorder that poses diagnostic challenges while also carrying negative socio-economic consequences. It highlights risk factors for CMNP development along with classification systems based on functional capabilities within current clinical guidelines. Finally, it sets up the research objective by emphasizing the scarcity of evidence regarding IASTM and MRT treatments for college students experiencing CMNP during distance learning due to COVID-19 restrictions. 
This introduction provides an overview of the global incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), specifically focusing on the high prevalence and incidence among young women in sub-Saharan Africa. It highlights the need for effective preventive measures, particularly in this population.
The first paragraph establishes the context by stating that there has been a rapid increase in STI incidence globally over the past decade, with more than one million curable STIs acquired daily. It also mentions that young women in sub-Saharan Africa are disproportionately affected by both curable STIs and HIV.
The second paragraph further emphasizes these trends by mentioning specific statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), which estimated 374 million new infections of four curable STIs in 2020. It also highlights limited data suggesting high incidence rates of STIs among women participating in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) trials.
The third paragraph explains why addressing STIs is crucial for women's health, as they can lead to severe complications such as infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and increased susceptibility to HIV. The paragraph also notes that women face higher biological risks compared to men when it comes to complications from STIs.
The subsequent paragraphs discuss factors contributing to higher STI prevalence among younger women in sub-Saharan Africa, including cultural, economic, and social marginalization. The challenges faced by women regarding negotiation of preventive measures further underscore their vulnerability.
The introduction then introduces doxycycline as a potential post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategy for preventing bacterial STIs. It mentions that doxycycline is already widely used for other infections such as malaria and lyme disease. Results from a clinical trial conducted among men who have sex with men (MSM) using HIV PrEP showed promising reductions in bacterial STI rates when using doxycycline PEP.
Despite these promising findings, there is limited information available on how perception of risk and prevalence of STIs among women receiving HIV prevention care may influence the efficacy of doxycycline PEP. The need for trials specifically focusing on young African women is emphasized.
The introduction concludes by introducing the doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (dPEP) Trial, which aims to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline PEP for STI prevention in cisgender women in Kisumu, Kenya. It mentions that this trial is the first to assess the efficacy of doxycycline PEP in this population, and describes the objective of this paper as outlining the baseline characteristics of participants in the dPEP Trial.
In summary, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of global STI trends, emphasizes the disproportionate impact on young African women, introduces doxycycline as a potential preventive strategy, highlights gaps in knowledge and ongoing clinical trials among different populations, and sets up the specific focus and objectives of this particular study. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, the subsequent sections of this paper are likely to delve into more specific details regarding the design, methodology, and findings of the dPEP Trial. These sections will provide a comprehensive understanding of the study population and shed light on how doxycycline PEP may contribute to reducing STI incidence among cisgender women.
The paper may further explain how participants were selected for this open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted in Kisumu, Kenya. It is important to understand their baseline characteristics and demographic information to assess if there are any factors that could potentially influence their risk for acquiring STIs or affect their response to doxycycline PEP.
The authors might discuss relevant definitions and measurements used in assessing STIs in this trial. This could include information such as which specific bacterial pathogens (e.g., Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum) were targeted for prevention with doxycycline PEP. They may also describe how these infections were diagnosed or confirmed within the study population.
Additionally, given that this trial was conducted among women already receiving HIV prevention care through syndromic management of STIs and daily oral PrEP, it would be interesting to learn whether participant perceptions about their own risk for acquiring STIs align with actual infection rates. This can help determine if there is a need for enhanced education or interventions targeting risk perception among this population.
 
Furthermore, since limited data exist on using doxycycline PEP specifically among cisgender women in sub-Saharan Africa, examining potential differences based on age group could provide valuable insights into variations in susceptibility or preventive behaviors across different cohorts within this population.
It is also likely that the researchers will explore challenges related to implementation and adherence to doxycycline as a preventive strategy within an African context. Factors such as acceptability issues by participants, potential side effects or complications, and ongoing monitoring of adherence might be discussed.
In conclusion, this PubMed article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dPEP Trial and its potential for reducing STI incidence among young women in sub-Saharan Africa. By outlining the baseline characteristics of the study population and discussing the methodology employed in evaluating doxycycline PEP, researchers can provide critical insights into how this preventive approach can be effective for cisgender women. The findings from this trial could inform future interventions focusing on STI prevention strategies tailored to high-risk populations within the region. 
The introduction of this PubMed article discusses the importance of monitoring biodiversity conservation and changes in the natural environment and ecosystems on a large scale. Monitoring efforts often focus on indicator species or groups, such as birds. Sound recordings are commonly used for bird monitoring due to their ability to identify species even when they cannot be easily seen in the field.
Citizen science, which involves public participation in scientific research, is a valuable approach for obtaining data over long periods and large spatial scales. This approach can also be applied to analyzing sound recordings of birds. Training participants to improve their identification skills is crucial for increasing the quantity and quality of data collected through citizen science projects and enhancing participants' interest in the natural environment.
Advancements have been made in developing automated birdsong recognition systems, but a library of sounds annotated by citizens would contribute significantly to improving the accuracy of automated birdsong recognition. The use of online training has been increasing in citizen science projects, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online training offers advantages such as low costs and easy accessibility.
However, little research has examined the effectiveness of online training for species identification in citizen science projects. Quiz-style training has been found to be more efficient than simple memorization because it takes advantage of the testing effect, where recalling information strengthens memory more effectively than other methods like writing or listening alone.
Existing quiz-based online training tools require participants to listen repeatedly or randomly to full-length sound sources regardless of their proficiency levels or involve customization by selecting specific sets of songs themselves. Therefore, more efficient and user-friendly quiz-based training approaches are needed.
Adaptive learning is an approach that tailors learning content, feedback, and interfaces specifically for individual users. It can personalize learning effectively using automatic mechanisms. The effectiveness of adaptive learning has been evaluated across various fields recently.
Memory mechanisms play a crucial role in adaptive learning approaches, which have been extensively studied since Ebbinghaus proposed his forgetting curve hypotheses in 1885. The forgetting curve explains that memory rapidly increases after initial learning but exponentially decreases unless repetition learning or spaced learning is implemented. Meta-analyses have shown that setting appropriate intervals for repetition and spaced learning improves learning effectiveness. The recency effect suggests that people tend to recall items from the end of a list more easily.
Applying these memory mechanisms to a quiz-style online training tool can enhance its effectiveness by controlling the order of bird species presented in the quiz. However, quantitative optimization of factors such as the number of quiz training questions, time from quiz to test, and interval between questions requires further investigation.
In this study, the researchers developed a new online training tool called TORI-TORE, which consists of multiple-choice quizzes aimed at improving bird identification skills from recorded bird songs and fostering citizen scientists skilled in birdsong identification. The objectives of this study were to compare species identification skills and attitudes toward birds before and after training, compare results between adaptive training (inspired by adaptive learning) and baseline training using a randomized controlled trial, and test predictions based on forgetting curve hypotheses regarding the optimal number of quiz questions, time lag between training and testing, and question intervals.
Overall, this research aims to understand how theories about memory mechanisms relate to online training effectiveness for bird song identification. This understanding can guide the development of effective online tools for improving species identification skills in citizen science projects focused on birdsong recognition while also fostering interest in birds and natural environments. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by stating that Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as fruit flies, is a well-established model organism for studying developmental processes. The authors highlight the importance of studying autophagy, a cellular pathway responsible for degrading misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, in relation to genetic conditions called proteinopathies. These proteinopathies are a class of neuronal diseases found in humans.
The authors emphasize that autophagy and another cellular pathway called the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are closely linked and both play essential roles in maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. They point out how alterations in one pathway can impact the functioning of the other. Dysregulation or dysfunction in autophagy and UPS pathways have been associated with age-associated disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly those affecting neurons.
The review aims to illustrate how studies conducted using Drosophila models have contributed to our understanding of autophagy's role in proteinopathies caused by mutations in genes associated with common neurodegenerative diseases. Table 1 summarizes these diseases discussed later in the article along with their principal mechanisms and modifiers (components of pathways that can either suppress or enhance toxic phenotypes).
Throughout the introduction, various references are cited to support specific points made by the authors:
- The length of CAG repeats is linked to progressive motor decline and neuron death.
- Aggregate formation kinetics are mentioned as being important.
- The role of Huntingtin (a protein involved in Huntington's disease) in autophagy is referenced.
- The formation and increase in size of polyQ oligomers related to Rnq1 amyloid-like prion conformation is noted.
- Endogenous dhtt is mentioned with respect to its relevance.
- TOR inhibition is highlighted as an area of interest.
- Chaperones play a crucial role related to polyQ-containing proteins.
- Histone deacetylases, the antioxidant pathway, and deubiquitinating enzymes are cited as factors of significance.
- Glutamine metabolism and the role of Rab5 and PSA are highlighted.
- The use of compounds that target mutant Huntingtin to autophagosomes is mentioned.
- Retinal degeneration, loss of interneuron projections, reduced dendritic neuron arborization, and the role of chaperones in relation to polyQ-containing proteins are discussed in the context of specific diseases or conditions mentioned earlier.
- References are made to various genes and proteins associated with different proteinopathies (Ataxin1/2/3, C9orf72, SOD1/FUS/TDP43/Amyloid beta/TAU/Parkin/PINK).
- Moreover, perturbations related to TOR signaling-related genes expression and cell-cycle-related gene expression are stated.
In summary, this introduction provides an overview of the importance of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for studying autophagy in proteinopathies. It introduces key concepts related to autophagy and its relationship with other cellular pathways while mentioning specific genetic conditions associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The introduction lays out the objectives for reviewing Drosophila studies on autophagy's role in these diseases and highlights specific areas that will be explored further in subsequent sections. Continuing from the previous explanation, the article dives into specific proteinopathies and their association with autophagy using Drosophila models. The authors discuss the role of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and prion diseases.
For each proteinopathy discussed, the authors provide insights into the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis. They highlight findings related to specific genes, molecular processes, and cellular pathways involved. For instance, they mention how mutant Huntingtin leads to aggregate formation and increased toxicity in HD. In SCA3, Ataxin3 aggregation is enhanced by Atx1, while Ataxin2 is involved in translational control. ALS-related FUS mutations trigger toxic aggregate accumulation that inhibits autophagy.
The article also delves into different modifiers or components within autophagy pathways that can either suppress or enhance these toxic phenotypes. This includes mentioning various factors like deubiquitinating enzymes for SCA3, antioxidant drugs for ALS-related disorders, and histone deacetylases for AD.
The authors discuss findings related to mitochondrial impairments seen in diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). They highlight studies showing how dysfunctional mitophagy contributes to these conditions by disrupting the removal of damaged mitochondria.
Additionally, the review discusses molecular processes associated with neurodegenerative diseases like AD and tauopathies where aberrant autophagy plays a crucial role in facilitating pathological Tau aggregation.
Throughout these discussions on various proteinopathies, references are made to studies using Drosophila models that have contributed valuable insights into understanding disease mechanisms. The authors outline how specific genetic manipulations, treatments, or interventions in Drosophila have shed light on the role of autophagy in these conditions. They highlight important findings such as the relevance of certain genes or pathways, efficacy of potential therapeutic compounds, and the impact of different mutations.
In summary, this PubMed article focuses on summarizing and discussing how Drosophila models have contributed to our understanding of autophagy's involvement in various neurodegenerative diseases. It highlights specific proteinopathies and explores the mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis while emphasizing the importance of autophagy-related processes. By referencing numerous studies conducted using Drosophila models, this review provides a comprehensive overview of how these research findings can further enhance our understanding of human neurodegenerative diseases and potentially lead to new therapeutic strategies. 
This PubMed article introduces the topic of the oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor (Olig) family of proteins and their role in neural cell fate and specification. The Olig family consists of three proteins: Olig1, Olig2, and Olig3. Initially, studies showed that these genes are expressed in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), where Olig1 regulates the formation and maturation of oligodendrocytes in the brain, and Olig2 modulates oligodendrogenesis in the spinal cord.
However, further research revealed that the Olig proteins are also involved in neurogenesis. Specifically, Olig2 is expressed in progenitors of motor neurons in the developing spinal cord. Additionally, it was found that Olig1/2 can generate inhibitory interneurons in the brain. More recently, it was discovered that GABAergic neurons are derived from cells belonging to the Olig3 lineage.
The article then discusses how the role of the Olig family in astrocyte specification is not well established. Some studies suggest that Oli1/2 may promote astrocyte differentiation after generating interneurons. However, other studies indicate that expression of these genes may inhibit astrocyte development and confirm neuronal or oligodendroglial fate instead.
The introduction then transitions to discuss gliomas - primary brain tumors derived from neural stem cells or progenitor cells - which express various members of the Olig family. Gliomas account for approximately 30% of all primary brain tumors and 80% are considered malignant.
Traditionally, gliomas have been classified based on histopathological features established by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, advancements in technology have allowed for improved molecular and genomic classification methods. The current WHO classification divides gliomas into six families based on different criteria such as age group or specific genetic alterations.
Prognosis and therapeutic success for gliomas rely on accurate diagnosis. However, distinguishing between different types of gliomas based solely on histological markers can be challenging due to similar morphological characteristics. Furthermore, observer variability can lead to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of the correct disease.
The introduction concludes by mentioning the adoption of molecular markers and revised grading in the 2021 WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). This updated classification aims to improve accuracy in differentiating glioma subtypes. The expression of Olig2 across all gliomas has been confirmed through large datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
The article provides insight into ongoing research regarding the expression and role of Olig genes in oligodendrocytes, neurogenesis, and various types of brain tumors. Understanding these factors is crucial for improving diagnosis and developing targeted therapies for diseases involving neural cell fate regulation. The article then focuses on the specific expression and role of Olig genes in gliomas. It explains that adult-type diffuse gliomas, which include oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, and glioblastomas (GBMs), are further categorized based on histological characteristics and molecular markers.
Oligodendrogliomas with mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q have attracted attention due to their favorable response to chemotherapy. These tumors also commonly exhibit mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter gene.
On the other hand, IDH-mutant astrocytomas are now graded as WHO grade II, III, or IV based on specific criteria. They often harbor additional mutations in genes such as ATRX and TP53.
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a high mortality rate. IDH-wildtype GBM shows alterations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and TERT promoter mutations similar to oligodendrogliomas.
The article highlights that attempts to diagnose oligodendrogliomas have utilized markers associated with mature or immature oligodendrocytes. However, traditional markers like myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), NG2, or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) lack specificity for distinguishing between glioma types.
Several studies have reported marked expression of Olig2 specifically in oligodendrogliomas. Anaplastic oligodendroglioma samples showed intense nuclear Olig2 expression. The cells displayed round nuclei with perinuclear halos, consistent with the characteristics of oligodendroglial tumors. Some studies also observed upregulation of both Olig1 and Olig2 in oligodendrogliomas.
In contrast, the expression of Olig genes in astrocytomas and GBMs has been inconsistent. Generally, low levels of Olig1 and Olig2 have been observed in these tumor types. However, the variability in their expression suggests that the role of Olig proteins may differ in different glioma subtypes.
The article concludes this section by discussing the challenges of accurately diagnosing gliomas based solely on histological features. Similar morphological characteristics between different types of gliomas can lead to confusion and biased classifications. This highlights the need for reliable molecular markers to aid in distinguishing between glioma subtypes.
Overall, this PubMed article provides an overview of the oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor (Olig) family and its role in neural cell fate determination as well as its expression patterns within different types of gliomas. The understanding of these factors has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy and developing targeted therapeutics for various neurologic diseases involving misregulation or tumor formation within neural cell lineages. 
This introduction provides an overview of the current state of glioblastoma (GBM) research and treatment. The first paragraph establishes GBM as the most common malignant primary central nervous system tumor in the United States, with low survival rates despite standard treatments. It highlights the need for novel therapies to target the unique characteristics and immune resistance of GBM.
The second paragraph discusses recent clinical trials that have shown moderate improvement in overall survival using a multimodal approach, combining tumor-treating fields with chemotherapy. It also mentions targeted immune therapies, such as signaling pathway inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, which have been successful in treating hematologic malignancies but have not yet translated to GBM.
The subsequent paragraphs mention specific immune strategies that have been attempted in GBM but have had limited success so far. Immune checkpoint inhibitors and single/multi-epitope peptide vaccines have not significantly impacted survival, although a surviving long peptide vaccine has shown promise in early phase trials for recurrent GBM. A personalized dendritic cell vaccine has also demonstrated modest improvements in survival.
The lack of widespread success in immunotherapies for GBM is attributed to intrinsic and adaptive factors that contribute to its immunosuppressive properties. These include intratumoral heterogeneity, T-cell dysfunction, sequestering of T-cells within the bone marrow by tumors, specificities of the central nervous system microenvironment, plasticity of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs), selection of resistant tumor populations, effects of concurrent steroid treatments on immunotherapy efficacy, and adaptive genomic and epigenomic changes in recurrent GBM.
Finally, it is mentioned that this paper will discuss recent advancements in understanding these intrinsic and adaptive factors contributing to immunotherapy resistance within GBM. It also highlights engineered medicines targeting specific molecules involved in this resistance process (such as CD47 or CSF1R inhibitors) as well as non-engineered medicines that have the potential to overcome these obstacles and improve prognosis for GBM patients.
Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the need to explore new approaches to treating GBM by understanding its immune resistance mechanisms and highlights various strategies that have been attempted thus far. It provides a background for the rest of the paper, which will delve into recent advancements and potential solutions in more detail. In the subsequent sections of the paper, the authors will delve into the recent advancements and potential solutions in overcoming immune resistance in GBM. They will discuss engineered medicines, such as CD47, CSF1R, CD73, COX2, CCL2, IL6, and GITR inhibitors. These molecules have been identified as promising targets for immunotherapy in GBM due to their involvement in regulating immune responses and tumor progression.
CD47 inhibitors aim to block a signaling pathway that allows tumor cells to evade phagocytosis by macrophages. By inhibiting CD47 activity, these agents promote the recognition and elimination of tumor cells by the immune system. CSF1R inhibitors target a receptor necessary for monocyte survival and differentiation into immunosuppressive macrophages within GBM tumors. Inhibiting CSF1R reduces the population of these immune cells that contribute to immunosuppression.
CD73 is an enzyme involved in adenosine production from extracellular ATP. Adenosine suppresses anti-tumor immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Inhibiting CD73 can enhance T-cell-mediated anti-tumor activity within GBM tumors by reducing adenosine levels.
COX2 is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis and is upregulated in many types of cancer including GBM. Prostaglandins can suppress anti-tumor immunity through various mechanisms including inhibition of T-cell function and promoting regulatory T-cell accumulation. Targeting COX2 with inhibitors can potentially reverse this immunosuppressive effect.
CCL2 is a chemokine involved in recruiting monocytes/macrophages to tumors where they can exert immunosuppressive effects. Blocking CCL2 receptor signaling has shown promise as a way to disrupt this recruitment process which may help overcome immunosuppression within GBM.
IL6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic effects on different cell types, including immune cells. Elevated levels of IL6 have been associated with immunosuppression and poor prognosis in GBM patients. Inhibiting IL6 signaling can potentially alleviate immunosuppression and enhance anti-tumor immune responses.
GITR (glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor) is a regulatory receptor expressed on various immune cell types, including T cells and regulatory T cells. Targeting GITR has shown potential to enhance anti-tumor T-cell responses by modulating the balance between effector and regulatory T cells.
The authors will discuss the mechanistic rationale behind each of these targets as well as the results from preclinical studies or early-phase clinical trials. They will also evaluate the challenges and limitations associated with targeting these molecules in GBM treatment.
Furthermore, non-engineered medicines will be explored in terms of their potential to overcome immunotherapy resistance in GBM. These may include conventional chemotherapeutic agents that exhibit immunomodulatory effects or repurposed drugs originally developed for other indications but found to have off-target effects on immune system regulation or tumor immunity.
By examining both engineered medicines targeting specific molecules as well as non-engineered options, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current advancements in understanding and addressing immune resistance within GBM. The hope is that these insights may lead to improved treatment strategies that can ultimately improve prognosis for GBM patients who face limited options for disease management at present. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides a background and overview of the concept of "pyroptosis." The term pyroptosis was first proposed in 2001 and combines the words "pyro," representing inflammation or fever, and "ptosis," representing programmed cell death. The introduction then mentions that pyroptosis has been redefined as a form of programmed necrosis mediated by gasdermin proteins.
Gasdermins are pore-forming proteins, and there are six different gasdermin proteins identified: A, B, C, D, E, and DFNB59. However, DFNB59 is not associated with the formation of membrane pores or pyroptosis. The members of the gasdermin family have two domains: an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain connected by a flexible peptide.
The focus of this review is on GSDMD (gasdermin D), which is described as the most extensively studied executive protein involved in pyroptosis. GSDMD is cleaved into an active N-terminal domain (GSDMD-NT) upon activation induced by various stimuli. Inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1/4/5 (and murine caspase-11) are responsible for cleaving GSDMD into its active form.
GSDMD-NT then oligomerizes and forms membrane pores in cells leading to various outcomes including lytic cell death, release of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-18, disruption ionic homeostasis/organelle dysfunction/cell lysis/sustained release inflammatory cytokines due to massive membrane pore formation causing loss in integrity.
The article explains that while GSDMD-induced pyroptosis can protect against bacterial infection there have been numerous studies demonstrating that abnormal activation of GSDMD can cause severe inflammatory cascades leading to diseases like ischemic stroke FMF NOMID EAE nonalcoholic fatty liver disease cancer HIV infection Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The article also mentions that pyroptosis plays an important role in the clinical symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, specifically in terms of excessive inflammation and cytokine storm seen in COVID-19.
Given the crucial role of GSDMD in pyroptosis and inflammatory disorders, the review aims to summarize the structure and activation mechanisms of GSDMD, as well as highlight the discovery of potential GSDMD inhibitors. Inhibiting GSDMD could hold promise for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, including COVID-19.
This introduction effectively provides a brief history of pyroptosis, introduces key concepts related to gasdermin proteins (specifically GSDMD), and outlines its importance in both normal physiological processes (e.g., protection against bacterial infections) and pathological conditions (e.g., various inflammatory diseases). It sets up the rationale for focusing on GSDMD and explores potential therapeutic avenues by targeting this protein. Continuing from the previous explanation, this PubMed article further delves into the role and implications of GSDMD in pyroptosis and inflammatory disorders. The article highlights that abnormal activation of GSDMD can result in persistent inflammation, disrupting ionic balance, organelle function, causing cell lysis, and leading to sustained release of inflammatory cytokines. These consequences have been implicated in various diseases such as ischemic stroke, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), sepsis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cancer, HIV infection, as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).
Additionally, the article emphasizes the significant role of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or COVID-19. It explains that excessive inflammation and cytokine storm contribute to tissue damage and organ failure observed in COVID-19 patients. As GSDMD serves as a regulatory protein upstream of this cytokine storm response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, it becomes an attractive target for potential treatment interventions against COVID-19.
In light of these findings and its pivotal involvement in pyroptosis-related processes and inflammatory disorders，the review aims to provide a comprehensive summary focusing on the structure and activation mechanisms specifically associated with GSDMD. By understanding these aspects more deeply，it may be possible to identify therapeutic strategies targeting GSDMD for various conditions.
Furthermore，the article highlights ongoing efforts towards finding potential inhibitors of GSDMD. Inhibiting GSDMD activation or its activity could help mitigate excessive cell death，inflammatory responses，and related pathological consequences found across multiple diseases including but not limited to COVID-19.
By providing an overview of the current knowledge and research progress regarding GSDMD，the review offers a foundation for further investigations and therapeutic advancements. It aims to stimulate interest in exploring novel approaches for the development of therapeutic interventions that modulate GSDMD and its downstream effectors.
In conclusion, this PubMed article introduces the concept of pyroptosis and highlights the role of GSDMD as a key executor in this process. It discusses the implications of abnormal GSDMD activation on various inflammatory diseases, including COVID-19. The review emphasizes the importance of understanding GSDMD structure, activation mechanisms, and potential inhibitory strategies to advance our understanding of pyroptosis-related disorders and develop effective treatments. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the drug metformin and its versatile utility. Metformin, also known as 1, 1-dimethyl biguanide (MF), is a widely used orally administered anti-hyperglycemic drug for lowering blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The article mentions that it is considered the preferred first-line drug for managing high glucose levels in T2DM patients.
The history of metformin can be traced back to its extraction from the French lilac plant, Galega officinalis. In medieval times, this plant extract was used to decrease blood sugar and relieve symptoms associated with T2DM. Guanidine was later discovered as an active ingredient in Galega officinalis that lowers blood glucose levels. However, other guanide-derived drugs overshadowed metformin initially due to their perceived effectiveness in treating T2DM. These medications eventually fell out of favor because of their high toxicity, leading to metformin becoming the gold standard drug for managing high glucose levels due to its benign and nontoxic properties.
Metformin received approval for treating hyperglycemia in different countries at various times, starting from the United Kingdom in 1958 and followed by Canada in 1972 and the United States in 1995. It has become the most prescribed drug worldwide for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus with more than 120 million people using it.
The molecular structure of metformin is illustrated in Figure 1 included within the article. The mechanisms through which it acts are discussed next - primarily through inhibiting gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose) by liver cells through inhibition of intracellular binding of calcium within hepatocyte mitochondria.
In addition to its antidiabetic effects, metformin exhibits several other beneficial effects such as being antilipidemic (lowering lipid levels), hepatoprotective (protecting the liver), anti-neoplastic (inhibiting tumor growth), cardioprotective (protecting the heart) and anti-obesity effects.
The article also highlights other applications of metformin, including its use in managing acne, hirsutism, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. It is also recognized as a chemo-preventive agent for neoplastic conditions.
The pharmacokinetics of metformin are discussed briefly. After oral administration, metformin is slowly absorbed from the small intestine. Approximately half of the administered dose reaches systemic circulation (bioavailability), and its plasma half-life ranges from 1.5 to 4 hours. A significant portion of the drug is excreted in urine within 24 hours after consumption.
Metformin's effects during pregnancy are influenced by changes in glomerular filtration rate, leading to lower plasma concentrations compared to non-pregnant women. However, it can cross the placenta with fetal concentrations generally being lower than maternal concentrations.
The mechanisms through which metformin exerts its various effects are described next within this introduction section. It decreases appetite and increases secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) resulting in decreased carbohydrate absorption after meals and inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Metformin enhances glucose transport in skeletal muscle stimulated by insulin, increasing skeletal muscle glucose disposal. It also affects lipid metabolism by increasing free fatty acid esterification while inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissue.
Metformin has indirect antineoplastic effects by reducing insulin resistance and levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Moreover, it has both AMPK-associated and AMPK-independent cellular pathways that directly inhibit tumor growth. Beneficial cardioprotective effects arise from long-term use of metformin resulting in weight loss and an improved lipid profile.
Recent research has indicated that metformin may also influence bone metabolism, affecting both osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation by stimulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) while decreasing receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) expression.
The introduction concludes by highlighting the mode of action of metformin relevant to dentistry, including its effects on enhancing osteogenesis and angiogenesis, influencing the AMPK pathway, acting in a concentration-dependent manner, and discussing its potential clinical applications.
Overall, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of metformin's history, uses, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action in various body systems or conditions as well as its potential benefits. 
This introduction provides an overview of circadian rhythm and its role in regulating various biological activities in all living beings. It explains that when circadian rhythms are synchronized with the light-dark cycle, melatonin is secreted to initiate sleep during the nighttime. The relationship between circadian rhythm markers such as dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and core body temperature (CBT) rhythms and sleep timing is referred to as the "phase angle" of circadian entrainment.
The introduction also highlights that while Earth's rotation and social activity rhythms follow a 24-hour cycle, the endogenous circadian rhythm in humans may be slightly longer than 24 hours. The length of this intrinsic circadian period is known as "tau." It mentions that tau can vary from individual to individual, with women typically having a slightly shorter tau than men.
Furthermore, it discusses how endogenous circadian rhythms are entrained to follow a 24-hour cycle through various external cues called zeitgebers. Light stimulation plays a crucial role in this entrainment process by activating neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which regulates the molecular signaling pathway and transcription of clock genes involved in determining the phase of the circadian cycle.
The article then introduces Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD), which is a circadian rhythm disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep and waking up at desired times due to delayed sleep phases. It emphasizes that DSWPD prevalence is high during adolescence and young adulthood, making it crucial to establish effective treatment strategies for this disorder.
The introduction further states that there are many aspects yet unclear about DSWPD, including its pathological mechanism, appropriate classification, assessment methods based on patients' backgrounds, psychosocial characteristics, physiological findings, and treatment strategies for different subgroups within DSWPD.
Additionally mentioned are delayed sleep phases (DSP) experienced by individuals who do not meet diagnostic criteria for DSWPD but still have a delayed sleep phase. The concept of social jetlag (SJL), which refers to differences in sleep timing between weekdays and rest days, is also introduced as a concern related to circadian rhythm and sleep hygiene in young people.
The complex interaction between social schedules, light exposure patterns, genetics, homeostatic pressure on sleep, and the circadian system that contribute to DSWPD's development is acknowledged. It notes that approximately 40% of DSWPD patients have normal melatonin secretion profiles despite a clearly delayed sleep-wake schedule. This subgroup is referred to as "circadian-entrained DSWPD" and is influenced by psychological, behavioral backgrounds in addition to biological factors.
Furthermore, it highlights comorbidity between DSWPD and psychiatric disorders such as neurodevelopmental and mood disorders. It mentions the 2015 guidelines published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs) including DSWPD but emphasizes the need for additional treatment methods specifically for circadian-entrained DSWPD and those complicated by psychiatric disorders.
Finally, this review article aims to describe physiological and psycho-behavioral backgrounds of different types of DSWPD seen in young people while discussing the relationship between psychiatric disorders and DWSWPD. It also intends to address current issues related to treatment approaches based on psychological and psychiatric assessments. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting that health professions trainees in the 21st century have access to a significant amount of open access educational resources, which exceeds what an individual's mind can handle. As a result, future practitioners need to be proficient in knowledge acquisition. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching recognized this need and emphasized incorporating habits of inquiry and improvement as a learning strategy in medical education reform. In response to these evolving needs, inquiry-based learning (IBL) has emerged as an appealing educational strategy.
IBL focuses on learner-driven knowledge acquisition through development of inquiries and hypothesis generation. It differs from problem-based learning (PBL), which involves learners investigating problems provided by teachers. Another similar teaching method is case-based learning, where learners are given cases to target their investigation and research. However, this article specifically focuses on pure trainee inquiry learning and its specific benefits compared to other teaching methods.
The theory behind IBL is constructivist, learner-driven active knowledge acquisition. Students formulate hypotheses and make observations to construct their own knowledge. The framework for IBL can be divided into five phases: orientation (introduction of the topic), conceptualization (generation of open questions and hypotheses), investigation (exploration or observation), conclusion (reviewing problem, hypothesis, interpretation), and discussion (communicating findings externally and reflecting internally).
While IBL curriculum design has evolved since its inception in the 1950s by Jerome Bruner, the core foundation of student-directed epistemic curiosity remains consistent as it encourages active participation and improves scientific literacy. Studies have shown that IBL can enhance students' analytical thinking abilities compared to traditional lecture-based curricula.
There may be some variability in how IBL is classified or sub-divided in the literature. Some categorize it based on assigned tasks such as scholarly research or literature-based research while others consider it overlapping with PBL or sub-classify it based on the roles and responsibilities of teachers and students.
Although there are apparent benefits of IBL in higher education, particularly in fostering inquiry behavior, its outcomes in health professions education have not been fully understood. Thus, this article aims to conduct a scoping review of published literature exploring student outcomes in IBL curricula in health professions training. The objectives are to describe the extent of existing literature, characterize study designs and outcomes, and identify gaps where future studies on IBL should focus. In order to conduct this scoping review, the authors will analyze and synthesize the existing literature on inquiry-based learning in health professions education. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of student outcomes in IBL curricula, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current research.
The researchers intend to describe the extent of existing literature by identifying relevant studies that have explored student outcomes in IBL curricula within health professions training. They will search various databases and sources to ensure a comprehensive scope of the available literature.
To characterize study designs and outcomes, the authors will assess each included study for its research design, methodology, data collection methods, and analysis techniques. This approach will allow them to identify common patterns or trends across studies and highlight any variations in findings.
Additionally, this scoping review aims to identify gaps in the health professions education literature where future studies on IBL should focus. By conducting a thorough analysis of existing research, this review can reveal areas that have not yet been explored or require further investigation. These identified gaps can guide researchers towards future avenues of inquiry regarding student outcomes in IBL curricula.
The ultimate goal of this scoping review is to contribute valuable insights into understanding how IBL impacts student outcomes specifically within health professions training. By synthesizing the available evidence on this topic, researchers hope to shed light on both the benefits and limitations associated with implementing IBL approaches in these educational contexts.
The findings from this scoping review can serve as a foundation for future empirical studies examining student outcomes in relation to different aspects of inquiry-based learning. This may include exploring specific interventions or instructional strategies associated with successful implementation of IBL curricula as well as investigating potential factors influencing student engagement or motivation within these environments.
Through their comprehensive analysis and synthesis, the authors anticipate providing an overview of current knowledge regarding student outcomes resulting from inquiry-based learning approaches within health professions education. Ultimately, they aim for their work to inform educators' decision-making processes and contribute to the ongoing enhancement of educational practices in this field.
In conclusion, this scoping review will analyze and synthesize the existing literature on student outcomes in inquiry-based learning curricula within health professions education. By providing a comprehensive overview of available research, characterizing study designs and outcomes, and identifying gaps for future studies, this review aims to contribute valuable insights into understanding the impact of IBL on students' educational experiences in these professional training programs. 
This PubMed article discusses the health-seeking behavior of communities in Western Uganda regarding schistosomiasis treatment when mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel (PZQ) is delayed. Schistosomiasis is a significant public health issue, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, affecting over 240 million people. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using PZQ for MDA along with social mobilization and health education to control and prevent schistosomiasis.
Despite these interventions, it is not clear where communities go for PZQ treatment when MDA is not available. The goal of this study was to explore the health-seeking behaviors of communities along Lake Albert in Western Uganda during such periods to inform the implementation policy for achieving WHO's 2030 target of 75% coverage and uptake.
Schistosomiasis, one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), mainly affects sub-Saharan Africa, with Schistosoma mansoni being most prevalent in Uganda. Current control measures include preventive chemotherapy through MDA targeting school-going children aged 5-14 years old and adults in specific situations. Other measures include improving water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH), health education and sensitization activities, as well as snail control.
The WHO classifies schistosomiasis infection endemic areas into three levels: low (<10%), moderate (10-49%), and high (≥50%). They also recommend administering PZQ at least once every two years for low-endemic areas, once a year for moderate-endemic areas, and twice a year for high-endemic areas. However, despite these recommendations, Uganda has struggled to achieve the desired medication uptake rates among both school-going children and adult communities.
To ensure optimal outcomes and sustainability of PZQ uptake in Uganda's case specifically, there is a need to improve the implementation strategy of MDA. Additionally, individuals experiencing schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms should always seek PZQ treatment. Some common signs and symptoms include skin rash, fever, body aches, breathing difficulties, diarrhea and constipation, blood in the feces, and swollen bellies. Advanced stages of the disease may lead to liver fibrosis, intestinal ulcers, high blood pressure, stunted growth in children, cognitive impairment in children, and infertility in women.
Health-seeking behavior refers to the activities individuals undertake when they perceive themselves as having a health problem or being ill to find an appropriate remedy. Previous studies conducted worldwide have shown that people seek treatment from biomedical or traditional healthcare sources or both. The choice of treatment source can be influenced by various factors such as age, sex, education level, socioeconomic status, social networks ethnic beliefs attitudes among others.
Regarding schistosomiasis treatment with PZQ specifically, studies have shown varied findings. In some communities of Nigeria and Tanzania studied previously participants sought medication from both traditional and modern healthcare sources; however more regarded modern medicine as more effective. Factors such as absence or unawareness of MDA programs fear of side effects being busy or pregnant can contribute to not receiving PZQ drug treatment.
Gender disparities have also been observed regarding access to healthcare services for NTDs including schistosomiasis due to inequalities and power dynamics related to decision-making on seeking treatment finances. People with biomedical knowledge tend to seek treatments from modern sources if they perceive the symptoms as severe acute lack of health workers limited drug supplies long distances poor road networks lack of health information have also been identified as barriers hindering communities from accessing healthcare facilities specifically for schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms.
While previous studies have focused on health-seeking behaviors related to schistosomiasis treatment through MDA programs using PZQ these studies did not provide insight into where populations turn to when MDA programs are absent.
In Uganda, the PZQ-MDA program has been implemented for nearly 20 years, and the drugs are procured with support from development partners such as the schistosomiasis control initiative (SCI), ARISE, and ASCEND. The Ministry of Health's vector control division manages drug distribution to the districts.
This comprehensive introduction provides background information on schistosomiasis, its prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa and Uganda specifically, current control measures through MDA using PZQ, challenges in achieving optimal medication uptake rates, factors influencing health-seeking behaviors for various illnesses including schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms, previous studies' findings on health-seeking behaviors regarding schistosomiasis treatment using PZQ, and the need to understand where communities seek treatment in the absence of MDA programs. 
The introduction of this PubMed article starts by providing background information on the demographic dividend and its potential benefits for countries. In 2017, the African Union committed to harnessing the demographic dividend through investments in youth, which prompted leaders across the continent to develop policy roadmaps and action plans for attaining this dividend. The main idea is that countries can accelerate economic growth and maximize per capita gains by making strategic investments in health, education, and labor-market.
The demographic transition is then explained as a process initiated by declines in national fertility rates and infant/child mortality rates. These changes modify the population age structure, resulting in a larger labor force and lowered dependency ratio. However, it is emphasized that realizing these dividends requires optimal policy conditions.
It is also pointed out that countries have only a limited window of opportunity to act on maximizing the potential of the demographic dividend. The length of this window varies depending on factors such as historical context and development levels.
The article highlights that evidence supporting demographic dividend-favorable policies mainly comes from Southeast Asian and European countries with limited knowledge from African countries. This indicates a research gap that needs to be addressed.
Previous studies have suggested key policy areas to capitalize on the demographic transition including expanding family planning services, improving health/nutrition for mothers/children, increasing educational attainment, and investing in labor/economic sectors. However, specific policy investments/enactments for creating a favorable environment are less documented.
To address this gap, two literature reviews conducted by Population Reference Bureau (PRB) and World Bank are mentioned. They identified specific policy inputs conducive to achieving the demographic dividend among various West African countries. The PRB review particularly focused on legalizing contraception, disease prevention/public health investment, free public education provision etc., while World Bank review highlighted financial resource allocation/stakeholder support/institutional building/results monitoring.
Despite evidence-based policies existing for realizing the demographic dividend at hand, their incorporation into national planning is not well understood. Thus, a comprehensive review of the national policy landscape is needed.
The demographic transition stages of African countries are explained, indicating that most countries in sub-Saharan Africa are either in the pre-dividend or early-dividend phase. The different priorities for these phases are highlighted: pre-dividend countries should focus on human development outcomes to accelerate fertility decline and develop necessary skills for the labor market, while early-dividend countries should prioritize job creation to sustain economic growth.
The article acknowledges that specific policy enactments suggested in existing literature largely come from Southeast Asian and European countries, leaving a gap in knowledge for African countries. Therefore, the study aims to use the Demographic Dividend Framework developed by Gates Institute to review two pre-dividend African nations as case studies. The goal is to identify evidence-based policies conducive to fostering a demographic dividend-favorable environment, assess existing national policies for comprehensiveness and gaps, and provide recommendations for policy amendments.
Overall, this introduction sets up the context and purpose of the article by explaining what the demographic dividend is, its potential benefits for African countries, and gaps in knowledge regarding specific policies for achieving it. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a neurological disorder characterized by acute flaccid paralysis. It states that GBS is an immune-mediated neuropathy and the most common cause of paralysis worldwide, affecting approximately 100,000 individuals annually.
The authors discuss antecedent events that often precede the onset of GBS, such as surgery or infection, implicating various pathogens including Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, cytomegalovirus, Zika virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. These events are widely discussed in relation to GBS development.
GBS is generally categorized into demyelinating and axonal subtypes based on different immune responses at various sites in the body. The demyelinating subtype is known as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) and it involves the destruction of myelin in peripheral nerves due to infiltrating inflammatory cells. AIDP is identified as the most common subtype in Western countries. The authors highlight that antibodies can be detected on Schwann cells in AIDP patients.
Additionally, experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) is mentioned as an animal model used to study AIDP. EAN uses myelin epitopes P0 or P2 as major antigens to induce T-cell-mediated neuritis.
The second most common subtype of GBS is Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN), which primarily involves axonal injury without significant inflammation or demyelination. Antibodies related to AMAN include anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a antibodies. Interestingly, AMAN patients related to Campylobacter jejuni infection share structural similarities between gangliosides on peripheral nerves and lipo-oligosaccharides produced by this bacterium.
Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a variant of GBS, is characterized by facial muscle weakness and ataxia. Most MFS patients have antibodies against GQ1b ganglioside, suggesting their potential role in the disease mechanism and as diagnostic markers.
The authors emphasize the role of inflammatory cells and factors in the pathogenesis of GBS. Macrophages are discussed as playing a dual role—proinflammatory macrophages (M1) promote blood-nerve barrier disruption, cytokine production, and Th1 polarization leading to demyelination; anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) seem to have a protective function by promoting T-cell apoptosis, myelin removal, inhibition of inflammation, axon regeneration.
The involvement of T-cell subtypes is highlighted as contributing to the imbalance seen in GBS pathogenesis. The Th1 response activates and recruits macrophages to peripheral nerves causing damage either directly or through toxic substances release. Whereas the Th2 response acts as a suppressor and regulator of the Th1 pathway with observed resolving effects during recovery phase.
IL-17 and Th17 cells' emerging roles in immune diseases are briefly mentioned along with Treg cells' suppressive effect on inflammation. Furthermore, studies showed that regulatory T cells (Tregs) from both GBS patients and healthy individuals exhibited similar properties related to suppressing CD4+ effector T cells.
The introduction ends by mentioning cytokines' essential role in regulating cellular processes including growth differentiation modulation, immune response modulation, and participation in inflammatory responses. Proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IL-6 stimulate effector cell recruitment while inhibiting cytokines like IL-4 and IL-10 aid disease suppression or induce myelin repair.
Finally, the introduction notes that new strategies for identifying potential therapies for GBS patients have emerged from recent studies on its pathogenesis both using animal models such as EAN rats and clinical practice approaches.
Overall, this introduction provides an extensive overview of GBS, its subtypes, antecedent events, pathogenesis involving inflammatory cells and cytokines, as well as the potential for new therapeutic approaches. 
This introduction provides an overview of microneedles and their growing importance in various biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, biosensing, and body fluid extraction. The passage begins by highlighting the key benefits of microneedles. Firstly, the tips of these tiny needles can penetrate the skin's upper layers without touching nerve endings, minimizing bleeding and pain. This is advantageous for applications involving drug administration or device insertion for biomedical signal detection. Microneedles create microchannels on the skin through which molecules can pass or through which devices like electrodes can be brought to access biomedical signals.
Microneedles offer several advantages over traditional methods of drug administration. They bypass gastrointestinal digestion, allowing drugs to be directly absorbed into the bloodstream through the skin. This approach also accelerates drug absorption, extends its effective duration in the body, and enables patients to self-administer medication without requiring medical professionals.
In terms of biosensing, microneedles provide a means for continuous monitoring of biomarkers in interstitial fluid. This offers potential advancements in non-invasive sensing techniques for various health conditions.
The introduction then describes what a typical microneedle looks like—a microscale needle shaped like a cone or pyramid attached to a patch that adheres to the skin's surface. It mentions that while transdermal delivery via microneedles was proposed by Zhao et al., it was not until the 1990s that mass production became feasible due to limitations in micromachining technology.
Furthermore, this passage highlights different types of microneedles—solid, coated, soluble, and hollow—as well as various materials used for their construction: silicon (particularly mentioned), metals biomaterials (e.g., polymers). A wide range of fabrication methods has been explored including photolithography with selective etching; machining with chemical etching or micro-milling; laser cutting; 3D printing; soft lithography; micro-injection molding; hot embossing; electrohydrodynamic atomization; laser machining, electric-discharge machining with laser machining, drawing lithography, centrifugal lithography, and droplet-borne air blowing.
The article then specifies its focus on recent advancements in materials, fabrication methods, and biomedical applications of microneedles. It notes that many existing reviews primarily concentrate on drug delivery while neglecting other aspects such as biosensing and body fluid extraction. The painless nature and minimally invasive characteristics of microneedles have attracted attention in the field of biosensors for detecting biomarkers in human tissue fluid. Additionally, it mentions that there is a dearth of literature examining the fabrication methods used to construct microneedles.
In conclusion, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the importance and potential applications of microneedles in biomedical research. It highlights their advantages over traditional drug delivery methods while emphasizing their role in biosensing and body fluid extraction. Furthermore, it notes the variety of materials used for constructing microneedles as well as the numerous fabrication techniques employed to produce these devices. This particular article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the recent progress in the field of microneedles. It focuses on three main areas: materials, fabrication methods, and biomedical applications. The authors highlight that while previous reviews predominantly covered drug delivery applications, this review aims to encompass a broader range of topics such as biosensing and body fluid extraction.
One significant aspect addressed in this review is the selection of materials for constructing microneedles. While silicon is mentioned as a commonly used material, other options include metals, biomaterials, and polymers. The choice of material depends on factors such as biocompatibility, mechanical strength, and ease of fabrication. By summarizing various material options in this article, readers can gain insights into the pros and cons associated with each choice.
Another critical aspect explored within this review is the wide array of fabrication methods employed for producing microneedles. These methods involve advanced techniques like photolithography with selective etching or machining with chemical etching or micro-milling. Other innovative approaches such as 3D printing or soft lithography are also noted. By discussing these different fabrication methods comprehensively, readers can understand both current practices and potential future directions for producing microneedles.
The article goes beyond mere exploration of materials and fabrication methods by delving into different biomedical applications where microneedles have proven useful.
Firstly, it highlights drug delivery as one major application area for microneedles. With advantages like bypassing gastrointestinal digestion and enabling self-administration by patients without medical supervision, microneedle-based drug delivery systems offer promising alternatives to conventional routes like oral administration or injections.
Biosensing emerges as another area where microneedle technology has demonstrated its potential for innovation. Due to their minimally invasive nature when penetrating tissue fluids through microchannels created on skin surfaces by these needles, they provide unique opportunities for continuous monitoring of biomarkers present in interstitial fluid. This can have significant implications for diagnosing and managing various medical conditions.
Additionally, this review emphasizes the use of microneedles for body fluid extraction. By integrating microchannels into the skin using these needles, it becomes possible to extract specific fluids like blood or interstitial fluid without causing significant pain or discomfort to the patient. This application area holds promise for various diagnostic and monitoring purposes.
The article acknowledges that while existing reviews have provided insights into different aspects of microneedle technology, limitations in literature coverage persist. There is a scarcity of research regarding fabrication methods and discussions about the challenges associated with producing microneedles with high precision structures. However, this study aims to bridge such gaps by summarizing existing processing technologies comprehensively.
Overall, this PubMed article provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in materials, fabrication methods, and biomedical applications related to microneedles. By uncovering new possibilities offered by this technology and addressing areas that require further exploration, it serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested in advancing the field of microneedle-based biomedical devices. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the global burden of endometrial cancer in women. It states that endometrial cancer ranks as the sixth most common cancer among women worldwide and is the most common gynecologic cancer in several developed regions, including North America and Eastern and Northern Europe.
The introduction then discusses a concerning trend observed since the late 1990s. The incidence of endometrial cancer has rapidly increased in several developing countries during urbanization, including some Asian countries (Japan, Singapore, China, and the Philippines) and South Africa. This increase is suggested to be partially explained by changing environmental and lifestyle risk factors in these regions such as obesity epidemic, lack of physical activity, and prolonged sitting.
While obesity is a known risk factor for endometrial cancer, the association between sedentary behavior (characterized by low energy expenditure) and endometrial cancer remains largely unclear. The introduction mentions that technological innovation over the past few decades has led to prolonged sedentary time due to desk-based office work and screen-based recreation.
To support this discussion on sedentary behavior's impact on health outcomes beyond endometrial cancer specifically, it references the WHO Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior from 2020. These guidelines state that long sedentary time is associated with various negative health outcomes such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular diseases, obesity issues, and more recently total cancer morbidity.
Three previous meta-analyses investigating associations between sedentary behavior with various types of cancers have reported a 28% to 36% increased risk of endometrial cancer among individuals with higher levels of sedentary behavior. However, some evidence regarding sedentary behavior's association with endometrial-specific incidence was not included in existing review articles or meta-analyses at that time.
One possible reason for discrepancies in previous findings could be due to no distinction being made between different domains of sedentary behavior. The WHO Guidelines distinguish between various domains such as leisure-time, occupational, and total sedentary behavior. These domains may have different associations with adverse health outcomes due to varying confounding factors.
The introduction also emphasizes the need to consider the complex interplay of lifestyle factors in relation to endometrial cancer risk. Obesity is highlighted as a well-established risk factor for endometrial cancer, with a clear dose-response relationship. Prolonged sitting may be related to high BMI (body mass index), suggesting that obesity could mediate the link between sedentary behavior and cancer incidence.
Additionally, attention is given to physical activity as another potential protective factor against cancer risk, although less evidence exists on this topic compared to obesity's relationship with endometrial cancer.
To address these gaps in knowledge and provide comprehensive analysis on domain-specific (occupational and leisure-time) and total sedentary behavior in relation to endometrial cancer risk, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to include existing studies while considering different adjustment strategies for BMI and physical activity.
In summary, the introduction sets the stage by highlighting the global burden of endometrial cancer before delving into trends observed in developing countries during urbanization. It then explores the association between sedentary behavior and endometrial cancer while discussing possible reasons for inconsistent findings in previous studies. Finally, it outlines the objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a better understanding of how domain-specific sedentary behaviors impact endometrial cancer risk while considering confounding factors such as BMI and physical activity levels. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of calcaneal apophysitis (CA) or Sever’s disease, which is the most common cause of heel pain in children and young people. The incidence rate is reported to be 3.7 per 1000 patients, making it a significant musculoskeletal issue. CA accounts for a considerable number of consultations in sports clinics, ranging from 2% to 16%, and constitutes a noteworthy percentage of repetitive stress injuries in children (5.8%–22.7%).
The condition primarily affects girls between 7 and 12 years old and boys between ages 8 and 15, with a peak occurrence observed between ages 10 and 12 across both genders. CA was first described by Dr Sever in 1912 after observing sporadic continuous pain in the posterior area of the calcaneus (heel bone) among pediatric patients.
Histological studies have characterized CA as inflammation or bone edema resulting from stress fractures in the secondary growth center of the calcaneus. This inflammation is attributed to traction forces exerted by the triceps surae muscle on the hyaline cartilage that comprises CA.
The gender incidence ratio for CA remains controversial, with conflicting findings reported by various studies: some suggesting that it occurs more frequently in boys than girls at a ratio of around10:1 while others indicate ratios around3:1,2:1,or even1:1.
CA typically manifests as a unilateral condition; although dominant leg association may explain this tendency, there have been cases reported where it affects both sides simultaneously.
Diagnosis relies primarily on recognizing signs and symptoms but can also be supported by complementary tests such as X-ray imaging. The pain associated with CA usually localizes to the posterior and plantar side of the calcaneus or even at the Achilles tendon insertion site.
Various treatment approaches have been documented including stretching exercises for triceps surae, ice application, physical activity restriction, rest, topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, taping, and the use of foot orthoses and heel pads.
The causes of CA include rapid periods of growth resulting in muscle-tendon imbalances due to slower muscle development in comparison to bone growth. Additionally, obesity has been associated with an increased risk of CA due to valgus deformity of knees and ankles. Weight distribution among the lower limbs is noted to be higher on the affected side in children with CA. Overuse injuries also contribute to CA development through repetitive micro-traumas during activities such as running or jumping. The role of improper or insufficient footwear with inadequate cushioning can further worsen this factor.
Certain sports activities like athletics, football, basketball ballet, tennis have been identified as being associated with CA due to their demands on the feet on hard surfaces.
Biomechanical factors are often observed in patients with CA; 95% present with alterations affecting movement at the ankle joint such as limited dorsiflexion caused by restrictions in triceps surae or hamstring muscles.
Authors have identified different types of foot deviations associated with CA: some report flat feet with valgus calcaneus as common while others highlight a varus calcaneal deviation leading to a pronated foot under dynamic conditions. Two other causes linked to CA mentioned are clubfoot and pes cavus (high arches).
Given that knowledge about risk factors related to CA aids prevention and early treatment for this common condition among children and adolescents,pursuing a systematic review was undertaken.The purpose was therefore to identify both intrinsic (within individuals) and extrinsic (environmental) risk factors for developing Calcaneal apophysitis,in addition potential consequences associated after considering evidence provided from previous studies. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the significance of colorectal cancer (CRC) as a prevalent malignancy, ranking as the third most frequent among cancer patients. It states that CRC is responsible for more than 1.8 million new cases per year and approximately 900,000 annual deaths. Although advancements in cancer therapy have led to improved survival rates for CRC patients, the therapeutic outcomes remain suboptimal, with only a 12% five-year survival rate.
The complexity of CRC incidence and development is then discussed in relation to both exogenous and endogenous factors. Recent research in molecular pathological epidemiology has revealed a strong association between dietary and lifestyle factors and the risk of developing CRC. Factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, processed meat intake, genetic predisposition, and certain therapeutic agents like aspirin have been identified as potential contributors to CRC risk.
The article also mentions specific molecular aberrations found in CRC samples through large-scale sequencing studies. Hypermutation accompanied by microsatellite instability (MSI) caused by hypermethylation and suppression of the MLH1 gene is detected frequently in CRC samples. Furthermore, several candidate genes including APC TP53 SMAD4 PIK3CA KRAS are often found to be mutated.
A focus on understanding molecular processes and signaling pathways involved in CRC development follows this discussion. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), part of a signaling pathway that controls various cell activities like proliferation, metabolism, phenotype acquisition, motility, and angiogenesis emerges as a critical component implicated in driving CRC pathophysiology due to its impact on these cellular functions.
Attention then shifts towards long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which have been implicated in regulating the mTOR signaling pathway associated with cancers including colorectal cancer. lncRNAs are RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but play important roles influencing gene activity at different levels. Some lncRNAs exhibit features similar to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Oncogenic lncRNAs are demonstrated to stimulate tumor activity, while tumor suppressor lncRNAs inhibit it. Overexpression of specific lncRNAs has been associated with poor prognosis and metastatic behavior in CRC patients.
The potential of targeting lncRNAs as a therapeutic approach in CRC is also highlighted. RNA sequencing data from the TCGA dataset showed differential expression of around 200 lncRNAs in CRC patients, suggesting their involvement in the disease. Additionally, mTOR emerges as a potential target affected by these regulatory mechanisms involving lncRNA expression.
The introduction concludes by outlining the purpose of the systematic review – exploring and highlighting mTOR-associated lncRNAs using literature databases with an aim to identify possible correlations between specific lncRNA expressions and mTOR regulation in CRC cases. In this systematic review, the authors aim to investigate the potential role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating the mTOR signaling pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC). They begin by explaining that lncRNAs are a class of transcripts that are longer than 200 nucleotides and do not code for proteins. Despite lacking protein-coding capabilities, lncRNAs have been found to play crucial roles in gene regulation at various levels, including transcription, translation, and protein modification.
The authors highlight that previous studies have indicated the involvement of several lncRNAs in modulating the activity of the mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway is a critical signaling cascade that controls multiple cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, motility, and angiogenesis. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in various cancers, including CRC.
Moreover, dysregulated expression of certain lncRNAs has been associated with poor prognosis and metastatic behavior in CRC patients. These findings suggest that targeting these specific lncRNAs could serve as a potential therapeutic approach for CRC management.
To support their investigation into mTOR-associated lncRNAs in CRC cases, the authors rely on literature databases as valuable resources for identifying possible correlations between specific lncRNA expression patterns and mTOR regulation. They aim to gather relevant information from previous studies regarding interactions between particular lncRNAs and components within the mTOR pathway.
By synthesizing existing research findings on this topic through a systematic review approach, they hope to provide valuable insights into how various lncRNAs may influence or be influenced by mTOR activity in CRC cases. This thorough examination can help broaden our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying CRC development and progression while also highlighting prospective targets for future therapeutic interventions.
The study's methodology likely involves an extensive literature search using relevant keywords related to colorectal cancer (CRC), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and the mTOR pathway. The authors would then carefully select peer-reviewed articles that have investigated the association between specific lncRNAs and mTOR regulation in CRC. They may employ a standardized approach, such as Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to ensure the systematic review is conducted effectively.
The ultimate goal of this study is to provide an updated overview of mTOR-associated lncRNAs in CRC cases, thereby aiding future research efforts and potentially identifying novel targets for therapeutic interventions. By shedding light on the intricate interplay between lncRNAs and the mTOR pathway in CRC, this systematic review offers valuable insights into potential avenues for personalized medicine approaches and improved patient outcomes.
It is important to note that while the information provided here gives an understanding of the article's introduction section, additional details about specific methodologies, results, conclusions, and implications would be found in subsequent sections of the research article itself. 
This introduction provides background information on the tobacco control program initiated by Beijing, China, which aligns with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It highlights the significance of assessing the impact of this policy through a Health Impact Assessment (HIA). 
The introduction begins by emphasizing China's status as the world's largest tobacco consumer, with a consumption exceeding that of 39 other countries combined. It also states that smoking in China has resulted in numerous fatalities and high rates of secondhand smoke exposure among non-smokers.
Although China signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2005, it has taken time to fulfill its responsibilities. The country's tobacco monopoly has limited national progress towards implementing comprehensive measures recommended by the FCTC, such as smoking bans in public places.
However, there is evidence of progress at a local level, including Beijing. The city successfully implemented a smoking ban during the 2008 Olympics and later established several smoke-free regulations. In June 2015, Beijing introduced its comprehensive tobacco control regulation following smoke control measures and tax reforms at a national level.
Beijing's comprehensive policy aligns with six MPOWER measures recommended by WHO: Monitoring tobacco use; Protecting people from tobacco smoking; Offering help to quit tobacco; Warning about the dangers of tobacco; Enforcing tobacco advertising, promotion & sponsorship restrictions; Raising taxes on tobacco. These measures include bans on indoor and certain outdoor public spaces, higher taxes on cigarettes, anti-tobacco advertising efforts, cessation support systems establishment and media campaigns.
The introduction proceeds to provide statistical evidence supporting positive outcomes resulting from Beijing's policy implementation since 2015. Trends indicate reductions in cigarette sales per person as well as declines in smoking prevalence and secondhand smoke exposure over three years. Additionally, there have been significant decreases in hospital admissions for stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders following smoke control measures.
To evaluate these impacts comprehensively through an HIA process requires defining a set of indicators. Previous research on the Portuguese smoking prevention and tobacco control law used specific indicators such as mortality rates, hospital admissions, and smoking prevalence. However, those studies did not mention a clear indicator selection procedure nor comprehensive coverage. The WHO recommended four essential indicators for measuring the effects of tobacco control legislation but lacked process evaluation and focused solely on outcome evaluation.
Considering Beijing's unique local measures and the need for a more inclusive set of indicators, this study aims to identify appropriate indicators for scoping an HIA to assess Beijing's comprehensive tobacco control policy. The findings may serve as a reference for future HIAs in China or other developing countries.
In summary, this introduction provides context about China's significant tobacco consumption problem and previous efforts towards tobacco control. It highlights Beijing's comprehensive policy as well as positive outcomes associated with its implementation. Finally, it emphasizes the need to develop a set of indicators through an HIA approach to assess the policy comprehensively. This PubMed article focuses on the scoping of a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) to assess Beijing's comprehensive tobacco control policy. It recognizes the need to identify a comprehensive set of indicators that can effectively measure the impact of this policy and serve as a reference for future HIAs on tobacco control in China and other developing countries.
The introduction highlights the importance of conducting an HIA in evaluating the health effects of major policies, programs, or projects. HIA involves a combination of procedures, methods, and tools that judge the potential effects on population health and their distribution within that population.
The study acknowledges previous research conducted by Costa et al., which applied HIA methodology to assess Portugal's smoking prevention and tobacco control law. However, it notes that while some indicators were measured following this policy implementation, there was no mention of how these indicators were selected or whether they provided a comprehensive assessment.
In contrast to previous studies, this article emphasizes the need for a scientific indicator selection procedure when conducting an HIA in Beijing. It points out that Beijing's tobacco control policy includes various local measures like tobacco control complaint systems. Therefore, it suggests including process evaluation alongside outcome evaluation and expanding beyond just four essential indicators recommended by WHO: mortality rates, tobacco consumption levels, smoking prevalence rates, and evaluations of tobacco control policies.
The overall aim is not only to assess the outcomes but also evaluate processes such as compliance with smoke-free regulations or changes in public perceptions regarding smoking behavior. By developing a more comprehensive set of indicators through proper scoping techniques during an HIA process, it becomes possible to obtain more detailed insights into how effective Beijing's policy has been at reducing smoking-related harms.
The article concludes by emphasizing that successful identification of these indicators will contribute significantly not only to assessing Beijing's comprehensive tobacco control policy but also providing guidance for future HIAs focused on similar policies in China or other developing countries facing high rates of tobacco consumption.
Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the study's objective, which is to identify a comprehensive set of indicators for scoping an HIA of Beijing's tobacco control policy. It emphasizes the need for a well-defined indicator selection process and highlights previous shortcomings in indicator selection from other research studies. By conducting this study, the authors aim to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and impact of tobacco control measures implemented in Beijing while offering guidance for future HIAs in similar settings. 
This introduction provides an overview of the topic of the article, which focuses on the role of ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1) in stem cells and its potential for treating stem cell-related diseases. 
The introduction begins by highlighting the self-renewal and multidirectional differentiation potential of stem cells, which are divided into embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and adult stem cells (ASCs). It then mentions that stem cell therapy has promising application prospects, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to rebuild a patient's hematopoietic and immune system, and mesenchymal stem cells reducing transplantation rejection and severe lung injury induced by COVID-19.
Next, it states that mechanisms regulating the self-renewal and differentiation potential of stem cells can be compromised due to gene mutations, cell fusion, chromosomal mutations, etc., leading to tumor growth from malignant transformation. The importance of transcription factors like Oct4, Sox2 Nanog, Klf4, and c-Myc in regulating pluripotency, differentiation ability, and cell reprogramming is emphasized. However, recent studies have discovered that posttranscriptional modifications also play a critical role in regulating cellular processes and determining the fate of stem cells.
The introduction then describes various posttranscriptional modifications affecting mRNA biosynthesis including N6-methyladenosine (m6A), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), inosine (I), pseudouridine (Ψ), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), N6-2’-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am),and 7-methyguanosime(m7G). These modifications influence mRNA folding translation or transport processes.
The remaining part focuses on A-to-I editing which is the most common type of RNA editing in animals and its involvement in various gene regulatory mechanisms at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. It highlights the ADAR protein family, which was discovered in 1987 and contains three members: ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3. ADAR1, a specific adenosine deaminase, is explained to bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and convert adenosine (A) to inosine (I) as part of A-to-I editing. Mutations in the ADAR1 gene are associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) and Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH), both related to neurological lesions associated with chronic activation of type I interferon.
The introduction also mentions that apart from its role in triggering adaptive immunity, research has identified various effects of ADAR1 on immune cell functions such as early T-cell development or mediating T-cell immune tolerance. Moreover, it explains that knockout of ADAR1 leads to lethality or premature death of mouse embryos and describes how it promotes leukemia stem cell self-renewal via let-7 pri-microRNA editing.
Further on, it adds that ADAR1 plays a vital role in the survival and maintenance of intestinal stem cells by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress signals. Additionally, through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation triggered by Adar1 stimulus affects hematopoietic stem cells' regulation.
The introduction concludes by acknowledging that while some roles of ADAR1 in stem cells have been identified through research so far, there is still limited understanding regarding its mechanism as a potential target for clinical treatment for stem cell-related diseases. As a result,the article aims to discuss the protein structure,biological function,and potential therapeutic strategies associated withADRAr activityin stem cells based on existing knowledge thus far. In this article, the authors aim to delve deeper into the protein structure and biological function of ADAR1 in relation to stem cells. They also intend to explore potential treatment strategies for stem cell-related diseases based on ADAR1's role.
The significance of studying ADAR1's impact on stem cells lies in its ability to regulate vital biological processes. The previously mentioned study showing that knockout of ADAR1 leads to lethality or premature death in mouse embryos emphasizes the importance of RNA editing regulation through ADAR1. Moreover, specific functions of ADAR1 have been identified in different types of stem cells.
For instance, studies have revealed that ADAR1 plays a crucial role in promoting leukemia stem cell (LSC) self-renewal by editing let-7 pri-microRNA. By reprogramming malignant progenitor cells, ADAR1 contributes to leukemia progression. Additionally, it has been observed that knockdown of ADAR1 reduces the self-renewal ability of blast crisis leukemia stem cells (BC-LSC) in RAG2+ γc+ mice.
In relation to intestinal stem cells and gut homeostasis, it has been discovered that high expression levels of ADAR1 are found in Lgr5+ cells. Its absence leads to rapid apoptosis and loss of these active circulating stem cells within the small intestine and colon.
Furthermore, investigations have unveiled an association between the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation triggered byADRAr stimulus affecting regulation concerning malignant hematopoieticstemcells' proliferation.Notably,the exact mechanisms underlying howADRAr impacts diverse type sofstemcells have stillyet tobefully understood.Thus,thisreview aims not onlyto elucidatethe protein structureandbiologicalfunctionsofADRARinthe contextofstemcellsbut alsotoexplore itspotential asanovel target for treating diseases relatedtostemcells.Potential therapeuticstrategiesforstemcell-related diseases based on the function of ADAR1 will also be discussed.
Understanding the role of ADAR1 in stem cells has implications for potential therapeutic interventions. Manipulating ADAR1 activity or targeting its downstream pathways may offer new avenues for treating stem cell-related diseases, including certain types of leukemia or intestinal disorders.
In conclusion, this PubMed article provides a comprehensive introduction to the role of ADAR1 in stem cells. It highlights its importance in various aspects such as self-renewal, differentiation potential, and regulation of immune cell functions. The authors aim to further examine the protein structure and biological function of ADAR1 in relation to stem cells while exploring potential therapeutic strategies. This research carries significant implications for understanding the fundamental biology of stem cells and developing new treatment approaches for related diseases. 
The introduction of this PubMed article discusses the use of educational technologies in health professionals' education process, specifically focusing on the use of educational videos (EVs) in nursing education. It highlights that EVs are a valuable tool for promoting education and knowledge dissemination, as well as facilitating changes in healthcare practices. The accessibility and convenience provided by digital platforms make EVs accessible to a wide audience regardless of location or time.
The article mentions that the production of EVs requires careful structuring and organization of information. When properly developed, EVs serve as a solid foundation for understanding and effective reflection. They can be used in various teaching-learning environments to convey motivational concepts, experiences, and information.
Additionally, the article emphasizes the positive impact of EVs on nursing professionals' practice. Access to EVs on digital platforms enables nurses to update their knowledge on specific topics with potential positive repercussions on patient care.
The article further explains the three stages involved in developing an educational video: pre-production (script and storyboard preparation), production (recording and editing), and post-production (evaluation by the target audience). When created following these methodological steps, EVs become powerful tools for building knowledge and improving healthcare practices.
The introduction also cites a study that validates a video script and storyboard related to syphilis prevention and management. This study demonstrates that well-produced educational materials can contribute to better understanding issues surrounding syphilis prevention, diagnosis, treatment, changing behaviors related to safe sexual practices among nursing professionals as well as users seeking health services.
Other relevant studies discussed highlight how using videos contributes to advancing knowledge in nursing by helping students acquire practical skills while methodologically supporting development efforts for other educational videos within healthcare settings.
Considering the importance of methodological rigor in constructing quality EVs, some scientific literature reveals failures in fulfilling these steps which adversely affects material quality. Therefore, this review aims at presenting diverse information about methodologies used during production processes with emphasis on contributing towards creating safe, high-quality educational materials and promoting the dissemination of scientific knowledge within nursing.
The objective of this study is to evaluate the scientific evidence on various methodologies used by nursing professionals in the production of educational videos. Continuing with the explanation of this PubMed article, the authors justify the need for this study by highlighting the importance of methodological rigor in constructing educational videos. They argue that previous scientific literature has shown failures in fulfilling these methodological steps, which ultimately impacts the quality of educational materials produced. Therefore, this review aims to contribute to nursing professionals' knowledge by presenting diverse information about the methodologies used in EV production.
By evaluating scientific evidence on these methodologies, this study seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of best practices and strategies employed by nursing professionals when creating EVs. This approach is crucial for creating safe and high-quality educational materials that can effectively promote knowledge dissemination and contribute to ongoing education within the nursing field.
Furthermore, it is emphasized that incorporating validated educational technologies like videos into nursing professionals' practice supports permanent and continuing education efforts. By utilizing well-designed EVs as a means of learning and staying updated on new developments, nurses can enhance their skills and improve patient care outcomes.
The authors state that understanding detailed information about educational video production methods is particularly relevant for both education and healthcare. This knowledge would enable nursing professionals to incorporate validated strategies into their teaching methodologies while also ensuring high-quality content creation.
In summary, this article aims to evaluate scientific evidence regarding various methodologies employed by nurses during the production of EVs. By presenting an expansive overview of best practices within this field, it seeks to support educators in developing effective educational videos as well as promoting continuous professional development among nurses.
The utilization of properly structured EVs has proven potential for enhancing knowledge acquisition among learners while also advancing practical skills in real-world healthcare settings. The positive impact demonstrated through existing studies highlights how employing video-based teaching approaches can strengthen nursing education while offering methodological support for future EV productions across different areas within healthcare.
Ultimately, through a systematic evaluation of relevant literature on methodology utilization in developing nursing-focused EVs, this research contributes valuable insights towards improving instructional design frameworks aimed at producing accurate, engaging, and impactful educational materials. This knowledge has the potential to enhance nursing professionals' ability to deliver high-quality healthcare services and promote effective communication of scientific knowledge within the nursing field. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the ongoing burden of pediatric malnutrition in developing countries, specifically focusing on Southern Asia. It emphasizes that malnutrition is a crucial risk factor for morbidity and mortality worldwide. The introduction also mentions that approximately 1.9 billion people in the Asia and Pacific region have limited access to healthy diets, emphasizing the critical need for improving diet quality, especially in children.
The article draws attention to the differentiation between nondisease-related malnutrition (related to environmental factors) and disease-related or illness-related malnutrition (caused by underlying diseases). Nondisease-related malnutrition occurs due to limited food access or decreased dietary intake, resulting in an imbalance relative to nutritional needs and impacting growth, development, and overall health. Disease-related malnutrition can progress as a result of increased catabolism, decreased appetite, or increased energy losses due to acute or chronic disease.
The impact of disease-related malnutrition is discussed with respect to increased hospital stays and financial burdens. For example, a study conducted in the Netherlands estimated annual medical costs of €80 million for disease-related malnutrition in hospitalized children.
It is emphasized that long-term nutrition support is necessary for children with chronic diseases to prevent growth faltering, impaired development, and poor health-related quality of life. The causes of malnourishment vary among different chronic diseases such as congenital heart disease (CHD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic liver disease (CLD), malignancy, or infectious diseases like diarrhea, AIDS tuberculosis,and parasite infections.
The importance of regular assessment and management for children with chronic diseases is stressed because nutritional deficiencies make them more susceptible to infections due to a weakened immune response. The interlinked factors contributing are undernourishment itself along with infectious diseases and immune system impairment.
The authors note that their research focuses on chronic malnourishment in children with various chronic illnesses which has received less attention compared to malnourishment caused by infectious diseases in developing countries. They highlight the need for comprehensive assessments, including anthropometry, clinical evaluation, feeding tolerance observations, and biochemistry analysis, to ensure adequate nutrition.
The introduction discusses the challenges in recognizing and addressing malnutrition due to lack of uniform definitions, variable screening practices, and an inadequate recognition of nutrition as a crucial component of patient care. It also acknowledges that resource limitations in developing countries affect assessment availability and regular monitoring for achieving favorable outcomes.
Furthermore, the study's concept is traced back to an expert meeting with six child health professionals who discussed the current challenges in managing malnutrition in chronically ill children. The purpose of this study is stated as reviewing available articles on measuring malnutrition specifically within pediatric chronic diseases in developing countries where limited resources restrict identification of nutritional status.
Overall, this introduction sets the stage for understanding the significance of pediatric malnutrition globally and highlights specific factors related to nondisease-related malnutrition versus disease-related or illness-related malnutrition. It emphasizes the need for improved nutrition support for children with chronic diseases while outlining some key challenges faced in implementing effective strategies. The subsequent sections of the article are likely to delve deeper into the specific objectives, methods, and findings of the study. The researchers aim to address the gap in understanding and managing malnutrition in children with chronic diseases, particularly within resource-limited settings.
To accomplish this goal, they conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature on measuring malnutrition in pediatric chronic disease. Their focus is primarily on developing countries where there are constraints in identifying nutritional status accurately due to limited resources and complex conditions.
The article thus highlights the importance of anthropometry assessment (e.g., measurement of height, weight, head circumference) as well as clinical evaluation for detecting signs and symptoms related to malnourishment. This includes observations on feeding tolerance and biochemical analyses that provide objective data about nutrient levels in the body.
However, it acknowledges that uniform definitions for malnutrition are lacking across studies and screening practices can vary significantly. Consequently, recognizing malnutrition prevalence rates becomes challenging. The authors emphasize that nutrition should be considered an integral part of patient care and not be overlooked or underrecognized.
Furthermore, it acknowledges resource limitations faced by developing countries when conducting assessments for malnourished children with chronic illnesses. Availability of necessary resources (such as trained healthcare professionals and tools/equipment) along with regular monitoring become essential factors influencing successful outcomes.
The introduction also mentions how this research emerged from an expert meeting where child health professionals discussed current challenges associated with managing malnutrition among chronically ill children. This highlights collaboration among experts as well as their collective effort to address key issues regarding pediatric malnutrition within the context of chronic diseases.
Overall, this introduction sets up a framework for understanding the significance of pediatric malnutrition within developing countries while emphasizing its connection to chronic diseases. It describes various factors contributing to both disease-related and nondisease-related forms of malnourishment while underscoring the need for adequate nutrition support throughout childhood illness trajectories.
By outlining challenges related to identifying nutritional status accurately and the limitations faced by resource-limited settings, the article creates a context for understanding the relevance and objectives of the study. This information serves as a foundation for subsequent sections that likely delve into specific methods employed by the researchers to meet their objectives and present their findings. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of cardiomyopathies, which are disorders of the heart muscle (myocardium) caused by both genetic and environmental factors. These conditions ultimately lead to impaired cardiac function and heart failure.
Cardiomyopathies can have different effects on the function and structure of the heart, as well as the presence of arrhythmias. They are categorized into several types, including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). DCM is the most common form, affecting approximately 1 in 250 individuals, followed by HCM affecting 1 in 500 people. ACM is less common, occurring in about 1 in 5,000 individuals.
Around 30% to 50% of cardiomyopathies have a heritable component, meaning they can be passed down through generations. Different types may have distinct phenotypes (observable characteristics), prognosis (outcomes), and causal mutations responsible for their development.
In HCM specifically, mutations in sarcomeric genes are primarily implicated. Sarcomeres are structural units within muscle cells that enable contraction. Pathogenic variants in genes such as beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and myosin binding protein C3 (MYBPC3) occur frequently and affect proteins within thick filaments of sarcomeres. These mutations typically lead to disease onset around a person's forties.
On the other hand, DCM exhibits functional diversity among its causative genes. Mutations involving Titin (TTN)—a giant protein involved in maintaining muscle structure—account for around 12% to 25% of DCM cases. Lamin gene variants representing LMNA rank second among these patients' genetic mutations. Other affected genes include MYH7, TNNT2 Tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), Desmoplakin (DSP), RNA binding motif protein 20 (RBM20), and sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 5 (SCN5A).
In ACM, pathogenic variants often occur in genes encoding proteins that make up desmosomes, which are structures involved in cell adhesion. Genes such as Plakoglobin (JUP) DSP, Plakophilin-2 (PKP2), Desmoglein-2 (DSG2), and Desmocollin-2(DSC2) play critical roles in ACM development.
Restrictive cardiomyopathies are typically caused by mutations in sarcomeric genes like cardiac troponin I. To a lesser extent, mutations in other genes such as Desmin (DES) and Filamin C also contribute to this type of cardiomyopathy.
Although different types of cardiomyopathies have distinct clinical presentations, their underlying mechanisms and phenotypic features can overlap significantly.
Advances in genetic sequencing techniques like next-generation sequencing and genome-wide association studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis for cardiomyopathies. Multiple studies have identified susceptibility regions and genetic variants associated with various types of these conditions. It is important to note that most rare disease-causing variants are found within coding regions of the genome.
For example, truncations—where part of a gene is missing—of the TTN gene are considered leading genetic causes of DCM when present. On the other hand, MYBPC3 truncating variants or missense variants—where there is a change in a single DNA building block—are prominent among HCM-causing mutations detected using next-generation sequencing methodologies.
Despite these advancements, there can still be difficulty identifying specific causative variants for familial cases using targeted genetic screening tests based on whole exome sequencing or limited region-focused sequencing approaches.
The introduction suggests that noncoding genetic variants, which are changes in DNA segments that do not code for proteins, may play a significant role in cardiomyopathies. Whole genome sequencing has provided evidence supporting the association between noncoding genetic variants and these heart diseases.
Emerging research also highlights the importance of disruption in regulatory regions within the genome. For example, alterations in transcription factor binding sites within enhancers or promoters can have an impact on the 3D chromatin structure and reduce gene expression, which can be crucial for disease development.
Furthermore, noncoding variants within intronic or untranslated regions (UTRs) could also contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies. In fact, a substantial percentage of non-coding variants at splice sites (where coding segments are joined together) and UTRs have been classified as either pathogenic or likely pathogenic.
In this review article, the authors emphasize exploring noncoding genetic variants and their association with cardiomyopathies. Specifically focusing on promoter regions (which initiate gene expression), enhancers (regulatory elements that influence gene activity), untranslated regions (sections before protein coding sequences), splicing sites (important for mRNA processing), and intronic regions may provide valuable insights into how these mutations contribute to cardiac disease development.
The accompanying figure provides a schematic illustration of various noncoding parts of eukaryotic genomes—including enhancer, promoter, 5′ UTRs (untranslated regions), introns, and 3′ UTRs—highlighting their relevance in this context.
Overall, this introduction sets up the importance of studying noncoding genetic variations in understanding cardiomyopathies beyond just coding region mutations—a perspective that is supported by recent advances using next-generation sequencing techniques. 
This PubMed article focuses on lung cancer, which is responsible for the highest number of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In 2018 alone, there were over 1.5 million deaths from lung cancer, with an incidence rate exceeding 2 million cases (11.6%). The majority of lung cancer cases are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic stage lung cancer, leading to limited curative options and poor outcomes. Over the past few decades, innovative strategies have been developed to address this challenge. For instance, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been designed to target specific mutations in tumor cells that drive their growth and survival. Immunotherapies have also emerged as a promising approach.
On one hand, personalized medicine based on molecular alterations specific to individual patients has demonstrated efficacy in clinical applications but is only applicable to a subset of the population. On the other hand, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are now widely used but elicit varying response rates. Less than 40% of patients selected based on programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression show positive responses.
With the aim of improving clinical outcomes for lung cancer patients, numerous biomarkers have been investigated over recent decades. One such biomarker is PD-L1 expression in tumor biopsy samples which helps identify individuals who may benefit from ICI treatment. Patients with high PD-L1 tumor proportion scores (TPS ≥50%) exhibit superior response rates compared to platinum-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment option.
Despite these advancements, resistance and relapses still occur frequently among treated patients. Consequently, global age-standardized five-year survival rates remain low at around 10-20%, exhibiting only a modest increase of up to 5%. This necessitates further refinement and improvement in clinical management approaches for lung cancer.
To enhance patient care and monitoring throughout all stages of lung cancer, soluble biomarkers have been explored in plasma or total blood samples. These biomarkers offer advantages such as real-time monitoring, feasibility of repeated measurements, and the ability to detect disease progression even in cases where radiographic assessment is inconclusive (known as biological minimal residual diseases). Liquid biopsy techniques utilizing these circulating tumor-derived products have even been integrated into clinical practice for research and monitoring purposes, particularly in relation to oncogenic addiction under TKI treatment. In the realm of ICI therapy, inflammation-related biomarkers show particular promise due to their association with a worse prognosis. Inflammation affects immune modulation within both tumor cells and their microenvironment, which ultimately influences disease-related outcomes.
Despite recent technical advancements, no soluble biomarkers have yet been approved and validated for the management of lung cancer patients. However, there is growing interest in identifying a soluble biomarker that could predict response to ICI treatment while overcoming limitations associated with tissue-based analyses.
Several serum-based biomarkers are currently being explored or investigated further. Apart from blood cell counts (neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets) that have shown potential prognostic value with regard to ICI efficacy; other promising serum-based biomarkers include soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).
In conclusion, this article highlights the significant burden of lung cancer globally and discusses approaches such as personalized medicine and immunotherapy that aim to improve patient outcomes. It also emphasizes the need for effective biomarkers capable of assisting clinicians in making treatment decisions regarding ICI therapy specifically. Ongoing exploration of serum-based markers holds promise but requires further validation before implementation into routine clinical practice. 
This introduction provides an overview of the key concepts and issues addressed in the PubMed article. It begins by highlighting the large distribution ranges observed in many marine organisms, which is often attributed to the absence of physical barriers. The average range of a teleost reef fish in the Indo-Pacific region is estimated to be 9 million km2, while a typical freshwater fish range is only around 350,000 km2.
The introduction then emphasizes that population structure and dispersal patterns in marine ecosystems are much larger in spatial scale compared to terrestrial and freshwater environments. This phenomenon can be attributed to long-distance colonization and range expansion processes influenced by oceanographic and geographic factors.
Furthermore, the introduction states that genetic variation within species is linked to geographical processes that result in sub-divided populations. This has implications for management practices related to commercial exploitation and conservation efforts.
The role of sharks and rays in maintaining coastal and oceanic ecosystem structure is emphasized next. Sharks serve as top predators, while smaller ones function as mesopredators or prey for larger sharks and other oceanic predators. The unique life history traits of elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, skates), such as late sexual maturity, long gestation period, low fecundity, slow growth rate, high maternal investment, and long lifespans are highlighted as reasons why their populations are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures such as overfishing, habitat modification pollution ,and climate change.
Accordingly,m The primary cause of decline among shark and ray populations is identified as overfishing due to rates exceeding their capacity for replenishment. Additionally,m more than half of this fishing mortality arises from bycatch – unintentionally captured animals not targeted for fishing.
The expansion of shark fishing industry is also attributed partly due declining availability commercial fishes (teleosts) or strict restrictions on capturing them.
The diverse habitats occupied by sharks - including coastal waters,, pelagic waters,, limiting to continental shelves, and completely oceanic species - are mentioned, along with the distribution of rays that are mainly marine with some adapted for low salinity habitats and freshwater environments.
 
Population subdivisions in rays are considered more common than in sharks due to limited dispersal and geographical impediments. The aggregation of coastal shark populations for mating and parturition at specific locations is noted as a factor influencing genetic divergence between populations within different geographic regions.
Several examples are provided to support these concepts. For instance, observations about philopatry (returning to the natal site) among blacktip reef sharks in the Indo-Pacific highlight its contribution to genetic structuring. Another example concerns bull sharks, where significant genetic variation was observed among nurseries suggesting male-biased dispersal patterns.
The introduction underscores that understanding elasmobranch biology and life history is essential for developing effective species-specific management plans. Challenges related to governing shark and ray populations across international waters are discussed due to migrations crossing national boundaries and lack of comprehensive knowledge about migratory habits.
Lastly, it is indicated that present conservation efforts for sharks and rays suffer from inadequate resources (funds, technical capacity), as well as limited political will required for efficient monitoring, control, and management of elasmobranch fisheries/trade.
The introduction concludes by stating the purpose of the study: examining patterns of phylogeography (spatial genetics)and population structure within families both within individual species’ levels,and across multiple families  And provide insights through a meta-analysis combining data from various sources(publications,and unpublished studies.) 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the research progress and challenges in treating retinovascular diseases, particularly focusing on retinal artery occlusion (RAO). It highlights the significant investments made in recent years to study and develop treatments for retinovascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and macular diseases like age-related macular degeneration. These efforts have resulted in improved outcomes for patients with these conditions.
However, the same level of success has not been achieved in treating RAO. The introduction explains that there are several reasons for this disparity. One factor is that there are fewer RAO patients compared to other retinovascular diseases. Additionally, many central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) patients come for treatment after the theoretical time limit for neuron survival in the retina.
CRAO is described as an ocular variant of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), sharing similar predispositions and pathogenetic mechanisms. The different types of CRAO are explained based on etiology, permanency of occlusion, and preexisting collateral supply. It is noted that spontaneous improvements in vision occur more frequently in transient NA-CRAO cases compared to other types.
The introduction emphasizes that a significant proportion of CRAO cases result in profound and irreversible loss of vision. Conservative treatment approaches have shown unsatisfactory results compared to natural history outcomes.
The article mentions guidelines provided by organizations like the American Heart Association (AHA), American Stroke Association (ASA), and American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) which provide instructions on managing acute stroke and CRAOs respectively.
Local intra-arterial thrombolysis is acknowledged as a common practice despite its similarity in efficacy with conservative therapy but with higher rates of adverse events. Criticisms regarding study design limitations are also mentioned.
The review then introduces the concept of neuroprotection as an additional strategy alongside existing approaches for NA-CRAO care. It highlights the importance of considering neuroprotection in ocular stroke management and redirects attention to this aspect that is often overshadowed by revascularization techniques.
The article acknowledges the lack of randomized controlled studies providing clear guidelines or recommendations for treatment, stating it as a cause for concern. However, it mentions ongoing clinical trials investigating the use of intravenous thrombolytic agents such as alteplase and Tenecteplase in NA-CRAO patients within specific time frames after symptom onset.
The introduction concludes by emphasizing that despite cases of successful reperfusion without significant vision improvement, issues surrounding retinal survival time play a crucial role in explaining the lack of visual improvement in CRAO cases. It mentions a study by Jusufovic et al., which sheds light on these factors contributing to vision outcomes.
Overall, the introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the research landscape surrounding retinovascular diseases and especially focuses on the challenges faced in treating CRAO. It sets up the rationale for further exploration of neuroprotection as an important aspect of ocular stroke management. Continuing from the previous explanation, the introduction of this PubMed article highlights that outcomes for patients with CRAO have remained unchanged over the past three decades. This lack of progress underscores the need for new approaches and a deeper understanding of effective treatments.
In addressing this need, the article mentions ongoing clinical trials investigating intravenous alteplase and Tenecteplase for treating NA-CRAO. These studies aim to assess the role of treatment within a specific time window after symptom onset. The phase 2 trial (REVISION) and phase 3 trial (THEIA) focus on intravenous alteplase administration less than 4.5 hours after symptom onset in NA-CRAO patients.
Additionally, there is another phase 3 study called TENecteplase in Central Retinal Artery Occlusion Study (TenCRAOS), which investigates the use of intravenous Tenecteplase for CRAO specifically.
The introduction recognizes that reperfusion of the retina can occur in some cases without significant improvement in vision. It explains that issues related to retinal survival time are major factors contributing to this lack of improvement. The concept elaborated by Jusufovic et al., likely explores factors such as ischemic damage threshold and delayed neurotoxicity beyond simple reperfusion.
Despite advancements in research on various aspects of retinovascular diseases, including revascularization techniques, there has been limited attention given to neuroprotection as an important component of ocular stroke management.
The introduction also acknowledges limitations in current knowledge and treatment recommendations due to a lack of randomized controlled studies providing clear guidance on managing CRAO effectively.
Concluding remarks highlight that these ongoing clinical trials investigating intravenous thrombolysis may bridge important gaps in knowledge and provide valuable insights into its efficacy for treating NA-CRAO patients within specific treatment windows.
Overall, this introduction serves multiple purposes: it sets a background by discussing improvements achieved in treating some retinovascular diseases while acknowledging the lack of progress in addressing CRAO. It introduces CRAO as an ocular variant of acute ischemic stroke, explains its classification, and highlights the urgency associated with timely treatment. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for neuroprotection alongside revascularization techniques and acknowledges ongoing clinical trials investigating intravenous thrombolysis as potential game-changers in NA-CRAO treatment outcomes. 
This introduction provides an overview of the topic of interest, which is the comparison between laparoscopic transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) and ultrasound-guided TAPB for postoperative pain control in patients undergoing major colorectal surgeries. 
It starts by highlighting that TAPB is commonly used in colorectal surgeries to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption. However, there are controversies surrounding the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic TAPB compared to ultrasound-guided TAPB.
The article then discusses the background context, stating that minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has become recommended for treating colorectal diseases due to its equivalent efficacy and improved functional recovery. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways have also been implemented to shorten hospital stays and reduce costs without compromising surgical outcomes. However, acute postoperative pain remains a common concern within ERAS protocols.
Regular administration of opioids for pain relief is associated with several adverse effects such as postoperative ileus, nausea and vomiting, delayed mobilization, urinary retention, somnolence, and delirium. The article mentions that despite efforts towards opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia techniques, optimal pain management after MIS surgeries still lacks consensus.
Next, it explains what TAPB entails - the injection of a local anesthetic between specific muscles in the abdominal wall to target segmental nerves at a certain level. The use of TAPB during laparoscopic colorectal surgery has already proven effective in reducing opioid consumption.
The ERAS Society Guidelines strongly recommend using TAPB instead of epidural analgesia for colorectal MIS surgery. Both laparoscopic and ultrasound-guided approaches have been developed to improve accuracy while minimizing risks associated with peritoneal penetration.
The article acknowledges that although ultrasonography training among anesthesiologists is common in tertiary referral centers due to its advantages such as dynamic imaging capabilities without radiation exposure or contraindications, it may not be readily available in primary hospitals due to resource constraints. Additionally, even with ultrasound guidance, there is a risk of procedure-related injury.
Laparoscopic TAPB appears to be a potential alternative that minimizes risks associated with peritoneal penetration but may compromise the precise positioning of nerves and tissue planes compared to ultrasound-guided TAPB.
The existing systematic reviews on this topic have focused on comparing TAPB with no-TAPB locoregional analgesia or placebo control in colorectal surgery. However, these reviews have limitations in terms of sample size and their ability to provide conclusive evidence.
Given the controversies surrounding laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB and the lack of high-quality evidence guiding clinical practice, the researchers hypothesize that surgeon-performed laparoscopic TAPB will be non-inferior to anesthesiologist-delivered ultrasound-guided TAPB.
To address this hypothesis and provide more robust evidence for postoperative analgesia in colorectal MIS surgeries, the authors conduct a meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness and safety of these two specific TAPB approaches.
Overall, this introduction sets up the research problem by highlighting current controversies and knowledge gaps regarding pain management techniques in colorectal surgeries. It explains the rationale for investigating laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB and establishes the aim of conducting a meta-analysis to address these gaps. Continuing from the previous explanation, the article highlights the need for high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice in determining whether laparoscopic TAPB is as effective and safe as ultrasound-guided TAPB for postoperative analgesia in colorectal MIS surgeries.
The authors mention that existing systematic reviews on this topic have primarily focused on comparing TAPB with various control groups or no-TAPB locoregional analgesia. However, these reviews have limitations due to small sample sizes and their inability to provide a conclusive consensus.
Given these limitations, the researchers aim to conduct a meta-analysis that specifically focuses on laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB in colorectal MIS surgeries. By integrating both direct and indirect comparisons, they hope to provide a more comprehensive analysis that can guide individualized clinical practice.
The article mentions that previous research has shown favorable outcomes with the use of TAPB in colorectal surgeries. The ERAS Society Guidelines for Perioperative Care in Elective Colorectal Surgery 2018 strongly recommend its use instead of epidural analgesia in these procedures.
In addition, both laparoscopic (Lap-) and ultrasound-guided (US-) approaches have been instrumental in reducing peritoneal penetration risks during TAPB and improving accuracy by aiding visualization of nerves and tissue planes. The authors acknowledge that while ultrasonography is an optimal imaging modality for peripheral nerves, its availability may be limited due to resource constraints at primary hospitals.
Moreover, although laparoscopy minimizes intraperitoneal injection risks associated with peritoneal penetration during Lap-TAPB compared to US-TAPB, precise nerve positioning could be compromised when using this approach.
To address these concerns and uncertainties surrounding laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB techniques, the present study seeks to compare their effectiveness and safety using a meta-analysis approach. This will enable researchers to pool together available evidence and analyze the outcomes of both approaches comprehensively.
The ultimate goal of this research is to provide better guidance for clinicians performing postoperative analgesia in colorectal MIS surgeries. By evaluating the current evidence surrounding laparoscopic and ultrasound-guided TAPB, the authors hope to determine whether either approach is more effective and safer than the other, thus aiding in individualized clinical decision-making.
In conclusion, this PubMed article introduces the context of TAPB as a commonly used technique for postoperative pain control in colorectal surgeries. It highlights controversies regarding laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided approaches and emphasizes that existing systematic reviews have limitations in providing conclusive evidence. The researchers aim to fill these knowledge gaps by conducting a meta-analysis that systematically compares the effectiveness and safety of these specific TAPB approaches. 
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures for various applications, such as studying drug efficacy and toxicity, as well as creating disease models. Compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, 3D-culture models provide a more accurate representation of the in vivo environment and therefore improve the quality of experiments conducted.
The advancements in 3D devices and technologies have led to the development of microfluidic chips known as organ-on-a-chip (OOC) systems. These OOC devices are designed to mimic the cellular microenvironment found in human organs by incorporating features like fluid flow through micro-channels to simulate vasculature networks. This allows for the provision of nutrients and transportation of waste and metabolites within these simulated systems. By mimicking both structural features and physical conditions, OOC models have great potential for translating in vitro findings into better understanding human physiology.
One significant advantage offered by OOCs is the potential to make drug discovery processes faster and cheaper compared to conventional methods, with cost reductions estimated up to 26%. However, despite progress made thus far, their broad applicability is hindered by a lack of online detection schemes that enable real-time observation of cellular behaviors. This limitation restricts our understanding of cellular mechanisms over time and hampers efforts to correct defects or improve OOC model production.
To date, several analytical techniques have been employed in conjunction with OOCs for monitoring cellular behavior, including optical imaging methods like phase contrast microscopy or fluorescence-based assays alongside electrochemical sensors or label-free assays such as photonic crystal technology. Additionally, capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS) have been used successfully given their high sensitivity and specificity for analyzing changes in metabolites, proteins, lipids within cultured cells.
However MS cannot be directly integrated with OOCs due mainlyto challenges posed by cell media present in the chambers, which typically contain salts, nonvolatile buffers, and compounds that can interfere with MS analysis by creating ion suppression. The current approach relies on offline sample preparation methods to normalize chip-to-chip variability or manipulate cell excretes before MS analysis. Unfortunately, this significantly reduces the ability to track metabolites over time - an essential factor for unraveling cellular mechanisms.
Given the advantages offered by MS for biomedical applications, this article focuses specifically on investigating approaches that enable direct coupling of OOCs with MS. The review examines different techniques and hyphenation methods that bridge OOCs with MS analysis including electrophoresis, solid phase extraction, liquid chromatography and droplet-based chips. These techniques are assessed for their strengths and limitations in enabling real-time analysis.
This comprehensive review is intended to summarize recent developments in direct coupling of OOCs with MS analysis techniques. By evaluating various approaches and considering their capabilities as well as weaknesses for real-time analysis, it provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in developing robust interfaces that allow rapid and specific characterization of OOC content using MS as the analytical tool of choice. Furthermore, the article specifically focuses on the techniques used to evaluate mimetic tissue models in OOCs. Along with a brief discussion on traditional methods such as phase contrast microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), there is an emphasis on the use of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. TEER allows researchers to assess the barrier function of epithelial cell layers in OOCs and provides valuable insights into cellular behavior in these complex systems.
After providing an overview of the general analytical techniques used for OOC evaluation, the review delves into MS as a powerful tool for studying metabolites, proteins, and lipids within 3D cell systems. By utilizing MS for in-situ monitoring of OOCs, researchers can gain insight into the molecular composition of culture media, excreted metabolites, and waste products. The high sensitivity and specificity of MS make it an ideal candidate for unraveling intricate metabolic pathways within these complex cellular models.
However, despite its advantages, integrating MS directly with OOCs poses several challenges. The presence of cell media in OOC chambers containing salts, nonvolatile buffers, and interfering compounds can lead to ion suppression during MS analysis. This issue restricts real-time analysis capabilities since offline sample preparation methods are currently employed to normalize chip-to-chip variability or manipulate cell excretes before undergoing MS analysis.
To address this challenge and enable real-time analysis of molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, or proteins within OOCs using MS technology directly coupled to these systems is being explored. The review explores various hyphenation techniques that bridge the gap between OOC platforms and MS analysis including electrophoresis-based approaches which allow separation prior to detection by mass spectrometry.
Additionally solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography are examined as possible strategies for sample pre-treatment or isolation before introducing samples into mass spectrometers.The potential utility of droplet-based chips, which offer a highly controlled microfluidic environment and the ability to compartmentalize samples, is also explored.
As with any analytical technique, there are limitations associated with each approach. The review provides an in-depth analysis of these limitations and challenges encountered when coupling OOCs with MS. By understanding these constraints, researchers can make informed decisions regarding the choice of methodologies that best suit their specific research needs.
Overall, this PubMed article serves as an exhaustive review of the recent developments in direct coupling of OOCs with MS analysis. It aims to facilitate the development of robust interfaces for analyzing OOC content using MS as a rapid, sensitive, and specific technique. By highlighting the capabilities and shortcomings of each approach for real-time analysis within complex cellular systems like OOCs, this article represents a valuable resource for researchers seeking to advance our understanding of cellular mechanisms and optimize drug discovery processes through improved analytical methodologies. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the recognition and adoption of digital health by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO resolution acknowledges the importance of digital technology in achieving universal health coverage and sustainable development goals. This sets the stage for understanding the relevance and significance of digital healthcare (DHC), which involves the convergence of digital technology with healthcare.
The article then explains that DHC has become increasingly important due to various factors, such as changes brought about by the fourth industrial revolution, demographic shifts like population aging, and social changes such as widespread use of smart devices. These factors have increased the demand for DHC.
Furthermore, it points out that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the adoption and spread of DHC. Contactless healthcare services enabled by digital technology have become more prevalent than ever before.
Next, it introduces musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) as a significant health issue. MSDs encompass a wide range of chronic conditions affecting bones, joints, and soft tissues. Musculoskeletal pain is a common symptom associated with MSDs, with low back and neck pain being leading causes of disability worldwide.
The article provides alarming statistics about MSD prevalence globally – approximately 1.71 billion individuals suffer from these disorders, making them a major cause of disability worldwide. In specific countries like the UK and Korea mentioned in this introduction section's cited references also face high rates of MSDs among their populations.
Rehabilitation is emphasized as an essential component for managing MSDs effectively throughout patients' lives at different stages starting from childhood to old age. It mentions that exercises designed to increase muscle strength, flexibility, and mobility play an integral role in patients' rehabilitation programs.
Pain control is also highlighted as a major concern when caring for individuals with MSDs undergoing rehabilitation programs.
 
Additionally mentioned are initiatives like Austria's secondary preventive program aimed at preventing rehospitalization through observation studies where physical inactivity was found to be strongly associated with healthcare service needs.
The article then explores the potential of DHC in enhancing musculoskeletal rehabilitation. It explains that using digital health technologies like Internet-based platforms, smartphone applications, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) can make rehabilitation more interactive and engaging. The availability of accelerometer-based physical activity trackers on smartphones and smartwatches is also mentioned as a practical feature for individuals unfamiliar with advanced technology, including older adults.
Despite highlighting the promising prospects of DHC in musculoskeletal rehabilitation, the article notes that there is inadequate assessment regarding its effectiveness. It states that studies specifically examining the relationship between MSD management and DHC are scarce.
To address this research gap, this systematic review & meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of musculoskeletal rehabilitation using a DHC system. By doing so, it seeks to contribute essential evidence on whether DHC can indeed offer a valuable alternative for both patients and healthcare professionals involved in musculoskeletal rehabilitation programs. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, one notable aspect mentioned is the cost-effectiveness, safety, and measurability of using DHC for health improvement. This is particularly relevant in the context of musculoskeletal rehabilitation which requires physical activity (PA). The integration of DHC with PA can hold great potential for enhancing rehabilitation outcomes.
The article highlights advancements in technology such as sensors and wearable devices that make it easier for healthcare providers to access and manage patients' rehabilitation in their daily lives outside traditional healthcare facilities. This shift from hospital-based care to remote monitoring and management has the potential to improve patient convenience and engagement.
Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of making virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) content more interactive and engaging. By doing so, patients can become more interested in their own rehabilitation process, leading to better adherence and outcomes.
Despite acknowledging these potential benefits, the article notes that there is a lack of adequate assessment regarding the effectiveness of DHC in musculoskeletal rehabilitation. Specifically, studies examining how DHC relates to MSD management are scarce.
To address this research gap, the systematic review and meta-analysis described in this article aim to evaluate the effectiveness of musculoskeletal rehabilitation using a DHC system. By synthesizing existing literature on this topic through a rigorous methodology, this study intends to provide clarity on whether utilizing digital health technologies can indeed lead to improved outcomes in musculoskeletal rehabilitation.
The main goal is to gather evidence on whether DHC can offer a practical and flexible alternative for both patients with MSDs seeking effective rehabilitation as well as healthcare professionals involved in managing these conditions. With robust evidence from this review study, stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding implementing DHC systems within musculoskeletal rehabilitation programs.
Overall, by exploring the intersection between digital technology and healthcare within the context of musculoskeletal disorders' management, this PubMed article intends to shed light on an area that has attracted growing attention due to its potential for improving patient outcomes, accessibility, and efficiency in rehabilitation practices. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the importance and complexity of glycans in the human body. It explains that glycans are structurally diverse biomolecules found on all cells and tissues, and glycosylation is the primary source of microheterogeneity in proteins.
The introduction highlights that almost all proteins passing through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi during biosynthesis are modified with O- or N-linked glycans. These glycans, as part of the cellular glycocalyx, play crucial roles in various biological processes such as intracellular transport, cell adhesion, interactions between cells and with their surrounding matrix, as well as cellular signaling.
It is emphasized that while at least 4000 human genes are involved in glycan synthesis, glycans themselves are not directly encoded by the genome. Genetic defects in the glycosylation machinery can be lethal at an early embryonic stage, underscoring their vital role.
The dynamic structure and composition of glycans can vary among different cells. Endogenous factors like specific expression levels of glycosyltransferases and pH in ER and Golgi influence these characteristics. Additionally, age and environmental factors including lifestyle choices and diet have been shown to affect the glycocalyx. Alterations in glycan structures often reflect abnormal conditions such as cancer.
Tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) receive increasing attention due to their central role in cancer progression. However, carbohydrates are generally poorly immunogenic compared to other molecules like proteins. Vaccination using carbohydrates typically results in low-affinity Immunoglobulin M (IgM) production rather than class-switching to high-affinity Immunoglobulin G (IgG). This poses challenges for developing effective vaccines against TACAs since T-cell-mediated immunity is critical for active cancer immunotherapy.
Furthermore, TACAs often resemble healthy cell glycans structurally which allows them to evade immune detection. They are also expressed at low levels in healthy tissue or during prenatal development, contributing to their tolerance by the immune system. To overcome the limitation of glycan immunogenicity, glycans are conjugated to carrier proteins in vaccine development.
Targeting TACAs offers advantages in cancer therapy as they are less susceptible to antigen escape compared to protein markers due to their complex synthesis process involving multiple enzymes. TACAs are more abundant than protein tumour antigens and frequently identified in a larger percentage of patients. Several therapeutic antibodies targeting TACAs have been approved for cancer treatment.
The introduction also discusses the structure and function of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used in therapy, including their interactions with immune cells and complement system components. Although mAbs have been successful therapeutically, their large size limits penetration into dense tissues like tumor microenvironments.
To address these limitations, smaller antigen-binding fragments such as Fab, scFv, and single-domain Abs have been developed through enzymatic cleavage or recombinant protein expression systems. These fragments offer improved access to dense tissues and allow for genetic engineering and the development of multivalent/multispecific tools.
However, some recombinant antibody fragments exhibit reduced stability and affinity compared to full-length antibodies. Additionally, most antibody fragments suffer from fast renal clearance due to their small size below the glomerular filtration cut-off.
In summary, this introduction provides an overview of glycans' importance in human physiology and pathology while highlighting challenges related to their use as targets for immunotherapy. It sets up the rationale for developing smaller antibody fragments that can overcome limitations associated with full-length antibodies while maintaining stability and optimal serum half-life for effective cancer therapy.

The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the importance of the Arachis hypogaea, commonly known as peanut or groundnut, in terms of its production and nutritional value. It highlights that peanuts are a significant source of digestible protein, cooking oil, and vitamins in many regions around the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and America where they play a crucial role in fighting malnutrition and ensuring food security.
However, despite its importance as a crop, peanut productivity levels remain low in developing countries due to various constraints such as biotic (living organisms) and abiotic (environmental) stresses. The article emphasizes that breeding new cultivars with improved productivity is essential for meeting the needs of producers, consumers, and industry.
One challenge faced by peanut breeding programs is the limited genetic diversity within cultivated peanuts. As an allotetraploid species (containing two complete sets of chromosomes from different diploid ancestors), peanuts have low genetic diversity compared to their diploid wild relatives within the Arachis genus. This lack of genetic exchange between cultivated peanuts and wild ancestors contributes to increased susceptibility to pests and pathogens.
The limited genetic diversity and tetraploid complexity pose barriers to creating cultivars with broad resistance, excellent quality, and high yield. The article suggests that exploring gene resources present in diploid Wild Arachis species through advanced genomic techniques can potentially overcome some limitations.
Omics technologies are then introduced as powerful tools for gene discovery and functional elucidation. These technologies allow scientists to study intricate biological systems based on advances in genomics (DNA sequencing), transcriptomics (gene expression analysis), proteomics (study of proteins), metabolomics (study of small molecules), interactomic analysis (protein-protein interactions), hormonomic analysis (plant hormone signaling), etc.
The emergence of next-generation sequencing has revolutionized genomic research by enabling whole-genome resequencing for variant discovery. Additionally, it has made possible other applications such as transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq), epigenome dynamics (Chip-Seq), and network analysis to explore connections between genes and metabolites.
The integration of omics technologies provides a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between phenotype (observable characteristics) and genotype (genetic makeup). The article highlights that these techniques have greatly facilitated molecular studies of peanut-biotic factor interactions, specifically focusing on peanut defense responses and resistance to biotic stresses caused by insects, pathogens, and bacteria.
In summary, the introduction outlines the significance of peanuts as a crop in terms of production and nutrition. It also establishes the challenges faced by breeding programs due to limited genetic diversity. Finally, it introduces omics technologies as valuable tools for studying molecular aspects related to peanut defense mechanisms against diseases and pests. Continuing from the previous explanation, the PubMed article further explains how omics-based studies have contributed to a better understanding of molecular pathways involved in peanut defense responses and resistance to biotic stresses.
The article emphasizes that studying these molecular aspects is crucial for developing strategies to enhance crop protection against pests and pathogens. By uncovering the underlying genetic mechanisms and identifying specific genes involved in defense responses, researchers can ultimately develop improved cultivars with enhanced resistance.
Genomic analysis has allowed scientists to identify candidate genes associated with resistance traits. By comparing genetic sequences of different peanut varieties or wild relatives, researchers can identify variations that are linked to disease resistance. This information can then be utilized in breeding programs to select for desirable traits.
Transcriptomics, which involves studying gene expression patterns using techniques such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), offers insights into which genes are activated or repressed in response to biotic stresses. Such information helps unravel the complex regulatory networks involved in defense mechanisms against pests and pathogens.
Proteomic analysis aims at understanding protein profiles and changes in protein abundance under stress conditions. It provides valuable information about proteins that play essential roles in plant defense against biotic factors. By identifying these proteins, researchers gain insight into key molecular players involved in pathogen recognition, signal transduction pathways, and immune responses.
Metabolomics studies focus on analyzing small molecules produced by plants during stress situations. These molecules serve as important chemical messengers for communication between plants and their environment. Through metabolomic analysis, scientists can identify compounds that contribute to plant defense by acting as antimicrobial agents or signaling molecules.
Furthermore, interactomic analysis enables researchers to explore protein-protein interactions within defense-related pathways. By building networks of interacting proteins involved in plant immunity, new insights are gained regarding how different components interact and cooperate during defense responses.
Hormones also play a crucial role in mediating plant immune responses through hormone signaling pathways. Hormonomic analysis elucidates how hormones such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene are regulated and integrated in defense signaling networks.
Lastly, integrating all these omics approaches allows researchers to unravel the connections between genes, proteins, metabolites, and phenotypic traits. By utilizing advanced computational tools for data analysis and network modeling, scientists can gain a systems-level understanding of how different components interact to confer resistance against biotic stresses.
In summary, the article highlights that omics technologies have revolutionized peanut research by providing valuable information about the genetic basis of defense responses and resistance to biotic stresses. These studies contribute to ongoing efforts in developing improved peanut cultivars with enhanced productivity and resilience against pests and diseases. 
This introduction provides an overview of the role of signaling pathways and communication between cells in determining cellular function. It explains how external stimuli are converted into biochemical signals through protein cascades activated by ligand-receptor binding on cell surfaces. These signaling pathways control important biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell death.
The introduction then focuses on specific signaling pathways that are crucial for normal cellular function but can be disrupted in malignancy. It mentions several key pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Disruption of these pathways can contribute to the development of various types of cancer.
The introduction also highlights the role of inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules in cancer and chronic viral infections. Specifically, it mentions programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 as significant regulators in these diseases. The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 leads to the activation of inhibitory signals in T-cells, resulting in reduced T-cell function and immune response against tumor cells.
Furthermore, the introduction discusses the relationship between PD-1/PD-L1 axis activity and acute viral infections affecting the respiratory tract. It explains how this pathway impairs CD8+ T-cell activity in the respiratory system during such infections.
The expression patterns of PD-1/PD-L1 on different immune cells are explored next. PD-1 is expressed primarily on CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells, where it negatively regulates T-cell activity when bound to its ligands produced by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as well as peripheral tissues and cancerous cells.
The implications of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction on T-cell function, including decreased activity and increased cell death, are described. The role of PD-L1 in regulating IFN-γ-secreting T-cells is also mentioned.
The introduction then delves into the impact of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction on cancer induction. It explains how cancer cells employ PD-L1 and other immune system regulators like cluster of differentiation (CD)-47 to resist immune responses. Activation of cellular myelocytomatosis (c-MYC) due to CD-47 and PD-L1 expression is highlighted as a target for improving anti-tumor immune response.
Next, the introduction focuses on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which has been implicated as a primary inducer of cancer. Abnormal signaling through this pathway can lead to functional changes in T-cells that compromise their anti-tumor function.
The association between Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation and various types of malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma, HIV-related cancers, breast cancer, and HPV-related cancers is discussed.
The connection between increased levels of PD-1 expression and hyper-activation of the Wnt pathway during chronic HPV infection with tumor cell metastasis and HPV-associated cancers such as cervical cancer is highlighted.
Finally, it is proposed that research should focus on understanding the Wnt/β-catenin and PD-1 signaling pathways as crucial elements in virus-related cancers. The conclusion suggests that these findings may prompt changes in how we evaluate cancer patients and approach immunotherapy.
Overall, this introduction sets the stage for exploring the importance of signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and molecules like PD-1/PD-L1 in cancer development influenced by viruses. It emphasizes their significance in shaping cellular responses during infection and malignancy. 
This introduction provides an overview of the current state of knowledge on depression in children and adolescents. It begins by highlighting the extensive literature that has been accumulated over the past few decades, emphasizing the major epidemiological findings regarding the prevalence and burden of depression worldwide. The introduction also mentions that rates of depression increase significantly from childhood through late adolescence and continue into adulthood, with a disturbing trend showing increasing rates across generations.
The urgency to address this issue is underscored by public policy experts recommending annual screening for depression in individuals aged 12 and above. To gain a better understanding and intervention strategies for depression in youth, researchers have identified various risk and resilience factors that predict its development. Additionally, evidence-based treatments such as psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies have been found to be effective in relieving youth depression.
Despite this progress, it acknowledges the ongoing suffering experienced by young people globally due to depression. Global data shows an alarming rise in age-standardized prevalence rates of depression over time while anxiety rates decrease. Furthermore, even with numerous empirically supported treatments available today, there has been little sustained progress in reducing the burden associated with youth depression since the 1980s.
The purpose of this article is therefore stated as revisiting and critically examining what we currently understand about youth depression and its interventions. The authors emphasize reviewing how our academic notions align (or do not align) with the symptoms and features of this construct called "depression." They also stress expanding both prevention strategies aimed at reducing risks for future episodes as well as treatment efforts targeting existing cases.
In order to advance progress on youth depression, this paper aims to provide a new hope through multiple positions taken by the authors that they believe hold promise for improving scholarly understanding while significantly reducing distress associated with youth depressions worldwide. Their perspective centers around emphasizing fundamentals grounded in humility, history, philosophy; openness to explore new ideas rigorously; recognizing relationships across social-ecological systems; appropriate conceptualization, measurement, and classification of depression constructs; and collecting accurate, reliable, and practical evidence.
The article outlines its three main goals: providing an overview of current knowledge on depression among youth while emphasizing how the construct has been conceptualized and measured historically; reinvigorating academic progress to better define and explain what depression is in youth using a developmental psychopathology framework; and addressing immediate needs to reduce prevalence and distress associated with youth depression by proposing ways to respond to unmet needs in risk identification, intervention strategies, engaging stakeholders at all levels.
In summary, this introduction sets the context for the importance of understanding youth depression by highlighting its prevalence, burden across generations, lack of sustained progress in reduction efforts over time. It suggests a comprehensive approach encompassing both research advancements and practical interventions to address this significant issue. Continuing with the explanation of the article, the introduction states that the authors have three main goals. The first goal is to provide an overview of what is currently known about depression among youth. This overview is presented in Table 1, which enumerates various risk factors for youth depression across ecological levels, and Table 2, which summarizes evidence-based interventions for treating and preventing depression in young people. The information presented in these tables is grounded in how depression as a construct has been conceptualized and measured both historically and currently.
The second goal of the paper is to reinvigorate academic progress focused on defining and explicating conceptually what depression means among youth. The authors argue that necessary steps in the process of construct validation were minimally engaged when studying adult depression, resulting in an incomplete understanding when it comes to studying depression among young people. They emphasize the importance of content conceptualization and accurate measurement to improve our understanding of youth depression.
Finally, the third goal centers around addressing immediate needs to reduce both prevalence and distress associated with youth depression. The authors propose ways to respond to unmet needs by targeting at-risk populations while also considering their families and communities. They suggest enhancing interventions through multiple ecological systems and engaging various stakeholders.
To achieve these goals, the paper presents a plan for advancing progress on youth depressions by detailing directions that promise improvement not only in scholarly understanding but also practical outcomes related to reducing distress worldwide.
The introduction concludes by expressing a belief that meaningful progress can be made without overly focusing on unproven biological or technological solutions alone but instead adopting a comprehensive approach that considers multiple aspects such as fundamentals grounded in history, openness for exploration, recognition of relationships across social-ecological systems, appropriate conceptualization of constructs associated with youth depression, as well as gathering reliable evidence with scientific validity.
Overall, this introduction sets out clear objectives for the article: providing an overview of current knowledge about youth depressions while critically examining existing concepts and measures, reinvigorating academic progress to enhance our understanding of depression among young people, and proposing strategies to bridge the gap in prevalence and distress associated with youth depression. By establishing these goals, the article aims to make a significant contribution towards addressing the urgent need for effectively tackling youth depressions on both scholarly and practical levels. 
The introduction of this PubMed article focuses on the vulnerability of certain populations and communities to the COVID-19 pandemic. It explains that research has consistently shown that racial/ethnic minorities, the poor, the elderly, people with disabilities, those with low educational attainment, and individuals with comorbidities are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. These groups are often referred to as "vulnerable" populations.
Furthermore, it highlights that vulnerability during pandemics goes beyond socioeconomic or health characteristics and includes marginalized and disadvantaged communities that are more likely to experience negative outcomes such as higher case rates, morbidity rates, and mortality rates.
The introduction also mentions that researchers have used various indices based on societal factors to assess vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic. These indices have been associated with higher incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in highly vulnerable areas. Additionally, they have been used to highlight disparities in vaccination coverage and vaccine hesitancy.
The article then discusses how Arctic populations face unique challenges and vulnerabilities due to geographic barriers limiting access to health services, underdeveloped civic infrastructure, larger populations with underlying medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease), lower socioeconomic status,and inadequate housing and sanitation facilities. It also mentions previous pandemics having a disproportionate impact on Arctic residents.
Interestingly, despite their existing vulnerabilities, Arctic communities have experienced fewer dire consequences from COVID-19 compared to developed countries like USA or UK. The diminished impact is attributed to factors such as subsistence activities-based livelihoods,traditional knowledge/practices,resilience campaigns,favorable community leadership/self-determination,widespread vaccination efforts,and remoteness from densely populated areas.
The introduction further points out that previous studies evaluating pandemic risk exposure often overlook a community's strengths while solely focusing on vulnerability or treating resilience simply as the inverse of vulnerability.This study aims at filling this gap by combining an assessment of both vulnerabilityandresilience among Alaskan communities within one integrated conceptual model.The authors propose an asset-based approach that focuses on community strengths rather than deficiencies as a comprehensive pandemic risk assessment.
The authors emphasize that combining the evaluation of vulnerability and resilience is crucial for identifying populations and communities at the highest risk, enabling efficient resource allocation, mitigation measures, recovery planning, and support services tailored to local realities. They also highlight that understanding health disparities and determinants in global health research should include remote regions like the Arctic.
In summary, this introduction raises awareness about the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations globally. It highlights the unique vulnerabilities of Arctic communities and their capacity to address pandemic risks by incorporating a comprehensive assessment of vulnerability and resilience. The integrated approach aims to inform public officials, local organizations, and policymakers about resource allocation for future pandemics driven by global factors such as globalization, human migration, urbanization,and climate change. In addition to the focus on vulnerability and resilience, the article emphasizes the importance of considering the unique characteristics and context of Arctic communities when assessing pandemic risk. It notes that using universal indicators, such as poverty rates, may underestimate the capacity of these communities to prevent, withstand, and recover from pandemic exposure.
The authors propose an alternative approach based on assets rather than deficiencies. This asset-based approach acknowledges that factors like family relations and subsistence activities in Arctic communities contribute to their ability to cope with income limitations. By shifting the research focus from community weaknesses to strengths, a more comprehensive assessment of pandemic risk can be achieved.
The study aims to develop indices of vulnerability and resilience specific to Arctic communities in Alaska by integrating various sociodemographic factors into a conceptual model. This framework will allow for a more nuanced understanding of how vulnerability and resilience interact in shaping COVID-19 epidemiological outcomes.
By conducting this combined assessment of vulnerability and resilience, public officials and local organizations can better allocate resources and services based on local realities. This tailored approach is essential for addressing the diverse needs of different populations or communities during pandemics.
Furthermore, the article acknowledges that remote regions like the Arctic are often overlooked in global health research. However, studying these regions is crucial for understanding health disparities as well as social and environmental determinants not only during COVID-19 but also in general.
The conclusion highlights how future global pandemics driven by factors like globalization,migration,and climate change are likely to occur. Therefore,the evaluationofvulnerabilityandresilience will continue being important tools for identifying at-risk populations or areas with greater needs,supporting resource allocation efforts,and implementing effective mitigation measures.

The introduction of this PubMed article begins by acknowledging that the use of palliative anticancer drugs can have varying effects on patients with incurable cancer. Some studies suggest that these drugs can prolong survival and alleviate symptoms, while others indicate minimal impact on life expectancy and an unclear relationship with quality of life. The potential benefits of using these drugs in terminally ill cancer patients are disputed due to concerns about their impact on patients' quality of life and survival, as well as the significant costs associated with cancer therapy.
The article notes a growing number of publications claiming that near the end of life, anticancer treatment is associated with lower quality of life and does not improve survival. It defines "end-of-life" as the final days, weeks, or months when death is imminent and cannot be prevented medically.
According to various references cited in the introduction, the use of anticancer drugs at the end of life is prevalent worldwide and increasing in some countries. For instance, a study conducted in Korea reported a rise in chemotherapy use during the last month before death from 25.7% in 2000 to 44.2% in 2010. Similarly, studies from the USA indicate an increase in chemotherapy within two weeks before death between 1993-1996.
The introduction suggests that these trends might be influenced by advancements in oncology treatments such as immunotherapy and targeted therapies which have expanded treatment options for patients nearing their end-of-life stage.
Furthermore, the introduction highlights differences observed across publications regarding resource utilization among end-of-life cancer patients. These disparities are particularly evident when defining study populations; population-based studies analyzing all cancer patients regardless of previous treatments or stage report lower frequencies of end-of-life cancer treatment compared to research studies focusing on advanced cancer or previous treatment recipients.
The overall goal outlined for this article is to explore methods used by different studies related to end-of-life cancer treatment outcomes while also describing its current magnitude at this stage. The authors propose a scoping review approach, stating that it allows for identifying knowledge gaps, clarifying concepts, and providing a comprehensive overview of the current status of anticancer treatment at end-of-life. This method aims to compare various studies' methods and outcomes to understand differences in order to inform decision-making and set future research agendas.
In conclusion, the introduction highlights the conflicting findings surrounding palliative anticancer drug use at end-of-life. It emphasizes the need for a scoping review to outline the current understanding of this topic, identify areas for further investigation, and inform future systematic reviews or primary research studies. In addition to setting the overall goal of the article, the introduction also explains why a scoping review approach is chosen. It clarifies that a scoping review is particularly useful for mapping existing literature in a specific field, enabling researchers to compare the methods and outcomes used across different studies.
By conducting a scoping review on anticancer treatment at end-of-life, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current magnitude of such treatment, highlighting variations in methods and outcomes among studies. This information can be valuable for decision-making processes within healthcare systems and can help set research agendas by identifying areas that require further investigation.
The authors highlight that understanding patterns and discrepancies in end-of-life anticancer treatment utilization is crucial not only for clinical practitioners but also for policymakers. It can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about patient care and optimizing resource allocation in terminally ill cancer patients. Moreover, it has implications for developing guidelines or protocols regarding end-of-life care within oncology practices.
By examining the existing literature on this topic through a scoping review approach, this article seeks to fill knowledge gaps and clarify conceptual inconsistencies surrounding anticancer treatment at end-of-life. This will contribute to an enhanced understanding of when, how, and why these treatments are administered during this phase.
Furthermore, insights gained from this study could inform future systematic reviews or primary research focusing on specific aspects identified as requiring deeper investigation. It will not only benefit researchers but also support evidence-based practice by providing more guidance on optimal clinical decision-making regarding cancer therapy options near the end of life.
The introduction concludes by emphasizing that advancing knowledge in this area has relevance beyond medical academia—clinicians need accurate information to provide effective patient care while considering quality of life aspects during terminal stages of cancer management.
Overall, the introduction efficiently sets up the context for studying anticancer treatment at end-of-life by summarizing contrasting findings from previous studies. It establishes gaps in current knowledge while outlining objectives related to conducting a scoping review, thus providing a clear roadmap for the rest of the article. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of migraine as a prevalent neurological condition and its significant impact on individuals' lives. It highlights the high prevalence and disability associated with migraine, particularly occurring between the ages of 35 and 39. The introduction emphasizes the social, familial, and economic implications of migraine, including decreased quality of life, work absenteeism, reduced work efficiency, and increased healthcare costs.
The article mentions that pharmacological interventions are commonly used for acute management of migraines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans. Additionally, prophylactic drugs like topiramate or valproic acid are recommended for chronic migraines. However, limitations exist with these approaches due to adverse effects such as increased blood pressure or allergic reactions.
Behavioral change interventions play a fundamental role in managing migraines alongside pharmacological treatments. These interventions include stress management, sleep hygiene optimization, dietary modifications, and regular exercise. The article specifically highlights aerobic exercise and yoga as preventive alternatives for migraines.
While the dissemination of information on migraines and exercise has increased through social media channels in recent years, the quality of that information remains questionable. Nevertheless, several international scientific societies recommend incorporating exercise into migraine treatment plans to improve symptoms.
Despite these recommendations for exercise in migraine treatment guidelines by various headache societies (e.g., French Headache Society; Danish Headache Society; American Headache Society), limited specific guidance is provided regarding which types of exercises are most effective for migraines.
The objective of this clinical practice guideline is to address this gap by providing recommendations on different modalities that could effectively treat migraines through exercise while considering patient characteristics such as frequency of attacks
Through a review process encompassing current evidence about exercise interventions (intensity,frequency,duration) along with disability reduction & improved quality life,the guideline aims at offering parameters associated with each prescribed modality based on patient’s preferences/experiences.It states clearly that this guideline is not meant to establish a standard of medical care but rather assists healthcare and exercise professionals (neurologists,physical therapists,exercise physiologists)in better managing patients with migraines by providing them with more specific recommendations or an exercise prescription.
In conclusion, the introduction sets the stage for the article by highlighting the global prevalence and impact of migraines on various aspects of individuals' lives. It establishes a need for specific guidance on exercise interventions within migraine treatment plans while acknowledging the absence of clinical practice guidelines in this area. The article aims to provide evidence-based recommendations on different exercise modalities and lifestyle adaptations that can improve migraine symptoms while accounting for individual patient characteristics and preferences. The PubMed article emphasizes the importance of developing a guide to assist clinicians in providing better recommendations and more specific exercise prescriptions for patients with migraines. While various scientific societies recommend incorporating exercise into migraine treatment plans, there is a lack of detailed information regarding the specific exercise modalities that are most effective.
The article acknowledges the growing interest and information about migraines and exercise on social media platforms. However, it highlights concerns regarding the quality of this information. To ensure that healthcare professionals have access to reliable and evidence-based recommendations, the need for comprehensive guidelines on exercise prescription for migraines is emphasized.
The main objective of this clinical practice guideline is to provide healthcare professionals, including neurologists, physical therapists, and exercise physiologists, with a series of recommendations on different exercise modalities that may be effective in treating migraines. The goal is to improve symptoms such as intensity, frequency, and duration while reducing disability and enhancing overall quality of life.
By reviewing existing evidence on exercise interventions for migraines, including their impact on symptoms and disability reduction as well as improvements in quality of life, this guideline seeks to provide parameters for tailoring exercise prescriptions based on individual patient characteristics. Factors such as migraine frequency physical condition,and patient preferences are considered in order to enhance the effectiveness of these interventions.
It's important to note that while this guideline aims to inform best practices for healthcare professionals when recommending exercises for migraine treatment,it does not establish a standard approach or specify exact protocols.It instead underlines the role played by patients' clinical presentation/experiences/expectations along with clinicians' expertise so that they can use their discretion when prescribing exercises based on current evidence-backed recommendations.
Overall,the article emphasizes both the significance of incorporating behavioral change interventions like regular aerobic exercises into migraine management alongside pharmacological approaches.Additionally,it stresses upon addressing limitations within current guidelines by developing comprehensive resources specifically focused upon appropriate exercise prescription parameters.This could help not only improve symptom management but also enhance overall quality of life for patients with migraines.
 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the importance of the gut microbiome in maintaining health and preventing disease. It starts by defining microbiota as communities of microorganisms that exist alongside the host ecosystem in a specific environment, while highlighting that the microbiome refers to the microbial genome.
The introduction then goes on to mention that metagenomic sequencing has identified over 10 million microbial genes in the human gut microbiome, indicating its complexity. The gut microbiome is described as playing a significant role in health and disease, with studies suggesting its influence on the interaction between the central and enteric nervous systems (known as the gut-brain axis) and subsequent effects on mental health outcomes like depression.
Furthermore, dysbiosis or an unhealthy gut microbiome has been linked to various diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The article emphasizes recent research indicating that the gut microbiome also modulates immune system functions. Components or metabolites produced by certain bacteria within the gut are known to promote anti-inflammatory responses.
Characterizing a healthy gut microbiome is challenging due to its diverse composition both within and between individuals. However, it is generally accepted that higher diversity, richness, stability of microbial communities along with an abundance of species associated with short-chain fatty acid production contribute to better health outcomes.
The introduction then highlights growing interest in understanding how vitamin D affects the composition of the gut microbiome. Vitamin D's active form (calcitriol) has been found to bind macrophages resulting in bacterial killing through antimicrobial peptide production. Studies conducted on rodents have shown associations between vitamin D deficiency or lack of vitamin D receptor activity with increased levels of less healthy bacteria from Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla.
Vitamin D also has a role in maintaining gastrointestinal integrity by reducing cell permeability and regulating tight-junction proteins which prevent pathogenic bacterial invasion into epithelial cells.
The article mentions a systematic review that found a link between vitamin D and the diversity and abundance of different bacteria in the gut microbiome, with subsequent interventional studies in healthy women indicating significant increases in microbial diversity and the abundance of health-promoting probiotic taxa after vitamin D supplementation.
However, the introduction highlights that there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically exploring the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the gut microbiome. Only three small RCTs have been conducted so far, with sample sizes ≤26 and intervention durations ≤16 weeks. Although some positive effects on beneficial bacteria were observed in these studies, their overall impact on diversity indices was mixed.
Given this scarcity of data from RCTs, the aim of this study is introduced: to investigate the effect of supplementing older adults with 60,000 IU/month of vitamin D over five years on their gut microbiome composition using a subsample (n = 835) from the larger population-based D-Health Trial. This study aims to address the gaps in current knowledge by conducting a long-term intervention with a larger sample size compared to previous studies. The authors acknowledge that the study population consists of older adults, who are often at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency and gut dysbiosis due to age-related factors.
To conduct this study, the authors recruited 835 individuals from the larger D-Health Trial, which is a population-based trial focusing on various health outcomes. The selected participants will be supplemented with 60,000 IU of vitamin D per month for five years. It's important to note that this dose falls within the range considered safe for long-term use by international guidelines.
By investigating the effect of long-term vitamin D supplementation on gut microbiome composition in an aging population, this study hopes to shed light on potential interactions between vitamin D status and gut microorganisms. Understanding these interactions could provide valuable insights into interventions aimed at improving gut health and preventing or managing related diseases.
The researchers plan to employ comprehensive metagenomic sequencing techniques to analyze changes in microbial diversity and abundance before and after the intervention period. They aim specifically to assess how vitamin D supplementation influences both overall microbiome composition and specific bacterial taxa associated with health-promoting effects.
A thorough characterization of microbial communities before and after supplementation will allow for a more detailed analysis of any observed changes related to diversity indices or specific bacterial taxa associated with health benefits. These findings will contribute significantly towards understanding whether prolonged use of moderate-dose vitamin D supplements can positively impact gut microbiota in older adults.
The article concludes by emphasizing that given their large sample size, long intervention period, and comprehensive analysis approach utilizing metagenomic sequencing techniques, they hope their study can provide robust evidence regarding any potential causal effect between vitamin D supplementation and alterations in gut microbiome composition.
The implications from this research could extend beyond simply linking gut health with better immune function but also broaden our understanding of how nutrients like vitamin D might interact with gut microorganisms to influence various aspects of health and disease. Such knowledge could inform future strategies for the prevention and management of conditions associated with altered gut microbial composition.
In summary, this PubMed article introduces the importance of the gut microbiome in health and disease, outlines current gaps in knowledge regarding vitamin D supplementation's effects on the gut microbiome, describes the study's objectives and methods, and highlights potential implications for improving our understanding of interactions between nutrients, gut health, and overall well-being. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the current state of lung cancer treatment and highlights the challenges faced by patients after surgery. It begins by emphasizing the significant impact of lung cancer as one of the most common cancers with high incidence and mortality rates. The authors mention that standard treatment involves surgery followed by postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
However, they acknowledge that many lung cancer patients experience a decline in their quality of life after leaving the hospital. This deterioration is attributed to several factors, such as cardiopulmonary dysfunction, negative psychology, adverse reactions to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which can affect prognosis and even shorten survival. Chemotherapy itself may lead to various hazardous effects, causing long-term pain and psychological stress for patients.
In light of these challenges, it is crucial to enhance nursing interventions during chemotherapy to prevent patients from being trapped in a cycle of treatment. Many studies have indicated that additional assistance and care are needed for lung cancer patients once they are discharged from the hospital. The authors argue for high-quality and efficient ongoing care to ensure better quality of life for these patients.
The introduction then switches focus towards surgical resection as the most effective method for treating early-stage lung cancer. Different types of surgical procedures are briefly described: thoracoscopic surgery (both multi-hole and single-port), which has been reported to minimize complications, improve postoperative quality of life, reduce discomfort, enhance lung function recovery, shorten hospital stay duration, and expedite patient's return to normal life.
Thereafter follows a historical perspective on video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) in treating early non-small cell lung cancer since its first lobectomy procedure performed in the 1990s. Previous studies have demonstrated several advantages associated with VATS compared to traditional thoracotomy lobectomy; these include shorter hospital stays, enhanced recovery outcomes with decreased perioperative complications and improved long-term survival rate for selected patients.
The introduction also mentions how thoracoscopic surgery has evolved from multiple-incision to double-incision, and finally to single-incision thoracoscopic surgery (single-port). Table 1 provides an overview of the various alternatives for lung cancer treatment.
The authors briefly mention enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) as a concept proposed in the 1990s, which aims to optimize clinical pathways through evidence-based medicine. ERAS focuses on reducing stress, shortening hospital stays, and promoting early organ function recovery and has been progressively expanding along with perioperative nursing measures.
However, while there have been advancements in pre- and post-operative care under ERAS, few studies have looked specifically at intraoperative nursing measures that can promote rapid postoperative recovery. Hence, the article intends to fill this research gap by examining the latest developments in intraoperative nursing related to rapid postoperative recovery. The ultimate goal is to facilitate early patient recovery after surgery and reduce complications.
In summary, this introduction provides context for lung cancer treatment approaches by highlighting existing challenges faced by patients after surgery and underscoring the need for enhanced nursing interventions. It also introduces different surgical methods used in treating early-stage lung cancer along with their associated benefits. Finally, it sets out an objective of exploring intraoperative nursing strategies that can expedite patient recovery. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the composition and significance of microorganisms in the human body, specifically focusing on eukaryotic cells, mitochondria, and the microbiota. It starts by highlighting that the human body is composed of trillions of eukaryote cells that govern various functions. However, despite their diverse functions, the origin and development of eukaryotic cells remains enigmatic.
The emergence of mitochondria is mentioned as a crucial event in this process. Mitochondria are energy-generating organelles specific to eukaryotic cells. They are believed to have formed through a symbiotic relationship between an archaeal host cell (from the phylum Lokiarcheaeota) and a bacterial cell related to alpha-proteobacteria. This endosymbiosis was mutually beneficial for both organisms and led to their coevolution and stability.
The long-standing partnership between these organisms eventually resulted in the formation of eukaryotic cells as we know them today, which make up animals, plants, fungi, and protists. The symbiotic event between archaea and bacteria is estimated to have occurred billions of years ago.
The article then explores how all plants and animals harbor symbiotic microorganisms that can have neutral (commensalism), harmful (parasitism), or beneficial effects (mutualism) on their hosts. These interactions play a role in coevolution and can change dynamically depending on external factors.
In humans, viruses,

This microbiota symbiotically contributes to various functions such as metabolism, immune processes, and signaling in almost all organs of the body.
The introduction also highlights the role of microorganisms in health and disease, including cancer. It is noted that specific microorganisms have been classified as human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and infection-induced cancers make up a significant portion of global cancer burden. Furthermore, microbial interactions in the gut microbiota can influence tumorigenesis and patient prognosis through various mechanisms involving metabolites, genotoxins, inflammation, and immune responses.
The influence of microorganisms on response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy is also mentioned. The gut microbiome is specifically highlighted as a focus of research due to its richness,
diversity,
and easy accessibility for sampling compared to other bacterial microbiomes.
The oxygen gradient within the gut lumen generated by host factors like diet influences microbial growth and composition in a way that promotes growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria in the large intestine. This information becomes relevant when discussing tumors since they have low oxygen levels compared to normal tissue and create chemotactic gradients that can attract bacteria.

The role of microbiota in the response to cancer treatments is emphasized in addition to the specific conditions within tumors that provide a favorable niche for microbial growth. The article sets the stage for future discussions on the composition, origin, assessment techniques, and clinical relevance of tumor-associated microbiota 
This PubMed article introduces the topic of cellular immune responses to viral infections and the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in detecting and responding to viral genomic nucleic acids. The cGAS-STING pathway is a critical component of the innate immune system, which is responsible for the initial defense against invading pathogens.
The article explains that cells have pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize specific structures within invading microbes called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In the case of viral infections, viral genomic nucleic acids act as a prominent PAMP. When these nucleic acids are detected by PRRs, it triggers a series of events that lead to the production of type-I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines by infected cells.
Type-I IFNs then act on neighboring cells in both an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs serve as restriction factors in bystander cells, limiting pathogen replication and spread. Additionally, the cytokines produced play a crucial role in initiating adaptive immune responses.
The introduction highlights how cGAS has been a focal point within this field since its discovery in 2013. Unlike classical PRRs that detect structural differences between pathogens and host cells, cGAS detects double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) indiscriminately - whether it originated from the host or pathogen. It identifies dsDNA presence within the cytosol as a danger signal.
The article also mentions that exposure of "self" dsDNA due to cellular disruption can also be detected by cGAS, leading to inflammation even in sterile settings.
It goes on to explain several diseases where chronic activation of the cGAS-STING pathway leads to pathology or contributes towards autoimmune and inflammatory disorders such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), COPA syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarthritis, and Parkinson's disease.
The cGAS-STING pathway is of great therapeutic interest. Agonists are being sought after for use as vaccine adjuvants or in cancer immunotherapy, while antagonists could be developed for treating inflammatory or autoimmune diseases.
The introduction then delves into the mechanistic details of the cGAS-STING pathway. It explains how cGAS binding to dsDNA induces phase separation and generates a cyclic dinucleotide called cGAMP. This molecule acts as a second messenger and binds to STING, leading to further downstream signaling events that result in the production of type-I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines.
The article also highlights recent studies that challenged the classical model of PRR signaling. It describes how cGAMP can travel from one cell to another through several mechanisms such as direct cell-to-cell transfer through gap junctions or incorporation into viral particles that transmit it to neighboring cells.
Additionally, it mentions recent discoveries regarding membrane transport proteins that provide routes for extracellular entry of cGAMP into cells. These include SLC19A1, SLC46A2, P2X7, LRRC8A:C/E channels/transporters/pores and LL-37 antimicrobial defense peptide.
Finally, the article acknowledges that the study of intercellular transfer of cGAMP is a rapidly growing field with implications for understanding disease mechanisms and developing novel therapies. The authors aim to detail and discuss current knowledge on different mechanisms by which cGAMP is transferred between cells in order to identify potential targets for innovative therapies.
Overall, this introduction sets the stage by outlining key concepts related to viral immune responses mediated by the cGAS-STING pathway and highlights its relevance in various diseases. It provides background information on PRRs, discusses the role of cGAS as a cytosolic dsDNA sensor, and introduces recent findings on intercellular cGAMP transfer mechanisms. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by acknowledging that although artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in various fields throughout history, its integration into daily life is a more recent development. Initially, AI was primarily used in academia and government research institutions, but as technology has advanced, it has also found applications in industry, commerce, medicine, and dentistry.
The article then highlights the human experience of becoming aware of our physical and mental limitations. In the past, these limitations often had significant consequences because there was no way to surpass them or improve upon our abilities. While machines have undoubtedly made everyday life easier from a physical standpoint, there has long been a desire among inventors, researchers, and philosophers to combine machine endurance and reliability with human-like intelligence and consciousness.
The theoretical foundations for what we now call AI were laid by mathematicians Alan Turing, Claude E. Shannon, and Norbert Wiener. Turing is considered the father of theoretical computer science; Shannon is known as the father of information theory; and Wiener is the founder of cybernetics. These visionaries are credited with introducing the concept of creating intelligent machines.
The concept of AI itself emerged in 1956 when researchers at Dartmouth College initiated an eight-week research project on Artificial Intelligence. Their goal was to create "thinking machines" that could mimic human intelligence and behavior. This event marks the formal beginning of AI as a field of study.
To better understand AI's scope within this introduction's context clarifies the differences between artificial intelligence itself along with deep learning, machine learning.,and data science—all fields related yet distinct from one another.
Artificial intelligence is introduced as a broad field encompassing techniques aimed at creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence like visual perception or decision-making processes. It can be divided into branches such as expert systems (used extensively in healthcare), robotics (used across industries), or natural language processing (used for voice assistants).
Deep learning, as a subfield of AI, focuses on the application of neural networks inspired by the structure of the human brain. It utilizes large amounts of data to automatically identify and extract features for making predictions or decisions in areas such as image or speech recognition.
Machine learning is another subfield that concentrates on developing algorithms and statistical models so computers can learn from data without explicit programming. Supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning techniques empower computers to make predictions (recommendation systems), detect fraud or undertake predictive modeling tasks.
Data science combines statistical and computational techniques with domain-specific knowledge to gain insights from data. Activities encompassed within this field include data acquisition, cleaning/pre-processing, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling/research/building predictive models. It plays a role in various domains such as healthcare or finance.
The introduction concludes by discussing how AI has gradually integrated into daily life over time. It describes some early examples like expert systems mimicking human decision-making abilities in fields like medicine or finance during the 1980s and 1990s. However, in the 21st century, AI has expanded further into consumer products/services ranging from virtual personal assistants (e.g., Siri) to recommendation systems personalized for customers' experiences (e.g., Netflix). Moreover, AI is now being employed in self-driving cars, healthcare applications alongside advancements within financial sectors.
Furthermore mentioned are three generations of AI: artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), artificial general intelligence (AGI), and artificial superintelligence (ASI). ANI represents today's prevalent type of AI seen through facial recognition/tagging used by Facebook or our virtual voice assistants found on smartphones like Siri/Alexa/Bixby. AGI is expected to think/plan/problem-solve independently while ASI represents an advanced generation where self-awareness might make human input obsolete for certain situations.
Overall it provides a comprehensive overview highlighting the historical context behind AI development, its integration into various fields, and the different subfields and related subjects within the AI domain. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the significant impact of cancer on both individual health and society as a whole in European countries. It states that nearly 40% of cancer cases can be attributed to modifiable risk factors, such as tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets, being overweight, and leading a sedentary lifestyle.
The article specifically focuses on the role of alcohol consumption as one of the leading causes of premature death worldwide. It mentions that alcohol consumption is directly linked to the development of several types of cancers, including those affecting the oral cavity, oropharynx, esophagus, larynx, and liver.
Despite some well-known negative health effects associated with heavy drinking (such as increased risk for liver disease or cardiovascular problems), it is less widely known that alcohol consumption is also a risk factor for cancer. The article emphasizes that younger people in adolescence and early adulthood are particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of alcohol consumption.
To address these risks among young people, effective strategies are needed to inform and educate them about the dangers associated with alcohol consumption. A WHO report mentioned in the article highlights that most young people start drinking between ages 12-16. Drinking behaviors during adolescence have been shown to contribute to various physical, psychological, and social problems that can persist into later life. The prevalence of risky drinking among university students is also concerning.
Recognizing potentially long-term consequences related to increased alcohol-related cancer risks in adulthood stemming from earlier age alcohol use initiation patterns established during adolescence - efforts targeting younger populations with interventions promoting health-conscious behaviors could lead to substantial improvements in public health outcomes both now and in future generations.
Digital technologies offer promising tools for communication, education, and increasing risk awareness surrounding alcohol consumption among young people who are more familiar with new technologies throughout their formative years. For example,mHealth initiatives delivered through smartphones have rapidly expanded.
The flexibility provided by such digital platforms opens up opportunities for public health specialists to reach and monitor a large number of people in real-time. Consequently, interventions targeting the riskiest drinking behaviors in young people who demonstrate hazardous and harmful drinking patterns are believed to have the greatest population-level outcomes.
Considering the negative public health and social impact of alcohol, particularly the increased risk of alcohol-related cancers, alongside high prevalence of risky drinking behaviors among younger populations, the researchers conducting this study were interested in exploring how emerging digital technologies could be utilized to moderate drinking behaviors in this particular age group.
Thus, the objectives of their work were two-fold: (1) to ascertain whether digital interventions aimed at young people are effective in addressing alcohol consumption; and (2) to evaluate the quality and strength of evidence available through systematic reviews on this topic. In order to achieve their objectives, the researchers conducted a systematic review of the available literature on digital interventions targeting alcohol consumption among young people. By systematically reviewing previous studies and analysis conducted in this field, they aimed to gather evidence on the effectiveness and quality of these digital interventions.
The article emphasizes the importance of examining the impact and accessibility of emerging digital technology in addressing drinking behaviors among younger populations. This is particularly relevant considering the negative public health consequences associated with alcohol consumption, including increased risk of alcohol-related cancers.
The researchers believe that by utilizing digital platforms, such as mobile health (mHealth) initiatives delivered through smartphones, it is possible to effectively communicate with and educate young people about the risks associated with alcohol consumption. These technologies can provide real-time monitoring of behavior and offer opportunities for targeted interventions.
Furthermore, younger individuals aged between 10-24 years are seen as ideal recipients for digitally delivered interventions due to their familiarity with new technologies throughout their formative years. The increasing popularity and multi-functional use of digital technologies make them valuable tools in facilitating communication, education, and risk awareness among this specific age group.
By examining existing systematic review literature, this study seeks to determine whether these promising digital interventions aimed at young people are effective in addressing alcohol consumption. Additionally, assessing the quality and strength of evidence is crucial for understanding how reliable and impactful these interventions can be.
The ultimate goal is to moderate drinking behaviors in younger populations by using technological advancements that align well with their daily activities. The potential benefits extend beyond reducing immediate risks related to excessive drinking but also have long-term implications for public health improvements.
By successfully targeting risky drinking patterns at an early stage in adolescence or early adulthood through digitally delivered interventions - it may be possible to prevent future detrimental effects on health outcomes such as increased risk of cancer or other chronic diseases associated with heavy alcohol use later on in life.
In conclusion, this article highlights the significant impact that cancer has on society while emphasizing known modifiable risk factors, including alcohol consumption. It examines the role of emerging digital technologies in addressing drinking behaviors among young people and the potential for reducing health and social problems associated with alcohol consumption, including the risk of cancer.
Through systematic review literature analysis, this study aims to determine whether digital interventions are effective in addressing alcohol consumption among young people. The findings have the potential to contribute valuable insights into designing targeted interventions that can lead to substantial improvements in public health outcomes both now and in future generations. 
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a prevalent and significant health issue worldwide, affecting males in both developed and developing countries. In fact, it ranks among the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men and is a leading cause of cancer-related death [REF]. Traditional treatment options for localized prostate cancer include surgery and radiotherapy, but for advanced cases, additional therapies such as brachytherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are commonly used [REF].
The primary objective of ADT is to lower the levels of circulating androgens (male sex hormones) in order to block their signaling. Androgens play a crucial role in the growth of cancer cells, thus reducing their availability can slow down disease progression [REF]. ADT has proven to be an effective approach by causing a decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels - an indicator of prostate cancer activity - as well as tumor size. As a result, it offers temporary relief for patients. However, it should be noted that ADT can also lead to side effects such as hot flashes and sexual dysfunction [REF].
The response to ADT can be observed over three phases: early, developing, and late stages [Fig. 1]. The early phase is characterized by decreased PSA levels, tumor regression, and improved quality of life for patients. In contrast, the late phase is associated with castration resistance - when tumors stop responding effectively to hormonal therapy - relapse occurs with highly metastatic aggressive tendencies[REF]. During the intermediate "developing" stage between these two phases,cancer cells undergo homeostatic responses which dynamically alter various cellular signaling mechanisms that eventually lead towards castration resistance(Fig 1). These responses include the revival or reactivation of alternate mechanisms related toandrogen receptor(AR)signaling activation.The specific mechanisms involved are,intra-tumor de novo productionofandrogen,multicopy amplification ARgene occurring withintumors,mutations in the ligand-binding domain of AR (AR-LBD),expressionof specific constitutively active isoforms of AR,overexpression of AR co-regulators,and androgen-independent activation of AR [REF]. These events contribute to a more aggressive form of the disease called castration-resistant prostate cancer(CRPC), typically occurring24-36 months after ADT initiation[REF]. In this stage,metastatic spreading is observedin most patients, and their average life expectancy becomes limited to 18-24 months thereafter [REF].
Another crucial mechanism that occurs in advanced PCa is epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT disrupts cell adhesion while promoting cellular migration and invasion. Although there is no unanimous agreement regarding the influence of androgen signaling on EMT regulation during ADT,research has demonstrated a link between the two. Initial studies suggest that ADT may induce EMT in advanced prostate cancer through a process known as "cadherin switching" [REF]. Cadherins are proteins involved in maintaining cell adhesion within tissues. Decreased expression of one type called E-cadherin (encoded by Cdh1) combined with increased expression of another type called N-cadherin (encoded by Cdh2) leads to cadherin switching [REF]. Disrupted tissue structures due to reduced Cdh1expressionresult in cells detaching from each other,resulting in free movement[REF]. Correspondingly,cadherin switching as observed during tumor progression playsavital role intumorcell migrationandinvasiveness—a characteristic featureofadvanced cancers[REF]. N-cadherinfacilitates enhanced migratory and invasive abilities for tumor cells, which contrasts withthe inhibitory role playedbyE-cadherin[REF].
In light of these findings, our study aims to review existing literature regarding the molecular perspective on how ADT influences cadherin switching in advanced prostate cancer. By unraveling these mechanisms, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the interaction between androgen deprivation therapy and cadherin switching, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective targeted therapies for advanced prostate cancer. 
In this introduction, the authors present two main concepts: critical thinking and blended learning. They argue that critical thinking is a crucial skill in today's competitive world and is considered essential in both professional and academic fields. Critical thinking consists of two domains: disposition (the mindset or attitude) and skill (the ability to accurately analyze data or use alternative methods to solve problems).
The authors highlight the importance of creativity in critical thinking, as it allows for innovative solutions in decision-making and problem-solving. However, they express concern that education has shifted towards a focus on information transfer rather than developing intelligent and creative individuals due to information overload and rapid technological advances.
The study by Karakoc Najafi et al. is mentioned as supporting the notion that university education should emphasize critical thinking skills. This serves as a rationale for examining the effects of blended learning on critical thinking.
Blended learning is described as a combination of face-to-face classroom learning and online learning, offering flexibility, timeliness, continuity, and effectiveness. It has gained popularity as an approach that combines the benefits of traditional teaching with electronic resources.
The authors argue that blended learning promotes active student engagement by allowing them to seek knowledge independently. Various subcategories within blended learning are mentioned, such as flex model, self-blended model, enriched virtual model, and rotation model. These models aim to enhance students' ability to investigate their own needs, engage in critical thinking processes actively, take initiative in different situations, and improve problem-solving skills.
Different perspectives on the impact of blended learning on students' critical thinking skills are presented through references to studies by Wahyuni (supporting positive impact), Hajrezayi et al. (suggesting non-significant contributions), Harrington et al.(highlighting a need for more research into specific subcategories like flipped classroom). These diverse findings set the stage for further investigation into blended learning's effects on critical thinking abilities.
Considering nursing education specifically important, the authors assert that teaching critical thinking is a significant effort in this field. They further suggest that education should focus on teaching thinking itself rather than merely transferring information to learners.
To address these concerns and gaps in knowledge, the authors conducted a systematic review of previous studies to comprehensively examine the effects of blended learning and its subcategories on critical thinking (and its subcategories). The ultimate goal is to understand how blended learning can enhance these crucial skills in the twenty-first century.
Overall, this introduction provides a broad overview of key concepts such as critical thinking, blended learning, and their significance. It presents supporting evidence from existing literature while establishing the rationale for conducting the proposed study. In addition to establishing the rationale for their study, the authors highlight the necessity of reviewing current educational strategies. They emphasize the repeated emphasis on making greater use of active learning strategies. This suggests a recognition that traditional teaching methods may not be as effective in developing critical thinking skills.
The authors specifically mention an extensive systematic review of previous studies as their chosen methodology. By conducting this type of review, they aim to provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of existing research on the effects of blended learning and its subcategories on critical thinking.
Their focus on critical thinking as one of the essential skills in the twenty-first century aligns with broader societal needs for individuals who can think critically, solve complex problems, and make informed decisions. As such, their study has implications beyond academia and could potentially contribute to efforts aimed at improving educational practices across various fields.
By investigating how blended learning impacts critical thinking skills, the authors aim to address a gap in knowledge regarding this specific pedagogical approach. They mention earlier research findings that have presented mixed results or focused on other aspects within blended learning methodologies (such as flipped classrooms). This indicates that while some studies have shown positive outcomes, there is still uncertainty about whether blended learning consistently enhances critical thinking skills.
By delving into previous research findings and conducting a systematic review, the authors intend to provide a more nuanced understanding of these relationships. This will allow them to determine if there are specific factors or approaches within blended learning that lead to more significant improvements in students' critical thinking abilities.
It is worth noting that nursing education is explicitly mentioned as a context where teaching critical thinking holds particular importance. The inclusion of this reference highlights nursing's unique demands for high-level decision-making skills and problem-solving abilities related to patient care.
Overall, this introduction sets up an argument for investigating how blended learning can impact individuals' development of critical thinking skills—a crucial competency needed in today's competitive world—and lays out why it is an important area for further research. The comprehensive review methodology and focus on an essential skill for the twenty-first-century workforce contribute to the article's significance in understanding the potential benefits and limitations of blending learning environments. 
The introduction of this PubMed article starts by highlighting the significance of viral hepatitis as a major global public health issue. It emphasizes that millions of individuals suffer from viral hepatitis every year, and in 2015, it caused 1.34 million fatalities worldwide. The majority of these deaths were due to chronic liver disease or primary liver cancer.
The introduction points out that the death rate from viral hepatitis has been increasing over time and now it can be compared to other major communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria infections.
It explains that viral hepatitis can be caused by five known hepatotropic viruses: Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis D Virus (HDV), and Hepatitis E Virus (HEV).
The article highlights the fact that a large number of individuals do not have access to screening and treatment for hepatitis, leading to chronic liver disease and cancer mortality. The World Health Organization is urging countries to take action in increasing knowledge, diagnosis/testing, and treatment services for this condition.
Specifically discussing HAV and HEV infections, which are enterically transmitted pathogens with sporadic infections or outbreaks of Acute Viral Hepatitis (AVH). The transmission route for HAV is mainly fecal-oral.
Regarding HBV infection in India specifically, it mentions that it affects approximately 240 million people worldwide while chronic HCV affects around 130-150 million. Chronic hepatitis affects about 400 million individuals globally with the Asia-Pacific region being highly impacted.
The introduction also states that both HBV and HCV infections are primarily transmitted through the parenteral route. Chronic infection due to these viruses can lead to serious consequences such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore, given their similarities in terms of distribution, hepatotropism, disease transmission patterns leading to chronic infection with possible outcomes like liver cirrhosis and HCC, it is mentioned that there is no standard of care for HBV and HCV due to the individualized nature of each infection.
The article highlights the importance of studying the prevalence of viral hepatitis in India. It states that this review aims to summarize the prevalence of viral hepatitis in India by analyzing peer-reviewed articles published between February 2000 and February 2021. Additionally, it aims to review determinant factors specific to the Indian region.
Lastly, a brief description is provided about Hepatitis as an inflammatory disease of the liver according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), while also mentioning a funnel plot as a graphical representation used to detect systematic heterogeneity and publication bias.
Overall, this introduction sets the stage for understanding why viral hepatitis is a significant public health issue globally and specifically in India. It highlights key statistics regarding its impact on mortality rates and emphasizes the need for increased knowledge, diagnosis/testing, and treatment services. The introduction of this PubMed article continues by stating the objective of the current review, which is to study the overall prevalence of viral hepatitis in India. The authors intend to do this by analyzing peer-reviewed articles published from February 2000 to February 2021.
This objective is important because understanding the magnitude and prevalence of viral hepatitis in a specific region like India can help inform public health interventions and strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. By reviewing existing literature on viral hepatitis in India, researchers can identify trends, risk factors, and areas that require further attention.
The article mentions that studying determinant factors specific to the Indian region is another aim of this review. This implies that apart from assessing prevalence rates, the authors will also investigate what factors contribute to viral hepatitis occurrences in India. These determinant factors may include demographic characteristics, geographic distribution, socioeconomic conditions, cultural practices related to transmission modes (such as blood transfusion or unsafe injection practices), healthcare infrastructure availability or accessibility issues for diagnosis and treatment services.
Moreover, the introduction briefly introduces two key concepts: "funnel plot" and "intervention effect". A funnel plot is a graphical tool used in research studies assessing publication bias or heterogeneity among individual study results. It helps visualize whether there is an asymmetrical distribution of effect sizes (e.g., odds ratios or relative risks) across studies included in a systematic review/meta-analysis. Publication bias refers to studies with statistically significant findings being more likely to be published than those with non-significant outcomes or negative results.
The intervention effect represents an estimation/measurement used within each individual study included in a systematic review/meta-analysis where researchers examine if certain interventions impact disease outcomes/progression rates/prevalence/other relevant indicators related to viral hepatitis in this case).
By mentioning these concepts briefly at this stage/model description step within their introduction section (and providing a reference), authors indicate their intention for conducting rigorous analysis while minimizing potential biases commonly observed across studies.
In summary, the introduction of the PubMed article discusses the importance of studying viral hepatitis in India. It outlines the aims of this review to analyze peer-reviewed articles on prevalence and determinant factors specific to the Indian region. Additionally, it touches upon methodological concepts like funnel plot and intervention effect to demonstrate a commitment to conducting a robust analysis. By addressing these objectives, this research aims to provide valuable insights into viral hepatitis in India and contribute to understanding, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for this public health concern. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by defining transactional sex as casual sex between two people that involves the exchange of material incentives for sexual favors. The author notes that transactional sex is associated with negative consequences such as sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV/AIDS), unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion, and physiological trauma.
The article then focuses specifically on Sub-Saharan Africa, where several studies have been conducted to examine the prevalence and factors associated with transactional sex among women. However, these studies have yielded conflicting results, leading to a need for a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the overall prevalence and factors related to transactional sex in this region.
The introduction highlights how socioeconomic factors play a significant role in establishing exchange-based sexual relationships in countries with high HIV prevalence. It also notes that globally, young people in Sub-Saharan Africa are more threatened by the HIV epidemic compared to other regions, with a high proportion of new infections occurring among young girls.
Furthermore, the introduction points out that risky sexual practices among females can lead to multiple concurrent sexual relationships and engaging in unprotected sex. This puts these girls at risk of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Unprotected sex also increases the risk of unintended pregnancies, which can result in unsafe abortions.
The article emphasizes that transactional sex motivated by financial gain is a serious public health issue in Sub-Saharan Africa. Assessing transactional relationships is seen as an important aspect of HIV prevention initiatives because it is identified as one of the main risk behaviors contributing to STI transmission and unwanted pregnancies.
Various issues faced by young people in sub-Saharan Africa contribute to their involvement in transactional sex. These include cultural norms, gender inequality, harmful traditional practices combined with limited access to reproductive health services and high unemployment rates for young females from lower-income families.
Several statistics are provided throughout the introduction highlighting the prevalence of transactional sex across different countries within sub-Saharan Africa. These numbers range from 2% in Niger to as high as 85-90% in Uganda among sexually active girls who have engaged in transactional sex within the last 12 months.
The introduction concludes by restating the need for a systematic review and meta-analysis to address the discrepancies and inconsistent results from previous studies. This study aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the prevalence and associated factors of transactional sex among women in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to highlighting the prevalence of transactional sex and its associated factors, the article emphasizes the public health implications of this practice in sub-Saharan Africa. It explains that transactional sex not only increases the risk of HIV infection and other STIs but also contributes to early sexual activity, early pregnancy, unsafe abortions, and school dropout among girls.
The article explains that unwanted pregnancy is a significant consequence of transactional sex for women in this region. It notes that when young girls become pregnant as a result of engaging in transactional sex, they often face barriers to education due to societal norms and expectations related to parenthood. This further perpetuates their disadvantaged position and limits their long-term life chances.
Furthermore, cultural and social norms along with gender inequality contribute significantly to encouraging young people in sub-Saharan Africa to engage in transactional sex. These norms may include traditional practices that prioritize male dominance and financial dependency on men. The lack of access to reproductive health services exacerbates these challenges for young females from lower-income families.
The introduction concludes by reiterating the importance of conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis to consolidate existing research on transactional sex among women in sub-Saharan Africa. By pooling data from multiple studies, it aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the prevalence as well as identify common associated factors across countries within this region.
This study is critical for informing future interventions and prevention strategies targeting transactional sex-related behaviors among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the extent of engagement in transactional sexual relationships can help policymakers design targeted programs aimed at reducing HIV transmission rates, improving access to reproductive health services, empowering women economically, addressing gender inequalities, promoting safe sexual practices such as consistent condom use or limiting multiple partners.
Ultimately, through synthesizing existing literature on this topic comprehensively through systematic review and meta-analysis methods outlined elsewhere [REF], this study seeks not only insights into transnational relationships but also aims long-term at mitigating broader public health concerns in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly those relating to HIV/AIDS, unintended pregnancies, and unsafe abortions. 
This introduction begins by explaining the concept of surface plasmon resonances (SPR) in noble metals such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag). These metals, when illuminated with a resonant wavelength, can cause the coherent oscillation of electrons, resulting in a significant increase in the optical extinction cross-section and near-field enhancement. This property allows noble metal plasmonic nanostructures to serve as SPR sensors by utilizing the high sensitivity of local electromagnetic fields to changes in their surroundings.
The rapid development of nanofabrication technologies in the past decade, including techniques like nanosphere lithography and nanoimprint lithography, has greatly expanded the range of applications for SPR sensors. These label-free and real-time detection devices have found uses in various fields for detecting bio-/chemical species.
The performance evaluation of SPR sensors is typically done using figure of merit (FOM), which measures how well they can detect changes in refractive index. A high FOM indicates excellent sensing performance. The factors influencing FOM are spectral shift per refractive index unit (RIU) and resonance linewidth or full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). To improve FOM, there are two main directions: enhancing near-field intensity for a large spectral shift per refractive index or decreasing the linewidths of the sensors by reducing plasmonic loss.
The introduction then discusses different types of SPR sensors. Propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) sensors that use prism coupling strategies have limited flexibility in tuning optical properties and suffer from difficulties with miniaturization and portability due to their reliance on optical components.
On the other hand, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensors based on metallic plasmonic nanoparticles do not need momentum matching conditions for excitation and are relatively simple to prepare with low cost. However, LSPR sensors often exhibit broad resonance spectra due to strong radiative damping, which can limit their sensing performance.
Advances in micro-/nanofabrication techniques have led to the development of metallic plasmonic substrates and nanostructured SPR sensors, such as nanohole arrays, nanoring arrays, and nanomushroom arrays. These nanostructured SPR sensors offer easier integration with imaging and microfluidic systems, direct excitation of plasmonic resonances without additional coupling structures, and the potential for multiplexing and high-throughput sensing analysis. The flexible structural designs of these sensors also provide opportunities to enhance near-field intensities and reduce resonance linewidths, thereby improving FOM.
Nanostructured SPR sensors have been extensively utilized in various applications such as medical diagnosis, food safety analysis, and environment monitoring. The introduction concludes by stating that this review aims to introduce effective strategies for improving the sensing performance of SPR sensors with a focus on reducing resonance linewidths rather than enhancing near-field intensities. The subsequent sections will cover influence factors of plasmon linewidths (Section 2), developed strategies for obtaining narrow resonance linewidths (Section 3), applications of SPR sensors in different fields (Section 4), and prospects for the future development of nanostructured SPR sensors.
Overall, this introduction sets the stage by explaining the principles behind surface plasmon resonances in noble metals and their applications as sensor devices. It highlights ongoing challenges in terms of sensor performance related to resonance linewidths while providing a context for exploring strategies to address these limitations. 
The introduction of the PubMed article starts by highlighting that the hospitality sector is one of the most energy-intensive parts of the tourism industry, following only the transportation sector. The high energy consumption in hotels is attributed to various factors such as heating, cooling, lighting, cooking, cleaning, and entertainment. Additionally, it is mentioned that many hotels worldwide focus on high-end and luxury features, which leads to higher investment, consumption, and pollution levels compared to other types of accommodations.
To provide some examples and context for this issue, the introduction presents statistics on energy utilization rates in high-star hotels from countries like Singapore and Portugal. It also mentions average energy consumption per meal and bath in Greece as well as the annual average energy intensity of hotels in Ottawa. These statistics emphasize how hotel buildings consume significantly more energy than residential buildings or other commercial buildings.
The introduction further highlights a study by Sheng et al., which found that luxury hotels in China consume four times more energy than other commercial buildings. This underscores the urgent need for energy-efficient operations in this sector. The increasing concern over hotel energy consumption has prompted scholars from various research fields to investigate this issue.
The negative impacts resulting from excessive hotel industry dependence on fossil fuel-based energy are discussed next. Oluseyi et al.'s study is referenced to demonstrate a strong correlation between CO2 emission levels and per unit room energy consumption in the hotel industry. Moreover, Sofer & Potchter's findings indicate that dense hotel belts contribute significantly to urban heat island effects.
Following these explanations about the environmental impact of large-scale hotel operations driven by significant population growth globally with increasing localized greenhouse gas emissions threatening climate change goals—various measures taken by countries and regions are mentioned such as low-carbon hotels and green hotels initiatives—aimed at reducing resource expenditure while alleviating associated climate footprint emissions [REF].
It goes on to mention researchers' advocacy for conservation efforts since the 1970s within academia with a growing endorsement of the concept of green consumption by tourists. The introduction then describes the main areas that past research has focused on, including the composition and major energy consumption sectors in hotels, factors influencing hotel energy consumption, and establishing benchmarks for energy usage. It highlights how earlier studies were primarily case studies but recent trends show increased interdisciplinary research combining knowledge from fields such as engineering, environmental science, business, and economics.
The introduction stresses the importance of collaboration in energy research within the hospitality industry. It explains how collaboration allows researchers and practitioners to combine resources and expertise to tackle complex energy-related issues effectively. By sharing information and best practices through collaborations, new insights are gained that can be applied to solve real-world problems.
The idea that interdisciplinary research drives innovation is presented next by emphasizing its ability to solve complex problems requiring knowledge from different disciplinary backgrounds for innovative solutions [REF]. The significance of cooperation in facilitating knowledge exchange and innovation is also highlighted.
Finally, it addresses the lack of studies specifically focusing on collaborative r 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by providing an overview of orofacial pain (OFP). It describes OFP as localized below the orbito-meatal line, above the neck and anterior to the ears, including pain in structures of the oral cavity. The latest classification system for OFP distinguishes between acute, episodic, and chronic pain based on duration and frequency.
Chronic OFP is particularly significant because it often leads to reduced quality of life, sleep disturbances, psychological issues, and disability. This distinction is crucial as chronic OFP requires different management strategies and has a less favorable prognosis compared to acute or episodic pain. The estimated prevalence of chronic OFP in the general population is 10%.
The article then introduces the concept of primary versus secondary classification for OFP. Primary conditions have unknown causes (e.g., chronic primary temporomandibular joint pain), while secondary conditions have identifiable causes (e.g., temporomandibular joint pain attributed to arthritis). Chronic primary OFP is considered its own disease entity, whereas chronic secondary pain syndromes are symptoms of underlying conditions.
The introduction highlights some challenging types of chronic primary OFP that require palliative care rather than curative treatment. These include painful temporomandibular disorders (pTMDs), idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and burning mouth syndrome (BMS). Patients with these conditions often experience significant biological, psychosocial, and economic burdens that impact not only themselves but also their families and society as a whole.
Specifically focusing on pTMDs: myofascial pain and temporomandibular joint pain are identified as the most common types within this category. They affect around 5% of the population with a higher prevalence in women compared to men.
For TN: it has a lifetime prevalence ranging from 0.16%-0.3% predominantly affecting women at a ratio of 1.5:1. TN is characterized by recurring severe paroxysmal pain in the orofacial region, triggered by innocuous stimuli such as washing the face or eating.
Regarding BMS: its prevalence ranges from 2.5%-5%, increasing to 14% among post-menopausal women. BMS is characterized by a burning sensation affecting the tongue, lips, and hard and soft palates. It may be accompanied by taste alterations, stinging sensations, dryness, and atypical odontalgia.
Despite scientific advancements in recent decades, treatment for primary OFP conditions remains suboptimal. Hence, understanding the underlying pathophysiology is essential for improving therapeutic approaches.
The introduction highlights that pre-clinical research plays a crucial role in advancing scientific knowledge of primary OFP conditions. It also emphasizes the increasing importance of pain neuroimaging and genetic studies supplemented with animal research.
The overall goal of this article is to review rodent assays (injury models) and behavioral measures used in chronic primary OFP research specifically focusing on pTMDs, TN, and BMS. The authors aim to discuss these measures' applicability and challenges given our current understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of these conditions while proposing possible future directions for research.
It's worth noting that previous reviews have focused on other conditions associated with OFP like migraine/headaches and oral cancer but are not relevant to this particular article's scope. The article emphasizes that despite the progress made in understanding OFP, there is still a need for further investigation into the pathophysiology underlying these primary OFP conditions. This is because current treatments are not optimal, and many patients continue to suffer from chronic pain and its associated impacts on their daily lives.
To address this gap in knowledge, pre-clinical research involving laboratory animals has been and continues to be an essential means of advancing scientific understanding. The use of animal models allows researchers to study various aspects of OFP, including its etiology, mechanisms, and potential therapeutic interventions.
Additionally, the article highlights that there has been a surge in pain neuroimaging studies and genetic research related to OFP. These approaches provide valuable insights into the neural pathways involved in pain perception and genetic factors contributing to susceptibility or resilience towards chronic pain conditions. Animal research serves as a complementary tool for these neuroimaging and genetic studies, allowing further exploration of mechanistic aspects not easily studied in human subjects.
The primary focus of this review article is to describe the rodent assays (injury models) commonly used for studying chronic primary OFP conditions such as pTMDs (myofascial pain and temporomandibular joint pain), TN (idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia), and BMS (burning mouth syndrome). These assays are critical for investigating various behavioral responses associated with these conditions.
Understanding the applicability as well as limitations of these assays is crucial for designing effective experiments that can provide meaningful insights into these complex disorders. By discussing the challenges inherent in using rodent models for studying chronic primary OFP conditions like pTMDs, TN, and BMS, researchers can refine experimental methodologies going forward.
Furthermore, considering our current knowledge regarding the etiology and pathophysiology underlying these primary OFP conditions should guide future directions in pre-clinical research. By identifying gaps in our understanding or areas where more information is needed, researchers can establish a solid foundation for developing improved therapeutic strategies.
It is important to note that this review article differs from previous ones that have focused on other OFP-related conditions such as migraines/headaches and oral cancer. By delineating this specific focus on chronic primary OFP conditions, the authors aim to provide comprehensive insights into these specific pain syndromes that have significant impacts on patients' lives.
In conclusion, this PubMed article highlights the significance of understanding chronic primary OFP conditions such as pTMDs, TN, and BMS. It underscores the need to further explore the underlying pathophysiology through pre-clinical research using rodent models. The goal is to improve our understanding of these complex disorders and pave the way for more effective management strategies in the future. 
In this introduction, the authors highlight the eye as a prime target for innovative genetic therapies due to its accessibility and the ease of drug administration. They specifically focus on inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) as a forefront disease for which gene therapies are being developed.
The authors emphasize the urgent need for therapies to cure IRDs, given their high prevalence and significant economic and psychological burden. While gene replacement therapy has shown promise for the treatment of IRDs, there are limitations in delivering genes that are too large or expressed in multiple isoforms in the human retina.
The introduction then introduces RNA therapeutics as an alternative approach to gene therapy. RNA therapeutics have the advantage of reversible changes in transcriptomic sequence without inducing permanent genomic changes like DNA editing techniques. The three main types of RNA therapeutics mentioned are antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), RNA interference (RNAi), and RNA editing therapies.
The authors discuss ongoing clinical investigations on ASOs for several IRDs, such as CEP290- and USH2A-associated IRDs. They also mention preclinical development of RNAi therapeutics for autosomal dominant RP (adRP) using a dual RNAi suppression strategy coupled with a gene replacement strategy.
Furthermore, they introduce RNA editing as another type of therapeutic approach derived from post-transcriptional modifications in humans. A specific type known as A-to-I editing is described, where adenosine is converted into inosine by enzymes called Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADARs). The catalytically active ADAR enzymes have important roles in recoding proteins and can be harnessed to correct pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs).
Different strategies for therapeutic RNA editing using exogenous or endogenous ADARs are discussed. These include overexpression of ADAR proteins or fusion with other intermediate binding proteins for exogenous approaches, while recruitment of endogenously expressed ADAR enzymes is explored for endogenous approaches. The design of a programmable guide RNA (gRNA) that marks the target adenosine and achieves on-target editing efficiency with minimal off-target effects is a central challenge in RNA editing.
The authors note recent developments in stabilizing gRNA through circularization or chemical modification, which may enhance the feasibility of therapeutic endogenous ADAR editing in an in vivo clinical setting. However, more research is needed to determine the relevance of ocular gene editing and identify suitable delivery vehicles.
Finally, the authors state that this review aims to provide an overview of RNA editing with endogenous ADARs, including its history and recent advancements. They also discuss the potential for using RNA editing as a treatment approach for IRDs. To facilitate understanding of this field, they provide an overview of ADAR enzymes' structure, function, and role before delving into specific aspects of RNA editing with endogenous ADARs.
Overall, this introduction sets the stage for exploring different types of genetic therapies for IRDs and highlights the potential benefits and challenges associated with using RNA therapeutics and specifically targeting ADAR-mediated RNA editing. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, after providing an overview of ADAR enzymes and their conservation across species, the authors delve into the challenges associated with achieving high on-target efficiency and specificity in RNA editing while minimizing off-target editing.
For endogenous ADAR editing, one of the key challenges is improving on-target editing efficiency while limiting bystander editing in the gRNA:target RNA duplex. Bystander editing refers to unintended edits occurring outside of the targeted site. The authors highlight that there have been limitations in achieving high on-target efficiency for endogenous ADAR RNA editing.
On the other hand, exogenous ADAR editing approaches face a different challenge - restricting promiscuous transcriptome-wide off-target edits. Transcriptome-wide off-target effects refer to unintended edits occurring throughout the entire transcriptome rather than at specific target sites. Despite exhibiting high on-target editing rates, exogenous ADAR approaches have been hampered by these off-target effects.

The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of esophageal cancer (EC) and its global incidence rates, as well as the varying pathological types in different regions. It highlights the significance of EC as one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract.
The first paragraph states that EC originates from the esophageal mucosal epithelium and has varying incidence rates among countries and regions. East Asia, specifically, has the highest incidence rate, which can be twice as high as the global average. Additionally, it mentions that in China, more than 90% of EC cases are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), while low-incidence areas like Europe and the United States predominantly have adenocarcinoma.
The paragraph goes on to provide statistics for new cases and deaths worldwide in 2020. It estimates 604,000 new cases globally (accounting for 3.1% of all cancers) with a mortality rate ranking sixth among malignant tumors. It also highlights China's significant burden in terms of EC cases and deaths recorded in 2015.
Furthermore, it emphasizes that a large proportion (70%) of patients with EC miss out on surgical intervention due to late detection and a high tumor burden. However, if detected early along with precancerous lesions known as ESCC lesions – minimally invasive treatments performed under endoscopy can result in a high 5-year survival rate (~90%).
Despite this success for early-stage patients treated using minimally invasive methods, it is noted that overall diagnosis rates for EC remain low. Many patients are diagnosed only after developing dysphagia or metastatic symptoms when their tumor is already at an advanced stage.
To improve early diagnostic rates specifically for ESCC (the predominant type), screening high-risk populations becomes crucial since early-stage symptoms are often not distinct enough to raise suspicion for potential cancerous growths.
However, due to inconsistencies in the professional expertise of endoscopists, there are missed cases resulting from the failure to recognize lesions during screening in high-risk areas. This leads to highlighting the potential benefit of computer-aided endoscopic monitoring.
The introduction concludes by mentioning that studies have shown that computer-aided diagnosis, specifically using artificial intelligence (AI), can help detect and classify suspicious lesions, ultimately improving ESCC detection rates. AI-assisted endoscopic diagnosis is seen as a promising solution for addressing an increase in workload and improving inspection efficiency.
Overall, this introduction provides essential background information on EC's global prevalence, varying pathological types across regions, importance of early detection and treatment for better patient outcomes, along with the potential role of AI-assisted endoscopy in improving diagnostic rates. Continuing from the introduction, this PubMed article focuses on summarizing the current status of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for endoscopic detection of early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The authors aim to explore the potential of AI-assisted endoscopy in improving diagnostic rates, reducing missed cases, and increasing efficiency.
Esophageal cancer poses significant challenges in terms of early detection. Often, patients are diagnosed at advanced stages when treatment options become limited and prognosis is poor. Improving the early diagnosis rate is crucial for better patient outcomes and reducing the disease burden. This necessitates effective screening methods targeting high-risk populations.
Traditional endoscopy has been a valuable tool in detecting esophageal lesions. However, it heavily relies on the expertise and experience of the endoscopist.

Moreover, there have been cases where lesions were missed due to human error or variations in clinical judgement.
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging AI algorithms to enhance endoscopic diagnostics. These algorithms use advanced machine learning techniques to assist endoscopists by automatically detecting suspicious lesions and providing real-time analysis during procedures.
The advantage of AI-assisted diagnosis lies in its ability to detect subtle or early-stage lesions that could potentially be missed by human observers alone. By analyzing patterns and characteristics within images or videos captured during an endoscopy examination, AI algorithms can help identify precancerous or cancerous regions with high accuracy.
The article likely elaborates on different studies that have explored various approaches for AI-assisted diagnosing of early ESCC using cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning algorithms or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These techniques involve training computational models with large datasets containing labeled images or videos from past clinical cases.
Researchers are able to fine-tune these models so they develop recognition capabilities specific to identifying ESCC lesions. The objective is to create an AI system that can not only enhance the endoscopist's ability to detect lesions but also support decision-making processes in real-time by providing immediate feedback during the examination.
By summarizing the current state of research in this field, the article likely discusses different studies and their outcomes, highlighting promising results that demonstrate improved diagnostic rates, reduced missed cases, increased efficiency, or enhanced overall detection accuracy when using AI-assisted endoscopy.
Ultimately, this research has significant implications for clinical practice and patient care. Successfully implementing AI technology into routine endoscopic examinations could revolutionize esophageal cancer detection by improving early diagnosis rates and potentially saving lives.
To conclude, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in detecting early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) through endoscopy. It emphasizes how AI algorithms can address current challenges faced by traditional screening methods and explores their potential impact on improving diagnostic rates and patient outcomes. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, researchers aim to enhance endoscopists' abilities to detect suspicious lesions effectively while conducting screenings in high-risk populations. 
The introduction of the PubMed article discusses the rapid technological advancements in teaching strategies that have occurred in recent years. Educators have been combining digital technology with various teaching methods and administrative strategies to align with course goals, settings, and subject matter. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced many schools to transition to distance education due to the unpredictable occurrence of new outbreaks.
As a response to these challenges, several countries have adopted educational strategies that incorporate newly developed technology devices, such as e-learning, augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, educational chatbots, and podcasting. Among these technologies, podcasts have emerged as a tool that is easily accessible and engaging for supplementing educational content. They have become increasingly important learning tools in various fields including nursing education.
The origins of podcasts trace back to the 1980s when radio evolved into new forms due to digital technology advancements. The term "podcast" was first coined by journalist Ben Hammersly in a newspaper article in 2004. A podcast is defined as an audio frequency launching via the internet or certain online portals like iTunes or YouTube. Podcasting featured a decentralized open architecture that allowed audio content storage on websites and enabled users to link and download via RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds.
Podcasting gained popularity primarily in Western countries because of its convenience properties such as fast delivery speed, lower cost compared to traditional media channels like radio or television broadcasting networks), and user-friendliness. Educators also started utilizing podcasts for knowledge exchange purposes; for example, the University of Oxford provided free podcasts of entire courses on iTunes.
While podcasting became popular early on in Western countries like the United States and Europe based on existing infrastructure support from companies like Apple or platforms such as iTunes/uTube), it took some time for Eastern countries like Taiwan (referred specifically) mentioned here)to catch up with this trend fully until 2020 when local companies SoundOn and Firstory created a suitable podcast development ecosystem. The market for podcasts in Taiwan dramatically increased, with more than 870 new podcasts emerging in the first half of 2020 alone. Taiwanese listeners also showed significant growth, with a substantial increase in downloads from Jan. 2020 to Jan. 2021.
Overall, using podcasts can bring various benefits to educational pursuits. They reduce visual fatigue levels and enable cyclical listening to enhance learning effectiveness and improve the overall learning experience. Podcast listenership has been on the rise globally, with surveys showing that over half of American audiences above the age of 12 have a habit of listening to podcasts.
In Taiwan specifically, there has been strong support from the government for distance learning initiatives since the early 1990s, making it an international leader in digital technology development. Taiwanese nursing educators strive to embrace new technologies and innovations by incorporating high-tech devices into their curriculum teaching strategies.
However, despite these advancements in technology adoption within education and healthcare-related fields in Taiwan, podcast usage remains relatively low compared to other countries or industries that have already embraced this medium fully.
This mini-review article aims to overview how podcast technology is currently being applied in nursing education and shed light on possible future trends within this field. 
This introduction is from a Position Statement prepared by the Nutrition Department of the Brazilian Association for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (ABESO). The statement aims to provide guidance on strategies and interventions for weight loss in individuals with obesity.
The statement begins by acknowledging that obesity is a chronic, progressive disease caused by various factors, primarily related to lifestyle (sedentary behavior and poor eating habits) as well as genetic, psychological, cultural, and ethnic factors. The treatment of obesity is complex and long-lasting, requiring lifestyle changes such as nutritional therapy, physical activity, psychological interventions, and potentially pharmacological or surgical treatments. It emphasizes that even modest weight loss (5%) can improve metabolic health and reduce cardiovascular risk.
The authors highlight the importance of long-term follow-up strategies for patients with obesity in order to promote sustainable weight loss. They present Figure 1 which demonstrates examples of successful strategies for long-term weight management.
The article then addresses specific dietary factors associated with obesity. One significant issue observed in Brazil in recent decades has been an increase in calorie intake primarily from ultraprocessed foods. The authors cite studies showing that these products make up a substantial proportion of dietary energy intake and are positively associated with excess weight and obesity prevalence across all age groups. They also mention similar findings from studies conducted in other countries.
Low intake of vegetables is identified as another relevant factor associated with obesity based on a North American study where an inverse association was found between consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and weight gain. Furthermore, low intake of fiber-rich foods was linked to increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality according to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.
Given these findings concerning dietary factors contributing to obesity prevalence worldwide,the authors emphasize the importance of recommending balanced diets for preventionand treatmentofobesityandits comorbidities.They note that “diet” has unfortunately become associated with food restriction due to common usage of the term “diet foods” or low-fat and sugar-free products. They highlight the true meaning of the word “diet” in its original Greek origin, which denotes a synonym for quality of life and encompasses healthy eating practices from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives.
The statement also addresses the negative impact of fad diets on obesity treatment. These diets often promise rapid weight loss but lack scientific evidence to support their efficacy and safety. The authors caution against these approaches, as they can have potentially harmful effects on health and are often created solely for commercial purposes.
Finally, the authors advocate for individualized meal plans that consider cultural habits, lifestyle, preferences, and personal circumstances to facilitate adherence to treatment. They emphasize that highly restrictive diets are difficult to maintain long-term and can lead to increased dropout rates and weight regain.
In summary, this introduction provides an overview of the complex nature of obesity as a chronic disease influenced by multiple factors. It emphasizes the need for comprehensive strategies involving nutrition therapy alongside other interventions. Additionally, it highlights specific dietary factors contributing to obesity prevalence worldwide while debunking misconceptions surrounding dieting terminology. Finally, it warns against fad diets while promoting individualized meal plans for successful long-term weight management. 
This PubMed article provides an overview of the importance of kinases in cellular metabolism, cell cycle regulation, cellular endurance, and differentiation. Kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in various signaling pathways and have been implicated in diseases such as diabetes, inflammation, and cancer.
The human genome sequencing has revealed that approximately 2% of the human genome codes for protein kinases, which are further categorized into families and subfamilies based on their biological functions. The major types of kinases found in mammalian signaling pathways include lipid kinases, tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases, and dual kinases.
Phosphorylation is a key mechanism by which protein kinases regulate target proteins' activity by controlling signaling pathways through amplification, cellular location changes or interactions with other controlling proteins. The study on human kinases has identified 518 protein kinase families based on their biological functions.
Kinase inhibitors are small molecules that inhibit kinase activity and have significant applications in therapeutic and diagnostic fields. They have shown potential as targets for treating various diseases such as autoimmune disorders cardiovascular diseases cancer inflammatory disorders. As of November 2022 FDA had approved 72 small molecules as therapeutic kinase inhibitors.
While small molecule kinase inhibitors have limitations like target non-specificity toxicity; novel biologic agents like monoclonal antibodies can also be employed for targeting specific kinases but disadvantages like target non-specificity may still remain. Additionally natural products from plant sources contain small molecules that can function as signaling molecules and assist in treating several disorders.
Research has also focused on marine natural products as potential sources of kinase inhibitors. Marine bacteria fungi sea animals algae sponges coral species have produced numerous kinase inhibitors with potential applications in drug development.
Kinase inhibitors represent a rapidly growing area of interest in therapeutics research however developing potent selective inhibitors remains challenging due to the complex nature of the active sites within these enzymes. A variety of approaches including targeting upstream kinases in kinase cascades and utilizing conformational variability have been explored to inhibit kinase activity. Selectivity has been a challenge during the development of kinase inhibitors binding to ATP pocket that disrupts the functioning of the kinase. Therefore, alternative strategies targeting inactive forms or employing structural diversity have been employed.
Several successful kinase inhibitors such as Imatinib have been developed for oncology applications. These inhibitors target specific types of kinases involved in oncogenic pathways and have shown efficacy in treating certain cancers like chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors.
Finally, the global market for kinase inhibitors is gradually expanding due to their therapeutic potential in a range of diseases beyond cancer. While cancer remains a priority area for drug development efforts, there is increasing interest in exploring other disorders as well.

The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the significant impact of neonatal encephalopathy (NE) on child mortality and long-term morbidities, such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and neurocognitive delays. The incidence of NE is lower in industrialized countries where therapeutic hypothermia (HT) is the standard treatment, reducing mortality and morbidities. However, NE burden is disproportionately higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. The feasibility, safety, and efficacy of HT in LMIC are uncertain due to various factors like prolonged intrapartum insults, comorbidities like poor nutrition or infections/inflammation.
The article highlights the need to identify alternative neuroprotective treatments for NE that can have a global impact on reducing its burden. It mentions that the pathophysiology following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is complex and evolves through different phases involving changes in placental blood flow, oxygen supply reduction, excitotoxicity increase with intracellular calcium rise, oxidative stress elevation leading to primary energy failure and cell death.
The authors emphasize that many potential therapies for NE target specific pathological processes related to excitotoxicity, oxidative stress or inflammation. They also mention how HT offers global cellular protection but express concerns about its safety and efficacy specifically in LMIC settings. Therefore, economical single therapies become a focus for this study as an alternative to HT.
The introduction acknowledges the absence of safe and effective therapeutic options apart from HT for treating NE currently available. Some agents are being evaluated through randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), either combined with or without HT. Notably mentioned ones include erythropoietin allopurinol topiramate caffeine melatonin stem cells 
Moreover researchers face challenges when translating preclinical studies into clinical studies due to variations between labs regarding treatment protocols/models used as well as lack of comparison with RCTs. The Vannucci rodent model is commonly used to examine the neuroprotective efficacy of potential agents and understand the underlying mechanisms in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, inconsistencies exist concerning hypoxia duration/concentration, temperature control during treatment, number of animals used, which raises questions about result reproducibility and validity.
The article emphasizes that while different treatments have shown neuroprotection in the Vannucci model and have set a foundation for hypothermic protection, there is a need to compare and establish the neuroprotective potency of multiple potential agents using this standardized model. Hence, the study aims to review literature for preclinical/clinical studies on NE therapeutic agents, rank them based on evidence efficiency scores for LMIC use, and test 25 therapeutic agents using the standardized Vannucci P7 rat model to identify promising ones for further study in large animal models.
In summary, this introduction provides an overview of NE burden globally and highlights the limitations of HT as a universal treatment option. It also discusses challenges faced when translating preclinical findings into clinical practice regarding variable protocols/models. Finally, it states their objectives: reviewing literature on NE therapies, ranking them based on evidence efficiency scores for LMIC use, testing multiple agents using a standardized animal model to identify promising candidates for further investigation. In the subsequent sections of the introduction, the article delves deeper into the pathophysiology of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. It explains that after an initial phase of reduced placental blood flow and fetal oxygen supply, which leads to a loss of cerebral autoregulation and decreased systemic blood pressure, there is an increase in excitotoxicity, intracellular calcium levels, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This results in primary energy failure and cell death.
Following reperfusion during resuscitation, there is a partial resolution of hypoxia-induced cytotoxic edema and accumulation of excitatory amino acids. Cerebral oxidative metabolism appears to recover during this latent phase. However, around 6-24 hours after hypoxic-ischemic insult (HI), a secondary phase occurs despite adequate oxygenation and perfusion. This secondary phase is characterized by failure of cerebral oxidative metabolism (secondary energy failure), further glutamate-driven excitotoxicity inflammation, production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as mitochondrial dysfunction.
The final phase occurring days to weeks or months later involves chronic inflammation that may lead to epigenetic changes and impair neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and axonal growth.
The introduction then discusses how various putative therapies for NE target specific pathological injury processes such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, overproduction of ROS  mitochondrial dysfunction , neuroinflammation ,and regeneration.
Therapeutic hypothermia (HT) has been found to have a global protective effect on multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in NE but concerns remain regarding its safety and efficacy in LMIC settings. In this study's focus on finding alternative therapies for LMICs economical single therapies are preferred.
The article also mentions other potential therapeutic options for NE currently under evaluation in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) such as erythropoietin allopurinol topiramate caffeine melatonin stem cells. However, it notes that some preclinical agents like inhaled xenon and erythropoietin have not shown significant neuroprotection in clinical trials when combined with HT.
The variability in treatment protocols and models used between preclinical studies is highlighted as a challenge for their translation into clinical studies. Additionally, the lack of reporting pertinent experimental details and animal numbers raises questions about result reproducibility and validity.
To address these issues, the study aims to review existing literature on potential NE therapeutic agents, rank them based on evidence efficiency scores specifically for LMIC settings. Furthermore , it intends to directly compare the neuroprotective efficacy of 25 different therapeutic agents using the standardized Vannucci P7 rat model in a single lab setup. The goal is to identify the most promising agents that can then be further investigated and studied using larger animal models.
In summary, this article provides crucial background information on neonatal encephalopathy (NE), its impact globally, limitations of current therapeutic options like therapeutic hypothermia (HT) in LMIC settings, challenges related to preclinical-to-clinical translation of therapies for NE ,and identification of alternative neuroprotective treatments as a major global interest. The specific aims of this study are highlighted: reviewing literature on NE therapies, ranking them for LMIC use based on evidence efficiency scores ,and evaluating multiple potential neuroprotective agents using a standardized animal model to identify promising candidates for future research. 
This introduction provides an overview of the field of gelatin authentication, specifically focusing on the use of biomarkers to determine the origin of gelatin. Biomarkers are molecules that are present in a specific species and can be used as indicators for authentication purposes. In the case of gelatin, two prominent categories of biomarkers are proteomic (proteins and peptides) and genomic markers.
Collagen, a fibrous protein found in animal tissues such as skin, bones, and connective tissue, is used to extract gelatin which has various applications in food and pharmaceutical industries. There are two types of gelatin - type A and type B - with different properties resulting from acid or alkaline pre-treatments during production.
Porcine and bovine skins and bones are commonly used as raw materials for gelatin production worldwide. However, there are public health concerns associated with their use due to potential pathogen dissemination, including prions that can be linked to disease transmission. Additionally, religious beliefs such as Halal (for Muslims) and Kosher (for Jews) dietary laws restrict the consumption of animal-derived products like porcine or bovine gelatins.
Gelatin is also utilized in traditional Chinese medicine (e.g., donkey-hide gelatin). It is essential for consumers to know the source of gelatins they consume due to product fraud risks. For example, some retailers substitute industrial gelatins made from leather waste for edible ones in food products despite potential health risks associated with industrial processes.
Cases of food fraud involving mislabeling have been reported when porcine DNA was found in Halal food products that claimed to contain only Halal-compliant ingredients like Halal-grade gelatin. The identification methods currently available for authenticating the origin of gelatins have advantages but also inherent limitations.
Proteomic biomarkers (e.g., proteins and peptides) offer reliable approaches while genomic-based methods that rely on nucleic acids and PCR detection have also been proven to be useful in gelatin authentication. These methods can contribute to quality control, ensure food safety, and protect consumers from fraudulent practices.
This review aims to provide an overview of the available methodologies for identifying the original source of gelatins. It will discuss proteomic techniques such as chromatography, mass spectrometry, electrophoresis, lateral flow devices, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Genomic approaches including PCR-based techniques such as singleplex PCR, PCR southern hybridization, and multiplex PCR will also be covered.
The advantages and challenges associated with each approach will be discussed along with future prospects for the field of gelatin authentication. Relevant information sources dating from 1980 onwards until recent developments were obtained through multiple databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) and Google Scholar.
In conclusion, this introduction highlights the significance of biomarkers in gelatin authentication and their potential role in strengthening quality control measures while safeguarding consumer health against food fraud risks. The article further emphasizes the need for reliable and convenient methods for manufacturers to identify the origin of gelatins, in response to consumer demands and increased public health concerns. It acknowledges that several methods have been established but cautions that there is no officially defined authentication method yet.
One challenge in implementing these methods is the high cost of equipment and reagents, which limits their widespread use. Nevertheless, proteomic biomarkers, including proteins and peptides, have shown promise as a strategy for determining gelatin origin. Genomic-based methods based on nucleic acids and PCR detection are also proven useful.
The use of novel biomarkers represents a significant improvement in the field of gelatin authentication as they offer more precise and reliable methods. These methods can be utilized to strengthen quality control measures, ensure food safety standards, and protect consumers from food fraud practices.
The review article then introduces various proteomic approaches that are commonly employed in gelatin authentication research. Chromatography techniques such as liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) enable the identification and quantification of specific proteins or peptides present in different types of gelatins. Electrophoresis techniques allow the separation of proteins based on their molecular weight differences.
Lateral flow devices are another approach mentioned in this article that utilize antibodies specific to particular protein markers to visually detect target molecules in gelatins quickly. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) offers a highly sensitive method for detecting target proteins through antibody-antigen interactions.
Additionally, genomic approaches based on nucleic acid analysis have demonstrated utility in determining origin authenticity. PCR techniques such as singleplex PCR allow amplification of genetic targets derived from specific species found in various animal tissues used for gelatin production.
PCR southern hybridization can distinguish between DNA fragments derived from different sources by using probes targeted specifically to each source's DNA sequence variations. Multiplex PCR extends this capability by allowing simultaneous detection of multiple species in gelatin samples.
The review article acknowledges that each approach has its advantages and limitations. It also emphasizes the need for further research to address existing gaps in knowledge and develop more efficient identification methods for the original biological materials used in gelatin production.
In conducting this review, the authors utilized several databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) to gather relevant information dating back to 1980 until the most recent developments. The selection criteria were tailored specifically to proteomic and genomic biomarkers with potential applications in gelatin authentication.
In summary, this PubMed article presents an overview of the field of gelatin authentication and highlights the importance of utilizing biomarkers to determine gelatin origin. It discusses various proteomic and genomic approaches currently employed, their advantages, limitations, and future prospects for improving identification methods. The review aims to contribute towards enhancing quality control measures, ensuring food safety standards are met while protecting consumers from fraudulent practices associated with gelatins' origin.

It begins by stating that stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease characterized by ischemia or hemorrhage, with ischemic stroke being the most common type. The introduction then highlights the high prevalence of stroke in China, with millions of new cases every year and a rising trend among younger individuals.
The introduction goes on to emphasize that dysphagia, difficulty swallowing, affects a significant percentage (29-78%) of stroke patients. It explains that dysphagia occurs due to damage to various organs involved in swallowing and weakness in key muscles responsible for movement during swallowing.
The impact of post-stroke dysphagia on patients' quality of life is discussed next. While survival rates have improved due to medical advancements, many survivors are left with debilitating sequelae such as dysphagia and impairments in speech, motor skills, and memory. Dysphagia increases the burden on families and society as it can lead to complications like aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition.
The introduction then mentions existing guidelines for diagnosing and treating post-stroke dysphagia developed by European Stroke Organization and European Society for Dysphagia. These guidelines recommend various interventions such as dietary modifications, nutritional interventions, behavioral interventions (swallowing training), oral health care, medication options like Capaicin receptor 1 agonist and dopaminergic drugs), as well as peripheral or central nervous regulation techniques (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation).
However, despite these recommendations, there is currently no specific or highly effective treatment schedule for post-stroke dysphagia. This leads to the discussion of acupuncture as a widely used treatment method in China and some East Asian countries for stroke recovery.
Tongue acupuncture is specifically highlighted as a micro-acupuncture therapy that has shown effectiveness in treating post-stroke dysphagia. It is described as a fast, relatively painless, and side-effect-free therapy that stimulates nerve receptors and helps with nerve sensory input, promoting recovery of damaged areas in the brain. The theory behind tongue acupuncture is based on the relationship between the tongue and meridians in traditional Chinese medicine.
Furthermore, the introduction explains that stimulation of acupuncture points on the tongue can regulate qi (energy) and blood flow, nourish the blood channels of the tongue, and promote recovery in the tongue and pharynx. Tongue acupuncture is considered effective in improving swallowing function by enhancing cortical nerve cell excitability, promoting neurological function recovery, activating related pathways or combinations thereof.
In summary, this introduction provides an overview of post-stroke dysphagia as a significant problem faced by stroke survivors. It highlights current statistics on stroke prevalence and emphasizes the need for effective treatment strategies. The focus then shifts to tongue acupuncture as a promising therapy based on its potential mechanisms of action within traditional Chinese medicine principles. The article further delves into the details of tongue acupuncture as a treatment for post-stroke dysphagia. It explains that tongue acupuncture was developed by renowned acupuncturist Guan Zhengzhai and has become an integral part of acupuncture alongside ear and head acupuncture methods.
According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, the heart is believed to be connected to the tongue through the circulation of meridians and the infusion of qi and blood. The heart is responsible for governing blood vessels and spirit, while the tongue is governed by the heart-mind and brain marrow. Stimulation of the tongue through acupuncture can promote brain function repair and alleviate post-stroke dysfunction through a concept referred to as "blood-vessel-heart-spirit."
Clinical practice has shown that tongue acupuncture therapy is relatively painless for patients, easy to administer, and more effective when combined with body acupuncture techniques. Researchers have found that using tongue-acupuncture points can improve swallowing function by altering cortical nerve cell excitability, facilitating neurological function recovery, enhancing neuron muscular excitability, activating relevant pathways or their combination in controlling swallowing-related nerves and muscles.
The article stresses that based on accumulated evidence from clinical practice, tongue acupuncture has proven effective in promoting functional recovery for patients with post-stroke dysphagia without significant side effects.
Additionally, it notes that this therapy aligns well with traditional Chinese medicine principles regarding holistic treatment approaches. This includes addressing not only symptoms but also considering underlying imbalances within meridians or Zang-fu (organ) systems.
The researchers suggest that due to its ease of administration by acupuncturists and acceptance among patients, along with its demonstrated efficacy in improving swallowing function after stroke without causing pain or adverse effects; Tongue Acupuncture presents itself as a valuable therapeutic option worth exploring further.
In conclusion, this PubMed article highlights the prevalence of post-stroke dysphagia in stroke survivors in China specifically but applicable globally as well. It presents tongue acupuncture as a promising adjunctive treatment modality for dysphagia after stroke, backed by clinical experience and theoretical foundations from traditional Chinese medicine practice. The effectiveness of this non-invasive therapy in promoting swallowing function recovery makes it a potentially valuable addition to the management options available for post-stroke dysphagia. However, further research is required to validate and refine the application of tongue acupuncture in this context, as well as to explore its mechanisms of action more comprehensively. 
This introduction begins by highlighting the prevalence and impact of cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). It states that cognitive dysfunction is one of the most common non-motor symptoms in PD and is much more common in PD patients compared to healthy aging individuals. The presence of cognitive dysfunction worsens the prognosis of PD, increases caregivers' burden, and leads to economic consequences.
The introduction then provides statistics on the frequency and progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD. It mentions that 40-50% of PD patients have MCI at baseline, and around 75-80% of those with MCI eventually progress to dementia based on longitudinal studies.
Next, the concept of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is introduced. SCD refers to a decrease in cognitive capacity without detectable impairment on neuropsychological tests. It suggests intact cognitive functions but may indicate underlying pathological changes. SCD has been identified as an at-risk state for developing MCI or dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
The introduction then draws a parallel between AD and PD by suggesting that SCD may also serve as an intermediate stage between normal cognition and MCI in PD patients.
Neuroimaging studies focusing on PD patients with SCD have indicated reduced FDG metabolism in specific areas of the cortex, including the middle frontal, middle temporal, and occipital regions, as well as the angular gyrus. These findings suggest that there may be early pathological changes associated with SCD in PD.
Furthermore, follow-up studies have shown that PD patients with SCD have a significantly higher risk of developing MCI and dementia compared to those without SCD at baseline. However, it is worth noting that there are some inconsistent results in studies regarding the association between SCD and cognitive dysfunction. Some research has found a correlation between SCD and depression, anxiety, or other mood-related features rather than cognitive impairment.
For example, one study by Barbosa considered subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) as a form of SCD and found that the severity of SCC was related to depression rather than Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores in PD patients with normal cognition. This suggests that clinicians should be alert to affective disorders in PD patients with SCD.
In another study led by Baschi, subjective memory complaints (SMC) were defined as forms of SCD. The results indicated a significant association between PD-SCD and anxiety when compared to PD without SCD.
Overall, cognitive impairment in PD poses a substantial financial burden on society as well as caregivers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify cognitive decline as early as possible. However , studies specifically targeting PD-SCD have been limited in terms of quantity. Furthermore, there is currently no consensus regarding the definition of SCD, nor is there a gold standard evaluation tool for assessing it in PD patients.
Due to these gaps in knowledge and understanding, the aim of this review article is outlined. The review aims to provide an overview of how SCD has been used as a diagnostic criterion in studies on PD. It also aims to describe the possible correlation between SCD and objective cognitive impairment, with the ultimate goal of recognizing SCD as an early indicator or at-risk state and enabling clinicians to predict conversion to PD-associated dementia (PD-D) more accurately.
By conducting this review, it is anticipated that a clearer understanding will emerge regarding the association between SCD and cognitive dysfunction or future cognitive decline in individuals with PD. This will contribute to better identification and early intervention strategies for those at risk.
The authors highlight the importance of addressing cognitive decline promptly due to its significant impact on patients' lives as well as society as a whole. By identifying and diagnosing cognitive impairment earlier, appropriate support systems can be put into place for patients, their caregivers can be better prepared for potential challenges ahead, and resources can be allocated efficiently.
This PubMed article not only emphasizes the clinical implications but also recognizes that further research is needed to establish a consistent definition of SCD specific to PD and develop reliable assessment tools for its evaluation. By providing an updated summary on existing literature related to SCD in PD patients, this review strives to bridge current gaps in knowledge surrounding this important aspect within Parkinson's disease research.
In conclusion, this introduction sets the stage by outlining key points about cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease while emphasizing the significance of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) as an indicator or prodromal stage preceding mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia progression. It highlights neuroimaging findings related to PD-SCD while acknowledging inconsistent results in previous studies. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for further investigation and consensus on defining SCD in PD and establishing assessment tools. The review article's objectives are outlined, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the association between SCD and cognitive impairment, ultimately leading to improved prediction and management of cognitive decline in PD patients. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the current state of primary liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and emphasizes the need for novel therapeutic modalities for advanced or unresectable HCC.
First, it highlights that liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death globally. HCC accounts for 75%-85% of all liver cancer cases.
The introduction then focuses on the role of the immune system in suppressing tumor growth and progression. It states that immunotherapy, which utilizes the host's immune system to fight tumors, holds promise for HCC due to its inflammatory nature and good sensitivity to immunotherapies.
Different types of immunotherapy strategies are mentioned, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), cell-based therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T), tumor immune vaccines, and cytokines like interferon.
Specifically, checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) are discussed. The interaction between PD-L1 expressed on cancer cells and PD-1 is highlighted as a key mediator of cancer immune escape. The success of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in various cancers is also mentioned.
The importance of combining different immunotherapies or combining them with other modalities to enhance their effects is emphasized. However, it is noted that compared to other T cell-inflamed cancers, response rates to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in HCC remain relatively low due to factors like tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics and genetic differences in patients.
Next, the role histone-modifying enzymes (HMEs) play in epigenetic regulation and their involvement in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis are explained. Abnormal epigenetic modifications associated with histone substrates are highlighted as potential targets for epigenetic therapies. Various small-molecule inhibitors of HME are mentioned, including histone deacetylation inhibitors (HDACis).
While HDACis have shown efficacy in hematological malignancies, their therapeutic efficacy as a single agent in solid tumors such as HCC has been unsatisfactory. Hence, combination therapies involving HDACis with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have been developed to enhance therapeutic outcomes.
The introduction then discusses the potential of HDACis to regulate gene expression and overcome tolerance to immunotherapy in HCC patients. HDACis are suggested to enhance the immunogenicity of tumors by increasing the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules that assist tumor antigen recognition by the immune system. Furthermore, HDACis can also modulate the TME by promoting recruitment of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells through increased expression of chemokines, cytokines and NK cell-related receptors.
Finally, the rapid development of nanotechnology is introduced as a game-changer in biomedicine. Nano-based drug delivery systems (NDDS) offer an effective strategy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies for HCC while minimizing damage to normal cells.
In summary, this introduction provides an overview of primary liver cancer focusing on HCC and highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. It emphasizes both immunotherapies and histone deacetylation inhibitors (HDACis) as potential strategies for treating HCC. Additionally, it introduces nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems as a promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of these therapies. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of primary complement (C) deficiencies, which are a type of primary immunodeficiency. It begins by stating that C deficiencies make up approximately 1-10% of all reported primary immunodeficiencies, although national registries have documented higher numbers. The most common C deficiencies affect mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and C2, with MBL deficiency estimated to occur in over 10% of the Caucasian population. However, the majority of C deficiencies have an estimated prevalence of about 0.03% in the general population.
The introduction highlights that many C disorders go undiagnosed due to redundancies in the immune system and the frequent presence of asymptomatic patients. It explains that most C defects are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, except for C1-inhibitor deficiency (autosomal dominant) and properdin deficiency (X-linked). The various types of C deficiencies are categorized into early pathway defects, terminal component defects, and regulatory component/receptor defects.
Symptoms associated with these deficiencies can range from mild or absent to serious and even life-threatening infections. Alongside inherited causes, acquired factors such as immune complex overconsumption, reduced hepatic synthesis, increased protein loss via urine, autoantibodies presence or somatic mutations can also lead to C deficiency.
The introduction mentions three clinical scenarios resulting from missing complement factors: increased susceptibility to bacterial infections; concomitant features of autoimmunity like systemic lupus erythematosus; and uncontrolled complement activation leading to other immune-related disorders primarily due to regulatory component/ receptor deficits.
It emphasizes that severe sinopulmonary bacterial infections involving encapsulated bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae type b are common manifestations seen across different types of complement deficiencies.The presence recurrent neisserial infections may indicate possible terminal component or early alternative pathway deficiencies
Diagnosing C deficiencies can be challenging due to their rarity, heterogeneous clinical symptoms, and complex diagnostic procedures. Functional assays based on hemolytic activity are commonly used initially to test each activation arm of the complement system. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods have been developed to assess the functionality of all three complement pathways, followed by quantification of specific individual components.
Genetic approaches are increasingly employed in diagnosing C deficiencies, as there is a close association between genetic variants and these conditions. Gene sequencing has become an important tool for confirming single component deficiencies detected through functional assays. It is also used as an alternative method when functional tests are not easily available or when there is a need for immediate diagnosis.
The introduction acknowledges that genetic analysis may be complicated by copy number variations, point mutations, and pseudogenes but suggests that next-generation sequencing and improved genetic tools have gradually changed the approach to diagnosing these inherited immune system disorders.
The article aims to explore the potential benefits of genetic workup in supporting currently available immunological assays for identifying C deficiencies. It presents a case study of a ten-year-old boy with C7 deficiency due to a novel mutation resulting in functional hemizygosity. Additionally, it conducts a systematic review of literature to uncover the genetic bases underlying C7 deficiency. In this PubMed article, the authors set out to investigate the role of genetic analysis in identifying and understanding complement deficiencies. They specifically focused on C7 deficiency, a rare condition that affects one of the components of the complement system.
To explore this topic, the researchers conducted a case study involving a ten-year-old boy who presented with C7 deficiency. They discovered a novel mutation that was responsible for functional hemizygosity in this patient. To further enhance their understanding of C7 deficiency, they performed a systematic review of existing literature to uncover other genetic mutations associated with this condition.
The authors highlight that while immunological assays are commonly used for initial diagnosis and evaluation of complement deficiencies, these tests have limitations. Functional and protein analysis can be time-consuming and less accurate. Additionally, they may be influenced by factors such as sensitivity to freeze-thaw cycles.
Genetic approaches offer several advantages compared to traditional diagnostic methods. Gene sequencing has become increasingly robust and accessible, allowing researchers to identify specific genetic variants associated with complement deficiencies accurately. In cases where functional tests are not readily available or inconclusive results are obtained, genetic analysis provides an alternative and immediate diagnostic technique.
The integration of genetics into the diagnostic pathway has been particularly valuable in confirming single component deficiencies detected through quantitative and functional assays. It allows clinicians to pinpoint specific gene mutations responsible for these deficiencies accurately.
Despite challenges related to copy number variations, point mutations, pseudogenes, and inherent complexity when investigating rare diseases' genetics aspects like inherited immune system disorders is steadily improving through advances in next-generation sequencing technology.
The article emphasizes how genetic analysis complements conventional immunological assays by providing additional insights into both diagnosis and pathophysiology underlying complement deficiencies. Understanding the genetic basis behind these disorders can help clinicians develop personalized treatment strategies based on individual patients' specific gene variants.
By studying C7 deficiency as an example within this broader context, the authors aim to shed light on how integrating genetic workup into standard diagnostic protocols has the potential to enhance our understanding of complement deficiencies as a whole. It may also drive further research into novel treatments, prevention strategies, and potentially even genetic therapies for individuals with complement deficiencies.
Overall, this article underscores the importance of incorporating genetic analysis alongside immunological assays in diagnosing and studying primary complement deficiencies. By examining specific cases and conducting thorough literature reviews, researchers can advance our knowledge in this field and pave the way for more accurate diagnostics and targeted interventions in patients with these rare immune disorders. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), highlighting its global impact and severity as a deadly infectious disease. It mentions that MTB primarily attacks the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. TB is described as the 13th leading cause of death worldwide, following only HIV/AIDS.
The introduction emphasizes the scale of the problem, citing that approximately one-third of the global population is affected by TB, with an estimated 10 million new cases reported in 2020 alone. The disease affects people across all age groups and poses a significant threat if left untreated. The emergence of drug-resistant strains further complicates treatment options, making it difficult to combat TB effectively.
One major challenge in controlling TB is the lack of rapid and accurate diagnostic methods. The current available methods mentioned include smear microscopy (acid-fast staining), culture-based techniques, nucleic acid amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). While some techniques are sensitive, they have limitations such as being time-consuming or requiring sophisticated equipment.
The introduction then highlights LAMP as a promising alternative for rapid nucleic acid amplification with simpler operation requirements compared to other methods like PCR. LAMP has been widely adopted for pathogen detection including SARS CoV-2. In fact, it has been endorsed by WHO as a replacement for smear microscopy in peripheral settings for TB diagnosis.
To address the need for better diagnostics and achieve global elimination of TB, this study aims to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on LAMP's diagnostic accuracy in detecting mycobacteria. It acknowledges that while previous studies have demonstrated its efficacy over the last decade, there is currently no updated version available. Furthermore, many studies focused solely on pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB and did not cover other Mycobacterium species.
The authors intend to evaluate LAMP's diagnostic performance by analyzing its sensitivity and specificity against different reference methods, target genes, and detection techniques. The goal is to determine the diagnostic efficiency of LAMP as a tool for mycobacteria detection specifically in low-resource settings where conventional methods may be impractical.
In summary, this introduction provides background information on the global impact of TB caused by MTB. It highlights the challenges in TB diagnosis and introduces LAMP as a potentially advantageous alternative for improved diagnostics. The study aims to fill existing gaps in knowledge by evaluating LAMP's diagnostic accuracy across various parameters with the ultimate aim of addressing TB diagnosis burden in resource-limited settings. In addition to the introduction provided, this PubMed article emphasizes the need for an efficient, reproducible, and cost-effective diagnostic tool for TB that requires minimal infrastructure. The authors propose LAMP as a potential solution to meet these requirements.
LAMP stands for loop-mediated isothermal amplification, which is a DNA amplification method that can amplify minute quantities of DNA within a shorter period of time. Compared to other nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, LAMP offers several advantages. It operates under isothermal conditions, meaning it does not require sophisticated thermal cycling equipment like PCR machines. This makes LAMP more suitable for low-resource regions with limited laboratory infrastructure.
The article also highlights previous research indicating that LAMP-based detection methods have shown higher sensitivity compared to the GeneXpert assay. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed LAMP as a replacement for smear microscopy in peripheral settings for TB diagnosis.
To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of LAMP in detecting mycobacteria, the authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. They collected relevant studies from various databases and analyzed pooled data to assess sensitivity and specificity of LAMP against different reference methods.
They also explored factors such as target genes and detection methods used in conjunction with LAMP technology to determine its diagnostic efficiency. By considering these variables, they aimed to provide an up-to-date assessment of the performance of LAMP not only for TB detection but also for addressing other Mycobacterium spp., expanding beyond strictly pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB studies.
The ultimate goal was to evaluate how well LAMP performed as a tool specifically suited to low-resource settings burdened by high rates of TB infection. By assessing its diagnostic potency in detecting mycobacteria effectively and accurately with minimal requirements on infrastructure or resources available at hand, they hoped their findings would contribute towards efforts in achieving global elimination of TB.
In conclusion, this PubMed article presents an introduction that outlines the global impact of TB and the limitations of current diagnostic methods. It highlights the potential benefits of LAMP as a rapid and cost-effective alternative, particularly in low-resource settings. The authors describe their aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy of LAMP using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach, which would provide valuable insights into its performance for detecting mycobacteria. Ultimately, this work aims to aid in addressing the challenges associated with TB diagnosis and contribute towards achieving global elimination of the disease. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the legalization of cannabis for recreational use in Canada on October 17, 2018. This legislative action has resulted in divergent reactions from different groups: those who campaigned for cannabis legalization have expressed positivity, while groups involved in treating individuals who experience negative outcomes from cannabis use have expressed disappointment. However, despite the increase in cannabis use since legalization, the expected business potential has not materialized.
The article goes on to mention that the overall use of cannabis in Canada has been consistently increasing each year since legalization. It cites statistics showing that the percentage of adults over the age of 15 using cannabis increased from an estimated 15% in 2017 (before legalization) to 25.2% in 2021. Similar increases have been observed in other countries that have fully legalized cannabis.
The COVID-19 pandemic and opioid crisis have affected efforts to inform the general public about potential harms associated with cannabis use. Although adverse events related to cannabis are not common, there is concern that as THC concentration and frequency of use increase, these events may become more prevalent. For example, the rate of diagnosed Cannabis Use Disorder has increased from an estimated 10% to 22% among users.
The need to effectively communicate these risks is emphasized due to recent developments regarding the legal status of medical and recreational cannabis across various countries and states within the United States. Several US states have legalized medical or recreational marijuana, while countries such as Canada and Uruguay have fully legalized both forms of usage.
To support emergency department personnel when discussing adverse events related to mental health associated with cannabis use, this article aims to aggregate common and uncommon psychiatric adverse events experienced by users. The authors acknowledge previous studies on cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) which is often highlighted by media due to its dramatic nature; however, they clarify that only a small proportion of users experience this particular side effect.
Furthermore, an increase in emergency department visits related to cannabis use has been recorded post-legalization in Canada. However, it is noted that the absolute number of such visits remains small relative to the number of cannabis users. The authors propose framing this frequency as a rare side effect if viewed in the context of pharmaceuticals under consideration for government licensing.
In addition to physical side effects like stroke and lung injuries associated with heavy cannabis use, mental health adverse events are discussed as a complex subject requiring further exploration. The article also touches on potential factors complicating data analysis in this area.
Overall, this introduction provides an overview of the context and significance of studying adverse events related to cannabis use following its legalization. It highlights the need for effective communication about risks while considering various demographic and societal factors influencing usage patterns and outcomes. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, it delves into specific studies and research related to adverse events of cannabis use. The authors mention a study conducted by Andrews and colleagues, which examines cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) as one of the most commonly reported adverse events associated with cannabis use. CHS is characterized by severe nausea and vomiting and has received significant attention from the media due to its dramatic nature.
While CHS is one of the more well-known adverse events, the article emphasizes that it affects only a small proportion of cannabis users. It acknowledges that administrative data from Canada shows an increase in emergency department visits per 100,000 people following legalization; however, it is still a relatively small number when considering overall cannabis users.
The study takes a comparative approach to analyzing adverse events related to cannabis by comparing them to side effects seen with government-approved pharmaceuticals. For instance, they highlight more serious medical side effects such as the risk of stroke and lung-associated injuries like hemoptysis (coughing up blood), which are more clearly associated with heavy use. These side effects have clear quantitative measures through imaging techniques that demonstrate damage caused by these events.
However, understanding mental health-related adverse events linked to cannabis use proves even more complex than physical side effects. The authors endeavor to address this complexity within their research. They also acknowledge potential factors that could complicate data analysis in this area but do not delve deeper into these factors within the introduction.
In summary, this introduction establishes a framework for studying the psychiatric adverse events related to cannabis use in conjunction with emergency department visits and medical outcomes following its legalization for recreational purposes in Canada. It highlights differential viewpoints on legalization while emphasizing increasing usage rates since its implementation. Additionally, it touches upon other countries' legal approaches towards medical and recreational marijuana before segueing into specific areas like CHS and mental health consequences.
This setting provides readers context for understanding why researching adverse events associated with cannabis use and effective communication in this field are crucial. The subsequent sections of the article are likely to explore these topics in more detail to enhance understanding, inform medical professionals, and contribute to evidence-based interventions and policies. 
This introduction begins by providing background information on pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs), which are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise from chromaffin cells and often secrete catecholamines. It explains that PCCs originate from the adrenal medulla, while PGLs develop from extra-adrenal sympathetic or parasympathetic ganglia.
The article highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with PCCs and PGLs. It states that these tumors can go undiagnosed during a person's life and are typically discovered in only a small percentage of autopsies. Furthermore, the introduction notes that PCCs are frequently detected incidentally, meaning they are found by chance when patients undergo imaging tests for other reasons. The article updates previous epidemiological data to state that all PCCs/PGLs are now considered potentially metastatic, suggesting an increased likelihood of spread to other parts of the body. As a result, all patients should be advised for genetic counseling due to the significant genetic component associated with these tumors.
The next section provides an overview of the diagnostic methods used for detecting and evaluating PCC/PGL. It mentions urinary metanephrines as a means of diagnosis, as well as the use of CT scanning and functional imaging techniques like positron emission tomography (PET)/CT with various radiotracers and 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy. These imaging techniques aid in identifying potential metastatic disease and determining appropriate treatment options.
Surgical intervention is highlighted as the primary treatment approach for most cases of PCC/PGL after careful consideration by a multidisciplinary team. However, it acknowledges that therapy with 131I-MIBG may also be a reasonable option for unfit cases if 123I-MIBG scintigraphy yields positive results. For metastatic PCCs/PGLs, the article discusses the use of conventional chemotherapy regimens as well as newer agents like tyrosine kinase inhibitors, somatostatin analogs, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), DNA-alkylating agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors.
The focus of this study is then narrowed down to the inhibition of histone deacetylation via HDACis. The introduction explains how alterations in histone acetylation levels can epigenetically affect gene expression related to tumor suppression and cancer progression. It mentions that there are 18 human HDACs divided into two families based on their co-factors and various classes located in different cellular compartments.
The introduction elaborates on the potential anti-cancer effects of HDACis by increasing acetylation levels in both histone and non-histone proteins. This leads to cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation, induction of cell death/apoptosis through mechanisms like oxidative stress generation, disruption of mitosis and autophagy while blocking angiogenesis.
The article also provides relevant tables summarizing key information such as classification of human HDACs by cellular localization and tissue expression, clinical testing status and indications for various HDACis currently under investigation for PCC/PGL treatment.
Finally, it states that this review aims to summarize previous research on currently tested HDACis for treating metastatic/unresectable PCCs/PGLs from in vitro studies up to clinical trials. It also mentions important clinical trials investigating the use of these agents specifically for PCCs/PGLs as well as other neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, it should be noted that PCCs and PGLs are rare tumors, making research and clinical trials on treatment options limited. Therefore, this article seeks to gather all available evidence from in vitro studies, animal models, and clinical trials to provide a comprehensive overview of HDACis in the management of metastatic/unresectable cases of PCCs/PGLs.
To support this objective, the article highlights key clinical trials investigating the use of HDACis specifically for PCCs/PGLs and NETs. The authors likely aim to assess the efficacy and safety profiles of these agents as well as any potential benefits in terms of disease control or overall survival rates. By capturing data from various stages of research - from laboratory experiments to human trials - they hope to ascertain whether HDACis could be implemented into routine oncological practice for these particular tumors.
The introduction also provides information on different types of cancers where HDACis show promise as potential therapeutic options. These include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-small cell lung carcinoma(NCSLC).
To further clarify how HDACis exert their anti-cancer effects, Figure 1 is included in the introduction section. This figure illustrates multiple mechanisms through which HDACis can influence cellular pathways involved in cell growth regulation, cell death induction, angiogenesis inhibition, and other processes crucial for cancer progression.
Additionally, significant attention is given to discussing different classes and specific compounds referred to as HDAC inhibitors. It is mentioned that HDACis can be either natural or synthetic compounds. Some HDACis selectively target specific classes of HDAC enzymes, while others are considered pan-HDAC inhibitors.
Lastly, the introduction highlights the importance of considering patient-specific factors and administration doses when evaluating the antitumor activity of HDACis. Each patient's tumor type and stage, as well as other individual characteristics, may influence the effectiveness and tolerability of these drugs. Therefore, it is crucial to combine scientific evidence with clinical expertise for optimal treatment decision-making in PCCs/PGLs.
In conclusion, this introduction provides a detailed background on PCCs/PGLs and their diagnostic challenges. It focuses on the potential role of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) in managing metastatic/unresectable cases. The article aims to consolidate existing evidence from laboratory studies and clinical trials to evaluate whether introducing HDACis into oncological practice could benefit patients with these rare neuroendocrine tumors. 
This PubMed article provides an introduction to the topic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and its current understanding and treatment. 
The introduction begins by defining ASD as a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by communication deficits, social impairments, repetitive behaviors, and sensory-motor coordination defects. It also mentions that ASD is now encompassed under the term "ASD" in the latest diagnostic systems, such as the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5-TR). The worldwide prevalence of ASD is estimated to be around 1 in 160 children, with a higher prevalence in males than females.
The article highlights that the number of reported ASD cases has increased significantly over the past 30 years. In particular, it mentions that both China and the United States have seen a rise in ASD cases exceeding 2% of their respective populations. This increase has led to a considerable negative impact on patients' daily lives, as well as their families' and social development.
Next, it is stated that although researchers have not yet defined the exact pathogenesis or mechanism underlying ASD's development, genetic, environmental, neurodevelopmental, and immune factors are believed to play significant roles. Furthermore, there currently exists no effective treatment for ASD due to insufficient evidence clarifying its mechanism.
The article goes on to mention various drugs that have been utilized for specific symptoms or comorbidities associated with ASD but not specifically targeting ASD itself. These drugs include risperidone and aripiprazole for agitation and irritability but come with adverse effects such as weight gain; methylphenidate., atomoxetine.,and guanfacine for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms but may cause sleep disruption; loss of appetite nausea ,irritability fatigue sedation hypotension among others.
In addition to pharmacological therapies., behavioral and educational interventions (BEI) have been used for ASD treatment. However, high-quality BEI programs require a significant time commitment and may take a long time to show benefits.
The article then introduces the concept of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), which encompasses medical care practices outside of mainstream medicine. The regimens of CAM that have been tried in ASD patients include biologically based treatments (such as dietary interventions, nutraceuticals, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and chelation) and non-biologically based treatments (such as mind-body medicine, manipulative body-based practices like massage or acupuncture). While some CAM therapies have shown some benefit in treating ASD symptoms., there is still insufficient evidence to confirm their clinical effectiveness.
Within the realm of CAM therapies., acupuncture stands out as a traditional Chinese medicine approach with potential promise for treating ASD. Acupuncture involves the insertion of needles into specific acupoints on the patient's body to stimulate therapeutic responses. Traditional Chinese Medicine frames ASD within their classification system "Shen zhi" diseases, linking it with various symptom categories such as sluggishness depression irritability decreased appetite or delays in development such as speech cognition walking etc . The understanding is influenced by TCM's concept that considers individualized treatment based on overall syndrome differentiation rather than simply targeting disease-specific symptoms.
Despite its historical usage within TCM for thousands of years., acupuncture has not gained authoritative recognition in Western medicine due to the lack of sufficient scientific evidence. This leads to the objective behind this review article - exploring the potential usefulness and efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment option for individuals with ASD.
In conclusion., this introduction provides an overview of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) along with its current diagnostic criteria prevalence response to available treatment options shortcomings thereof leading researchers healthcare providers patients families alike search effective alternative or complementary therapies such as Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM). Acupuncture specifically discussed within TCM context differentiated syndromes serves as a focus for the study presented in this article. 
This introduction provides an overview of the topic being discussed in the PubMed article. It starts by highlighting the unique nature of healthcare organizations, where services provided involve varying levels of risks to patients. It acknowledges that this puts a significant amount of pressure on healthcare professionals, staff, administrators, boards, and policymakers.
The introduction then brings attention to the global COVID-19 pandemic as an event that has emphasized the fragility and stress experienced by healthcare systems and staff worldwide. This sets the stage for discussing the critical role of communication and information sharing in improving patient safety and addressing organizational problems.
The article mentions that past inquiries into failings of care have shown several concerning factors: (a) voiced concerns by staff are often ignored until a crisis point is reached; (b) professionals with high calling intensity may remain silent on critical issues due to psychological contracts that encourage presenteeism; (c) whistleblowing is still considered necessary to address unresolved systemic and organizational problems. It also highlights how silence in healthcare can lead to concealing errors and compromising patient safety.
Next, definitions of employee voice and employee silence are introduced. Morrison's definition describes employee voice as informal communication aimed at improving work-related issues, while LePine and Van Dyne define it as speaking out with intent to challenge the status quo for improvement. Employee silence is defined as intentionally withholding genuine expression about organizational conditions or critical work-related information from colleagues or superiors.
The article notes that there is ambiguity surrounding these terms in healthcare settings, especially when discussing patient safety advocacy or concealing information related to patient safety. The relationship between employee voice/silence, organizational culture/behavior in healthcare settings, and professional culture/identity is explored.
Difficulties arise when trying to operationalize voice/silence definitions because they involve discretionary behaviors shaped by various factors. In healthcare contexts where concerns about patient safety are common topics for discussion or withholding information can have ethical implications if related to medical errors, the discretionary nature of voice/silence can be misleading.
The introduction also touches on the idea that employee silence and employee voice may be distinct concepts with different antecedents. It suggests that employees can exhibit both silence and voice depending on the situation or issue at hand. The conflict of interest between protecting patient interests while considering healthcare professionals and organizations is mentioned.
Furthermore, the article highlights that speaking-up in healthcare is often met with negative consequences for employees, contributing to a culture of silence. It mentions empirical evidence linking employee silence to negative outcomes like burnout. The Job Demands-Control Model, Job Demands-Resources Model, and Conservation of Resources Model are introduced as theoretical frameworks that can help understand employee voice behaviors in healthcare organizations and their impact on employee well-being.
Overall, this introduction sets up the context for discussing communication behaviors within healthcare organizations, emphasizing the importance of addressing both employee voice and silence when it comes to improving patient safety and well-being. The article pivots to focus on the concept of burnout and its relationship to employee voice and silence in healthcare organizations. It mentions that the Job Demands-Control Model (JD-C), the Job Demands-Resources Model (JD-R), and the Conservation of Resources Model (COR) can provide valuable insights into understanding these behaviors and their link to employee outcomes.
The JD-C model considers burnout as a result of a mismatch between job demands and employees' control over their work. In this context, employee silence may be seen as evidence of this mismatch, while employee voice may indicate a better fit between demands and resources. This suggests that having a voice in decision-making processes can contribute to reducing burnout in healthcare professionals.
The JD-R model focuses on job resources that help individuals cope with job demands, and it suggests that employees who feel empowered to speak up about concerns are more likely to have access to necessary resources, leading to improved well-being.
The COR model emphasizes individuals' drive to obtain, retain, foster, and protect valued resources. It suggests that when employees' resources are depleted or threatened, they may be less likely to engage in voice behaviors due to concerns about further resource loss or negative consequences.
By applying these theoretical frameworks specifically within healthcare settings, the article aims to shed light on how employee voices are influenced by organizational factors such as culture and behavior. It also highlights potential conflicts of interest arising from patient advocacy versus protecting professional interests or organizational reputations.
Additionally, the article questions how exactly voice/silence should be operationalized within healthcare contexts given their unique nature. The content of what is being voiced or withheld is crucial because issues related to patient safety have ethical, moral, and legal dimensions which can complicate our understanding of discretionary behaviors in healthcare settings.
In conclusion, this PubMed article introduces the importance of communication behaviors within healthcare organizations with regards specifically focusing on employee voice and silence. It explores definitions; discusses challenges in operationalizing these concepts in the healthcare context; highlights the negative consequences of silence and its impact on employee well-being; and introduces theoretical models that can enhance our understanding of the relationship between voice/silence, burnout, and employee outcomes. By addressing these issues, the article aims to contribute to improving communication efficacy and ultimately patient safety within healthcare organizations. 
The introduction of the PubMed article discusses the growing interest in plant-based diets as a means to achieve sustainable development goals that optimize human and environmental health. It highlights that plant-based diets have been associated with a reduced risk of various noncommunicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.
The introduction further emphasizes that both the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization recommend a sustainable healthy diet that is predominantly plant-based. This includes whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, moderate amounts of eggs, dairy, poultry and fish, as well as small amounts of red meat.
To define plant-based diets more specifically for research purposes, it is mentioned that these diets are characterized by high intakes of foods from plants (fruits and vegetables) and lower intakes of foods from animals (red meat and dairy products).
This sets the stage for discussing how previous research has classified study participants based on their consumption or elimination of animal foods in binary terms. However, it acknowledges that there is a need to characterize plant-based dietary patterns along a continuum rather than through strict categorization.
The introduction introduces diet quality indices as an approach used to assess the quality and variety of foods consumed within a plant-based diet. These indices consider prior knowledge such as dietary guidelines and cultural eating habits to create composite scores reflecting compliance with specified criteria.
Several examples are provided to demonstrate how existing diet quality indices reflect different aspects of plant- and animal-based food consumption. For example, one index focuses on traditional Nordic diet components while others differentiate between healthy versus less healthy plant-based foods.
Given the increasing development of new diet quality indices for assessing plant-based diets alongside research examining their associations with health outcomes, it is emphasized in this introduction that reviewing these indices becomes imperative. The scoping review presented in this article aims to identify and critically evaluate existing diet quality indices used for assessing plant-based diets among adult populations, including their development, construction methodology, and validity.
The ultimate goal of this review is to provide researchers with a comprehensive synthesis of available indices and enable them to select the most suitable index for their own research question. Additionally, it aims to contribute to the field of research on plant-based diets by providing insights into the current state of diet quality indices used in this context. Continuing from the previous explanation, the introduction highlights that this scoping review is essential due to the proliferation of new plant-based diet quality indices and increasing research examining their associations with health outcomes. By conducting a thorough review of these indices, researchers will have a clearer understanding of their basis for development, construction methodology, and validity.
Identifying and critically evaluating diet quality indices used for assessing plant-based diets among adult populations is important for several reasons. Firstly, it allows researchers to assess the appropriateness of different indices for specific research questions or study designs. Not all indices may capture the full spectrum of plant-based eating patterns or provide reliable measures of dietary quality.
Secondly, understanding the basis for development and construction methodology helps evaluate whether an index adequately captures key nutritional components or elements specific to plant-based diets. A robust index should have been developed based on sound scientific principles considering relevant dietary guidelines and cultural context.
Thirdly, assessing the validity of these diet quality indices provides insights into their ability to measure what they claim to measure. Validity refers to how accurately an index reflects individuals' actual adherence to a given dietary pattern. An index with high validity will demonstrate strong associations with relevant health outcomes.
By critically reviewing existing diet quality indices used for assessing plant-based diets among adults in this scoping review, researchers aim to fill gaps in current knowledge in this field. This synthesis seeks not only to provide a comprehensive overview but also build upon previous studies by evaluating each index's strengths and limitations.
The findings of this scoping review will be valuable not only for scientists studying the relationships between plant-based diets and health outcomes but also policymakers interested in promoting sustainable and healthy eating patterns among populations worldwide.
In conclusion, this PubMed article's introduction sets up its primary objective: conducting a scoping review that identifies diet quality indices used for assessing plant-based diets among adult populations while critically evaluating their development basis, construction methodology, and validity. It emphasizes the importance of this review in guiding future research by helping researchers select appropriate indices and promoting knowledge advancement in the field of plant-based diets' impact on human health. 
The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that is a significant cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It states that atherosclerosis can lead to various severe consequences such as heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and major amputation. The article highlights the global impact of CVD by mentioning that approximately 17.9 million people die from it every year.
To understand the disease process of atherosclerosis, the introduction explains that it is characterized by endothelial activation and the accumulation of lipoproteins. This leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and ultimately results in the formation of plaques in blood vessels. These plaques can gradually enlarge, leading to restricted blood flow or embolization, which causes damage to the heart or peripheral tissues.
The current diagnostic methods for atherosclerosis are mentioned next, but it notes rare but significant procedure-related consequences associated with them along with high costs. The classical biomarkers used for diagnosis include total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or serum triglyceride levels.
However, these biomarkers cannot definitively predict the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore there is a need for new biomarkers that are cost-effective and improve detection while identifying novel treatment targets.
The introduction also addresses personalized intervention in preventing clinical events related to CVD as we enter an era of precision medicine. It refers to metrics proposed by the American Heart Association in 2010 to define and monitor cardiovascular health. Lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and abstaining from tobacco use are emphasized along with pharmacological interventions like statins for controlling lipoprotein levels.
Despite high-intensity statin therapy available options including cholesterol-binding agents such as ezetimibe) and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have been introduced due to challenges in achieving therapeutic goals for serum lipids.
The limitations of current strategies are acknowledged, and the need for further research is highlighted. Specifically, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying plaque progression to identify targets for stabilization or regression of plaques is emphasized.
To gain insight into atherosclerotic disease from biomarkers to disease pathogenesis, the introduction mentions extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are described as small membrane-bound particles that play a role in cell-cell communication and have been identified as promising biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in various diseases. They also have potential therapeutic applications due to their ability to carry and deliver bioactive molecules.
The article explains that EVs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and atherosclerosis. Animal studies have contributed significantly to understanding EV biology and functions, laying the groundwork for clinical translation.
In summary, this introduction covers the significant impact of atherosclerosis on cardiovascular health worldwide. It highlights limitations in current diagnostic methods and treatment strategies while emphasizing the need for new biomarkers that are cost-effective and improve detection. The role of EVs is introduced as a promising avenue of research with potential implications for both diagnostics (biomarkers) and therapeutics in various diseases including atherosclerosis. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, the introduction also provides an overview of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their potential applications in understanding atherosclerotic disease.
EVs are described as versatile entities with various applications.

Finally, animal studies are mentioned as critical contributors to our understanding of EV biology and functions, paving the way for clinical translation in the future. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the importance of Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) in the electrical treatment of heart failure. Conventional CRT involves biventricular pacing to stimulate the left ventricle (LV) and has shown significant benefits in reducing hospitalizations and mortality for patients with symptomatic dyssynchronous heart failure.
The uptake of CRT has expanded in recent years, with studies showing benefits in patients with moderate LV dysfunction and those requiring atrioventricular node ablation. However, there is a significant proportion of patients who do not derive clinical benefit from conventional CRT or cannot be treated due to issues like LV lead implantation failure or inadequate performance.
Conduction system pacing (CSP), particularly His-Bundle pacing (HBP), has emerged as an alternative treatment option. HBP aims to restore completely physiological ventricular activation but comes with challenges like difficult implantation and long-term complications. Left Bundle Branch Pacing (LBBP) is a novel form of CSP that shows promising results from observational studies, though robust data from randomized trials is currently lacking.
Considering the high prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in heart failure patients receiving CRT, an important clinical concern is how AF affects outcomes for CSP. AF can attenuate the clinical benefit achieved with CRT due to factors such as reduced cardiac output, uncontrolled ventricular rates, and increased risk of inappropriate shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators.
Given the growing use of CSP in heart failure patients with AF, it becomes crucial to examine how AF impacts outcomes specifically for HBP and LBBP. The article focuses on two areas: evaluating the possible impact of AF on LBBP by adjusting atrioventricular delays (AVDs) to achieve fusion pacing and reviewing evidence on CSP use following AVNA for AF. It aims to address gaps in knowledge regarding CSP efficacy for patients with AF.
In summary, this introduction sets the stage for the article by providing an overview of CRT and its limitations, introducing CSP as an alternative treatment option, highlighting the importance of AF in heart failure patients, and outlining the specific focus and objectives of the study. In the subsequent sections of this article, the authors delve deeper into the impact of atrial fibrillation (AF) on conduction system pacing (CSP), particularly focusing on left bundle branch pacing (LBBP). They discuss various factors that may contribute to the challenges and outcomes of CSP in patients with AF.
One important consideration is the inability to achieve fusion pacing with intrinsic right ventricular conduction due to AF. In patients without AF, adjusting atrioventricular delays (AVDs) can help optimize ventricular dyssynchrony and improve outcomes. However, in the presence of AF, achieving fusion pacing becomes more challenging. The authors critically evaluate current evidence regarding LBBP and its ability to overcome these difficulties in patients with AF.
Additionally, they review studies that investigate CSP use following atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) for AF. AVNA is a treatment option for patients who do not respond well to pharmacological therapies or cannot tolerate them. The authors examine whether AVNA affects CSP outcomes and compare it with conventional CRT in terms of clinical benefits.
Throughout their discussion, the authors emphasize that while observational studies have shown encouraging results for LBBP in both patient groups – those with AF and those who have undergone AVNA – there is a lack of robust data from randomized trials. This creates uncertainty around the efficacy and long-term outcomes of CSP for individuals with heart failure complicated by AF.
The article concludes by highlighting the need for further research to address these critical issues surrounding CSP efficacy in patients with AF. Future studies should focus on randomized controlled trials comparing LBBP with conventional CRT, specifically assessing its impact on LV function improvement and clinical outcomes among individuals experiencing both heart failure and persistent or permanent AF.
In summary, this PubMed article provides an overview of CRT as a cornerstone treatment for heart failure before delving into the challenges faced when implementing CSP techniques such as LBBP in patients with atrial fibrillation. The authors critically analyze the available evidence and advocate for more research to establish the efficacy of CSP in patients with AF. This article aims to contribute to the current understanding of CSP's role in managing heart failure patients with AF and guide clinicians in making informed decisions regarding treatment options. 
The introduction of this PubMed article discusses the concept of digital medicine and its application in the context of healthcare in China. It highlights the evolution of digital medicine from basic applications to a more advanced level, emphasizing its ability to upgrade medical practice to a high-definition and personalized level.
The introduction also mentions the use of smartphones as a central tool in digital medicine, enabling individuals to generate real-world data and focus on their health. Additionally, it acknowledges the role of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in transforming electrocardiograms (ECGs) into screening tools for cardiac and non-cardiac disease prediction. AI can interpret ECG information effectively, suggesting interventions related to diet, exercise, maintenance, identifying potential disease hazards, and enhancing patient care.
However, challenges arise with information retrieval due to constant changes in patients' activity trajectories, disconnected regional databases, and data loss during system updates. The implementation of consistent digital records and medical history-taking systems is proposed as a solution that can improve diagnosis and treatment while avoiding duplication or delays.
The introduction further discusses various medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound, endoscopy, tomography, pathology/histology that offer considerable digital potential when combined with AI-supported diagnosis and treatment. This contributes towards standardization, improved detection capabilities for pathological findings,and faster diagnosis.
A significant focus is placed on acute heart failure (AHF), which is recognized as a global public health burden due to its high morbidity rates,mortality rates,and associated treatment costs.The relationship between AHF and multi-organ dysfunction,worsening renal function,and prolonged hospitalization is mentioned along with challenges faced during patient management after discharge.These challenges include inadequate disease awareness,timeliness issuesin treatment,index testing,resulting in repeated admissions,poor prognosis.It emphasizes that apps,sports watches used for health monitoring,and medication reminders play an important role during post-discharge management.These devices can monitor heart rate,blood pressure,sleep quality,enabling self-regulation and providing comprehensive data for healthcare professionals.However, reliability issues arise when it comes to the analysis of patient condition data by doctors.
To address these concerns, the use of multimodal sensors in household appliances is suggested.These sensors can collect information on daily life physical activity,sleep quality,vital signs,providing a more accurate representation of patient health status. 
The introduction also mentions the importance of an efficient and timely emergency medical system for treatment of acute heart failure.Incorporationof a dedicated network in hospitals aids in quick transfer of data collected by wireless monitoring equipment.The consultation records can be accessed through a database,thus helping experts judge patient condition and reducing time and cost involved in emergency treatment.
Although conventional Western medical treatment combined with Chinese medicine has shown effectiveness in managing patients with acute heart failure,the article emphasizes the need for clinical guidelines that incorporate remote monitoring.Moreover,the integration of digital healthcare with combined Chinese and Western treatments is suggested as a way to optimize clinical treatment protocols.
In summary,this introduction provides an overview of digital medicine's application in healthcare,tackling challenges faced specifically in acute heart failure management.It outlines potential solutions while highlighting opportunities for further research. The article then transitions to present the main objectives of the study. It aims to summarize the current state of research and identify the main challenges associated with integrating digital healthcare for acute heart failure management, particularly in combination with Chinese and Western medicine. The authors also aim to explore the potential benefits and prospects of using digital prevention and treatment strategies that incorporate both medical approaches.
By conducting this research, the authors hope to establish a basis for proposing new strategies and protocols for clinical management. They recognize that with advances in technology and the increasing demand for personalized healthcare, there is a pressing need to adjust existing healthcare models in China by incorporating digital medical technologies like remote monitoring programs.
The ultimate goal is to optimize clinical treatment protocols by leveraging the advantages of digital medicine combined with Chinese and Western treatments. By doing so, they anticipate an improvement in treating acute heart failure patients, enhancing their symptoms, quality of life, and overall cardiac function.
The introduction implies that through an integrated approach combining traditional medical practices with digital tools such as smartphones, wearable devices,sensors,and AI-based analysis systems,the accuracy,timeliness,and effectiveness of diagnosis,treatment monitoring,and prevention can significantly improve.This integration would involve collating patient physiological data alongwith other relevant health information from diverse sources into interoperable systems-assisting physicians in better decision-making while reducing patient readmissions.The precise use cases,the available resources,and possible limitations are expected[REF-needed].
In conclusion,the introduction sets up key aspects related to applying digital medicine technologies within acute heart failure management.It establishes a foundation exploring opportunities,challenges faced by current approaches,discusses possible strategies,enabling future development,care improvements,guidelines formation(for prevention,treatments)with backgrounds combining western (conventional)and Chinese medicines.Promoting personalized care achieving enhanced outcomes in AHF patients has been envisaged[REF-needed]. 
In the past two decades, significant global changes have occurred due to urbanization, economic growth, and population aging. This has resulted in a rapid epidemiological transformation whereby infectious diseases have been largely replaced by cardiovascular diseases as the leading cause of death. However, one crucial risk factor related to cardiovascular disease that is often overlooked is dyslipidemia.
Abnormal lipid metabolism has been found to be positively correlated with an increased risk of various conditions such as atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, and osteoporosis. Additionally, excessive lipid accumulation has been associated with other diseases including diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/hepatitis. Furthermore, abnormal lipid metabolism has also been linked to pituitary dysfunction, testosterone deficiency, hypothyroidism and plays a role in regulating tumor biology.
Energy metabolism alterations are considered indicators of cancer and are important targets for cancer treatment. The uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells requires efficient energy sources. Consequently, lipid metabolism becomes over-activated in order to meet the high energy demands of cancer cells throughout tumorigenesis and progression. Understanding the mechanisms underlying abnormal lipid metabolism in tumors can provide valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies.
Lipid metabolism pathways play crucial roles in numerous metabolic processes within the body. Lipids encompass a diverse group of water-insoluble molecules such as triacylglycerides (principal component of triacylglycerol ester), phosphoglycerides (structural components of biofilms), sterols, spatholipids (important second messengers and hormones). Changes in lipid metabolism can significantly impact biofilm stability and are associated with tumor aggressiveness.
Research from as early as 1953 demonstrated that tumor tissues could synthesize lipids similar to embryonic tissues. Today there is increasing evidence suggesting that specific changes occur within different aspects of lipid metabolism in cancer cells which contribute to tumor progression (Figure 1). This review aims to highlight the current research on abnormal lipid metabolism in tumors and the potential role of drugs targeting lipid metabolism, specifically cholesterol, triglycerides, and sphingolipids.
Cholesterol metabolism enhancement supports cancer progression through various mechanisms: increased cholesterol biosynthesis, heightened uptake of exogenous cholesterol by LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor), augmented cholesterol esterification by ACAT1 (acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1), and amplified production of hydroxysterols. Intrinsic drivers of carcinogenesis include activating oncogenic genes such as MYC that subsequently promote mevalonate pathway gene expression leading to increased miR-33b expression. Another factor is the absence of p53-mediated inhibition of the mevalonate pathway facilitated by reliance on target ABCA1. Additionally, SQLE activates Akt via PTEN inhibition resulting in cholesterol ester accumulation.
In summary, this article presents a comprehensive overview of abnormal lipid metabolism in tumors and its association with tumor progression. It emphasizes the importance of key players like cholesterol, triglycerides, and sphingolipids in tumor biology. Understanding the intricate relationship between lipid metabolism and cancer may provide valuable insights for developing new therapeutic approaches targeting these pathways. This article further delves into the role of abnormal lipid metabolism in tumor progression, specifically focusing on cholesterol, triglycerides, and sphingolipids.
In tumor cells, cholesterol metabolism is often enhanced to support the growth and progression of cancer. The four main aspects through which cholesterol promotes carcinogenesis are as follows:
1. Enhanced Cholesterol Biosynthesis: Cancer cells exhibit increased synthesis of cholesterol, contributing to their growth and survival. This is achieved by upregulating key enzymes involved in the mevalonate pathway, a critical pathway for cholesterol production.
2. Increased Exogenous Cholesterol Uptake: Tumor cells can also acquire cholesterol from their environment by upregulating the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which facilitates the uptake of LDL-cholesterol. This uptake provides an additional source of cholesterol for tumor cell proliferation.
3. Elevated Cholesterol Esterification: Within cancer cells, there is an increased conversion of free cholesterol to its esterified form through the action of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1). This esterification process facilitates storage and utilization of excess cellular cholesterol for various tumorigenic processes.
4. Increased Production of Hydroxysterols: Certain tumors produce elevated levels of hydroxysterols derived from enzymatic reactions involving cytochrome P450 enzymes or sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27). These hydroxysterols promote cancer cell proliferation and migration.
Several intrinsic factors drive these aberrations in cholesterol metabolism during carcinogenesis:
a) Activation of Carcinogenic Genes such as MYC: Activation of oncogenic genes such as MYC leads to upregulation not only in mevalonate pathway genes but also miR-33b expression. MiR-33b further enhances MYC expression through positive feedback loops, exacerbating dysregulated lipid metabolism in cancer cells.
b) Inhibition of p53-Mediated Mevalonate Pathway Suppression: The tumor suppressor protein, p53, usually suppresses the mevalonate pathway as a protective mechanism. However, certain tumors rely on target ABCA1 for their growth and survival, resulting in an absence of p53-mediated inhibition and continued activation of the mevalonate pathway.
c) SQLE-Mediated Akt Activation: Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, can activate the Akt signaling pathway by inhibiting PTEN expression. This Akt activation leads to further cholesterol ester accumulation within cancer cells.
Understanding these mechanisms provides important insights into potential therapeutic avenues. Targeting abnormal lipid metabolism may offer promising approaches for treating tumors. Researchers have identified various molecular targets within these pathways that could be exploited for therapeutic intervention.
This comprehensive review also highlights triglycerides and sphingolipids as critical players in tumor biology. Abnormalities in triglyceride metabolism have been linked to tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance. Sphingolipids play crucial roles as signaling molecules and are associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and inflammation—all processes involved in tumorigenesis. Alterations in sphingolipid metabolism can affect tumor microenvironments and impact disease progression.
In conclusion, this PubMed article provides a detailed exploration of abnormal lipid metabolism's role in tumor progression from the perspective of cholesterol, triglycerides, and sphingolipids pathways. Insights gained from studying abnormal lipid metabolism may open new doors for targeted therapies aimed at disrupting dysregulated lipid biology within cancer cells. Importantly, such interventions have the potential to provide novel treatment strategies for effectively combating different types of tumors.
 
The introduction of this PubMed article starts by highlighting the increasing prevalence of diabetes as a serious global public health issue. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) predicts that the number of diabetes mellitus patients worldwide will reach 783 million by 2045. In China, an epidemiological investigation found a 12.4% estimated prevalence of diabetes in 2018, with only 50.1% of treated diabetic patients being adequately controlled.
The introduction then emphasizes the significant impact that diabetes has on individuals and society. People living with diabetes are at risk of developing life-threatening complications, leading to increased need for medical care, reduced quality of life, and added stress on families. Poor management of diabetes and its complications can result in frequent hospital admissions and premature death.
Despite advancements in antidiabetic drugs, glycemic control remains far from perfect, with some drugs causing adverse events and increasing cardiovascular disease risk without effectively improving clinical symptoms.
This highlights the urgent need for new drugs that are effective with minimal side effects, favorable hypoglycemic effects, and potential symptom relief.
The introduction then mentions Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has been used to treat diabetes for thousands of years. TCM has made significant progress in modernization and globalization in recent years.
Jinlida granule is introduced as a Chinese patent medicine composed of various herbs. It was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) in 2005. It has been widely used in clinical practice.
Previous research conducted by the authors includes a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating Jinlida's efficacy and safety in T2D patients who received Jinlida or placebo alongside metformin treatment for 12 weeks. The results showed a more significant reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels among those receiving Jinlida compared to placebo.
Furthermore, meta-analysis and systematic reviews of Jinlida granules have shown significant reductions in fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), and HbA1c levels.
Animal experiments have also demonstrated that Jinlida granules can enhance the function of brown and beige adipocytes, improving glucose and lipid metabolism. They can also reduce insulin resistance in rats fed with high fat by regulating phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
However, previous studies on Jinlida focus primarily on its effect on blood glucose levels and their potential mechanisms while neglecting its role in improving clinical symptoms of T2D.
Hence, this current study aims to conduct a secondary analysis based on the previous randomized controlled trial to investigate the role of Jinlida in reaching standard target blood glucose levels as well as improving clinical symptoms. The goal is to bridge the gap between hypoglycemic agents and improvements in diabetic clinical symptoms. This PubMed article aims to investigate the role of Jinlida granules in reaching standard target blood glucose levels and improving clinical symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The authors recognize that previous studies have primarily focused on the effect of Jinlida on blood glucose levels and its potential mechanisms, largely ignoring its impact on improving clinical symptoms.
To address this gap, the study conducted a secondary analysis based on a previous randomized controlled trial. In this trial, a total of 192 subjects with T2D were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either Jinlida granules or placebo alongside metformin treatment for a duration of 12 weeks.
The results from the previous trial showed that glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was significantly reduced in the group receiving Jinlida granules compared to the placebo group. Additional meta-analyses and systematic reviews of Jinlida granules also demonstrated significant reductions in fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), and HbA1c levels.
Building upon these findings, the current study aims to delve deeper into understanding how Jinlida contributes to reaching standard target blood glucose levels while also examining its impact on improving clinical symptoms associated with T2D.
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used for thousands of years as an alternative approach to managing various health conditions, including diabetes. However, modernization and globalization have led to significant progress in incorporating TCM into conventional medicine practices. Jinlida granule is one such example; it is a Chinese patent medicine composed of 17 different Chinese herbs approved by CFDA for treating T2D since 2005.
In addition to analyzing its effects on glycemic control measures like HbA1c, FBG, and 2hPG as mentioned earlier, animal experiments have suggested that Jinlida granules could improve glucose and lipid metabolism by promoting the thermogenesis of brown and beige adipocytes. This effect is accomplished by enhancing mitochondrial function and inhibiting the expression of miR-27a. Jinlida granules have also exhibited the ability to reduce insulin resistance by regulating phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in rats fed with a high-fat diet.
Despite these promising findings, limited attention has been given to assessing Jinlida's impact on improving clinical symptoms associated with T2D. Clinical symptoms play a crucial role in overall quality of life for individuals living with diabetes. Therefore, this study aims to bridge that gap between hypoglycemic agents' effectiveness and improvements in diabetic clinical symptoms.
By conducting a secondary analysis based on their previous randomized controlled trial data, the authors hope to shed light on Jinlida's potential role in achieving standard target blood glucose levels while promoting better patient outcomes through relieving clinical symptoms.
Overall, this research contributes to addressing the urgent need for new antidiabetic drugs with minimal side effects, favorable hypoglycemic effects, and symptomatic relief for individuals living with T2D. By exploring Jinlida granules' potential benefits beyond blood glucose control measures, it provides valuable insights into leveraging Traditional Chinese Medicine approaches within mainstream diabetes management strategies. 
The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the significance of diabetes mellitus (DM) as a systemic metabolic disease characterized by high blood sugar levels. The author cites statistics from the International Diabetes Federation to emphasize the increasing prevalence of DM worldwide and its associated negative impacts on patients' health and economic burdens.
The introduction then provides an overview of the different types of DM, namely type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and secondary diabetes resulting from viral infections, cystic fibrosis, and pancreatic cancer. While the etiologies may differ among these types, there is a common understanding that abnormal communications between cells, tissues, and organs contribute to the progression of DM.
Next, the introduction introduces extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are lipid bilayer membrane vesicles secreted by various cells into extracellular space. The author notes that EVs are highly heterogeneous in their characteristics and contain biologically active molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. These features enable EVs to serve as carriers for transmitting signals among cells. In recent years, there has been significant interest in studying EVs due to their critical roles in mediating intercellular communication and involvement in physiological processes.
Furthermore, the introduction highlights several advantages of EVs for therapeutic applications. These include their abundance in sources, low immunogenicity, biocompatibility Continuing from the advantages of EVs, the introduction emphasizes their flexibility to be modified and their ability to cross biological barriers. These characteristics make EVs attractive for use in various disease treatments. The potential of EVs-based therapies has gained attention in recent years.
The introduction then delves into the importance of pancreatic islets in glucose homeostasis. Paul Langerhans' discovery of pancreatic islets and their hormone-producing cells (alpha, beta, delta, pp, and epsilon cells) is mentioned. Among these cell types, beta-cells play a crucial role in controlling blood glucose levels through insulin secretion.
The article highlights that abnormal crosstalk between pancreatic islets and extra-islet tissues mediated by EVs plays an important role in maintaining glucose homeostasis under physiological conditions. However, under pathological conditions like diabetes mellitus (DM), this crosstalk becomes disrupted and contributes to the occurrence and development of DM.
Under normal circumstances, pancreatic beta-cells secrete insulin to lower blood glucose levels by increasing glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Likewise, peripheral tissues can promote insulin secretion and growth of beta-cells through EVs-mediated crosstalk.
However, several mechanisms are discussed where this communication via EVs turns detrimental. In type 1 diabetes (T1DM), autoantigen-containing EVs derived from pancreatic islets target autoimmune cells causing severe autoimmune responses. Moreover, peripheral tissue-derived EVs exert negative impacts on pancreatic islets leading to dysfunction and death of these crucial cells seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Additionally, secondary diabetes resulting from other diseases can also arise due to EV-mediated crosstalk between pancreatic islets and other tissues.
The introduction further mentions that apart from their roles in intercellular communication within DM pathogenesis processes or complications thereof; researchers have also explored using EVs as biomarkers for detecting DM or as therapeutic agents for treatment strategies.
Lastly about the aims of the article, it is stated that this review intends to outline the current knowledge of EVs-mediated intercellular and interorgan crosstalk within pancreatic islets and its significance in regulating systemic metabolism. Furthermore, the authors hope to shed light on potential applications of EVs in diagnosing DM and exploring their therapeutic potential. The objective is to provide a new perspective, contribute to biomarker discovery, and aid in anti-diabetic drug development.
In conclusion, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of diabetes mellitus and highlights the increasing prevalence of DM worldwide. It introduces extracellular vesicles (EVs) as important mediators of intercellular communication within DM pathogenesis processes or complications thereof. The introduction also emphasizes their value as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and their therapeutic applications in treating various forms of diabetes. 
This introduction provides background information and sets the context for the research study. It begins by highlighting the increasing global incidence of heart failure (HF) and the high prevalence of HF among women. The authors reference a report from the American Heart Association projecting a rise in HF prevalence, emphasizing that HF causes significant morbidity and mortality among women, especially in older age groups.
The introduction then discusses how HF tends to manifest differently in women compared to men. Women are more likely to experience HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which occurs at an older age and is associated with more symptoms. Despite being less prone to coronary artery disease (CAD) before menopause, women report worse quality of life and higher risk for depression.
The next section focuses on guideline-directed medical therapy for HF, noting that it does not differ between men and women but pointing out that women are often underrepresented in clinical trials for HF treatment.
The introduction then introduces sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), explaining their mechanism of action as hypoglycemic agents that primarily decrease blood glucose levels by increasing urinary glucose excretion. The authors highlight that SGLT-2is have been shown to have additional effects on the cardiovascular system, leading to their approval as treatment for HF.
Key recommendations from recent guidelines regarding SGLT-2is use in patients with reduced ejection fraction are mentioned from both American and European societies. Potential mechanisms through which SGLT-2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular benefits are briefly described.
Following this, the authors describe sex differences in myocardial adaptation after a cardiac event, highlighting that HFpEF is more common in women who also tend to have more comorbidities compared to men with heart failure. They cite relevant studies showing disparities between male and female patients regarding hospitalization rates and outcomes associated with SGLT-2 inhibitor use.
Based on identifying this gap in knowledge about potential sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes among HF patients using SGLT-2is, the authors state their goal to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of SGLT-2is on primary composite outcomes stratified by sex.
The methods section briefly explains the search strategy and inclusion criteria for eligible studies. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to ensure transparency and rigor in study selection.
Finally, the authors mention that they used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for assessing study quality and detail their data extraction process. They specify statistical analysis techniques employed, such as inverse variance weighted averages, hazard ratios, odds ratios, heterogeneity assessment methods, and significance threshold.
Overall, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the global burden of heart failure with an emphasis on gender disparities. It introduces SGLT-2 inhibitors as a potential treatment option for HF patients and highlights gaps in knowledge regarding sex-specific effects. The introduction of this PubMed article continues by discussing the primary outcome of interest for the study, which is a composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent visit for heart failure. This outcome is important because it reflects the overall impact and severity of HF on patients' health and well-being.
The authors then provide details about the methods used in their study. They conducted a comprehensive search and review of three major databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane) from 2017 to 2022 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated SGLT-2 inhibitors for HF outcomes. Only dedicated cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT-2is and subgroup analyses based on sex were included in the analyses.
To evaluate the quality of included studies, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used. This tool assesses several domains such as random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding procedures, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. Three authors independently extracted data using a standardized form to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Statistical analysis was performed using Cochrane Review Manager software (RevMan version 5.4). The researchers calculated inverse variance weighted averages of logarithmic hazard ratios using a random effects model to determine study weight. Pooled hazard ratios stratified by sex were calculated based on intention-to-treat analysis. The odds ratio was also computed between pooled hazard ratios to compare primary composite outcomes between sexes.
Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using both I^2 statistics and Cochrane Q statistics. A low level (<25%) indicates little heterogeneity among studies while higher levels indicate increasing heterogeneity.
The introduction concludes by mentioning that all reported p-values below 0.05 are considered statistically significant in this analysis.
By providing an overview of their methodology with specific emphasis on study selection criteria, quality assessment tools used, data extraction process details, and statistical analysis methods, the authors ensure transparency and reproducibility in their study.
In summary, the introduction of this PubMed article establishes the background and significance of heart failure as a global health problem, particularly among women. It introduces SGLT-2 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic option for HF patients and highlights the need to investigate potential sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes associated with SGLT-2 inhibitor use. The section also outlines the specific research objectives, search strategy employed, study inclusion criteria, quality assessment procedures used, data extraction process details, and statistical analysis methods. This thorough explanation sets up the subsequent sections of the article that present the findings from their systematic review and meta-analysis.
