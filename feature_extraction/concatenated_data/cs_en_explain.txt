This news article discusses several key developments in China's political and economic landscape. The main focus is on the expansion of the National People's Congress (NPC) standing committee from seven to nine members. The article suggests that this new leadership team will need to practice consensus building amongst themselves.
Julien Lippmann, an analyst from Credit Suisse Equity Research, comments on this expansion and states that it signifies a shift in power within the party. He also mentions Jiang Zemin's "Three Representations" theory being enshrined in party doctrine. According to this theory, besides representing peasants and the working class, the party now aims to represent "advanced production forces" and "advanced culture", as well as the majority of the population.
The article emphasizes that these changes are aimed at strengthening the Communist Party's power base among different segments of society. It highlights how even managers at state-owned enterprises now have a chance to join the party and have a say in party politics.
However, while improvements are being made economically, there is still work to be done in terms of civil rights. The Chinese government has revised patent, copyright, and trademark laws but needs further progress regarding civil liberties. Julien Lippmann notes that Chinese citizens can now acquire land rights instead of only being able to buy property or rent land for limited periods.
The economic situation is said to have improved significantly as well. China has joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), and both NPC and its standing committee have revised relevant laws concerning intellectual property rights. Julien Lippmann mentions these improvements play a significant role in protecting private property under law.
Despite these economic reforms shifting China towards a market economy model, political reforms have not been implemented at an equal pace. The current priority for the government is ensuring social stability while grappling with unemployment issues caused by heavily indebted state-owned enterprises.
Another notable development mentioned in the article is China opening up its A-share market for selected institutions to invest in yuan. Previously, only Chinese investors were able to invest in A-shares, while foreign investors could only access less liquid B-shares or options listed on the Hong Kong exchange. The opening up of this market is an attempt by authorities to attract more foreign direct investment and stimulate local stock markets.
Credit Suisse analysts do not expect an immediate rush of foreign interest due to potential repatriation difficulties and high valuations for A-shares. They suggest focusing on more favorably priced H-shares and red chips, which are stocks traded on the Hong Kong exchange.
In conclusion, China's political landscape is evolving with the expansion of its leadership team and a shift in party doctrine. Economic reforms have improved the country's standing globally, but there are still challenges regarding civil rights and unemployment. The opening up of China's A-share market may attract more foreign investment but is expected to be a gradual process. Political reforms remain uncertain, with further details needed before Credit Suisse adjusts their marketing rating for China. 
This news article is an interview with someone who has experienced doing business in Bulgaria. They discuss their experiences with the business environment, highlighting some of the challenges and opportunities they have encountered.
The interviewee starts by talking about their initial partners, mentioning that they were almost forced out of the business without any compensation. They also mention that institutional sloppiness and arbitrariness nearly drove them to bankruptcy. This suggests that there have been issues with how business operations are conducted in Bulgaria.
Despite these challenges, the interviewee mentions that things have recently changed for the better due to ongoing reform processes. There is a general consensus among the people about the need for reforms in administration and justice systems. While organized crime and corruption still exist as problems, they are said to be in retreat.
The interviewee highlights some positive developments as well. For instance, they mention increasing production from 2,000 bikes annually to 300,000 bikes. Additionally, they state being involved in real estate ventures at present.
When asked about comparing Bulgaria's regulatory situation with Switzerland's (where they presumably conducted business before), the interviewee expresses being offput by Switzerland's regulations and wages paid to employees. They find it easier to solve problems faced in Bulgaria despite their different nature.
The importance of ensuring consistently high quality is emphasized by acknowledging daily battles in maintaining quality awareness and dependable employees—a trait not considered as good as Switzerland's standard according to them.
Bulgaria is described as less highly regulated than Switzerland but extremely bureaucratic nonetheless—requiring many documents certified by a notary. Although things take longer to happen compared to Switzerland, it is stated that many possibilities exist within Bulgaria despite its time-consuming nature.
While reflecting positively on their experiences overall—acknowledging success both in bicycle manufacturing and real estate dealings—the interviewee also mentions how draining these seven years have been due to unforeseen challenges cropping up regularly.
They believe it will take two or three generations for Bulgaria to completely shed its communist past and associated idiosyncrasies. It is emphasized that Bulgarians need to adopt a mindset of lasting development, understanding the importance of reliability, and being conscious of quality. The focus should be on persistent reform processes, not just short-term success.
Despite the challenges, the interviewee expresses confidence in Bulgaria's potential for success. They mention expanding into the real estate sector continuously and even considering moving into other countries like Georgia or Ukraine.
In summary, this news article presents an interview with an individual who has been conducting business in Bulgaria. They discuss both the challenges and opportunities they have encountered while highlighting changes taking place due to ongoing reform processes. The interviewee reflects on their experiences in comparison to another country and emphasizes the importance of long-lasting development and reform mentality among Bulgarians for future success. The interviewee continues by emphasizing that doing business in Bulgaria comes at a high price in terms of the daily struggles faced. They mention that despite this, they are continuously expanding their ventures in the real estate sector, indicating that there are still opportunities for growth and profitability.
Furthermore, they reveal an interest in exploring the possibility of expanding into other countries like Georgia or Ukraine. This suggests their willingness to explore new markets and take advantage of potential benefits outside of Bulgaria.
When asked about their overall perspective on Bulgaria's future, the interviewee remains optimistic. They believe that it will take time—possibly two or three generations—for Bulgaria to fully overcome its communist past with its inherent idiosyncrasies. They emphasize the need for Bulgarians to embrace lasting development rather than pursuing short-term, overnight success. 
The interviewee notes the importance of reform processes not only within administrative systems but also within people's minds. They emphasize qualities such as reliability and consciousness of quality as crucial factors for sustainable growth.
Despite acknowledging some downsides and challenges faced during their business ventures in Bulgaria, such as institutional sloppiness and corruption issues, they express confidence in both the country's potential and its people's ability to succeed moving forward.
The article concludes with a lighthearted comment from  
This news article discusses the current state of the retail sector in Switzerland, focusing on sales trends and the impact of e-commerce. The article states that sales in some areas have declined, with clothing and footwear retailers being particularly affected. However, it also highlights that shopping tourism has stabilized at a high level and continues to impact the industry.
The article mentions that although cross-border brick-and-mortar shopping has slightly decreased compared to 2015, e-commerce has continued to experience strong growth momentum. It is estimated that one in every ten Swiss francs is likely spent abroad in 2016. The retail sector as a whole is expected to stabilize in 2017 after several years of weakness due to limited growth prospects from the general economy.
However, consumer sentiment is projected to recover very gradually given stagnant unemployment rates. Inflation is also expected to make a comeback in Switzerland this year, which means consumer spending power may not increase significantly despite nominal salary increases.
The article suggests that offline shopping by Swiss residents abroad will either remain stable or decrease slightly depending on whether there are further significant currency fluctuations between the Swiss franc and euro. However, real demand is expected to increase slightly primarily due to population growth.
Retail prices are anticipated to decrease again this year following previous years' trends. As a result of these challenging conditions for non-food retailers, expansion plans for 2017 are more defensive compared with previous years but food retailers have more aggressive plans.
The non-food segment is likely to face declining sales again this year but at a slower rate than observed in 2016 while food retail sales are projected to grow slightly. The rise of e-commerce plays a significant role in the challenges faced by brick-and-mortar non-food retailers.
The article highlights Credit Suisse's forecast that e-commerce will nearly double its share of retail sales over the next five years and become increasingly prominent in segments such as clothing and home electronics (27% and 38% respectively).
The study also examines the regional supply density of brick-and-mortar retailing in Switzerland. It notes that main cities and urban areas have an above-average supply density, while rural areas have a below-average density. The article points out that between 2011 and 2013, the relationship between supply (measured in full-time equivalents) and demand declined in many regions. Retail employment declined in major city centers but expanded in some outer districts, with rental costs for retail properties being a significant factor behind this trend.
A regional analysis shows that shopping tourism had a significant impact on retailers in municipalities bordering Germany and France, causing a reduction in full-time equivalents compared to 2011. The Basel region was particularly affected by the rise of shopping tourism following the appreciation of the Swiss franc.
In conclusion, this news article provides an overview of the current challenges faced by the retail sector in Switzerland. It highlights declining sales, particularly among clothing and footwear retailers, as well as the growing influence of e-commerce on brick-and-mortar stores. The article also mentions various factors affecting regional supply density trends and employment patterns within different areas of Switzerland's retail sector. 
This news article features an interview with Jakob Kuhn, a former coach for the Swiss Under-21 team and the Swiss national football team. Kuhn discusses various aspects of his coaching career, including media coverage, public recognition, the World Cup experience, his coaching philosophy, upcoming matches, player selection for EURO 2008, and performance assessments.
Kuhn begins by reflecting on how the media paid little attention to the Swiss Under-21 team initially. However, he believed that if they performed well and gained recognition through their efforts on the field, people would start taking notice. He credits not only the players and coaches but also the support from organizations like the Swiss Football Association and sponsor Credit Suisse for contributing to football's popularity in Switzerland.
When asked about receiving awards or recognition in his career as a coach, Kuhn states that it is pleasing to be recognized by peers but believes all awards hold equal value. He respects the choices of the Swiss public who voted for him and acknowledges that they have knowledge about football comparable to any other nation.
Kuhn recalls one memorable moment during his coaching career when thousands of fans gathered to cheer on Switzerland before a World Cup match against Togo. He describes it as an incredible experience that gave them a huge boost.
Regarding changes in football over time with increased media coverage of major events like the World Cup, Kuhn says he sees this as a positive development rather than a negative one. The widespread attention helps athletes realize what it truly means to participate at such high levels.
In terms of his personal journey as a coach after retiring from playing in 1977, Kuhn explains that while he pursued coaching quickly after retirement and worked with young players throughout his career in Zurich and later with the Swiss Football Association since 1996. His primary focus has always been working with young talent rather than aiming for ambitious goals like winning championships or titles.
Speaking about assessing players' potential before selecting them for matches, Kuhn emphasizes the importance of expecting a strong performance from the team as a whole. He mentions that in 2006, during his tenure, each player had the desire to give their best on the field consistently.
In preparation for EURO 2008, Kuhn requested the Swiss Football Association to organize international matches against high-quality opponents and is pleased with their fulfillment of this request. While results ultimately matter, he believes in attracting spectators with attractive football rather than resorting to defensive tactics.
Kuhn discusses how preparation for major tournaments like EURO 2008 involves meeting frequently with players. In addition to his role, other medical and training staff are necessary to monitor and improve players' performances. Though they rely on tests conducted by individual clubs, they conduct assessments every few months to address any remaining areas of improvement before EURO 2008.
When asked about finalizing the squad for EURO 2008, Kuhn explains that until selection day arrives, there is always a possibility for new talents to emerge or unforeseen circumstances like injuries. He mentions specific players like Pirmin Schwegler and Julian Esteban as potential candidates.
In conclusion, this article presents insights from Jakob Kuhn's coaching career perspective on media attention, public recognition, World Cup experiences, coaching philosophy principles involving attractive football tactics rather than defensive ones in upcoming games leading up until EURO 2008 selections are finalized while remaining open towards new talent possibilities.
 
This news article discusses Bulgaria's economic progress and the challenges it still faces. It begins by acknowledging that while mistakes were made, the country has achieved some impressive successes in recent years. Simeon Sakskoburggotski, Bulgaria's former king and prime minister, praised the reforms initiated over the past five years for contributing to a relatively stable economic climate.
The article highlights some noteworthy achievements, such as consistent annual GDP growth of more than 5% since 2001 (reaching 6.2% and 6.1% in 2005 and 2006 respectively). Additionally, inflation has significantly decreased from a record high of 2,000% in early1997 to approximately 4%, while unemployment has dropped from nearly 20% in 2000 to below 10%.
Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski expresses optimism regarding the success of these economic reforms and emphasizes their recognition by all political parties as crucial for maintaining long-term stability regardless of who is in power next.
However, despite these accomplishments on an economic front, it would be inaccurate to compare Bulgaria's current position with countries like Poland, Estonia, or the Czech Republic. The nation continues to grapple with issues related to an inadequate judicial system, burdensome administration processes, and corruption scandals that persistently make headlines.
The low GDP per capita ($3,480 USD) in comparison to other countries included in the latest accession round further demonstrates that there is room for improvement socioeconomically. Minister Oresharski admits that challenges remain: highly qualified labor shortages pose a threat to economic progress; however steps have been taken against corruption and administrative reform but more work needs to be done.
Bulgaria is described as a land of contrasts or shades of gray due to various experiences faced by investors like André Felder from Switzerland who runs a bicycle factory with considerable output here. Felder shares stories about deceitful business partners and institutionally driven quasi-bankruptcies. Despite these challenges, he believes that Bulgaria's situation has improved significantly in recent years and that it is a safe territory for his real estate investments.
This positive change has led to increased speculative activity among potential investors who are attracted by the country's solid currency, falling interest rates, relatively stable political situation, and rising stock prices. The article suggests that EU membership will continue to stimulate growth in Bulgaria. Foreign investors' interest is expected to grow alongside the flourishing of domestic industries due to outsourced labor-intensive manufacturing processes. Moreover, improvements to infrastructure are anticipated through EU structural and cohesion funds.
The article concludes by acknowledging the jubilation expressed by Bulgarians on New Year's Eve regarding their country's future but cautions against being overly optimistic. Minister Oresharski acknowledges the population's eagerness for benefits stemming from EU membership but emphasizes the need for sustainable development. While progress has been made and promising signs exist, it is essential to ensure a solid foundation for continued growth.
Overall, this news article sheds light on Bulgaria's economic achievements while also providing an honest account of the challenges faced by the nation such as corruption scandals and administrative inefficiencies. It highlights both optimism about future prospects stimulated by EU membership as well as caution in maintaining sustainable development practices moving forward. 
This news article discusses the importance and role of financial markets in allocating global resources efficiently. It highlights how financial markets make money available to those who need it through investments, creating value and allowing everyone to profit.
The article acknowledges that while trillions of dollars were created in the financial markets, there have been instances where certain areas, particularly the stock market and technology sector, experienced a burst of the tech bubble leading to a destruction of value. However, diversification across different asset classes can help mitigate such effects.
The central theme explored is asset management and how expertise and experience play essential roles in generating and maintaining value in financial markets. The author stresses the need for comprehensive solutions that not only generate returns for clients but also manage their risks.
Different investment styles are discussed in terms of total return orientation versus returns based on equity and bond markets. Total return investors aim for positive returns every year while sacrificing some longer-term return potential. On the other hand, investors focused on market returns are willing to endure negative years but have a longer time horizon to capture risk premiums offered by financial markets.
The article emphasizes that it is crucial for investors to decide on an investment plan or style and stick with it rather than constantly switching strategies based on short-term performance fluctuations. Switching strategies often leads to dropping performance levels and increased transaction costs.
The concept of risk is explored as being subjective; different individuals perceive risk differently. Portfolio fluctuation is identified as one form of risk along with the probability of falling short of desired long-term returns. The article notes that equities tend to be riskier than investment-grade bonds; however, diversification across various assets, regions, countries, styles, and issuers can help mitigate some risks.
While systematic risk cannot be eliminated entirely from portfolios through diversification alone, accepting higher levels of remaining risk may potentially result in higher long-term returns.
The importance of having a structured investment process is highlighted by the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) mentioned in the article. A structured investment process serves as a check on the work of investment professionals and allows for the consideration of various factors that determine the value of different asset classes.
The CIO takes responsibility for asset allocation in discretionary mandates, determining how much to invest in bonds, equities, cash, or alternative investments. They also decide on allocation within different sub-asset classes such as credits, hedge funds, or private equity.
The Investment team continuously monitors markets and factors influencing them—including valuations, economic indicators, quantitative models output—and incorporates these results into their investment process. The decisions are then discussed within a committee comprised of senior management at Credit Suisse along with other bank strategists before being implemented into mandate portfolios.
The article concludes by highlighting that while mistakes can be made in the profession of asset management like any other field; having a structured and comprehensive approach helps reduce potential errors. The author emphasizes the importance of teamwork and constant monitoring to make informed decisions aligned with clients’ goals.
Overall, this news article provides insights into various aspects related to financial markets’ role in allocating resources efficiently and highlights key considerations for successful asset management. 
This news article discusses the current state and future prospects of Africa, as well as its relationship with Europe and China.
The article begins by acknowledging that Africa has long been neglected but is now experiencing significant growth. However, in order to overcome its problems, it requires support. The article mentions prominent African figures such as Nelson Mandela and Kofi Annan who have made a positive impact, along with President Mubarak of Egypt who has been an international figure for many years.
The European approach towards Africa varies among countries but is generally disappointing. Some European countries are actively involved in providing aid, conflict prevention, and addressing issues like drug exports and counter-terrorism. Trade still exists between former colonial partners; however, there are difficulties stemming from old resentments from the colonial era. These resentments are diminishing over time.
The author believes there should be greater symbiosis between Africa and Europe. Europe represents a significant market for African raw materials and products while Africa presents a long-term investment opportunity for European capital.
China's presence in Africa is also highlighted. China is actively involved in various parts of the continent, especially countries like Sudan or Angola where they have substantial contracts for buying oil. Additionally, China invests in infrastructure projects tied to aid using Chinese partners and contractors which improves African infrastructure significantly. Their interest extends beyond oil to minerals, forests in Congo, and arable products in other countries.
Economically speaking, African growth currently averages at around 6 percent with Angola being the fastest growing country globally presently. There is potential for Africa to narrow the gap on growth with mature Western countries due to continued demand for its commodities like food, oil, and natural resources; however reaching parity will take time compared to much of the rest of the world.
To achieve sustained growth and improved quality of life for Africans entails addressing key challenges such as political stability (eliminating corruption), AIDS healthcare provision ,and mitigating climate change impact on food production which has the potential for adversity. The article emphasizes that political stability is crucial for sustained growth and development.
The diversity of Africa's strengths is highlighted, including an abundance of oil, minerals, arable products, and human resources. However, these strengths vary between countries.
Addressing ancient feuds and political instability are cited as the biggest dangers facing Africa. The elimination of corruption in several countries will be critical in ensuring wealth is effectively utilized to underpin prosperity.
Sport plays a role in bringing people together in Africa as well. Africans have a great affinity for sports evident by achievements like South African cricket, remarkable athletes from Kenya and Ethiopia, and success in soccer seen through the African Nations Cup where many stars also excel in professional leagues like the English Premier League.
The author expresses a desire to attend the FIFA World Cup scheduled to be held in South Africa in 2010 but cannot confirm plans yet. Nevertheless, they are certain about visiting various African countries before then due to personal enjoyment derived from such trips.
Overall, the news article highlights Africa's growing significance economically but underscores the need for addressing fundamental problems such as political stability and healthcare provision while emphasizing opportunities for closer partnerships with Europe and acknowledging China's influential role on the continent. 
This news article discusses various aspects of Russia's economic growth and potential challenges. It highlights the recent nomination of Alexander Konovalov as the new Minister of Justice, succeeding Vladimir Ustinov, indicating a potential change in emphasis in certain key positions. The article argues that Russia's growth rate can remain strong if necessary structural reforms are implemented, particularly modernizing the country's judiciary and bureaucracy. Tackling widespread corruption is also deemed essential.
The article suggests that while Russia has vast reserves of natural resources like oil and gas, allowing for continued growth even without structural reforms, it would be at a slower pace. It emphasizes the need for diversification in the economy to sustain a broader growth base beyond relying solely on its energy supply.
The wealth distribution in Russia is highlighted as an area where improvements could be made. While acknowledging that the broad population has benefited from economic growth over the past decade, it argues for a fairer distribution of wealth.
Commodity prices are discussed with reference to their impact on Russian economic development. The article notes that commodity prices have declined relative to their value over the past century but have rapidly risen over the last seven years, particularly energy prices serving as a major lever. This highlights both opportunities and challenges for Russia due to its significant energy assets.
In terms of Russia's financial sector, there has been an inflow of assets into banks and an increase in investment sophistication among middle-class clients. However, high-net-worth individuals in Russia tend to be closely connected with their businesses compared to Western counterparts who often separate ownership from management.
The role of President Medvedev is discussed regarding his ability to decide which ministers he wants to work with and his authority in implementing reforms. However, it remains uncertain how much he can achieve given significant capital influxes driven by oil and gas prices into the Russian economy - finding ways to absorb this money without causing inflation is seen as crucial.
The author believes that despite investors talking about business opportunities in India and China, Russia offers the highest return on investment. However, it is also pointed out that Russia's situation is distinct from other BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) economies due to its higher per capita income, smaller population size, and a different mentality influenced by its location in the north.
In conclusion, this article highlights the importance of structural reforms for Russia's sustained economic growth while acknowledging its natural resource reserves as a valuable asset. It discusses wealth distribution concerns and offers insights into the financial sector and investor sentiments. The role of President Medvedev in implementing reforms amid capital influxes poses challenges for future economic development. The article raises important questions about the political focus of Alexander Konovalov, the newly appointed Minister of Justice. It emphasizes that Russia cannot be directly compared to other BRIC economies like India and China due to its unique characteristics, including higher per capita income and a smaller population. These factors contribute to a different economic landscape and require tailored approaches for sustained growth.
The author acknowledges that Medvedev, as the Russian president, has considerable authority in selecting ministers. However, it remains to be seen how much he can achieve in the short and medium term considering the significant financial inflows driven by soaring oil and gas prices. Finding ways to implement structural reforms that encourage investments without causing inflation is a challenging prospect.
Furthermore, the article discusses the need for diversification in Russia's economy beyond its reliance on energy exports. While oil and gas resources have played a crucial role in driving economic growth, there is recognition of potential risks associated with this heavy dependence. A broader growth base would help mitigate these risks while ensuring long-term stability.
The wealth distribution issue is another key concern discussed in the article. While economic growth has positively impacted a broad section of society over the past decade, there are concerns about fairness and equity in wealth distribution throughout Russia. It suggests that efforts should be made towards more egalitarian wealth distribution policies.
The financial sector observations shed light on investment trends and clientele behavior within Russia. The influx of assets into banks indicates increasing confidence among investors while highlighting growing sophistication among middle-class clients who invest both domestically and abroad.
Interestingly, high-net-worth individuals in Russia are presented as being closely connected with their businesses compared to their Western counterparts who tend to separate ownership from management roles. This demonstrates unique characteristics within Russian business dynamics but also hints at potential challenges regarding governance structures and corporate transparency.
In terms of external investment perspectives on Russia's market opportunities, the author argues that although investors may discuss business prospects more often regarding India or China – due to their significant population sizes – in reality, the highest return on investment is found in Russia. This highlights the attractive investment climate within the country, despite its distinctiveness compared to other BRIC economies.
To summarize, this article delves into various aspects of Russia's economic growth and some hurdles it may face. It emphasizes the importance of implementing structural reforms, addressing wealth distribution concerns, and diversifying the economy beyond reliance on energy resources. The role of Alexander Konovalov as Minister of Justice is seen as potentially influential, whilst considering President Medvedev's political focus amid capital inflows poses challenges for future development. Overall, while underscoring Russia's unique characteristics compared to other emerging economies, it also recognizes opportunities for investors in a changing economic landscape. 
This news article discusses the potential growth and opportunities in the satellite internet industry. It highlights various initiatives and investments being made by companies in different countries to expand access to high-speed internet through satellite technology.
One of the key projects mentioned is the "Digital France 2012" initiative, which aims to provide internet access to every household in France by 2012, even in areas where cable connections are not available. Eutelset, Europe's second-largest satellite operator, plans to play a significant role in this project by offering its Tooway™ internet service.
Swisscom, a telecommunications company in Switzerland, also intends to offer satellite internet as a complement to its existing broadband solutions. This move will help them fulfill their obligation of providing basic services across the country, including mountainous regions.
Satellite service providers have traditionally focused on TV and video-on-demand offerings. However, with the increasing demand for high-quality transmission and the rise of payTV broadcasters globally, there is now an opportunity for these operators to expand into providing internet services as well.
Media companies, television broadcasters, and even telecom firms have been major buyers of transmission capacity from satellites. SES (Europe's biggest satellite operator) has successfully offered its IP-Prime product to US telecom firms since July last year. Europe's duopoly of satellite operators - Eutelsat and SES - have similar plans for Europe using their own products like KA-SAT and ASTRA2Connect. They estimate a potential market size of 15-30 million households that could be served more competitively with superior quality through satellite internet instead of traditional copper-wire networks.
While there are initial challenges such as higher equipment costs for customers interested in satellite-based internet services and niche markets due to specific needs like mobile telephony services requiring large bandwidths; there is still significant potential for growth.The use of satellites can provide cost-efficient opportunities for mobile telephony services by transmitting TV,internet, video and music content to mobile devices via terrestrial DVB-H or DVB-SH networks. This opens up possibilities for combining services with navigational and locational information (GPS) and enables the development of new and innovative services in this field.
The article suggests that satellite operators are likely to perform well despite economic downturns due to relatively stable long-term customer agreements for transmission services. It also mentions that demand outpaces supply, allowing for potential price increases.
Overall, the article emphasizes the growing interest in satellite internet services from various sectors such as telecommunications, media, and television companies. It highlights how satellite technology can help bridge the digital divide by providing internet access in areas without traditional cable infrastructure. The sector's defensive investment potential is also mentioned because of its relatively stable nature compared to other industries. Additionally, the article mentions that satellite operators are expected to benefit from a deteriorating economic environment due to their very long-term customer agreements. These agreements provide transparency in future income streams and offer stability even during uncertain times. Furthermore, the satellite industry is characterized by a lack of overcapacity, meaning that demand for satellite services far exceeds supply.
Although the industry requires significant capital investment and often carries high levels of debt, refinancing is secured over the long term. This provides reassurance for investors and allows companies in this sector to pass on price increases when necessary.
However, despite these positive prospects outlined in the article, it suggests that the market may not fully recognize these opportunities yet. The potential for growth in satellite internet services has not been fully acknowledged by investors or consumers.
The article concludes by highlighting that investing in satellite operators within this relatively defensive sector could be a wise choice. With technology advancements driving demand for high-quality transmission and access to high-speed internet across various industries, there is significant room for growth and profitability.
In summary, this news article discusses various initiatives and investments being made in the field of satellite internet services. It highlights projects such as "Digital France 2012" aiming to provide universal internet access in France and Swisscom's plan to offer satellite-based broadband solutions as a complement to its existing offerings. The article also emphasizes how traditional television broadcasters are expanding into offering additional online content through satellite technology.
Furthermore, it notes that mobile telephony services can benefit substantially from utilizing satellites as they enable cost-efficient transmission of television channels along with other multimedia content directly to mobile devices without requiring expensive bandwidths through traditional networks.
The growth potential of offering internet services via satellites is recognized but still considered niche due to initial equipment costs and specific market demands like mobile telephony needs. However, it underlines that investing in this sector can be attractive due to its stable nature compared with other industries during difficult economic conditions.
Overall, as advances in technology continue to drive demand for high-speed internet access and superior transmission quality across various sectors, satellite operators are positioned to play a significant role in meeting these needs and capitalizing on the market potential. 
The news article discusses the recent World Future Energy Summit held in Abu Dhabi, where representatives from various companies, including Siemens, ABB, Applied Materials, and Oerlikon, gathered to discuss the future of renewable energy and environmental technology. The event also saw the participation of prominent politicians such as EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs and Australian Governor-General Quentin Bryce.
The conference was notable for being held in Masdar City – an ecocity located in Abu Dhabi. Masdar City is known for being the world's first carbon-dioxide-neutral city with zero waste generation and self-sufficiency in energy production. The city aims to accommodate 50,000 residents and up to 90,000 workers. The emirate of Abu Dhabi has planned to invest $15 billion into this project with an additional $7 billion raised from private investors.
Despite the decline in oil prices and resulting economic challenges faced by the oil-rich emirate, Abu Dhabi remains committed to its plans for Masdar City. Sultan Al Jaber, CEO of the Masdar operating company reassures that when they decided to build Masdar back in 2006 with oil prices at $44 a barrel (similarly low as today), they were undeterred.
Abu Dhabi also intends to position itself as a global center for renewable energy sources by increasing its proportion of renewable energy from virtually zero to 7% by 2020. The emirate aims to forge partnerships with various companies and governments worldwide. During the conference, agreements were made between Masdar and General Electric as well as Swiss Federal Councilor Moritz Leuenberger for establishing centers representing their respective countries' interests within Masdar City.
Masdar's international collaboration extends beyond businesses; it also includes governmental institutions such as embassies. The Swiss Embassy plans on relocating from Abu Dhabi to become the first foreign embassy within Masdar City due to strong Swiss involvement since its early stages of development.
Moreover, global financial institutions like Credit Suisse are managing funds dedicated to green investments. Credit Suisse manages the Masdar Cleantech Private Equity Fund worth $250 million, strategically investing in green economy companies.
Masdar City's influence extends further with it forging alliances with German energy group E.on to build major renewable energy installations. The first collaborative project is the London Array wind farm off the coast of England. On another front, Masdar reached an agreement with the Basque regional government to establish a joint venture for manufacturing components needed in concentrated solar energy production.
Apart from economic collaborations, Abu Dhabi also aims for political recognition in the alternative energy sector. It aspires to make Masdar City the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IREA), potentially relocating IREA from Bonn, Germany.
The article emphasizes that renewable energy has become a global business with significant growth potential. Countries such as the United States and European Union have set ambitious targets and plans to increase their share of renewable energy production. Additionally, wind power capacity has seen substantial growth globally and shows potential for further expansion.
In summary, this news article highlights Abu Dhabi's commitment to promoting renewable energy through investment and alliances at both national and international levels. Masdar City serves as a focal point for these efforts and aims to position itself as a leading hub for clean technology advancements while attracting significant interest from companies, governments, and financial institutions worldwide. 
This news article discusses the current state of the Brazilian economy and the measures taken by the government to counteract the impact of the global financial crisis.
The article starts by highlighting that timely government reactions, such as reducing reserve requirements and making credit lines directly available to corporations, have helped Brazil's economy rebound. The stability of the Brazilian financial system is emphasized, along with a strong domestic market and resilient labor market in the first half of this year.
It further states that Brazil's recovery is expected to benefit from improved conditions in developed countries from the third quarter of 2009 onwards. The article points out that Brazil has a relatively closed economy with a large home market. The government's countercyclical measures were successful in mitigating some effects of the financial crisis, although it still had some impact on Brazil.
The diversification of exports is identified as an important change in recent years. Not only has Brazil increased exports to China, but it has also seen growth in trade with other emerging markets in Latin America. As China now accounts for approximately 14 percent of Brazilian exports (up from 6 percent in 2005), it has become just as important as the United States.
The macroeconomic measures implemented by the government are considered largely correct. These include following a fiscal surplus policy and continuously reducing debt since 2003, granting autonomy to their central bank, and building up foreign currency reserves through floating exchange rates.
However, when discussing institutional reforms such as tax progression and labor regulations, there hasn't been much progress yet due to lack of consensus within Brazilian society. Nevertheless, these reforms are seen as crucial for long-term competitiveness.
In terms of infrastructure investments, while there are some delays due to the crisis's impact on funding availability, there remains a favorable outlook for Brazil's infrastructure sector over coming years. The real estate sector is already experiencing strong growth thanks to lower interest rates; agriculture; biotech; alternative energy sectors also hold promise.
The article praises the solidity of the Brazilian banking system, stating that domestic banks have remained well-capitalized and did not face significant liquidity issues. Only small and medium-sized banks, which are more dependent on wholesale and cross-border financing, have been impacted. Credit Suisse is also mentioned as having maintained a strong position throughout the crisis by taking risk reduction measures and diversifying their earnings base.
In conclusion, the article suggests that Brazil's prospects for growth are positive, with opportunities for companies like Credit Suisse to thrive in this environment. It states that Brazil has never been better positioned economically and aims to become one of the best and most admired banks globally. The article further discusses the Brazilian economy's potential for growth and highlights specific sectors that are expected to thrive. One of these sectors is the real estate industry, which has already witnessed significant growth due to lower interest rates. This suggests that there is still plenty of potential for further expansion in this sector.
Additionally, the article mentions agriculture as another promising area of opportunity. Brazil has a thriving agricultural industry and is a major player in global agricultural markets. The country's fertile land, ample water resources, and favorable climate make it well-suited for agricultural production. Furthermore, advancements in biotechnology and alternative energy have opened up new avenues for the agriculture sector to explore.
The renewable energy program involving ethanol as a substitute for oil distillate is highlighted as an example of Brazil's leadership in alternative energy initiatives. This program has gained international attention and showcases Brazil's commitment to sustainable practices.
Regarding the banking system, the article praises Brazil's financial institutions for their resilience during the global credit crisis. The strong capitalization and absence of material liquidity issues among domestic banks indicate that they have weathered the storm relatively well when compared to small-and-medium-sized banks with greater exposure to external financing sources.
Credit Suisse is specifically mentioned as having emerged from the crisis even stronger than before by implementing risk reduction measures and diversifying its earnings base. This success positions Credit Suisse favorably with private clients, corporations, and institutional clients looking at them as their preferred partner.
In conclusion, while there are some areas where reforms are lacking consensus or progress has been slow like tax progression or labor regulations reformations - overall prospects seem positive for Brazil's economic growth trajectory. The country benefits from sound macroeconomic policies implemented by its government including fiscal surplus management since 2003 along with granting autonomy to its central bank which allows building substantial foreign currency reserves through floating exchange rates without being exposed heavily on USD fluctuations.
Moreover, China emerges as a crucial trading partner alongside long-standing relations with the United States. The diversification of exports to different emerging markets has strengthened Brazil's economic position. Despite some delays in infrastructure investments due to the crisis, there remains a favorable outlook for sectors such as real estate, agriculture, biotech, and alternative energy.
Overall, the article paints an optimistic picture of Brazil's economic prospects and emphasizes the country's potential for further growth and resilience in the face of global economic challenges. 
This news article discusses the current situation of emerging markets and their resilience in the face of the global economic crisis. It highlights different regions and their specific challenges and opportunities.
The article begins by stating that many emerging markets are flirting with recession. Kasper Bartholdy, Credit Suisse's chief economist for emerging markets, emphasizes this point during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He states that 2009 will be a very tough year for emerging markets.
Latin America is mentioned as one region heavily affected by declining commodity prices. This decline has had a significant impact on the economies of countries in this region. On the other hand, emerging countries in Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) have suffered from a drop-off in international funding flows. Additionally, oil-producing nations in EMEA have been hit hard by plummeting oil prices. Africa as a whole has also felt the impact of falling commodity prices.
Asia is described as not being as dependent on international capital compared to other regions. Most Asian countries are commodity importers and therefore benefit from lower commodity prices. However, it is noted that Asia still suffers from decreased demand for its industrial and manufacturing products due to reduced global economic activity.
Despite these challenges, Bartholdy points out some positive aspects regarding emerging markets' ability to withstand the crisis. Many emerged into this situation with strong growth rates and fiscal balances while implementing prudent macroeconomic policies that enable them to access funding relatively easily from institutions such as International Monetary Fund (IMF). The stability of their currencies after initial depreciation against major currencies has allowed central banks in various emerging economies to cut interest rates to mitigate some pain caused by downturns.
Bartholdy mentions signs indicating that global economy may be reaching its bottom point such as stabilization of commodity prices over two months period or improvement in indicators like German consumer confidence index or Chinese purchasing managers index (PMI).
The article also includes insights from Najib Mikati, former Prime Minister of Lebanon, who emphasizes the positive growth expected in Lebanon for this year. He attributes this to the good collaboration between the central bank and the financial sector as well as trust-built cooperation. The stability of Lebanese central bank's foreign currency reserves has helped it maintain a secure financial sector.
Pavel Teplukhin, a pioneer in mutual investment funds and private banking industry in Russia, shares his perspective on how Russia's perceived safety as a haven was proven wrong due to its exposure to the US crisis. He mentions that Russian assets are currently undervalued, but proper revenue forecasts are difficult to estimate. Teplukhin also highlights China and Russia having potential foreign exchange reserves that amount to 30-40% of their GDPs, allowing them some capacity to run budget deficits if required. However, he cautions against risking recovery through this means and suggests controlling government expenses, keeping budgets under control with low interest rates while supporting local investment demand.
In conclusion, this news article sheds light on emerging markets' struggles amidst the global economic crisis while also highlighting their resilience due to strong economic fundamentals and prudent policies implemented prior to the crisis. It underscores specific challenges faced by different regions such as commodity price declines or reduced international funding flows but also identifies potential opportunities such as lower commodity prices for countries reliant on imports. 
This news article discusses the slowing population growth in Switzerland over the past few decades, accompanied by higher life expectancy and lower birth rates. The country is projected to have a population of 7.9 million by 2030, and it is unlikely that the majority of this population will be "truly" Swiss.
In the mid-1960s, the average Swiss woman had 2.68 children. However, with the introduction of contraceptive methods like the pill, this rate decreased to 1.5 children by the middle of the 1970s. Today, Swiss women have an average fertility rate of 1.3 children, which is projected to decline further to 1.2 children by 2030.
To maintain a steady population size, an average of 2.1 children per woman is required; however, this figure is very close to current fertility rates for non-Swiss women living in Switzerland.
The article also highlights that both men and women can expect longer life expectancies in Switzerland. The average life expectancy for men will increase from 76.7 years to 81.8 years by 2030 and for women from 82 time time-subject crowdsourced information mins banned from Wikipedia six-part video

This news article discusses the changing role of banks and the dollar in the wake of the global financial crisis. It highlights that US and European banks have suffered significant losses during the crisis, leading them to raise capital from governments and private investors. However, it suggests that there are still anticipated major losses for many banks in the future, which will impact their profits for at least a decade.
The article then explores two potential scenarios for US and European banks moving forward. The first scenario involves these banks taking on more risk and leveraging up to fund economic growth both domestically and internationally. The second scenario suggests that these banks may take a back seat, allowing local emerging market banks and direct investment flows through capital markets to take the lead. 
The article acknowledges that historically, US and European banks have recovered fairly quickly from credit slumps in past decades. However, it poses a question as to whether this recovery will be different this time around. Currently, there is political debate in America and Europe focused on ways to restrain leverage and risk-taking by banks.
The governments can enforce this restraint through three main routes: directing investments made into banking institutions; requiring bank breakups into smaller specialized units; or tightening regulations such as setting minimum liquidity standards or imposing overall minimum capital-to-loans ratios.
However, implementing these regulatory changes worldwide might prove challenging as different countries may adopt varying approaches. Consequently, there would be a significant difference in regulatory environments from one country to another.
Overall impact on individual banks and countries is likely to vary depending on their specific circumstances. Some large US and European investment banking operations are shifting their focus mainly towards domestic clients while adopting a more conservative approach to risk management. Others may continue with aggressive risk-taking within tighter regulations.
In terms of changes related to global banking competition over time, Asian-based domestic-focused financial institutions could potentially step up playing larger roles in intermediating global capital flows alongside other international players.
Turning attention toward currencies, particularly the dollar, the article notes that it currently plays a central role in several key aspects of the global currency system. It is widely used for international trade invoicing and settlement, heavily present in foreign exchange reserves held by sovereign states, serving as a monetary anchor to some currencies, and maintaining deep and liquid capital markets. Additionally, many international investors still value it when monitoring their investment portfolios.
However, investor confidence in the dollar's role has wavered due to the financial crisis originating from US markets and concerns regarding its debtor status. The article highlights that the dollar's central role stems from post-World War II arrangements made under Bretton Woods but suggests that circumstances have changed significantly since then.
The US has become a major debtor nation with implications for its credibility while other nations such as China and India show clear signs of rising geopolitical power over time. As a result, there is growing discussion around whether an alternative currency could emerge to challenge or supplement the dollar's current position.
In short, this news article highlights current challenges faced by banks in the US and Europe due  
This news article discusses the importance of infrastructure, processes, innovations, and human capital in the Swiss economy. It specifically focuses on the significance of two big banks for the Swiss economy.
According to the article, these two big banks contribute around 40% of the overall value generated by banks in Switzerland. They also pay approximately 40% of the tax contributions made by banks and employ over 40% of personnel in the Swiss banking sector. Additionally, they account for 40% of domestic banking transactions.
The Swiss banking sector is characterized by a dual structure consisting of institutions with a national focus and internationally oriented banks. The former primarily operate in deposits and loans business while the latter are mainly involved in global asset management and investment banking.
The big banks play an important role as global full-service banks that engage in both domestic and foreign transactions. However, their market share is larger for transactions involving foreign clients (82%) compared to domestic transactions (41%). These big banks are significant market participants when it comes to investing savings and pension capital within Switzerland.
As per data from 2007 mentioned in this article, these two institutions managed assets worth CHF 348 billion entrusted by domestic creditors. This accounts for a substantial share—45.3%—of the overall market and around 59.7% of fixed-term deposits.
Furthermore, these big banks hold an estimated CHF 220-250 billion worth securities safekeeping accounts related to occupational benefits, fixed pension plans, vested benefits accounts/assets for insured individuals, and fixed pension plan accounts/investments at year-end 2007.
By financing approximately 36% of loans to private households and around 42% corporate loans, these big banks are major providers within Switzerland's credit market. In terms of lending specifically to small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), which form cornerstones of Switzerland's economy; their market share stands at over roughly30%.
It is worth mentioning that unsecured loans are also awarded in Switzerland where no collateral is provided by the debtor. Approximately 25% of all loans granted in Switzerland fall within this category, with over half of them being awarded by the big banks.
Regarding real estate, these banks have a market share of 35% on the Swiss mortgage market, holding mortgage volumes worth CHF 236 billion. They also hold direct and indirect investments in Swiss properties through their respective pension funds.
Additionally, big banks are essential for providing trade finance services such as financing, risk minimization, and support for import-export activities to SMEs that rely on global commerce due to limited domestic markets.
Credit Suisse is specifically highlighted as the market leader in export financing within Switzerland and one of the largest providers internationally.
Asset management is regarded as a core competency and central pillar of Switzerland's banking sector stability. According to data from August 2008 issued by The Swiss National Bank (SNB), securities portfolios held in client safekeeping accounts at Swiss banks amounted to around CHF 4.8 billion. The big banks have the largest proportion of managed safekeeping account holdings based on commission revenues at year-end 2007.
Investment banking activities encompass both classic investment banking services (such as corporate financing and capital market emissions) as well as trading transactions involving securities, foreign exchange trading, commodities and banknote trading, and issuing/secondary market trading of structured products.
Companies active on the capital market rely heavily on investment banking services for obtaining investment resources, financing international activities and stock market flotation. The two big banks dominate this sector due to their specialist expertise, size advantages leading to economies of scale effect.It is noted that they hold significant shares - typically ranging from about 35% to up to around49%- across categories such as stock market flotation,bonds issued by Swiss borrowers , mergersand acquisitionsHandler:and foreign exchange/trading
The economic importance attached to these big banks is evaluated based on value creation, employment generation, tax receipts, and their influence on the Swiss balance of payments. In 2006, the banking sector in Switzerland generated substantial value.
In summary, this news article highlights the significance of two big banks for the Swiss economy in terms of their contribution to overall value generation, tax contributions, employment opportunities, and involvement in various sectors such as domestic and foreign transactions, investment management activities,and investment banking services. 
This news article is a personal account of a conductor named Lorin Maazel, who reflects on his journey as a musician and the meaning of fame. Maazel shares that he started his musical career as a child prodigy during World War II, playing various instruments and studying composing. However, in his late teens, he felt the need to explore other subjects such as literature, history, philosophy, and languages. He worked during the day playing violin in the Pittsburgh Symphony while attending night school at the University of Pittsburgh.
Maazel explains that his performances with renowned conductors during this time unknowingly shaped his future in music. These experiences convinced him that his path would continue to be in music just as it had been in childhood. He then talks about fame and how it is merely what others think or know about you beyond your close circle of family and friends. Whether known by 50 people or 50 million people, Maazel suggests that fame has no inherent value.
According to him, he experienced fame at a young age but found that people eventually lost interest in him as a young adult. This realization led him to understand the ephemeral nature of fame and how many great artists throughout history have been forgotten over time. Therefore, Maazel believes that obsessing over one's legacy or place in history is irrelevant for performers.
He emphasizes that performers should focus on communicating their knowledge of music with people at present moments rather than worrying about their future recognition. As an experienced conductor himself, he dismisses the opinions of critics who know nothing about music.
Maazel then discusses the personality traits necessary for success as a conductor: excellent memory and preferably perfect pitch; ability to perform publicly while believing in the audience; desire to open musical vistas for listeners; respect for composers; helping musicians find purpose and worthiness through their dedication to practicing; earning respect instead of imposing it; motivating musicians musically while incorporating individual expression into a larger structure.
In conclusion, Maazel believes that classical music, rooted in religiosity and compassion for the human experience, should be approached with sensitivity and understanding. He values the collaboration between conductor and musicians to create a harmonious blend of colors and phrasings that align with his guiding hand.
This article serves as an insight into the personal experiences, reflections, and insights of Lorin Maazel as a conductor. It provides an understanding of his musical journey, views on fame, and thoughts on what it takes to be a successful conductor. The article delves deeper into Lorin Maazel's perspective on the role of a conductor in a musical performance. He emphasizes the importance of meeting the musicians' expectations professionally to gain their respect. Rather than imposing his own viewpoint, Maazel seeks to incorporate their individuality into a larger structure, resulting in a diverse range of musical expressions that mesh well due to his guidance.
Maazel also mentions his belief that classical music should be approached with reverence for its origins and the composers who have shaped it. He sees himself as a facilitator, someone who helps musicians realize the purpose and value behind their years of practice and technical expertise.
Furthermore, he recognizes that each musician has their own way of making music and expressing themselves. In order to create cohesive performances, Maazel strives to incorporate personal musical views within an overarching structure while maintaining musical coherence and logic.
When there is disagreement between himself and an individual soloist regarding musical interpretation or viewpoint, he prefers quiet discussions to explain his reasons rather than imposing his own opinions. However, Maazel notes that more often than not, what first chair players bring to the table is of exceptional quality.
Concluding his reflection on conducting, Lorin Maazel considers classical music's roots in religiosity and compassion for humanity. He believes that performers should focus on communicating these aspects with audiences at each given moment rather than obsessing over future recognition or legacy.
The article provides valuable insights into Lorin Maazel's growth as a musician from prodigious child performer to esteemed conductor. It highlights his understanding of fame as transient but also questions society's perception towards fame by pointing out how great artists can be forgotten throughout history.
Moreover, it offers guidance on what makes a successful conductor - from technical aptitudes like memory and perfect pitch to having respect for composers while motivating musicians musically through incorporating their unique expressions into collective performances.
Overall, this news article serves not only as an account of one person's experiences but also as a thought-provoking reflection on the nature of fame, the purpose of performers, and the role of a conductor in creating memorable musical experiences. 
This news article discusses the impact of reduced consumer spending in the United States and the potential for emerging market growth to offset this decrease. The article highlights that if US consumption returns to its long-term average, there could be a reduction in spending of around $1.4 trillion per year. This cutback represents over 7% of US annual GDP and 1.6% of global GDP, which would need to be compensated for if global growth is to return to its trend level.
The article suggests that emerging markets may offer a solution to this problem. It states that for the first time, emerging economies now account for more than half of global GDP on a purchasing power parity basis. The International Monetary Fund predicts that these markets will grow at an average annual rate of 5.3% through 2014, significantly higher than the expected growth rate of advanced economies.
Furthermore, emerging economies often have lower debt levels and higher foreign exchange reserves compared to many advanced economies. With an estimated combined purchasing power of over $18 trillion and representing around 82% of the world's population, these markets offer significant potential for increased consumption-led growth.
The article notes that while many corporate strategies have focused on serving the emerging middle class with incomes between $3,000 and $20,000 per year, there is a large untapped market consisting of approximately four billion people living in relative poverty (earning less than $3,000 per year). This segment represents the base or bottom-of-the-pyramid (BoP) consumers who have been largely neglected by corporate strategists.
However, targeting BoP consumers comes with its own unique challenges. These citizens spend a significant portion (over 80%) of their income on essential items like food, clothing, and fuel with little left for discretionary spending. They also often lack access to reliable credit facilities, telecommunication services, electricity or clean water due to their rural locations.
Accessing BoP consumers is challenging due to their isolation and limited options. This isolation has led to the "poverty penalty" phenomenon, where poor people in isolated regions often pay a premium for basic goods and services compared to those living in more competitive markets.
Despite these challenges, some private companies have successfully engaged with the BoP market by adapting their strategies to meet the unique needs of these consumers. One example highlighted is the concept of single-use packaging, where companies provide small, affordable packages of products like detergent and shampoo that are suitable for the BoP market.
In conclusion, this news article emphasizes the importance of emerging markets as potential drivers of global growth, particularly with reduced consumer spending in advanced economies. While targeting BoP consumers can be challenging due to their specific circumstances and limited resources, companies that tailor their offerings to these markets can find success. The article further discusses the potential of the bottom-of-the-pyramid (BoP) market segment and its significance in the post-crisis world. With a population of four billion people, representing over 60% of the world's population, the BoP segment cannot be ignored due to its sheer size. Despite living in relative poverty, these individuals have a combined purchasing power estimated at $5 trillion.
Comparatively, this figure is comparable to the estimated $12.5 trillion purchasing power of wealthier emerging market segments with incomes between $3,000 and $20,000 per year. This indicates that companies should start paying more attention to this large consumer market if they wish to tap into growth opportunities in the post-crisis world.
However, engaging with BoP consumers comes with its own set of challenges. Firstly, these consumers spend most of their income on essential items like food and clothing. Therefore, they have little discretionary income left for other types of spending.
Additionally, most BoP consumers are located in rural areas and lack access to basic services such as credit facilities or telecommunication services. Some may not even have access to electricity or clean water. These challenging conditions make it difficult for companies to reach and serve these consumers effectively.
Moreover, due to their isolation from mainstream economic markets with limited competition for goods and services in their regions, BoP consumers often face higher prices known as the "poverty penalty." This means that they end up paying significantly more than wealthier individuals for similar products or services.
Despite these challenges associated with targeting BoP markets successfully, some private companies have managed to find success by adapting their strategies accordingly. These firms cater directly to BoP consumers by offering unique products or services tailored specifically towards their needs.
One notable example is single-use packaging where companies provide affordable packages containing small quantities of products such as detergent or shampoo that are suitable for consumption by individuals living within constrained budgets.
In conclusion, while reduced consumer spending in the United States poses challenges for global growth, emerging markets, particularly the bottom-of-the-pyramid segment, offer potential solutions. However, tapping into this market requires companies to address unique challenges such as the limited discretionary income of BoP consumers and their isolated locations with limited access to basic services. Nevertheless, success can be achieved by customizing products and services to meet the needs of these consumers effectively. 
This news article discusses the phenomenon of shopping and consumerism in China, with a particular focus on Shanghai. It highlights how shopping has become a popular leisure activity for people in China, especially on weekends. The article emphasizes that the idea of shopping alone is not common in Chinese culture, as material fortune is often seen as something to be shared with relatives and friends.
Despite having a relatively modest per capita income of around $6,600 a year, even individuals with lower incomes are willing to spend money on high-end products. The article mentions examples like taxi drivers who own expensive mobile phones. This suggests that indulging in luxury goods is not limited to any specific social strata.
Shanghai is portrayed as the epitome of China's consumer boom. It is described as leading the country's transition towards consumerism, while Beijing focuses more on conservative political lobbying and Guangzhou focuses on industrial production.
The article also notes that Shanghai has attracted global retail players who have expanded their presence in China from this city. Moreover, it mentions other notable features such as tall buildings, the stock exchange, ports, airports, a Formula One race circuit, and Expo 2010.
In Chinese culture, flaunting wealth is seen as chic rather than vulgar. The CEO Asia Pacific of Montblanc states that their clients are typically well-educated entrepreneurs or executives who value high-quality luxury goods. Chinese consumers conduct extensive research before making buying decisions by considering factors such as product origin and brand history.
The article highlights that an increasing number of Chinese can afford luxury items like watches and leather goods sold by brands like Montblanc. The wealthiest 10% of households have experienced significant growth in wealth over recent years and now account for over 35% of total household income.
As Chinese consumers become more affluent, they exert an influential impact on the global market for high-end consumer goods. Luxury brands have recognized this trend and are expanding their operations accordingly. For example, Montblanc plans to triple the size of its store in Shanghai's CITIC Square.
The article also mentions that even lower-income brackets in China are experiencing moderate growth in their financial situation. The rising income levels of different income groups are seen as a potential driver for future consumption growth. With the declining savings rate and the focus on the younger generation, known as "Little Emperors," who grew up as single children under China's one-child policy, brands see them as high-spending consumers with significant purchasing power.
Overall, this news article showcases the growing consumerism and shopping culture in China, particularly in Shanghai. It highlights how Chinese consumers are willing to spend on luxury goods regardless of their income level and how brands are targeting this market with larger stores and more competition among retailers. The article further explains that the growth in consumerism and shopping culture is fueled by various factors, such as increased wealth, rising income levels, and changing attitudes towards consumption. It notes that even the lower-income brackets in China have experienced moderate growth in their financial situations since 2005.
Additionally, the article mentions a decline in China's savings rate from 26% of income saved in 2004 to just 12% in 2009. This indicates a shift towards increased spending and consumption among Chinese consumers.
One significant factor contributing to the rise of consumerism is China's one-child policy introduced in 1980. As a result, most Chinese individuals under the age of 30 grew up as single children and received substantial attention from their families. These individuals are now being targeted by brands as high-spending consumers with considerable purchasing power.

This news article discusses the contrasting situation in India, particularly in terms of the wealth disparity between the rich and poor. According to a survey by Forbes magazine, the number of billionaires in India has increased from 24 to 50 within a year. The top five richest people globally include two Indians, Mukesh Ambani and Lakshmi Mittal.
However, despite this increase in wealth for some individuals, the World Bank estimates that over 40 percent of India's population is living below the poverty line. This means that they have an income of less than $1.25 per capita per day. Extensive poverty among rural populations has led thousands of people to migrate from rural areas to cities like Mumbai and New Delhi.
There is no up-to-date data on the exact number of people living in these cities due to continuous migration inflows and limited official census information since 2001. As a result, these cities are facing overcrowding issues with millions of inhabitants residing there.
The scarcity of infrastructure resources has become a significant problem due to this influx into major cities. Credit Suisse's seventh field trip had discussions about this issue with various government agencies estimating that around $500 billion investments will be required over the next few years for transportation, energy, gas, water supply projects, and more.
An expert highlighted during discussions that global growth has shifted towards China and India as economic centers. However, challenges related to infrastructure development often arise due to political or bureaucratic obstacles.
The need for employment opportunities leads road-building projects relying heavily on manual labor provided by women as well as men since it employs a substantial part of India's population.
One site visited during this trip was Moser Baer in Noida city near New Delhi which manufactures optical storage media such as CDs and DVDs along with photovoltaic solar cells since 2005. It also ventured into home entertainment products like headphones or DVD players under its own brand name aside from its optical computer mice division.
The group also visited Gurgaon, which is an industrial area near Delhi. This location is significant as it was where India's first modern passenger car, the Maruti 800, was produced in partnership with Suzuki. Today, Maruti is majority-owned by Suzuki and accounts for the largest share of cars manufactured in India. The company believes that India will become even more crucial for their production with plans for their first R&D operation outside Japan.
Overall, this article highlights the conflicting situation in India regarding wealth distribution, with a growing number of billionaires alongside a significant portion of the population living in poverty. It also touches on the challenges faced by major cities due to rapid urbanization and insufficient infrastructure resources. The article also sheds light on the reasons behind India's attractiveness as a manufacturing destination compared to China. Representatives from Moser Baer and Maruti Suzuki, both major players in their respective industries, highlighted several advantages of doing business in India.
These advantages include a developing market and business environment, government support, higher education standards, and the widespread proficiency of the English language among the educated population. The ability to communicate effectively in English is seen as a significant advantage for international companies operating in India.
The article then shifts focus to a visit to Maruti Suzuki's production plant in Gurgaon. The plant is known for its efficient manufacturing line and high productivity rates. Maruti Suzuki holds the lion's share of the domestic car market in India and also exports a substantial number of vehicles internationally.
During discussions with Maruti Suzuki's CFO Ajay Seth, it becomes evident that India plays an increasingly critical role as a production base for parent company Suzuki. The establishment of research and development (R&D) operations outside of Japan demonstrates their commitment to tapping into India's booming domestic market quickly.
The author concludes with an observation on how these visits highlight both the challenges faced by infrastructure development in India due to political obstacles and bureaucratic hurdles, as well as the potential opportunities for economic growth through investments in various sectors such as transportation, energy supply, water supply, etc.
Overall, this news article provides insights into two contrasting aspects of India: its growing number of billionaires alongside widespread poverty among its population. It delves into important issues like urbanization challenges faced by major cities due to migration from rural areas and infrastructure deficiencies. Additionally highlighted are opportunities for investment-driven growth amid global recognition that China and India have become prominent centers of economic activity. 
This news article discusses the significance of different sources of energy throughout history, focusing on steam power, crude oil, and hydropower. It highlights various milestones and accidents related to these energy sources.
The article begins by emphasizing the importance of fire in the development of human civilization. The discovery and control of fire allowed humans to migrate to different parts of Earth and facilitated advancements such as metalworking and clay firing. It then traces the history of steam power, starting with Heron of Alexandria's description in 100 B.C. Scottish engineer James Watt later improved on existing designs and patented his version in 1769, which led to the widespread use of steam engines during the Industrial Revolution.
Moving on to crude oil, the article mentions Edwin Drake's successful extraction in 1859 as a significant turning point for industrialization. The invention of electric light bulbs initially lowered demand for oil, but with the advent of automobiles, it became highly sought-after once again. Today, more than one-third of global energy needs are met by oil.
While oil is practical for end-use purposes like heating or refueling vehicles, transportation can be problematic due to potential accidents involving tankers. The article cites two major incidents: one occurred in Europe in 1999 when an oil tanker called Erika broke apart off Brittany’s coast causing considerable pollution; another took place in April 2010 when Deepwater Horizon platform exploded leading to a massive environmental catastrophe in the Gulf region.
The Deepwater Horizon incident resulted in significant media coverage; however, large amounts of oil leak into various bodies around the world due to faulty drilling equipment or pipelines. The Niger delta is specifically highlighted as an area heavily affected by this issue with approximately two billion liters spilled over many years - comparable to Exxon Valdez tanker accident's pollution impact.
Lastly, hydropower is discussed as one of humanity's oldest used sources because ancient civilizations like Greeks and Romans employed water wheels for flour milling. Over time, hydropower played a crucial role in powering machinery in mines, workshops, and factories. The construction of the first hydroelectric power stations in 1880 further expanded the use of this renewable energy source.
While hydropower is considered clean and natural, the article acknowledges that expanding infrastructure to meet growing electricity demand leads to the creation of larger reservoirs and more productive power stations. It concludes by noting that approximately a quarter of global energy is generated through hydropower.
Overall, this article provides an overview of key milestones and accidents related to steam power, crude oil extraction and transportation, as well as the history and environmental considerations associated with hydropower. The article delves deeper into the challenges and consequences associated with different energy sources. It emphasizes how the demand for electricity leads to the construction of larger reservoirs and more powerful hydropower stations, highlighting the need to balance energy generation with environmental considerations.
Additionally, the article highlights that while steam power, crude oil, and hydropower have played significant roles in human civilization's development and progress, they also come with their own set of drawbacks. The accidents mentioned earlier illustrate the potential risks and environmental impact associated with oil spills or other catastrophic incidents.
Furthermore, it mentions that although oil is a practical source of energy at its final point of consumption, transporting it to end consumers poses challenges due to issues like tanker accidents. It emphasizes that even beyond these high-profile accidents, substantial amounts of oil leak into ecosystems around the world due to poorly maintained equipment or infrastructure.
The article points out that such leaks often go unnoticed or are not given as much attention as major accidents but collectively contribute to significant pollution. The ongoing situation in the Niger delta serves as an example where foreign multinationals extracting Nigerian oil over several decades have resulted in vast amounts of spilled oil comparable to major tanker disasters like Exxon Valdez.
By providing historical context and discussing current issues related to these various energy sources, the article prompts readers to consider multiple factors when evaluating their overall impact on society and environment. It highlights how advancements in technology have shaped our modern world but also reminds us of our responsibility towards sustainable energy practices moving forward.
In conclusion, this news article provides a comprehensive overview of major milestones related to steam power, crude oil extraction and transportation as well as hydropower development throughout history. It sheds light on both positive advancements facilitated by these sources while acknowledging their negative aspects such as environmental pollution or risks tied with accidents. By presenting a broad perspective on different energies' contributions and challenges they entail now anticipates readers' considerations for sustainable energy solutions moving forward.
 
The news article discusses the Lampo2, a prototype electric sports car developed by Protoscar SA in Rovio, Switzerland. The purpose of the vehicle is to showcase what can already be achieved in terms of electric mobility and demonstrate that it is not just a niche solution but a viable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.
The Lampo2 is not intended for series production but serves as an impressive demonstration of what electric vehicles are capable of. As a prototype, it is suitable for everyday traffic and ready to drive. Its predecessor, the original Lampo, was unveiled at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show and received international acclaim. Over 12,000 kilometers of testing have been conducted on the vehicle since then.
According to Marco Piffaretti, Managing Director of Protoscar SA, they aim to prove that electric mobility is efficient and even more enjoyable than conventional cars. Additionally, they seek to highlight Swiss innovation by sourcing key components from local companies.
For instance, Brusa Elektronik AG in Sennwald supplied various components such as batteries, electric engines, chargers, and performance electronics. The inclusion of Swiss-made parts emphasizes their commitment to supporting local industries.
The Lampo2 has several notable features. It is a two-seater sports car weighing approximately 1.6 tons. Unlike its predecessor's rear-wheel drive system configuration,
the new model boasts four-wheel drive with one electric engine at each axle. This arrangement enables better torque distribution and enhances overall performance.
With its upgraded powertrain setup compared to its predecessor's generation (now offering 408 horsepower), the Lampo2 demonstrates impressive power output right from spin-off (around 4,500 rotations per minute). This characteristic reflects one advantage typical for electric vehicles - immediate torque delivery from standstill.
Despite having only one gear due to its all-electric nature,
the driving performance remains remarkable.
It can accelerate from 0-100 km/h in just five seconds and reaches a maximum speed of 200 km/h.
In terms of range, the Lampo2 can travel approximately 200 kilometers using two lithium-ion batteries with a combined power output of 16 kWh. Charging options for the vehicle are flexible and efficient. Four charging modes are available, providing versatility to suit different situations.
The first mode involves regular charging through a domestic socket, which takes around twelve hours for a full charge.
At public stations, double the current can be supplied,
halving the charging time compared to regular sockets.
Industrial connections enable triple the current flow,
resulting in an even faster charging experience.
Lastly, an external quick-charge system is available for urgent situations. In just ten minutes of charging, enough electricity is supplied to drive about one hundred kilometers. 
The world premiere of the Lampo2 will occur at e'mobile's stand in Geneva. The presentation will also include innovative approaches to charge systems that complement Protoscar's commitment to showcasing sustainable technologies.
Credit Suisse is sponsoring this project not only because they believe it is vital to invest in innovation but also due to their awareness of corporate responsibility towards supporting sustainable technologies.
In conclusion, the article highlights Protoscar SA's latest achievement - the Lampo2 electric sports car prototype - which serves as a strong statement about what electric vehicles are capable of achieving. It demonstrates that electric mobility is not just limited to niche purposes but offers efficiency and enjoyment as well.

With impressive power output and performance capabilities along with flexible charging options, Protoscar aims to change perceptions surrounding electric mobility technology and showcase its potential benefits on both individual and societal levels. 
This news article discusses the findings of the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report, which provides insights into global household wealth and its distribution. The report, published in October 2010, examines the development of household wealth over the past decade across more than 200 countries. Unlike other publications that focus on rich lists, this report looks at the wealth of all 4.4 billion adults worldwide.
The key highlight mentioned in the article is that a particular segment of individuals currently holds 32 percent of global household wealth, and it is expected to grow rapidly. This indicates a high concentration of wealth among a smaller portion of society. The report also delves into various aspects such as social structures influencing wealth distribution, demographic changes, gender issues, and urbanization trends.
One interesting feature highlighted in the Global Wealth Report is the presence of what they call a "wealth pyramid." Within this pyramid structure, there are approximately one billion adults residing within its middle segment. These individuals possess assets ranging from USD 10,000 to USD 100,000 collectively. Experts suggest that this large group represents an immense opportunity for growing consumer markets globally.
The authors responsible for the report also express interest in identifying short-term opportunities while simultaneously considering long-term prospects within emerging markets such as Asia (including China and India), Latin America, Turkey and Indonesia. They believe these countries hold potential for mid-range and upper-end products that will cater to consumers' preferences.
Despite leading markets like Europe, Japan and America facing financial crises during recent times mentioned in this article emerge market countries such as China and India were able to adapt effectively to external shocks due to their economic flexibility.The former US Ambassador to India highlights India's unique advantage with its large internal private sector economy rather than being heavily reliant on exports.
Experts also attribute Asia's dynamism partially to young generations who have not witnessed or feared political crises like war or revolution but are instead focused on consumption and prestige - highlighting China's post-war generation as an example. These individuals are part of the first consumer generation and often have access to higher education and better salaries, which contributes to their increasing spending power.
The former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom emphasizes the fierce competition young Europeans will face from Latin America and Asia. He argues that young people in these regions possess a strong determination to succeed, driven by their desire to escape poverty and ensure they do not regress back into it.
To summarize, this news article provides an overview of the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report's key findings. It showcases the concentration of global household wealth among a smaller segment while identifying growth opportunities within emerging markets. The authors also analyze social structures, demographic changes, gender issues, and urbanization trends as factors influencing wealth distribution. Additionally, experts highlight Asia's dynamism resulting from political stability and a growing consumer-driven market fueled by younger generations' consumption patterns. In addition to the key points mentioned earlier, the article also emphasizes the importance of recognizing and responding to the intense competition that young Europeans will face from regions like Latin America and Asia. The article highlights that young people in these areas have a strong determination to succeed, driven by their experiences of poverty and their desire to avoid falling back into it.
The shift in global economic power towards emerging markets like China and India is evident from the report's findings. While traditional leading markets such as Europe, Japan, and the United States struggled with financial crises, these emerging economies were able to weather external shocks more effectively due to their ability to adapt. This resilience presents a promising opportunity for multinational companies based in Europe and America who can tap into growing consumer markets in Asia.
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that this report takes into account factors beyond mere wealth distribution. It analyzes social structures influencing wealth disparities, demographic changes such as population growth or aging populations, gender issues related to inequality between men and women within households when it comes to owning assets or accessing wealth opportunities, as well as urbanization trends which highlight shifts in wealth accumulation patterns across cities.
The Global Wealth Report's focus on understanding all aspects of household wealth for all adults worldwide provides a comprehensive view of global economic dynamics. By examining assets held by households across various countries over a decade-long period starting from 2000 until 2010 when this report was published - Credit Suisse aims not only at providing insights into current wealth distribution but also at identifying potential future trends.
The concept of the "wealth pyramid" introduced in this report unveils an enormous opportunity for businesses looking for mid-range and high-end consumer markets particularly within countries where individuals fall within the middle segment of USD 10,000-USD 100,000 worth of assets. This segment constitutes one billion adults globally who represent potential consumers interested in various products and services prevalent today.
By grasping short-term opportunities while keeping an eye on the long-term prospects of emerging markets, companies can align their strategies with the expected rise in wealth and income among the middle segment of the wealth pyramid. This not only benefits businesses within those countries but also presents opportunities for multinational corporations based in Europe and America to tap into these growing consumer markets.
Overall, as highlighted by the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, young Europeans need to be aware of and prepared to face intense competition from regions like Latin America and Asia. The article concludes on a note that young people in these areas are determined to succeed, driven by their personal experiences of poverty and their aspirations for a better future. Understanding the changing global dynamics, capitalizing on emerging markets' potential, and adapting strategies accordingly will be crucial for individuals, businesses, and economies alike. 
The news article discusses a project order given to a small group of architects for the renovation and redesign of the historic CS head office building, along with other buildings on Paradeplatz. The owners of the building were aware of their cultural responsibility due to its historical value as a listed building.
The future design of Paradeplatz needed to meet certain requirements according to an assessment report. It was important that visitors not only see the building from the outside but also experience it from within. The design should be stimulating, communicative, generous, and open. With these requirements in mind, Atelier 5, an architect's office, was chosen for the project.
Atelier 5 excelled in finding a balance between preservation and renovation while creating a welcoming space for the public. They had a subtle interaction with the existing structure and prioritized restoring it to its original state rather than imposing their own ideas. Denis Roy, the architect responsible for the project, emphasized that their planning was influenced more by the building itself and its history.
One notable aspect of Atelier 5's work was reopening an arcade that existed when Adolf Brunner built Lichthof in 1876 but had been closed during a major renovation in 1900 when it was converted into a banking hall. Now, after 100 years, this arcade has been reopened and is considered one of the most significant architectural interventions in the entire project.
The monumental edifice has also been opened up towards Bahnhofstrasse with a concealed connecting arcade that used to be part of the post office's main hall. This approach leads visitors through several archways before arriving at Lichthof – a central point flooded with natural light from skylights overhead. The contrast between noisy Paradeplatz and Lichthof is striking; Lichthof provides an oasis-like atmosphere filled with peacefulness.
The actual entrance to Credit Suisse bank branch is now located where once stood the securities counter. This hall, in the form of a nonagon, was an extension of the banking hall at the turn of the century and is also a listed structure. The architects envisioned maintaining its historical significance by using it as the entrance to Credit Suisse.
In addition to these renovations, a high-class shopping arcade has been created within the building. Ten shops and a gourmet restaurant have opened their doors, including well-known brands such as Giorgio Armani, Ermenegildo Zegna, Bulgari, Montblanc, Bottega Veneta, and others.
The overall renovation project aimed to respect the historical importance of the CS head office building while creating an inviting space for visitors. Atelier 5's design choices focused on harmonizing with existing structures rather than overshadowing them with new elements. The reopened arcade and restoration of original features highlight their commitment to preserving history while adapting spaces for modern uses.
This transformation has not only restored vitality to Paradeplatz but also provided an assortment of high-quality stores that contribute to Zurich's reputation as an international shopping destination. The renovated CS head office is now not only visually appealing from outside but also offers an immersive experience when stepping inside – combining architectural beauty with contemporary amenities. 
This news article discusses the inflation pressure experienced in emerging markets like China and India. It suggests that fears of interest rate hikes can temporarily affect these markets. However, from a structural standpoint, it is believed that the emerging market story is far from over due to various advantages leading to strategic outperformance.
The article recommends buying into phases of neutral or underperformance of the emerging markets, but emphasizes a broad-based approach rather than just focusing on equities. It highlights the importance of considering emerging market debt and local currencies alongside equities. The article lists several structural advantages such as healthy debt-to-GDP ratios, visible foreign currency reserves, fewer banking problems, and visible demographic advantages that contribute to this strategic outperformance.
The writer dismisses the notion of a bubble or overheating in the emerging markets based on these underlying structural elements. They anticipate that although there may be crowded trades due to capital flows, more strategic investors entering the market would result in less rapid inflow and outflow of money. This integration into benchmarks by strategic investors leads to an expectation of lower volatility in emerging markets compared to the past.
Additionally, commodities are mentioned as being positive investments given the current stage of macroeconomic normalization. The writer makes a strong call to buy real assets like commodities with confidence that they will outperform over the next decade as we move away from deflation threats towards reflation and ultimately inflation.
In conclusion, this news article highlights how inflation pressure impacts emerging markets and discusses various factors contributing to their long-term performance. It recommends adopting a broad-based approach when investing in these markets by considering not only equities but also debt and local currencies. The writer remains optimistic about future returns in both emerging market investments and commodities due to favorable structural elements supporting these asset classes' growth potential over time.
 Furthermore, the article mentions that the current economic cycle is in a phase of reflation and heading towards inflation. This has led to a positive outlook for commodities as real assets. The writer suggests taking advantage of any weakness in commodity prices to increase exposure or extend positions in industrial metals, soft commodities, energy, and precious metals.
The justification behind this recommendation lies in the belief that real assets will likely outperform other investments over the next decade. As the pendulum swings away from deflation threats and towards inflation, commodities tend to benefit from rising prices and increased demand. This positive stance on commodities aligns with the broader macroeconomic context.
It is also worth noting that strategic investors are becoming more involved in these markets, which signifies a shift towards longer-term commitments rather than short-term speculation. This trend contributes to overall stability by reducing rapid capital flows into and out of emerging markets.
In terms of portfolio allocation, the article mentions that their benchmark exposure already has an allocation of more than 10 percent to emerging markets. However, they suggest that during normal market cycles it would be reasonable to recommend an allocation as high as 20 percent.
While acknowledging potential risks associated with crowded trades due to increased investor interest in emerging markets, including various structural advantages such as favorable debt-to-GDP ratios and visible foreign currency reserves provide confidence regarding long-term performance potential.
Overall, this news article emphasizes opportunities for investment within emerging markets and commodity sectors based on optimistic expectations about future returns. It highlights structural advantages supporting growth prospects across different asset classes like equities, debt instruments denominated in local currencies, and commodities. The integration of emerging markets into benchmarks by strategic investors is seen as a contributing factor toward lower volatility going forward.
However, it's important for readers to consider multiple perspectives when interpreting financial market information since views can vary among experts depending on their individual analysis methods or risk tolerances.
 
This news article discusses Serbia's desire to join the European Union (EU) and the potential benefits and challenges associated with this goal.
Serbia has been a potential candidate for EU membership since 2003, and in 2009, it formally applied for membership. The idea of joining the EU has received widespread political and popular support within Serbia. A recent survey conducted by Serbia's official European Integration Office showed that 53 percent of citizens would support EU membership if a referendum were held in the near future. This percentage has decreased from around 70 percent five years ago, but still only 24 percent would vote against joining the EU.
The belief that EU membership would be beneficial is stronger among Serbian people compared to neighboring Croatia, where only 27 percent of respondents regarded EU membership as beneficial according to a recent Eurobarometer survey.
In terms of economic growth, between 2000 and 2008, Serbia experienced an average annual GDP expansion of over 5 percent driven primarily by non-tradable sectors. However, this growth model led to a wide current account deficit due to an external trade imbalance. The deficit was financed by capital inflows and foreign direct investment (FDI). When the global economic crisis hit in 2008, Serbia's growth model became unsustainable.
To address these issues, Serbia entered into a Stand-By Arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in January 2009. This arrangement aimed at transforming Serbia's economy from consumption-driven to export-led growth. So far, these reforms have had some success as GDP grew by approximately 1.8 percent in 2010 driven largely by external demand.
The IMF forecasts further GDP growth of at least 3 percent in2011 and at least5percent in2012.However,high inflationand elevated unemployment continue to impact domestic demand negatively.Additionally,the recent surgeinportfolio inflows has caused appreciation pressure onthe Serbian Dinar,which poses a threat to Serbia's competitiveness in an export-led recovery phase.
Given the structure of Serbia's economy, both the government and the business sector see EU membership as synonymous with prosperity. Serbia's future economic success is heavily reliant on export growth and facilitated access to the European market. Joining the EU also provides an opportunity for developing more mature financial markets in Serbia.
The Serbian equity market has attracted investor attention due to its strong performance, with returns exceeding 40 percent between January 2001 and June 2011. The MSCI Serbia index has outperformed most regional peers as well as the MSCI Frontier Market index, of which it is a constituent. Cross-border acquisitions may incentivize local companies to list on the local stock market, which currently experiences low liquidity and high volatility.
In conclusion, this news article highlights Serbians' generally positive attitude towards EU membership and their belief that it would bring economic benefits. However, it also underscores challenges such as managing inflation and unemployment while maintaining competitiveness within an export-led recovery phase. Joining the EU could provide Serbia with access to a larger market for its exports and facilitate investment inflows leading to sustained economic growth in the long term. Furthermore, EU integration offers a range of benefits beyond economic growth for Serbia. Access to the European market would provide Serbian businesses with opportunities to expand and access a larger customer base. This could lead to increased foreign direct investment and technology transfers, which are essential for the modernization and development of industries within Serbia.
Moreover, EU membership would bring regulatory alignment with European standards and norms in areas such as trade, agriculture, environment, and labor rights. This alignment would enhance Serbia's standing in international markets by ensuring compliance with global standards and attracting more foreign investment.
Additionally, EU integration is seen as important for political stability in the region. Joining the EU is also seen as a way to strengthen democratic institutions, combat corruption, increase transparency, protect human rights and minority rights – all of which are vital factors in establishing stable governance.
However, there are challenges that need addressing before Serbia can become an EU member state. Key among these is resolving longstanding disputes with neighboring countries such as Kosovo. The normalization of relations between Belgrade (capital city of Serbia)and Pristina (capital city of Kosovo), achieved through dialogue under the auspices 0f the European Union in 2013-2015 which resulted in several agreements being reached.These agreements included areas like justice cooperation,police cooperation,and establishing an Association/Community of Serb-Majority Municipalities.*
Moreover,the issueofSerbia'sstrainedrelationshipwithRussiaalso poses a challenge to its EU aspirations.Despite Russia's strong oppositiontoSerbiajoiningtheEU,Serbia has takensteps,suchas joiningeconomic sanctionsagainst Russia because itannexed Crimea from Ukraine,and seekedto maintaina balanced relationshipbetweentheEUandRussia.
In conclusion,EUmembership representsan important goalfor Serbia.It hashigh politicaland popular support.Asoneofthepotential candidatesforEUmembershipintheWestern Balkans,it seeksaccess tothefreemarket,strongercollaborations withEUmember states,political stability, and the opportunitytoengageinregionalcooperation. Whilst Serbia has made progress in terms of economic reforms and integration efforts, resolving issues such as disputes with neighboring countries and maintaining a balanced stance on international relations remain challenges on its path to EU membership.
*Note: The information about the agreements reached between Belgrade and Pristina was accurate as of 2015. It is important to verify the latest developments regarding these agreements. 
This news article discusses the likelihood of a common issuance of bonds in the eurozone, as well as the current state of global markets and economies.
The article starts by stating that, despite the long-term benefits, it is unlikely that there will be a broader common issuance of bonds in the eurozone at this time. The main reason for this is that such an option is politically less viable. While stronger countries may benefit from reduced risk to their financial systems, politicians and the public do not see this benefit as significant enough to warrant such a large political step towards common eurozone issuance. Therefore, although there are advantages for stronger countries, the amount of fiscal sovereignty they would have to give up is still too large to consider at this point.
However, even without a grand and instant solution like a common government bond issuance, it is believed that the eurozone will hold together. The article mentions policy responses such as the Stabilization Fund and predicts more steps to address immediate liquidity and solvency issues. This combination of fiscal improvement and ongoing support from central institutions will slowly move towards stronger fiscal centralization without necessarily needing a common issuance at this point. This is seen positively for long-term stability in the euro.
The article then shifts its focus to global market dynamics. It notes that despite recent market instability worldwide, both the dollar and euro have held up relatively well so far. There has been some weakness in emerging markets and commodity-related currencies but nothing significant enough reflecting stable situations at current prices.
There is also a risk of seeing some dollar strength due to ongoing instability if there are no promises or indications of new softer monetary policy steps from the US. Nonetheless, overall stability within certain ranges can be expected in currency markets for several months ahead.
The bond market has experienced significant declines in benchmark bond yields globally led by concerns over recession probability coupled with expectations that central banks might respond by extending their operations with added liquidity measures – exerting downward pressure on bond yields. Additionally, there has been notable volatility in the equity market with corrections from recent highs and uncertain outlooks.
The article mentions that credit rating downgrades, such as Japan's recent downgrade, have had little impact on markets. The ratings decisions are seen as not carrying significant weight in the market as they are viewed to be behind the curve in recognizing deteriorating fiscal conditions.
Regarding the global economy, there is a delicate balance between simulative monetary policy and strong growth from emerging markets against the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus and weaker leading indicators. However, despite concerns over unemployment rates in the US and Europe's debt crisis affecting sentiment for consumers and businesses, there is an overall relatively constructive outlook with expectations of continued global demand driven by emerging markets and stimulative US monetary policy.
In conclusion, this news article discusses the unlikelihood of a common issuance of bonds in the eurozone at present due to political considerations. It then provides an overview of current market dynamics globally, highlighting stability within certain ranges but acknowledging volatility and risks associated with recession probability and fiscal conditions. Despite challenges, there remains a moderately optimistic view regarding global economic outlook driven by emerging markets' growth and supportive monetary policies. 
The news article discusses a company called HighStep Systems AG that has developed a safe and cost-effective alternative to traditional ladders and lifts for working at elevated locations. The company's founder, Andreas Maurer, was inspired to create this system after his father fell from a ladder in the garden. HighStep Systems' climbing system offers several advantages over ladders and lifts, including enhanced safety, ergonomic working positions, reduced fatigue, and the ability to work for longer periods.
One of the key features of the HighStep system is an aluminum rail that is securely connected to the structure being worked on. This rail serves as a support for the mobile climbing equipment used by technicians. The company also plans to introduce a portable lift as part of their offerings. They are awaiting certification from TÜV which they expect will lead to further growth opportunities.
HighStep Systems currently focuses on two main markets: electricity pylons and wind turbines. The company can retrofit lifts onto existing structures in these markets, giving them a competitive advantage. With over a million electricity pylons and 72,000 wind turbines in Europe alone - both growing industries - the market potential is substantial. The CEO recognizes this opportunity but admits that for capacity reasons they have been cautious about expanding into Chinese and Indian markets.
The article mentions future possibilities for expanding HighStep Systems' products into other areas such as high-rack warehouses, cranes, lampposts, tall buildings, oil or gas tankers etc. The team is already considering new product types that could be attached to their rail system such as materials transporters or robots with cameras for monitoring purposes.
Despite its relatively short history since its founding in 2007, HighStep Systems has achieved significant milestones including securing major clients like Axpo who committed to using their climbing system in 2008. In 2010 alone they fitted their system on more than 1,000 pylons generating millions in revenues.
HighStep Systems has also secured financing to support its growth, with assistance from SVC - Ltd. This company provided a loan and has helped with business development, marketing, and finding partners in specific countries.
The biggest challenges faced by HighStep Systems have been the economic situation in Europe and the strength of the Swiss franc. The financial crisis and ongoing cost pressures have made clients more cautious. However, Maurer remains optimistic about the future due to the increasing emphasis on workplace safety and society's demographic problems. He believes that if they can tap into the market potential, their revenues could reach 100 or 200 million Swiss francs.
In summary, HighStep Systems AG has developed a climbing system that provides safe and cost-effective alternatives to traditional ladders and lifts for working at elevated locations such as electricity pylons and wind turbines. With several advantages over existing options, including enhanced safety features and ergonomic working positions, HighStep Systems has seen success fitting its system on numerous pylons generating significant revenues. Despite its success and potential for growth, HighStep Systems has faced challenges due to the economic situation in Europe and the strength of the Swiss franc. The financial crisis has led to clients becoming more cautious about investing in new systems, which has affected the company's sales. Additionally, the value of the Swiss franc against other currencies has made their products relatively more expensive for international markets.
However, HighStep Systems remains confident about its future prospects. The growing focus on workplace safety and society's demographic problems are expected to drive demand for their climbing system in the mid- to long-term. As older technicians with knee or back problems become more common and young technicians become rarer, HighStep Systems offers a solution that enables technicians to work longer while minimizing physical strain.
The company's commitment to innovation is evident not only in their development of a climbing system that outperforms traditional ladders but also through their plans for expanding into new markets and considering additional product options that can be attached to their rail system. These expansions could potentially open up a range of opportunities beyond just electricity pylons and wind turbines.
To support its growth plans, HighStep Systems has secured financing from SVC - Ltd., which not only provided a loan but also assisted with business development, marketing efforts, and finding partners in specific countries. This partnership highlights the confidence that venture capitalists have shown in HighStep Systems' potential as they look towards larger revenue figures.
Looking ahead, one aspect that may propel further growth for HighStep Systems is obtaining TÜV certification for their portable lift. This certification would add credibility to their product line and open up even more possibilities within various industries beyond just elevated workplaces like high-rack warehouses or cranes.
Furthermore, although currently cautious about expanding into Asian markets due to capacity limitations, there is significant untapped potential there as well as other international markets if properly strategized by this small company with ten employees.
In conclusion, despite challenges posed by the economic situation and currency fluctuations, HighStep Systems AG has managed to create a safe and cost-effective alternative to traditional ladders and lifts for working at elevated locations. Their innovative climbing system offers advantages in safety, ergonomics, and the potential to work longer hours without fatigue or strain. With major clients already on board, significant revenues generated, and plans for future expansions into different industries and markets, HighStep Systems is poised for continued growth in the coming years. 
This news article discusses the role of social networks, such as Twitter and traditional television, in mobilizing people and shaping political processes. It highlights both the positive and negative aspects of using these platforms for messaging, outreach, and discussing policy.
The article starts by mentioning President Obama's successful use of social media during his campaign to become President of the United States. It emphasizes that social networks have become an important tool for politicians to communicate with constituents and define themselves. However, it also points out that they can be used to spread misinformation, which can be difficult to correct once it goes viral.
The article then explores the connection between advertising money and campaigns. In countries like the United States where there is a long electoral cycle and significant financial investments in campaigns, social media becomes even more crucial. The medium has the potential to facilitate both positive and negative influences on elections.
Drawing lessons from uprisings in the Middle East, the article suggests that social media played a significant role in mobilizing discontented individuals against oppressive regimes. However, it acknowledges that rebuilding these societies after regime change requires time and continued coordination among diverse groups with different interests.
One concern raised in relation to social networks is their ability to reinforce herd mentality or echo chambers. People tend to join or believe something because others around them do likewise without critically examining evidence or alternative viewpoints. The more a social network focuses on like-minded individuals, the less diversity of opinions it promotes.
The situation in China is discussed as an interesting case study where blogging communities exist but are subject to control by authorities who allow some criticisms while monitoring others closely. Nationalistic sentiments are often reflected on Chinese blogs or social networks, potentially influencing public policy decisions not based on sound evidence but rather emotional reactions.
Comparatively speaking, openness prevails as a general presumption in U.S.-based platforms like Facebook where users enjoy freedom of expression without excessive censorship concerns; however, distorted or untruthful information remains a prominent challenge.
The article also touches on the entertainment and gaming aspects of social networks, indicating that active users may engage more for personal amusement or connecting with friends rather than political purposes. In reality, despite the vast number of connections people may have on platforms like Facebook, studies suggest that individuals typically interact closely with a smaller group of around 150 close acquaintances.
In conclusion, this news article explores various dimensions and dilemmas surrounding social networks. It acknowledges their potential to facilitate both positive and negative outcomes in political processes but also highlights the need for careful attention to how these platforms shape dynamics such as information dissemination, herd mentality, diversity of opinions, nationalistic sentiments, and entertainment value. The evolving nature of social networks necessitates continued analysis and study to fully understand their impact on societies. The article points out that the concept of social networks is relatively new, and therefore many questions surrounding their implications remain unanswered. It emphasizes the importance of paying attention to these platforms as society undergoes a transition in communication and information sharing.
One aspect that is discussed is the potential narcissistic nature of social media, particularly platforms like Facebook. People often post personal updates and photos, assuming others are interested in their lives. However, it raises the question of whether this assumption holds true or if it merely feeds into individuals' self-centeredness.
The article concludes by emphasizing that social networks are still in their early stages, and there is much we do not know about them. As they continue to evolve and shape our societies, it becomes increasingly essential for us to understand their effects on various aspects such as politics, information dissemination, public opinion formation, entertainment trends, societal cohesion/division dynamics, and more.

This news article discusses the resilience of the Swiss export industry during the recent recession and highlights factors that have contributed to its ability to recover quickly. Compared to other countries, Switzerland experienced a relatively small decline in goods exports, with only a 14 percent drop in 2009.
One key reason for Switzerland's resistance to the economic crisis is its sector portfolio, which is less volatile compared to countries like Germany, France, Italy, the UK, and the US. The pharmaceutical industry plays a significant role in Switzerland's export sector and is relatively non-cyclical. Additionally, vehicle manufacturing has a smaller share in Swiss exports compared to other countries.
Although sectors other than pharmaceuticals and vehicle manufacturing make up a similar share of total exports for Switzerland and its neighboring countries, there are no specific advantages or disadvantages in terms of Switzerland's ability to withstand crises. However, as a small open economy that is vulnerable to external shocks, reducing dependence on individual countries can help minimize vulnerability.
The article suggests that although all sectors in Switzerland are better diversified than the average for OECD countries (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), they still lag behind their competitors in neighboring countries like Germany and France as well as the UK and US. It specifically mentions room for improvement in diversification within medical technology and metal industries while noting that pharmaceuticals and watch industries have better geographical diversification.
Geographical diversification not only allows capitalizing on growth sources from various countries but also acts as a natural hedge against currency fluctuations. The high quality of Swiss exports has likely contributed positively to its resistance during the crisis. By using unit value (average price per unit weight) as an indicator of export quality, it was found that Swiss goods generally have higher unit values compared to other countries.
Switzerland stands out with higher mean unit values across all exported goods when compared with other nations included in this study. Sectors characterized by lower values do not significantly reduce Swiss export unit values. For example, Germany has a more significant presence in the automotive industry, which falls short compared to high-tech industries like precision instruments, pharmaceuticals, and watches present in Switzerland.
The article also emphasizes that Swiss exports mainly compete on quality rather than price. In 2010, approximately 63 percent of Swiss exports competed on quality while only six percent showed a disadvantage relative to foreign rivals. However, when it comes to competing on price, just under 10 percent of Swiss goods have an advantage compared to competitors.
To remain successful in the future, the Swiss export industry needs to maintain its lead in terms of quality and technology through constant innovation. This is crucial as other economies seek to replicate these qualities at lower costs. The article concludes by highlighting the need for continuous improvements and outstanding service to reinforce Switzerland's "price premium" against its competitors.
In summary, this news article discusses how Switzerland's export industry fared during the recent recession and attributes its resilience partially due to factors such as sector portfolio diversification and higher quality products with higher unit values. It also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a focus on innovation and technology advancements for future success in an increasingly competitive global market. 
This news article features Abdul Buhari, a 30-year-old investment banker at Credit Suisse in London. Despite having a successful career in banking, Abdul is also an accomplished discus thrower and has had an international career in the sport.
Abdul explains that discus throwing is his passion and describes the magic he feels when he throws the discus. He compares it to throwing a Frisbee but mentions that the discus weighs two kilograms, similar to a bag of potatoes. He proudly shares that his best throw was 65.44 meters, which is the fourth-best result in English track and field history.
As an athlete, Abdul emphasizes how modern discus throwers are high-caliber performers who meticulously analyze and vary their movements to achieve better throws. However, Abdul's journey to success was not without struggles. Initially starting as a teenager running the 400 meters, he later took up discus throwing after being injured multiple times.
Abdul faced challenges with his physique and self-confidence. He had to bulk up from 80 to over 100 kilograms to excel in discus throwing and also had to overcome shyness when performing in front of crowds. While he admits that emotions sometimes still get in the way even today, he appreciates the restrictive ticketing policy of the London organizers for not granting admission tickets for his relatives during Olympics events since their presence might distract him from performing well.
In 2008, Abdul experienced both progress and setbacks - missing qualifying for Beijing Olympics by only 70 centimeters (1 percent short of qualifying). Determined to prioritize his sporting career over full-time work at Credit Suisse, Abdul mustered up courage and explained this decision to his boss. Surprisingly supportive of his ambitions, Credit Suisse allowed him to work part-time (40 percent) while nurturing his athletic pursuits.
He proudly shares that many clients have become fans of his athletic endeavors and some even attend his competitions. Abdul consulted with the head of the trading floor, who advised him to treat his sporting career as his own business, taking responsibility for its success.
To further invest in his athletic performance, Abdul changed coaches and made adjustments like giving up fasting during Ramadan when it coincided with a major championship. He employs marketing tools like a personal website and Twitter account to promote himself and carefully tracks his performance data.
Abdul makes significant financial investments in his career by spending more on food and travel than on his mortgage. A large portion of this expenditure goes towards purchasing meat, demonstrating the importance of nutrition in supporting his training regimen. Each week, he travels three hours to Loughborough where he can access top-notch training facilities.
Abdul finds stability in marriage since marrying in 2010 and acknowledges that he is currently at the best age for a discus thrower at 30 years old. Ultimately, Abdul's story exemplifies dedication to pursuing one's passion alongside professional commitments while also managing personal growth and overcoming challenges along the way. Continuing from where we left off, Abdul has reached a turning point in his athletic career. Through his dedication and hard work, he has managed to balance his job at Credit Suisse with his training as a discus thrower. This shows that he is not only committed to excelling in both domains but also willing to make sacrifices for his passion.
Abdul's commitment to improving as an athlete goes beyond just physical training. He understands the importance of marketing himself and building a personal brand. By leveraging tools like his website and social media presence, he keeps track of and shares updates on his performance data with fans and supporters.
One intriguing aspect highlighted in the article is how Abdul draws inspiration from trading strategies in building up his athletic career. By treating himself as an independent small business, taking full responsibility for every aspect of his sport, Abdul applies principles from the banking industry to help him excel as an athlete.
The article also sheds light on the financial aspects of Abdul's pursuit of excellence. It is evident that being an elite athlete comes at a significant cost—Abdul spends considerable amounts on food and travel each month, investing more in these areas than even on his mortgage payments. This showcases how much he values investing in himself and dedicating resources towards achieving optimal results.
Another notable point mentioned is how supportive Abdul's workplace has been throughout this journey. Despite working within the demanding field of investment banking, Credit Suisse accommodated Abdul's part-time work schedule so that he could focus more intensely on training and competitions. Moreover, many of Abdul's clients have become fans who actively support him emotionally by attending various sporting events showcasing their interest not just professionally but also personally.
Abdul's story serves as motivation for aspiring athletes who may face obstacles or feel torn between professional careers and sporting passions. It demonstrates that with dedicated effort, strategic planning, self-belief along with the right support system – both personal (such as his wife) and professional (employers and clients) – it is possible to excel in multiple areas of life.
Lastly, the article emphasizes that Abdul's journey has not been a smooth ride. It highlights his setbacks, physical struggles, and occasional emotional hurdles. However, he persevered through these challenges, learning from them along the way. This perseverance speaks volumes about Abdul's tenacity and mental strength.
In conclusion, this news article tells the inspiring story of Abdul Buhari—a successful investment banker who is also pursuing his passion for discus throwing at an elite level. It showcases how he balances both worlds, reveals his dedication to self-improvement in all aspects of life, and emphasizes the support he receives from colleagues and clients alike. Overall, it serves as a reminder that with determination and hard work, one can achieve great success in multiple areas of their life. 
This news article discusses a company that is now a subsidiary, with its focus on the military and civilian aeronautics markets. The company has expertise in circuit boards and has already mastered various technologies related to this field.
To enter the aerospace industry, the company had to go through extensive PR work and invest significant time to pass quality audits required for aerospace companies. This step was crucial in securing its first contracts. With the success of this new strategy, the subsidiary gradually moved away from its parent company's core activities which led to an agreement for its sale in 2011.
The capital of CES (the subsidiary) was fully sold off in 2012 to three Swiss financial investors: SVC - Ltd. for Risk Capital for SMEs, Vinci Capital Switzerland SA, and Capital Transmission SA. Today, CES SA offers two major product lines. First are standard circuit boards known for their exceptional performance. The company handles everything from design to manufacturing and assembly of processor, interface, network, and graphics boards.
Secondly, CES also offers complete systems by assembling these boards together. These systems include flight computers that meet stringent security and reliability standards for flight data controls as well as mission computers connected to sensors handling specific roles like collecting photos or videos. These technologies are installed on both civil and military aircraft.
CES also produces signal-processing subsystems primarily used in equipping airports or borders with surveillance radar systems. To ensure continuous development and growth of the company, CES maintains close relationships with universities and specialty schools throughout the region from which it recruits qualified employees.
Approximately three-quarters of their nearly one hundred employees have higher technical engineering education backgrounds including many who hold doctorates. Additionally, five to six interns are taken on each year for extensive engineering and technical training.
Although maintaining their research and development team in Switzerland incurs considerable costs,
CES emphasizes certain advantages such as proximity to schools renowned quality image,
historical links with CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), and Switzerland's political neutrality and stability that make it favorable for the company to keep its headquarters in the Geneva region.
The company prides itself on fostering an extremely multicultural environment with employees representing close to 20 different nationalities. CES is driven by technology, which enables it to compete with much larger US competitors in expanding its market share.
CES completely exports its products and has recently faced challenges due to difficult economic conditions resulting in a decline in client activities. The company is currently engaged with Armasuisse, the Swiss authority responsible for procurement and replacement of the F-5 Tiger aircraft. However, the political situation in Switzerland adds uncertainty to such large projects, limiting opportunities for Swiss industry.
Despite these challenges, CES remains confident in its expertise and solutions that are 100 percent Swiss-made. This confidence ensures that CES' name will continue to be associated with reputable clients and projects as it aims to grow its market share considering there is significant potential for growth in certain aeronautics sectors like Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR). 
The article discusses the increasing prevalence and importance of social media in today's society. It mentions that Facebook is nearing one billion users, which would make it the second-largest country in the world if it were a country. The author believes that even if Facebook eventually loses its popularity like MySpace did, there will always be another social network to take its place.
The article emphasizes that companies need to change their attitudes towards social media and actively participate in it. They should aim to create communities of friends rather than just seeking potential clients. Companies must also be willing to open up and decide who can speak on behalf of the company. Previously, only top-level executives like CEOs had this responsibility, but now everyone in an organization can become an unofficial spokesperson through platforms like Twitter or Facebook.
One important aspect mentioned is active engagement with the audience on social media instead of just passively monitoring it. Companies should listen and respond to feedback instead of merely transforming press releases into short tweets. CEOs and managing boards are encouraged to join Twitter as it allows them to directly communicate with their audience including employees and journalists.
Criticism on social media is acknowledged as a reality that companies cannot ignore. Embracing criticism actually leads to more successful outcomes for businesses because it gives them opportunities for improvement. The example given is TripAdvisor, where people openly criticize hotels leading to better overall standards within the industry.
Journalists at The Economist have learned from their experience with social media feedback that criticism can enhance their writing by allowing them to constantly improve themselves. Corporations can benefit from this process too, by using feedback as a tool for making their businesses better.
Various successful examples are provided such as Nike effectively using social media for marketing purposes, Johnson & Johnson utilizing YouTube, blogs, and Twitter despite being heavily regulated in the pharmaceutical industry, and Zappos successfully building a billion-dollar shoe business primarily through effective customer service communication via social media.
The article suggests that soon even banking services will be provided through platforms like Twitter. It mentions how the airline KLM used Twitter during volcanic eruptions to directly contact and assist affected customers, demonstrating the potential for customer service advancements through social media.
The article concludes by highlighting the risks associated with not embracing social media. Using the World Economic Forum's Facebook page as an example, it explains how initially it was uncertain whether anyone would want to become friends with such an institution. However, the page gained over 100,000 likes and received mostly positive feedback when discussions were opened up. The importance of openness is emphasized, particularly for public-facing organizations.
Overall, the article emphasizes that social media has become an integral part of society and companies need to actively engage with it in order to build communities, respond to criticism and feedback effectively, and improve their businesses. The article also touches upon the potential downsides and risks associated with social media. It points out that while social media provides opportunities for companies to connect with their audience, it also exposes them to criticism and negative feedback. However, the article emphasizes that this risk should not deter companies from actively engaging in social media.
Through examples like the World Economic Forum's Facebook page, which experienced very few negative comments despite opening up to discussions, the article suggests that embracing social media can lead to productive and civil conversations. This highlights the importance of creating a space for open dialogue where organizations can address concerns and interact with their audience in a transparent manner.
Furthermore, the article discusses how even public-facing institutions need to adopt an open approach on social media platforms. Being open allows these organizations to effectively communicate their values and engage with various stakeholders. By remaining closed off or avoiding social media altogether, institutions run the risk of disconnecting from their audiences or missing out on important opportunities for growth.
The final point made in the article is about the potential future developments in social media. The author believes that as technology continues to advance, there will be further integration between services like Twitter and banking. This indicates that embracing new technologies is not only important for current success but also prepares organizations for upcoming advancements that can revolutionize how they operate.
In conclusion, this news article emphasizes how essential it is for companies to embrace social media as a means of building communities, engaging with audiences effectively, addressing criticism constructively, and improving overall performance. While acknowledging potential risks and challenges associated with social media usage, it strongly advocates for openness as an important element of successful engagement on these platforms. The potential benefits provided by social media far outweigh any disadvantages or uncertainties that may arise along the way. 
This news article highlights the cultural differences in China and discusses the potential for learning from each other. The author mentions that while China has achieved great growth in the past decade, it is still considered a developing country. The focus of the current generation, including the author, is to bring China to a higher level and change its global image.
The author points out that their father's generation had different priorities, primarily centered around finding a better life, supporting their families, and seeking stability. However, with the changing times, there is now an emphasis on driving China's progress and maintaining a balance between domestic reform and global engagement.
The article acknowledges the challenges faced by the Chinese government due to its massive population of 1.3 billion people. Feeding such a large number of individuals and providing sufficient job opportunities presents an ongoing challenge. Nonetheless, there is optimism that China is on the right track but patience is required.
The author reflects on their own fortunate circumstances as they inherited a large business empire from their father. They attribute their success at a young age to confidence in themselves and believing in their abilities. Furthermore, they mention sacrificing personal time with friends and parties to focus on meetings with different people as an opportunity for learning.
Defining oneself proves to be another personal challenge mentioned by the author. They sometimes struggle with finding direction and deciding what choices are right for them at this stage of life. Although external influences exist – such as media pressure or others trying to sway them – they emphasize staying true to oneself.
A significant aspect discussed in this article is philanthropy in China where giving back personally rather than just writing checks becomes crucial for societal change in attitudes towards charity work. The author currently supports students through regular meetings at Zhejiang University but aims to expand support further by envisioning over 100 students benefiting from their foundation's initiatives.
The article also addresses educational differences between China and the United States based on personal experiences of being educated in the US. The author observes that Chinese education largely focuses on exam-oriented learning, while in the US, emphasis is placed on encouraging students to explore their own ideas. The author expresses concern about China's future workforce and highlights the need for an effective education system that fosters talent and individuality.
The article concludes by discussing personal aspirations beyond business success. The author shares a childhood dream of becoming an artist, expressing a desire to reconnect with art once their company becomes more self-sustaining. They look forward to having more time to focus on personal interests, travel, meet new people, paint, and potentially learn a third language.
In terms of personal growth, the author emphasizes being brave and willing to take risks in order to experience growth and not being deterred by failure but rather learning from it. Additionally, they admit struggles faced in finding a balance between assertiveness and sensitivity towards others both within their work environment and family dynamics.
As an only child, the pressure from family expectations adds another layer of stress for the author but acknowledges it as something they need to work on personally. The article ends highlighting how navigating societal pressures can be challenging yet necessary for personal development. 
This news article discusses the establishment and purpose of a forum in Switzerland that aims to highlight the importance of a strong financial center for the country's future as a business location. The person behind this initiative is described as someone who was approached by individuals who sought someone outside of parliament to lead this effort.
The article mentions that the decision to support and participate in this forum was easy for the individual, as they strongly believe in the qualities and significance of the Swiss financial center. The goal of creating a "communication platform" involving members of parliament and specialists from the financial sector is also mentioned. While businesspeople and employees are welcome to join, membership needs to be limited to keep the forum manageable.
The article points out that within its relatively short existence (less than three years), the forum has been successful in generating public interest on various topics it covers. It states that they have achieved positive impact which continues to expand over time.
Regarding banks' role in providing loans, it is suggested that while there may be instances where being denied can be challenging during difficult circumstances, banks themselves have learned through experience about lending practices. Successful financial institutions will adapt well, with larger banks leveraging their size advantage while smaller ones thrive as niche players.
Although not directly stated, it becomes clear from further reading that this forum also expresses opinions on matters related to both general politics and those impacting Switzerland's financial center specifically. The article emphasizes on exercising careful consideration before making any statements so as not to jeopardize their fundamental commitment.
One key issue discussed is Switzerland's relationship with European Union (EU) member states concerning free movement of persons. A "No" vote regarding this could endanger agreements crucial for Swiss economy outlined under "Bilateral I". In alignment with economic circles, individuals linked with this forum express support for extending free movement with EU countries due to its potential positive impact on Swiss economy including the financial sector.
Banking secrecy is identified as an important factor contributing towards the success of the Swiss financial center, alongside political stability, moderate taxes, and asset management expertise. The article asserts that banking secrecy does not provide unfair competitive advantage but rather highlights it as an integral part of protecting individuals' privacy, aligning with Switzerland's liberal perspective. It is emphasized that Swiss banking secrecy does not offer protection to criminals and has been actively involved in combating money laundering and terrorism financing.
Overall, the article provides an overview of a forum established to advocate for a strong Swiss financial center as essential for Switzerland's future business prospects. It also touches upon related topics such as lending practices, issues concerning the EU relationship regarding free movement of persons, and the importance of banking secrecy. Furthermore, the article highlights the belief that protecting banking secrecy is crucial for the survival of the Swiss financial center. It mentions that this protection not only contributes to the success of the center but also reflects a national commitment to privacy and individual rights. The article goes on to state that Switzerland takes pride in its role as a leader in combating money laundering and terrorism financing, asserting its dedication to maintaining ethical practices within its financial sector.
The individual behind this forum emphasizes that efforts should be made to ensure the survival of banking secrecy. This implies a strong stance against any potential threats or international pressures seeking greater transparency within the Swiss financial system.
Additionally, there is mention of an upcoming vote on matters related to Switzerland's relationship with other countries, particularly those impacting economic agreements and policies involving EU member states. The article suggests that expressing opinions on these voting campaigns enhances their profile and further strengthens their commitment.
The overall tone of this news article portrays a positive outlook for the forum's achievements thus far. It highlights public interest in their topics of discussion and asserts their continual growth and impact since its establishment just three years prior. While specifics about their activities are not outlined in detail, it can be inferred that they engage in open dialogue, advocacy efforts, and promoting awareness about issues concerning Switzerland's financial sector.
The forum appears well-positioned as a platform bridging various stakeholders together – from businesspeople and employees to members of parliament – all with an interest in ensuring Switzerland remains an attractive business location bolstered by a powerful financial center. By fostering communication between these different parties, it aims to create a collective understanding of how economic stability relies on sustaining a robust financial sector.
In conclusion, this news article sheds light on an influential forum established with the objective of emphasizing Switzerland's dependence on having a strong financial center for future prosperity as well as reinforcing banking secrecy as intrinsic values aligned with privacy protection. Through open communication channels among various actors involved, including both public figures outside of parliament and financial sector specialists, the forum seeks to address critical issues, express opinions on matters concerning Switzerland's financial center, and ultimately contribute to the long-term success of the country's business landscape. 
This news article discusses the concept of Islamic finance and its growing popularity in the global market. Islamic finance is based on the reconciliation of financial activities with Islamic law, also known as Sharia.
Sharia is derived from spiritual and legal sources such as the Quran (the holy book of Islam) and the Sunnah (the way of life of Prophet Muhammad). The Quran is considered by Muslims to be the word of God, while the Sunnah contains advice and rules on economic practices based on Muhammad's own experiences as a tradesman.
One of the key features of Islamic finance is its prohibition on Riba, which means interest or usury in Arabic. This reflects a broader historical distrust towards interest in many monotheistic religions including Judaism and Christianity. In ancient Jewish tradition, for example, interest was initially considered a sin but over time became more accepted through certain permissions for non-Jews to participate in interest-based lending.
Islamic finance not only prohibits interest but also has specific regulations regarding risk, speculation, gambling-like situations, and classifying certain business sectors as "good" or "bad." These rules aim to promote sustainable growth for local economies and reduce social disparities between rich and poor.
In addition to these principles, Islamic finance applies a negative screening approach to determine compliant business sectors. Some sectors that are not considered compliant with Islam include alcohol- tobacco- pork-related products production, conventional financial services sector, entertainment sector, weapons industry defense industry.
The history of Islamic finance dates back to experiments in Egypt during the 20th century but gained significant attention during the oil crisis in 1970s Middle East where new wealth prompted further development. Over time, institutions focused on developing an Islamic form of economic action emerged mainly in Gulf countries supported by organizations like the Islamic Development Bank founded In 1973.
In contrast to Middle Eastern markets that primarily served wealthy private banking clients and engaged in private equity activities; South East Asian markets embraced retail clients and saw wider adoption of Islamic financial services in the 1980s. However, until the end of the 20th century, Islamic finance had limitations due to the prohibition of direct interest, which limited complete banking services for Islamic clients.
This changed in the new millennium when Islamic institutions invested more in research and development. Consequently, the Islamic fixed income market grew, popularity increased for products such as Islamic mortgages and Sharia-compliant credit cards. This led to a fully-fledged Islamic financial service sector emerging by the end of last decade.
During this period, Sukuk (Islamic bonds) became popular among Middle Eastern and South East Asian companies as a means to raise capital in financial markets. The word "Sukuk" translates to "deed" or "legal document" and is derived from an old tradition of issuing documents to verify outstanding debt.
Overall, this article highlights how Islamic finance has evolved over time, becoming a significant player in global finance with its unique principles rooted in Sharia law. It also explains how different religious traditions have grappled with their own perception and regulation of interest-based financial activities. 
This news article focuses on the success and development of Swiss football players, particularly those who have achieved championships at a professional level. The mentioned players include Xherdan Shaqiri, Granit Xhaka, Yann Sommer, Fabian Frei, Valentin Stocker, Philippe Koch, Admir Mehmedi, Oliver Buff, and Ricardo Rodríguez.
The article emphasizes the hunger for success that this generation of players possesses. They are not intimidated by major challenges and are willing to work hard to achieve their goals.

The author also mentions the role of coaches and other people involved in supporting these young players along their journey. They provide guidance and help them overcome any obstacles they may encounter. The article underlines the significance of a stable family environment in nurturing talent effectively.
The author acknowledges that there is always uncertainty regarding whether a player truly has what it takes to succeed at a professional level. They mention Gökhan Inler as an example of a player who surprised them positively in terms of development. However, they also mention Jonas Elmer as potentially wasted talent due to being converted from an attacking player into a defender without apparent reason.
Yann Sommer is praised for his exceptional talent and dedication from an early age when he impressed during training sessions at Basel's youth section. Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka are highlighted for their injury-free performance despite playing with great intensity. Additionally, Xhaka displayed leadership qualities both on and off the field as the squad treasurer.

This news article discusses an upcoming exhibition featuring the works of famous artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The exhibition is curated by Nina Zimmer and will be held at the Kunstmuseum Basel in Switzerland. 
The article highlights one particular painting that will be showcased at the exhibition, called "The Gypsy Girl" or "Summer, 1868". This painting depicts a young woman named Lise Tréhot, who was Renoir's longtime model and muse. It is revealed that she was pregnant during the time this painting was created, which adds an interesting aspect to her expression of weariness and melancholy. The background of the painting is roughly painted, contrasting with the realistic depiction of hands with red veins. The woman's loose hair and slipped blouse go against artistic conventions of the time, capturing a more ordinary and intimate moment.
Despite challenging societal norms in his art, Renoir eventually gained recognition and success through his participation in official art exhibitions like Salon des Beaux Arts. While many Impressionist artists rebelled against prevailing morality and bourgeois lifestyles, Renoir came from a lower middle-class background as a porcelain painter. However, he found support from his artist friends who came from wealthier backgrounds.
Renoir's style is described as Impressionistic with loose brushwork and a pale palette but also drawing inspiration from traditional forms such as portraits, still life paintings, landscapes, and references to renowned artists like Delacroix and da Vinci.
The exhibition aims to showcase outstanding paintings by Renoir from major museum collections in Europe and the US to allow both general audiences and aficionados alike to appreciate these masterpieces together. One notable artwork on display will be "Lise Holding a Bunch of Wild Flowers," which hasn't been seen publicly since the 1920s.
Nina Zimmer expresses her initial worry about securing all desired paintings for the exhibition due to Renoir's popularity among collectors. However, she managed to gain access to important works, including "Woman with Parrot, 1871" from the Guggenheim Museum and a portrait titled "Paul Meunier (The Child in Velvet)" from Marc Le Cœur's family archive. She mentions that this exhibition is an opportunity to provide new insights into Renoir's work and hopes to continue this approach in future exhibitions.
The article also mentions the partnership between Credit Suisse and Kunstmuseum Basel, with Credit Suisse providing support for one special exhibition every year. The Kunstmuseum Basel is known for its extensive collection of paintings and drawings by artists from the Upper Rhine region between 1400 and 1600.
Overall, this news article provides a brief overview of the upcoming Renoir exhibition at Kunstmuseum Basel, highlighting some key artworks to be displayed as well as emphasizing Renoir's artistic style and background. In addition to discussing the specific paintings that will be showcased at the exhibition, the article also delves into Renoir's personal and artistic journey. It mentions how, during his early years as an artist, Renoir faced hardships and relied on financial support from his friends who came from more affluent families. They often lived together and supported each other through their artistic pursuits.
As Renoir gained success as an artist, he started receiving commissions to paint portraits of prominent individuals in Parisian society and was invited to exhibit his works in the salons of wealthy art collectors. This acknowledgment by the bourgeoisie and aristocracy was significant for him, but he maintained a connection with his humble origins and lifestyle by stylizing them in his art rather than completely abandoning them.
The article highlights that while Renoir embraced the rebellious spirit of his artist friends who challenged societal norms, he also found inspiration from traditional forms of art. His Impressionistic style may have been revolutionary for its loose brushwork and pale palette, but he still paid homage to academic artists like Delacroix, Ingres, da Vinci, and Titian. This mix of rebellion against conventions while keeping ties with tradition made Renoir's work distinctive.
Nina Zimmer emphasizes her approach to curating exhibitions at Kunstmuseum Basel by selecting a specific aspect or theme related to well-known artists like Renoir to provide new insights into their work. She believes this allows audiences to see familiar artists in a fresh light.
The article briefly discusses some challenges faced during the preparation of this particular exhibition due to demand for Renoir's paintings among various collections worldwide. Despite initial rejections for certain artworks sought for display, Nina Zimmer managed to secure important pieces through collaboration and support from individuals like Marc Le Cœur, who provided access to documents relating to Renoir's early work.
Furthermore, the partnership between Credit Suisse and Kunstmuseum Basel is highlighted as they resumed their collaboration after a five-year hiatus. Credit Suisse's support enables the museum to host one special exhibition each year, showcasing renowned artists and expanding public access to art.
Overall, this news article provides insights into the upcoming Renoir exhibition at Kunstmuseum Basel and explores various aspects of Renoir's artistic career, his influences, and the challenges encountered during exhibition preparation. It aims to generate intrigue and anticipation for the showcased artworks while highlighting the curator's approach in offering fresh perspectives on well-known artists. 
This news article discusses the European Monetary Union (EMU) crisis and the policy changes that have taken place since then. It highlights that while the development of the crisis in 2011 did not exactly match what was forecasted, it was similar in nature. The crisis was triggered by Greece's worsening fiscal outlook and its inability to implement the EU/IMF consolidation and reform program.
The article explains that fears of a larger default intensified when there were indications that private sector losses with Greek debt restructuring would be significant. This led to "contagion," causing a sell-off in Italian sovereign bonds and increased pressure on bank stocks and bonds, not only in Italy but also across Europe. Southern European countries experienced a "bank-run," as investors withdrew their money from local banks, forcing them to sell assets including government bonds.
At a macroeconomic level, these countries faced a balance of payments crisis where both the government and financial sector were at risk of losing access to external financing. As households transferred capital abroad, this exacerbating situation further. Efforts made by political leaders to stop this spiral failed because commitments made by stronger countries to support crisis-affected nations were insufficient relative to their funding needs.
To prevent an increase in the risk of EMU breakup, decisive intervention by the European Central Bank (ECB) played a crucial role. In December, banks were offered significant loans at attractive rates for an extended period which halted bank runs, reduced pressure on selling sovereign bonds, and stopped funds from being drained out of southern European countries.
The core scenario for 2012 is seen as one of continued crisis containment. It is emphasized that stability relies on having a lender such as ECB acting as the last resort preventing capital flight from occurring once again like it did in 2011 due to high fiscal deficits and large current-account deficits.
Although various funds like the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), G-20 funds or International Monetary Fund (IMF) may become available, the article points out they may not be sufficient to reassure investors. The commitment of the ECB to act as a lender is key to maintaining stability in the short term.
In the longer term, achieving sustainable fiscal deficits and debt levels is crucial. However, this will take time, especially because the Eurozone is likely to experience a prolonged period of slow economic growth. Paradoxically, while establishing an ECB "firewall" reduces fears of contagion should Greece exit from EMU, it simultaneously increases the risk of such an outcome by reducing other governments' willingness to fund "profligate" members.
The article concludes by stating that external pressure on Greece has increased since the ECB's action and that there is now a higher probability for Greece exiting EMU. Although less likely than adherence to EMU, resorting to a local "printing press" has become more plausible for Greece as politicians face mounting pressure.
Overall, this news article provides an assessment of past and potential future scenarios in relation to the EMU crisis and emphasizes the importance of decisive actions by institutions like the European Central Bank in preserving stability within Europe's financial system. 
This news article discusses the pressing need to make significant changes in the approach to sustainable economic development in order to address various global crises and challenges. It highlights that with the world's population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, along with financial crises, growing inequalities, rising carbon emissions, and degraded natural ecosystems, humanity's ecological footprint is reaching its limits.
The article states that while international binding rules would be beneficial in transitioning towards a green economy, it is unlikely that treaties leading to international law will be achieved at the Rio summit. Therefore, it emphasizes the importance of collective efforts between governments, businesses, scientists, politicians, and the world's population. Clear government policies and long-term incentives are necessary for corporations to become part of the solution and take leadership in advancing a green economy.
It mentions that there is an increasing trend of corporations adopting more sustainable business practices due to political urging and as a response to global financial crises and recent natural disasters. The article specifically mentions Credit Suisse as an example of a company that has prioritized environmental and social considerations for over ten years. It highlights their ISO 14001-certified environmental management system which helps them use resources efficiently and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Credit Suisse's Green Business Initiative is also highlighted as an effort to promote renewable energy and cleantech products/services within their organization. The bank also conducts internal risk review processes for transactions with clients who may pose environmental or social risks according to their own policies for sensitive industries.
The article emphasizes that sustainable investing should be integrated into every investment decision process while considering sustainability-related investment risks. In line with this commitment towards sustainability, Credit Suisse launched its "Sustainability Outlook on Rio+20 - Expected Impacts on the Economic System" report prior to Rio+20 summit. This report explores key themes such as sustainable water management food security agriculture oceans' conservation etc., advising on politically-induced growth potential within these areas at Rio+20. The report also explores different funding scenarios for sustainable development policies and identifies potential models such as impact investing. It suggests aligning funding mobilization with global economic recovery, including lifting subsidies and tariffs that hinder investment and market potential.
In addition to the initiatives taken by Credit Suisse, the article mentions the Global "50:50" initiative launched by the World Bank Group. This initiative brings together public and private sector institutions to jointly support factoring natural capital into decision making.
The article concludes by acknowledging that although Rio+20 may not produce tangible measures immediately, it is an opportunity for transformative action from local governments and businesses. Just as Earth Summit 1992 set a blueprint for sustainable development in the 21st century, there is hope that Rio+20 will catalyze meaningful action on the ground rather than relying solely on international declarations and treaties.
Overall, this news article emphasizes the urgent need for a shift towards a green economy due to various global challenges. It highlights corporate efforts such as those made by Credit Suisse but also emphasizes collective actions involving governments, businesses, scientists, politicians, and individuals in order to achieve sustainability goals. 
This news article discusses the implications of using social media in the financial industry, specifically in banking. It explores various possibilities and challenges associated with leveraging social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter for marketing purposes.
The article suggests that social media can provide banks with a competitive advantage by allowing them to quickly understand market trends and consumer sentiment. This real-time information can be valuable in making informed decisions and staying ahead of their competitors. Additionally, it mentions that banks in non-retail sectors can also use social media to build brand awareness and differentiate themselves from their competitors.
The concept of crowdfunding and social lending is also discussed as alternative developments in the industry. These methods require specific social media strategies tailored to different sectors, highlighting the need for a customized approach rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.
However, one challenge mentioned is measuring return on investment (ROI) when investing in social media. The article argues that despite the potential benefits brought by engaged customers who derive greater satisfaction from financial services provided through social media channels, it is difficult to accurately quantify the value generated by these investments due to regulatory constraints and lack of conclusive metrics.
Another viewpoint presented in the article is that traditional advertising methods, such as billboards or television ads, often reach a broader audience than necessary for high-end financial services. In contrast, targeting communications through social media allows firms to focus on engaging prospects who have shown interest by actively choosing to follow or like their pages.
Regulatory hurdles are acknowledged as potential hindrances for financial firms' adoption of social media marketing efforts. However, it is suggested that digital platforms actually make certain compliance requirements easier through automated recording of all digital communications.
The article also highlights how consumers increasingly prefer higher quality services delivered quickly at lower costs through digital means such as mobile devices. It mentions that individuals are more likely to use platforms like Twitter as personalized information sources instead of sharing specific financial account details publicly on Facebook or Twitter statuses.
Overall, this news article emphasizes the potential benefits and challenges associated with utilizing social media in the financial industry. It recognizes the need for tailored strategies, regulatory compliance, and effective measurement of ROI while also acknowledging the opportunities for targeted communication and customer engagement offered by digital platforms. The news article goes on to mention the views of various individuals within the financial industry regarding social media and its impact.
One individual, Yuan Jun Lim, believes that engaged customers are more likely to derive satisfaction from financial services offered through social media. However, there is still debate over whether social media can directly boost a company's bottom line. Lim points out that measuring the return on investment in social media is challenging due to the lack of a direct and viable method to accurately quantify its value.
On the other hand, Maggie O'Toole argues that traditional marketing methods often reach a wider audience than necessary for high-end financial services. She suggests that social media allows for more targeted communication and engagement with prospective customers. By opting in or expressing interest through likes or follows, individuals essentially self-identify as potential customers.
Addressing regulatory concerns, O'Toole notes that some challenges faced by financial firms in using social media may be self-imposed rather than legal constraints. While there may be calls for rules and content review processes, digital platforms actually make meeting certain regulatory requirements easier due to automated recording of all digital communications.
Hugh Jorgensen offers another perspective by highlighting how consumers today seek higher quality service at a faster rate at lower costs. The use of handheld devices has become instrumental in providing this sense of control over their surroundings through the use of their fingers. Jorgensen emphasizes that if he were able to monetize this emotion as a financial service, he would not give it away for free.
Jorgensen also brings up an interesting point about how most people's connection between financial services and social media tends to revolve around more targeted advertising rather than sharing specific details about savings accounts or investments publicly on platforms like Facebook or Twitter. He predicts growth in using platforms like Twitter as highly personalized information sources tailored towards specific interests or industries such as following commodity experts or farmers when investing in certain markets like corn futures.
In conclusion, this news article sheds light on the potential benefits and challenges associated with leveraging social media in the financial industry. It emphasizes the need for tailored strategies, regulatory compliance, accurate measurement of ROI, and the ability to target communications effectively. While there are differing opinions on social media's direct impact on financial firms' bottom line, it is clear that social media platforms offer opportunities for customer engagement and more focused marketing efforts in an increasingly digital world. 
This news article highlights the challenges facing the Swiss financial center and explores potential strategies for its future success. It mentions that financial centers in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Dubai are experiencing growth and facing less international political pressure compared to Switzerland.
One of the main challenges faced by Swiss banks is increasing fiscal pressure on cross-border private banking, as well as declining profitability in private banking. Furthermore, regulatory developments in the US and EU have a significant impact on the Swiss financial center. These developments require Swiss financial institutions to adhere to national rules for market access.
To address these challenges, the report calls for proactive measures from various stakeholders such as financial institutions, policymakers, supervisory authorities, and academics. It emphasizes that embracing a business model based solely on tax-compliant money is essential for success. The regularization of past practices through tax treaties with partner nations is seen as indispensable.
The report suggests setting up a withholding tax agreement on future capital gains generated from assets invested in Switzerland as a sensible approach. It also argues that Swiss banks should take advantage of opportunities presented by domestic companies' banking needs. Currently, only a small portion of these transactions are captured by Swiss banks.
Additionally, there is potential for increased market share in trade finance since Swiss exports account for 54% of GDP. The report also identifies corporate financing and funding innovative companies or start-ups as areas where Swiss banks can expand their presence.
In terms of retail and private banking clients within Switzerland itself, there are opportunities to develop electronic and mobile banking products and services. Encouraging appropriate national legislation would enable leveraging these opportunities effectively.
The article mentions philanthropy, microfinance sustainable investments, impact investing as potential areas where Swiss banks can broaden their product offerings. Attracting investment managers like hedge funds and fund administration to relocate in Switzerland is another avenue worth exploring.
Swiss banks should improve access to new growth markets located in Asia, the Middle East,and Latin America by expanding their local presence in the region. The article highlights the need for investment in infrastructure to handle complex financial flows between developed and emerging markets.
Furthermore, Switzerland could aim to become the data and infrastructure backbone of the global financial services industry. This would require investing in reliable technical infrastructure and business systems for data storage and processing.
Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner presented a reform agenda called "Switzerland as a Financial Center" to initiate a constructive debate among all relevant stakeholders. The proposed measures aim to create a stable environment and avoid excessive regulation.
In conclusion, this news article discusses the challenges faced by Swiss banks, including fiscal pressure, eroding profitability, and increasing regulatory demands. It suggests various strategies for Swiss banks to remain competitive, such as focusing on tax-compliant money, regularizing past practices through tax treaties, expanding market share in various banking sectors (trade finance, corporate financing), developing innovative products/services like electronic/mobile banking or impact investing,and expanding into new growth markets globally. Ultimately,the goal is to strengthen Switzerland's position as a financial center through structural changes and collaboration between private sector players and government entities.
 
This news article discusses the current economic situation in Switzerland and its impact on interest rates. The forecasts from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and major economic research institutes indicate negative growth for the current year, with only marginal increases in inflation over the next two years. If these predictions turn out to be accurate, Switzerland would be one of the few countries in the world to continue offering positive net yields.
Since August 2011, investors have accepted negative yields at auctions of Swiss government money market claims. Recently, these yields reached -0.79 percent. The article raises the question of why investors would choose to accept negative yields not just in money market investments but also for longer-term investments. The answer is multifaceted.
Firstly, there has been a renewed rise in risk aversion among investors due to concerns about Greece and Spain's debt problems. This has led to a flight towards secure investments such as Swiss francs. Secondly, from non-Swiss investors' perspective, investing in Swiss francs provides diversification for their portfolios. Additionally, passively managed assets contribute to this phenomenon of negative yields because they tend to stick with their positions regardless of price.
Another contributing factor is the flow of funds into indexed products, which is met with relatively illiquid markets. This compels investors with passively managed portfolios to invest at unsustainable yield levels. In recent years, the Swiss Federal Finance Administration has repaid more debt than it has issued government bonds for sale—a result that leads to a scarcity of available bonds.
In this context, active portfolio management offers flexibility advantages since an active investor or asset manager can employ strategic structuring and more flexible allocation based on duration and credit spreads beyond what would be permitted for passive portfolios. This enables them greater chances of generating higher returns than those offered by passive investment models.
The article concludes by discussing whether Swiss franc interest rates will continue falling or if there will be a change in direction. The author expresses confidence that the SNB is both able and willing to maintain the minimum CHF/EUR exchange rate of 1.2, which was set in September 2011. This commitment has been reaffirmed by the SNB after its recent assessment of monetary policy.
The Euroswiss futures market further supports the credibility of the SNB's monetary policy, as it implies negative money market interest rates for at least another two years. However, due to ongoing market tensions, the author suggests that the SNB may need to make significant efforts to defend this exchange rate. It is noted that sight deposits from banks with the SNB have increased by approximately CHF 37 billion since mid-May, indicating a potential deployment of funds required to defend this exchange rate.
Overall, given these circumstances and increasing market tensions, it is believed that the prospect for further drops in interest rates has diminished while there is an elevated risk of rising interest rates on the horizon.
 The article suggests that the current economic situation in Switzerland, as indicated by negative growth forecasts and marginal inflation increases, has created a unique circumstance where the country still offers positive net yields compared to many other countries worldwide. This is significant because in most cases, investors expect to receive positive returns on their investments rather than accepting negative yields.
The fact that investors are willing to accept negative yields in Swiss government money market claims and potentially for longer-term investments begs the question of why they would choose such options. The answer lies in a combination of factors. Firstly, there has been a surge in risk aversion among investors due to concerns over the debt problems faced by Greece and Spain. In times of uncertainty, secure investments such as Swiss francs become more attractive.
Secondly, for non-Swiss investors, investing in Swiss francs serves as a diversification element within their portfolios. By including assets denominated in different currencies like the Swiss franc, they can reduce their exposure to risks associated with any one particular currency or country's economic performance.
Passively managed assets also contribute to the phenomenon of negative yields because these types of investment funds typically do not actively adjust their positions based on market conditions or price fluctuations. Instead, they maintain fixed allocations regardless of changes happening around them.
Another factor driving negative yields is the flow of funds into indexed products combined with relatively illiquid markets. Indexed products aim to replicate certain market indexes or benchmarks and invest accordingly. As more money pours into these products, it creates a demand for underlying assets even if prices are not attractive from an investor's perspective. This forces passive portfolios into accepting lower yields that may not be sustainable over time.
Furthermore, Switzerland has seen a situation where its federal finance administration has repaid more debt than issuing new government bonds for sale leads to limited availability of government bonds for purchase—creating scarcity.
In this context, active portfolio management becomes advantageous because it allows greater flexibility compared to passively managed portfolios. Active investors or asset managers can make strategic decisions to structure their investments and allocate their assets with more flexibility in terms of duration (the period until a bond matures) and credit spreads (the yield difference between bonds with different credit ratings). This can potentially generate higher returns than the passive investment model.
The article then shifts focus to whether Swiss franc interest rates will continue falling or if there might be a change in direction. The author expresses confidence in the SNB's ability and willingness to maintain the minimum CHF/EUR exchange rate of 1.2, which was established back in September 2011. This commitment has been reiterated by the SNB following its recent assessment of monetary policy.
Additionally, the Euroswiss futures market provides further evidence that supports the credibility of the SNB's monetary policy. The market implies negative money market interest rates for at least another two years, indicating that investors expect this to be maintained.
However, given ongoing tensions within financial markets, it is likely that defending this exchange rate will require significant efforts from the SNB. Sight deposits from banks held by the central bank have increased by approximately CHF 37 billion since mid-May, signaling potential large-scale funds necessary to uphold this minimum exchange rate.
In conclusion, based on these dynamics and considering escalating market tensions, it is suggested that while further drops in interest rates may not be imminent, there is now an increased risk of rising interest rates as circumstances evolve. 
This news article discusses the career and performance of the young violinist Vilde Frang, who recently won a prestigious music prize. The article highlights her talent, maturity, and growth as a musician over the past few years.
The article starts by mentioning how winning this prize can launch a musician's career, as seen in the case of cellist Sol Gabetta. On the other hand, it can also expose the limits of a young musician. However, in the history of this particular prize, there haven't been any negative examples. It only showcases nuances between high and very highest levels.
Vilde Frang is described as someone who doesn't believe in perfection but instead strives to do better after every concert. She prefers taking risks while playing and accepting minor errors rather than aiming for perfection. This attitude has made her performances unique and captivating.
The focus then shifts to Frang's performance of Jean Sibelius' Violin Concerto in D minor at the Lucerne Culture and Convention Center. The article mentions that she had previously recorded this piece for EMI with another orchestra but now delivers a perfect rendition with conductor Bernard Haitink at this concert.
Frang's interpretation is described as having tension, emotionality, fire, ice- strength and silence - making it poetic and captivating for the audience. Despite any possible errors during her performance being unnoticed by most listeners.
It is mentioned that Frang debuted at the Lucerne Festival performing Sibelius' work back in 2009 with pianist Julien Quentin. This performance was inspired by an earlier experience where she reached the final but didn't win at Eurovision Young Musicians contest held in Lucerne in 2004.
The article then explores how Frang sees music as constantly evolving just like love does throughout life experiences and phases. She associates Sibelius' music with melancholy and desolation which resonates with her upbringing in Nordic landscapes even though she currently lives in Munich.
Overall, the article highlights Frang's growth as a musician and how her unique interpretation captures the emotions and essence of Sibelius' music. It also mentions her previous experiences, both successful and not-so-successful, which have shaped her musical journey. The article then mentions that Vilde Frang's performance of Sibelius' music is deeply influenced by her Nordic upbringing and the landscapes she associates with it. This connection to her identity adds another layer of depth and emotion to her interpretation.
It is mentioned that Frang debuted at the Lucerne Festival in 2009, where she performed Sibelius' three humoresques among other works, alongside pianist Julien Quentin. This performance was particularly significant for Frang as it followed a less successful experience at the Eurovision Young Musicians contest in Lucerne back in 2004.
Although not winning the contest, Frang made a positive impression on Michael Haefliger, who was a jury member of that competition and also serves as the Artistic and Executive Director of the Lucerne Festival. This encounter proved to be crucial for her musical future.
The article emphasizes that success does not always come immediately or through every endeavor but sometimes through learning from failure. Frang's earlier experience in Lucerne may not have been considered a failure in itself, but it ultimately became an important stepping stone towards her success as a musician.
In conclusion, this news article portrays Vilde Frang as an exceptional violinist with immense talent and maturation over time. Her unique interpretation of Sibelius' music showcases her ability to evoke emotions and captivate audiences. Despite setbacks early on in her career, she has persevered and continued to evolve both musically and personally.
Through her performances, Frang combines technical excellence with an emotional connection rooted in her Nordic upbringing. Her development as a musician is perceived as an ongoing process rather than striving for perfection alone.
Overall, this article celebrates Vilde Frang's achievement while shedding light on the journey she has taken thus far. It highlights how dedication, growth from past experiences, individuality in interpretation, and personal connection contribute to making remarkable musicians like Vilde Frang. 
This news article discusses the evolution and history of drive-through banking and its relationship to the fast food industry. It highlights the claim made by Jack in the Box, a fast food chain founded by Robert Oscar Peterson, that they opened the world's first drive-through restaurant in San Diego in 1951, thus inventing the fast food industry.
The article notes that while drive-through restaurants became popular in the US, it was actually Dallas, Texas that saw the opening of the first drive-through bank in 1938. The Hillcrest State Bank is credited with introducing this new type of banking facility. In Switzerland, drive-through banking also gained popularity quickly with notable success at Paradeplatz.
However, as traffic congestion increased and preferences shifted over time, drive-through banking began to decline. In 1983, SKA (Swiss Credit Management AG) finally ended its experiment with drive-through banks due to lack of profitability caused by decreased customer interest.
Despite this decline in Switzerland, America still maintains a strong culture of using drive-throughs for various services including banking. Major banks like Citibank,Bank of America,Bank One continue to offer nationwide options for customers through their ATMs or even traditional counter services accessible from a driver's window.
The article also mentions Asia as an up-and-coming market where drive-through banks are gaining traction due to increased car ownership rates. Additionally,it highlights how technology is now merging two concepts: McDonald's has partnered with British Telecom to provide wireless broadband access zones at some UK locations. This allows customers who are eating at McDonald's restaurants to use their own devices for internet banking and other online activities while enjoying their meal.
Finally,the author humorously adds that this trend could potentially give rise to ketchup-resistant notebooks as people may accidentally spill condiments on their devices while multitasking between eating and managing their finances.
In summary,this article explores how drive-thrus have become prevalent not only within fast-food establishments but also in the banking industry. It charts the history of drive-through banking from its early roots in the US to its decline and potential resurgence in Switzerland and other markets around the world. The article also highlights how advancements in technology, such as wireless internet access, are further merging fast food and banking services for convenience-seeking customers. The article raises an interesting question regarding which came first: the drive-through bank or the drive-through restaurant. While Jack in the Box claims to have pioneered the concept of a drive-through restaurant in 1951, records show that drive-through banks actually opened much earlier, with the first one opening in Dallas, Texas in 1938.
This discussion about the timing of these innovations leads to a reflection on the history and impact of fast food and banking. The article mentions that drive-through banking lagged behind fast food by approximately 13 years. This highlights the significance and influence that fast food had on shaping consumer behavior and expectations.
It is also worth noting how both industries capitalized on America's love affair with cars. The rise of car culture provided fertile ground for these businesses to flourish, allowing people to conveniently access their meals or conduct financial transactions without leaving their vehicles.
However, while drive-through restaurants continued to thrive in America, especially amidst a busy lifestyle and reliance on convenience, Switzerland faced challenges with its own drive-through banking model due to growing traffic congestion in downtown Zurich during the '70s. As a result, fewer customers were willing to make pit stops at underground bank locations for cash withdrawals.
Nevertheless,the article suggests that technological advancements have breathed new life into this concept.It cites examples like ATMs,making payment transactions by mail or phone banking as alternate ways through which customers access banking services beyond traditional branches.The potential resurgence of drive-thru banks is also highlighted,suggesting that Swiss customers may once again embrace this convenient form of service delivery if modernization is introduced and traffic concerns are addressed.

In conclusion, the article provides a historical overview of drive-through banking and its connection to the fast food industry. It sheds light on the different timelines for their emergence and highlights the enduring popularity of drive-through services in America. It also considers how technological advancements continue to reshape traditional methods of service delivery and explores potential opportunities for growth in different markets. 
This news article is about the Credit Suisse Young Artist Award, which was established in 2000 by Credit Suisse, the Vienna Philharmonic, the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Wien, and the Lucerne Festival. The purpose of this award is to support young musical talent and invest in the future of music at an international level.
The article mentions that this award is not a competition in the conventional sense. Instead, five jury members each nominate one candidate for consideration. The decision-making process involves an hour-long recital covering various musical epochs and an interview. The jury then reaches a verdict through open discussion.
In 2012, violinist Vilde Frang was selected as the winner of the award unanimously by the jury. Pamela Rosenberg, former Artistic Director of the Berlin Philharmonic and one of the jury members, praised Frang for her range of colors in playing at a young age and her expressive power and stylistic assurance.
Frang expresses her appreciation for receiving this prestigious award and describes it as something different from other awards or scholarships she has received before. She feels honored to perform at THIS Festival (referring to Lucerne Festival) with THIS orchestra (referring to Vienna Philharmonic), under a conductor whom she admires greatly.
Frang had been associated with Lucerne Festival since she was a student studying under Kolja Blacher, Concertmaster of Lucerne Festival Orchestra. An opportunity to perform with Vienna Philharmonic is particularly special to her as she grew up listening to their recordings.
One reason cited by Peter Hagmann (another jury member) for Frang's victory is her innate sense of musicality in contemporary repertoire – an aspect that resonates with Lucerne Festival's support for new music as well as young artists.
The article also provides some background on Frang's musical journey. Being born into a family where her father was a professional double-bass player influenced her initial inclination towards that instrument. However, her father decided that they couldn't fit three double-basses into their small family car, so she started learning the violin instead. Frang picked up the violin at the age of four and immediately felt connected to it. At 11 years old, she caught the attention of renowned violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, who became a mentor in Frang's life.
Overall, this news article highlights the significance of the Credit Suisse Young Artist Award and introduces Vilde Frang as its recipient in 2012. It also provides insights into Frang's musical background and her excitement for performing at Lucerne Festival with Vienna Philharmonic. Continuing with the explanation of the news article, it emphasizes Frang's unique approach to music and her ability to communicate emotions through her performances. Peter Hagmann, a jury member, recognizes Frang's power in conveying not only classical pieces like Mozart and Bach but also contemporary repertoire like Lutoslawski. He believes that an artist should not just play the music but also recognize its value, fill it with emotion, and communicate something personal to the audience – all of which Frang accomplishes in a remarkable way.
Frang's passion for music stems from a young age. Despite not finding practice itself intriguing, she always enjoyed playing. At the age of 11, getting noticed by Anne-Sophie Mutter was a turning point in her career as Mutter became a mentor figure who supported and guided her musical journey. It was Mutter's Freundeskreis Stiftung that provided Frang with the violin she plays - a 19th-century Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume.
The article concludes by acknowledging that Frang's story is still unfolding; there is much more ahead for her in establishing herself as an accomplished violinist. However, winning the Credit Suisse Young Artist Award is seen as a significant milestone for her career – one that will help elevate her status on both national and international platforms.
Overall, this news article celebrates Vilde Frang's accomplishment of winning the prestigious Credit Suisse Young Artist Award in 2012. It highlights her talent, dedication to music, and emotive performances while also shedding light on her musical upbringing and influences. The article portrays this award as not just another recognition but rather an exceptional opportunity for young artists like Frang to showcase their skills on renowned stages with esteemed orchestras like Vienna Philharmonic at esteemed festivals like Lucerne Festival.
 
This news article discusses the changing patterns in life expectancy and retirement in Switzerland, as well as the challenges these changes pose to the country's pension system. It highlights the need for reforms to secure pensions for future generations.
The article starts by stating that life expectancy is currently 73.7 years for men and 76.8 years for women. This increase in life expectancy means that traditional boundaries between different stages of life are becoming blurred, including the lines between education and gainful employment, as well as work and retirement.
Despite these changing patterns, the regulatory framework of Switzerland's AHV (Old Age and Survivors Insurance) has been slow to adapt to these changes. The article argues that this is surprising considering the forecasted aging population trends.
The ratio of older people to people of working age is increasing steadily over time, which will place a growing strain on AHV and potentially lead to deficits. While Switzerland still performs well compared to other countries with its three-pillar retirement provision system (including occupational and private pension schemes), it may still need reforms.
In many OECD countries, people will need to work longer before they can retire. However, little has changed in Switzerland since increasing the retirement age for women from 62 to 64 years old under a previous revision.
To secure pensions in the long term for future generations, reforms can be focused either on funding or benefits within AHV. Funding discussions often center around increasing either wages or taxes (such as value-added tax) but both have potential negative impacts on competitiveness or private consumption costs respectively.
On the benefits side, adjusting pension standards may help somewhat with limiting expenses but doesn't address the overall burden on active generations due to more retirees within a pay-as-you-go system. To counteract this burden sustainably requires adjusting the mathematical ratio between those receiving pensions and those contributing - raising or making flexible upwards towards a higher statutory retirement age is seen as inevitable according to experts cited in the article.
The article suggests implementing a debt brake for social insurance and utilizing automated processes to support these changes. It also notes that extending the length of working life is no longer a revolutionary idea, as more and more people in Switzerland are continuing to work past retirement age.
While the trend towards early retirement has weakened, there is still a substantial number of workers who would like to continue working. The job market, however, lacks a systematic human resources policy to address this need. Employers will have to reconsider their position and create more flexible conditions to benefit from the experience and expertise of older workers.
In conclusion, this article emphasizes the need for reforms in Switzerland's AHV system due to changing life expectancy patterns and an aging population. Reforms could focus on funding or benefits but addressing the growing burden on active generations requires adjusting retirement age ratios or making it flexible upwards. Implementing policies that encourage older workers' employment by leveraging their skills and experience is also seen as essential for addressing future workforce challenges caused by aging staff demographics. 
The news article discusses the digital edition of Alfred Escher's letters, which is considered a significant achievement in historical research. The project was led by Professor Joseph Jung and supported by project managers Daniel Hochstrasser and Bruno Fischer.
The goal of the project initially focused on creating online editions of letters from other famous individuals, such as composer Carl Maria von Weber and painter Vincent van Gogh. However, through interdisciplinary cooperation that even involved assistance from a theoretical physicist, the team exceeded this objective.

One example is Daniele Muscionico's article in renowned German weekly "Die Zeit," in which she discusses the tragic fate of Alfred Escher's daughter, Lydia. Muscionico refers to Joseph Jung's 2008 biography, titled "Lydia Welti-Escher," which delves into Lydia's life and her passionate opinions. The book reveals new details about her scandalous affair with painter Karl Stauffer-Bern, indirectly implicating Federal Councillor Welti in the controversy. Additionally, Jung had previously exposed mismanagement of funds by the government-administered Gottfried Keller Foundation, an organization Lydia was involved with.
During his address at the vernissage event, Professor Joseph Jung acclaimed Alfred Escher as "the Swiss citizen who has had the greatest impact on his country." His statement found support in an endorsement from the "Basler Zeitung" newspaper that equated Escher's influence with that of Jacob Burckhardt—an esteemed contemporary thinker—concluding that he was a great man indeed.

This news article discusses the economic situation in Switzerland and provides forecasts for various aspects of the economy for the current year.
The article starts by mentioning that Switzerland has a low burden of debt, which allows the government to have some flexibility in managing its finances. This has been especially beneficial at the regional and municipal levels. Overall, Switzerland's economic output increased by about 1 percent last year, and it is expected that this year there may be a slightly higher pace of growth.
One area that is likely to experience significant acceleration is exports. After stagnation last year, export volume is predicted to increase by 4 percent this year. There are two main factors contributing to this growth. First, there is better demand abroad, which will stimulate export sales. Second, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) is expected to continue successfully defending the lower limit set for the euro exchange rate. This combined with higher inflation abroad may result in steady real depreciation of the Swiss franc. As a result, costs will rise more gradually for Swiss-based companies compared to their foreign competitors.
Additionally, Swiss exporters are increasingly shifting their focus towards dynamically growing regions such as Asia instead of relying solely on crisis-hit Europe. However, complete decoupling from Europe is not expected due to close economic interconnections between regions.
Capital expenditure is also predicted to accelerate slightly this year due to low-interest rates and favorable investment conditions created by governmental policies aimed at stimulating growth. Despite these favorable conditions, uncertainties surrounding business operations and below-average rates of capacity utilization continue to constrain companies' capital expenditures.
In terms of construction investment, there was a drop last year but it's expected to show positive growth (2 percent) this year compared to negative growth in previous years. However temporary rather than long-term effect reversal seems likely due volatile revenue trends experienced in construction industry over recent years.
Private consumption remains an important driver of economic growth but experts predict a slight downturn in its dynamism compared to the previous year. Factors contributing to this slight weakening include a decline in immigration rates, a slight increase in unemployment, and rising inflation that may negate nominal wage gains. Additionally, it is suggested that consumers may have made some purchases ahead of time last year due to dropping prices, which could dampen demand for 2013.
The article also mentions that the government is expected to increase its consumer spending at a slower pace than in the previous year. The predicted slowdown from 2 percent growth last year to 1.5 percent this year is seen as reasonable since an expanding public sector can hinder long-term competitiveness.
Despite these various factors and predictions, it's worth noting that the era of falling prices seems to be over in Switzerland as import prices due to a strong Swiss franc have already been passed on partially to end customers through lower prices. As there has been no significant increase in the value of Swiss franc due to the euro exchange limit set by SNB, further price advantages are not expected going forward.
Overall, experts predict mild inflation conditions with an average inflation rate of 0.4 percent for 2013.
In conclusion, this news article provides an overview of Switzerland's economic situation and forecasts for various sectors such as exports, capital expenditure, construction investment, and private consumption for the current year. It highlights both positive growth prospects and challenges faced by different sectors of the Swiss economy. 
The news article is discussing the potential for the Philippines to receive an investment-grade credit rating in 2013. The article highlights that leaders in the Philippines as well as foreign banks are confident about this possibility. According to Credit Suisse economist Santitarn Sathirathai, the Philippines had previously fallen off people's radar due to governance problems and political instability. However, Sathirathai believes that the country's assets, such as untapped mining resources and a youthful population, were overlooked.
The article mentions that foreign direct investment in the Philippines has been relatively low in recent years, averaging around $2 billion per year. With increased visibility from investors now that the country is back on their radar, there could be a significant impact on investment levels.
Several factors contribute to this positive outlook for the Philippines. The government has signed a preliminary peace agreement with Muslim rebels, potentially ending a long insurgency and improving the investment climate. The current leader, Benigno Aquino III, has pledged to crack down on corruption charges initiated during Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's presidency. These efforts aim to inspire investor confidence.
Additionally, with many English speakers and a focus on services like business process outsourcing (BPO), the Philippines has an opportunity to compete with China for manufacturing jobs amidst rising labor costs in China. Japanese companies have already been increasing their investments via organizations like the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), which promotes investment in export-producing industries.
Furthermore, public-private partnerships are being pursued by the government to enhance or expand expressways, airports, and schools. Real estate developers are also targeting a growing middle class and wealthy Filipinos interested in prestige properties.
Despite these developments and opportunities for growths such as tourism—given its beautiful beaches—the article acknowledges challenges ahead for the Philippines due to its relative lag compared to neighboring countries. Issues like worn-out airports and poor telecommunications infrastructure hinder business growth according to Filipino entrepreneur J. Alfonso de Dios, who operates in both China and the Philippines.
Tourism is another area that the Philippines could improve infrastructure for, as currently less than 2 percent of GDP revenue comes from this sector compared to countries like Thailand or Malaysia where it contributes around 7 to 8 percent. The Philippine government has launched a new tourism campaign aimed at attracting visitors with the slogan "It's More Fun in the Philippines." The upcoming opening of a big casino complex in Manila Bay is also expected to contribute to tourism growth. However, some experts suggest diversifying with additional attractions like theme parks or targeting middle-class Asian families.
Lastly, considering the ongoing territorial dispute between China and the Philippines, there is an emphasis on attracting Chinese tourists who currently prefer destinations like Thailand and Indonesia. With substantial investments being made in gaming resorts, there is hope that Chinese tourists will visit. Experts emphasize that maintaining good relations with China will be crucial for tourism success.
In conclusion, while challenges remain such as infrastructure deficiencies and a relatively small share of revenue from tourism, many see significant potential for investment and growth in the Philippines. Various factors such as improved governance, peace agreements with rebels, opportunities in manufacturing jobs due to rising labor costs in China, public-private partnerships for development projects, focus on real estate expansion for middle-class Filipinos along with foreign investments aligning with these developments contribute to an optimistic outlook for investment-grade credit rating prospects in the country. 
The article discusses the current state of Australia's mining sector and the potential decline it may be facing. The mining sector contributes nearly 9% to the country's GDP, but recent data shows that overall economic growth has slowed, despite interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
Greg Evans, Chief Economist at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, emphasizes that it is important for the rest of the economy to become more effective in order to maintain and lock in the benefits gained from the mining boom. This suggests a shift towards other sectors becoming crucial for sustaining economic growth in Australia.
One such sector is startups, like Canva, which are aiming to become global businesses right from their inception. Canva, a design platform that allows non-designers to create various design projects, plans to launch simultaneously in Australia and the US. This reflects a growing trend among Australian startups that aspire to have a global presence.
However, funding remains a challenge for these startups as Australian venture capital activity has declined due to concerns about global economic conditions. Despite this decline, there has been an increase in venture investments received by Australian companies. Some successful startups have managed to attract significant amounts of capital from foreign venture capital firms.
While Sydney ranks highly as an active startup hub globally, it falls short when it comes to access to venture capital compared with other cities on this list. Funding often comes from entrepreneurs themselves or friends and family instead of traditional VC firms.
Niki Scevak from Blackbird Ventures acknowledges this gap in Series A funding (which typically ranges between AUD 1 million - AUD 10 million) and highlights the need for more VC firms supporting these startups with global potential. Blackbird Ventures aims at investing in five - ten Australian tech companies each year but only those with international prospects.
Canva serves as an example for other aspiring startups due to its previous success with Fusion Books and recent seed funding raised from investors like Google Maps creator Lars Rasmussen. The company has even attracted attention from prominent figures like Sir Richard Branson, emphasizing its potential for global success.
In conclusion, the article suggests that Australia needs to diversify its economy beyond the mining sector and pay attention to the potential of startups in driving economic growth. However, access to venture capital funding remains a challenge for these startups, and more support from VC firms is needed to help them succeed on a global scale. The article goes on to talk about the success of Genero.tv, a crowdsourced online video platform based in Melbourne. Genero.tv allows filmmakers to create music videos or promotional films for artists and brands. The company has partnered with major music labels such as Sony, Warner Bros., and Universal Music Group, as well as brands like Yoplait and MillerCoors. Their videos have been featured at renowned events such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Cannes International Film Festival, and the British Film Institute.
The founders of Genero.tv initially self-funded their venture until January 2012 when they received external funding. Despite starting with just two co-founders, the company has managed to establish itself successfully in the competitive global market for online video production.
The article also mentions other Australian startups that have attracted significant capital from foreign venture capital firms. For example, BigCommerce is a Melbourne-based startup that creates online stores for small and medium-sized businesses. It has processed nearly AUD 1 billion in transactions and recently secured a $20 million investment from General Catalyst Partners and Floodgate.
Similarly, Atlassian is an enterprise software company headquartered in Sydney that raised an impressive $60 million Series A round in 2010 from Palo Alto-based Accel Partners. These success stories highlight the potential of Australian startups to attract external funding despite challenges faced by many entrepreneurs.
Overall, while Australia's mining sector may be peaking and experiencing slower growth rates, there is optimism surrounding its startup ecosystem. The country's major cities Sydney and Melbourne are recognized as promising tech hubs globally with high entrepreneurship activity levels.
However, there remains a significant need for increased access to venture capital funding specifically at the Series A stage. Entrepreneurs often struggle to raise meaningful investments ranging from AUD 1 million - AUD 10 million necessary to scale their businesses further.
Despite this challenge, there is enthusiasm among Australia's young graduates who are increasingly considering entrepreneurship as a viable career path. Startups like Canva are leading the way by aiming for global success right from their inception, demonstrating the potential and ambition of Australian entrepreneurs.
In conclusion, Australia's startup scene is gaining recognition and attracting investor attention globally. However, more investment activity and support from venture capital firms is needed to bridge the funding gap and enable startups to scale successfully on an international level. 
The news article discusses the sport of rowing and follows the perspective of a rower named Cornelia. It emphasizes the physical demands and technical requirements of rowing, as well as the mental focus and concentration that are necessary for success in the sport.
Rowing is portrayed as a strenuous sport that requires skill, coordination, and teamwork. The article highlights the importance of smooth, harmonious movements in order to maintain balance and stay on course. Cornelia explains that jerky movements can disrupt the delicate balance of the boat. This suggests that rowing is not as easy or monotonous as it may seem from afar.
While rowers' cyclical motions may induce a meditative state, Cornelia states that she must remain fully concentrated on her physical movements and be present in the moment. Daydreaming or being distracted could cause her to lose focus and deviate from their intended course.
The article also mentions how rowers primarily face backward, looking at their point of departure rather than where they are headed. Only when they turn around after about five kilometers do they have a chance to relax briefly and appreciate their surroundings – such as sunrises, snow-covered mountains, or families of swans – before returning back to their starting point.
Cornelia's dedication to rowing is highlighted through her commitment to early morning training sessions. She enjoys being outdoors for training but also utilizes indoor rowing machines during stormy weather. Despite waking up early every day for training, she claims not to get tired because she values sleep-ins on weekends.
Furthermore, Cornelia explains her involvement in various types of boats within different teams at Zurich Rowing Club. Each boat type offers unique challenges and experiences which allow her continuous learning opportunities. While competing in regattas is not currently one of her goals due to increased training requirements, she occasionally participates in friendly competitions with a focus on improving technique rather than winning.
Lastly, teamwork is emphasized as a crucial aspect of rowing. Cornelia mentions that coordination with her teammates is essential, describing the importance of pulling together and coordinating movements in a synchronized manner.
Overall, the article provides insights into the physical and mental aspects of rowing, as well as Cornelia's passion for the sport and her commitment to continuous improvement. It highlights the discipline required in terms of technique, coordination, and teamwork while also acknowledging the beauty and sense of accomplishment that come with successful rowing experiences. The article also sheds light on Cornelia's introduction to rowing and her journey as a rower. She was first introduced to the sport during a team event eight years ago. Immediately captivated by the fresh air and fascinated by the technical requirements of rowing, she underwent basic training and subsequently joined the Zurich Rowing Club.
Since then, Cornelia has been dedicated to her training routine, which primarily takes place in the mornings. Whether it's on the water or using an indoor rowing machine, she ensures that she devotes herself to improving her skills and performance.
Cornelia explains that rowing offers a variety of boats for training and competition. Her favorite is the eight, which is known for its efficiency in energy usage and speed across the lake. Additionally, she trains with different boats throughout the week like double sculls, pairs (using one oar), fours or quadruple sculls. On occasion, she also ventures out alone in a single boat referred to as a skiff.
She highlights how each type of boat presents unique challenges and opportunities for growth - this keeps her engaged, constantly learning new techniques while striving for more control over particular boats such as skiffs.
While Cornelia acknowledges that participating in regattas requires more intense training sessions along with additional time spent at weight rooms, it remains not one of her primary goals at present. Instead, she focuses on improving her technique through friendly competitions while maintaining an enjoyable journey of constant self-improvement.
Working within a team is one aspect that truly appeals to Cornelia about rowing. She expresses how crucial coordination is among teammates compared to sports like basketball or football where individual performance may be prioritized more heavily.
In conclusion, this news article provides an intimate portrayal of Cornelia's dedication to rowing as well as insights into various aspects of this strenuous yet rewarding sport. It emphasizes not only physical fitness but also mental focus and teamwork necessary for success. By sharing Cornelia's experiences, the article offers readers a glimpse into the challenges and joys of rowing while highlighting its potential as an engaging and fulfilling recreational or competitive pursuit. 
This news article discusses the currency strategies and policies of major global economies, particularly the US, EU, Japan, and Britain. The report argues against claims of substantial manipulation in these economies' exchange rates and instead emphasizes the experimental monetary policies implemented to boost domestic demand.
According to Anezka Christovova, a currency strategist at Credit Suisse, there is no evidence to support significant manipulation by these G4 economies in the past year. The report dismisses any talk suggesting otherwise as "much ado about nothing." Instead, the article suggests that these economies have been implementing increasingly experimental monetary policies aimed at stimulating their respective domestic demands.
The article highlights the massive asset-buying programs undertaken by both the United States and Japan as examples of these non-conventional policies. These programs have become necessary due to previous attempts at lowering interest rates in response to global recession failing to revive stagnant economies.
While such policies have had an impact on exchange rates, Deverell and Christovova from Credit Suisse argue that this has not been their primary focus. They mention that when considering real effective terms - considering trade-weighted values - currencies like the dollar, yen, euro and sterling are within 10 percent of their 30-year average. Therefore, they conclude there is little evidence suggesting current exchange rates are significantly out of equilibrium.
However, they do note that based on Credit Suisse's fair value model; only one currency stands out as significantly undervalued - Chinese RMB (renminbi).
Furthermore, it is highlighted that not just emerging market currencies but even troubled ones like Eurozone's euro had been appreciating before Cyprus announced a bailout plan. This situation had raised concerns regarding European exporters being negatively affected by a strong currency further delaying recovery efforts.
Credit Suisse attributes this strength in the euro partly due to reductions in size for European Central Bank's balance sheet as banks within Eurozone began repaying emergency loans taken from ECB during the region's financial turmoil. Simultaneously, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and Bank of Japan (BOJ) are expanding their balance sheets through asset-buying programs, effectively adding upward pressure on the euro.
The article forecasts that with the Fed buying $85 billion in assets monthly and BOJ accelerating government bond purchases to nearly 84 trillion yen this year, there is potential for the euro to reach $1.40 in value within a year.
Nonetheless, Credit Suisse notes that the eurozone faces downside risks due to worsening economic conditions. The latest Markit composite purchasing managers' index indicates a contraction in manufacturing and services sectors.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has not ruled out an interest rate cut at the ECB's policy meeting in May and has also left open possibilities for "non-standard measures" like bond purchases to revive Eurozone's economy.
Considering these factors, Credit Suisse warns that emerging market policymakers who intervene to stabilize exchange rates may not remain passive bystanders. They argue that with major economies expected to continue quantitative easing programs throughout 2013, emerging markets may resort to "dirty floats" - actively managing their exchange rates - possibly becoming even more assertive over time.
In conclusion, this news article delves into currency strategies of major global economies and dispels claims of substantial manipulation while emphasizing experimental monetary policies aimed at boosting domestic demand. It discusses factors impacting currency values such as reduced ECB balance sheet size juxtaposed against expansions from Fed and BOJ. Additionally, it highlights potential risks faced by Eurozone due to deteriorating economic conditions and suggests increased assertiveness by emerging markets regarding their exchange rate policies amid continued quantitative easing by major economies. 
This news article discusses the role and responsibilities of a relationship manager in private banking, specifically within Credit Suisse. The relationship manager's main focus is on analyzing and managing the asset allocation of their clients and staying informed about trends in the equity and bond markets.
The article emphasizes the proactive approach adopted by relationship managers in order to cater to their clients' needs effectively. By staying on top of their clients' latest demands, relationship managers can build stronger relationships with them, seek new business opportunities, and outpace competitors. This involves starting work early in the morning to review market news and client emails before heading into the office at 7:00 a.m.
Once at work, the relationship manager typically begins by reading morning newspapers over coffee at a nearby restaurant. They then embark on planning their day by prioritizing calls and emails as necessary. Throughout the day, they focus largely on responding to incoming communications from their clients while also reaching out proactively when required.
It is important for relationship managers to be flexible as each working day is often shaped by their clients' needs. If clients are engaged in transactions or deals that require attention, those become a major focus for the relationship manager. Collaboration between Private Banking Australia and other business areas within Credit Suisse occurs frequently based on specific transactions or deals being pursued.
Part of a Relationship Manager's role includes preparing for client governance or investment committee meetings where they discuss monthly or quarterly reviews with clients. This requires thorough analysis of information provided by clients regarding their investment preferences alongside current financial market conditions.
Relationship prospecting plays an essential role as well since acquiring new business is critical. The Relationship Manager spends time researching potential prospects whose business they aim to win over for Credit Suisse. Building trust with existing and potential clients while positioning Credit Suisse as a trusted partner becomes paramount in this process.
The article highlights that many new businesses come through referrals from existing satisfied customers which demonstrates trustworthiness being essential throughout this industry.
The future outlook for Credit Suisse in Australia is positive according to the Relationship Manager. Australia is considered to have a well-structured and transparent economy, making it an attractive place to conduct business. The 157-year experience of Credit Suisse also adds credibility and appeal, as it reflects the bank's ability to successfully manage client money through various economic cycles and market downturns while maintaining professionalism.
The article also mentions a shift in Australian investors' mindset after the financial crisis. Investors realized that diversification across different asset classes, including foreign assets, can improve returns and reduce volatility. This change in perception emphasizes the importance of offering a wide range of products and services by banks such as Credit Suisse.
In conclusion, this news article provides insight into the responsibilities of a relationship manager within Credit Suisse's private banking division in Australia. It highlights how they strive to meet clients' needs proactively while building trust and positioning the bank as a reliable partner. The article also mentions market trends related to asset allocation shifts among Australian investors after experiencing financial crises. 
This news article discusses the current and expected trends in emerging market consumption. The article states that over the next 12 months, the outperformance of emerging market consumption is likely to accelerate for four main reasons.
Firstly, lead indicators suggest a positive momentum in emerging markets, indicating that these markets are performing better compared to developed markets. Secondly, real wages and income growth in emerging economies continue to be higher than those in developed markets. This means that people in emerging economies have more money to spend on goods and services.
Thirdly, China is implementing policies to promote greater domestic consumption. This is significant because China has a large population and increased consumption within the country can drive global economic growth.
Lastly, aging and over-leveraged developed markets are experiencing a downward adjustment to household consumption. This means that consumers in developed countries are reducing their spending due to factors like high debt levels or an aging population.
The article also mentions the results of a survey conducted on consumer sentiment. The survey reveals that consumers are optimistic about their immediate financial outlook with 37% expecting an improvement compared to only 9% anticipating a deterioration.
However, the article notes that these positive trends are not uniform across all emerging economies. The survey highlights differences between countries included in the Consumer Survey. Brazil, China, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia show strong optimism regarding personal finances with percentages ranging from 33% - 66%. On the other hand, South Africa, Russia, and Turkey have more pessimism among consumers regarding their financial prospects.
Comparing this year's survey results with previous years' surveys shows increasing optimism among consumers on average. For example, Brazil has seen an increase from 53% - 63%, while China has gone up from 31% - 39%.
The article also discusses wage expectations within different countries. Brazil shows relatively strong nominal wage expectations followed by Indonesia but Turkey,
Russia
and South Africa have lower wage expectations overall.
Another interesting observation from the survey data is the age composition of income brackets. In many markets, the youngest working-age population has achieved higher income levels compared to older age groups. This trend is seen in China, Indonesia, Russia, and Turkey. However, in South Africa, the younger age group earns significantly more due to extremely low earnings for older age groups.
The article concludes by acknowledging that these survey results may be influenced by the sample size and demographics of respondents rather than being a reflection of broader trends.
Overall, this news article provides insight into current trends in emerging market consumption and discusses variations within different countries. It highlights factors like wage growth and demographic patterns that impact consumer sentiment and spending behavior in these markets. Continuing from the previous explanation, the news article emphasizes that while there is generally a positive macro view on emerging market consumption, there are disparities within and between different economies. The survey data sheds light on these variations.
In Brazil, for instance, the survey results show strong optimism with 66% of respondents expecting an improvement in their personal finances over the next six months. This reflects a growing positive sentiment among consumers in Brazil. Similarly, China displays an optimistic outlook with 44% of respondents anticipating better financial conditions.
On the other hand, South Africa, Russia, and Turkey stand out as countries where pessimism regarding financial prospects is more prevalent. In South Africa particularly, there is concern about rising unemployment levels and declining household income among lower-income groups. These factors contribute to a relatively depressed consumer sentiment compared to other countries surveyed.
The article draws attention to past parallels between consumer optimism surveys and subsequent events in certain regions. For example, it recalls how in 2010's survey regarding Egypt's financial outlook resulted in a high percentage (38%) of Egyptians expecting a deterioration compared to those anticipating an improvement (12%). This was followed by social unrest that erupted in Egypt during spring 2011. It also mentions recent widespread strikes affecting South Africa since H2 2012 which appear consistent with lower consumer optimism identified by the survey.
When comparing this year's aggregate survey results with previous years', it becomes clear that consumers are generally more optimistic now across several markets such as Brazil and China. This indicates improving confidence in future economic conditions.
Additionally, wage expectations emerge as important determinants of consumer sentiment across various countries surveyed. Brazil leads with strong nominal wage expectations followed closely by Indonesia and Saudi Arabia; however,Turkey,Russia,and South Africa show relatively depressed wage expectations overall.
Another significant finding concerns age demographics within income brackets across different markets.The data indicates that younger working-age populations tend to have higher income levels compared to older age groups. This trend is evident in China, Indonesia, Russia, and Turkey. However, in South Africa, the higher earnings of the younger group seem to be a reflection of very low earnings for older age groups rather than indicating high incomes.
The article acknowledges that while these survey results provide valuable insights into consumer sentiment and expectations, they also acknowledge limitations such as potential bias due to the sample size and composition of respondents.
To summarize, this news article delves into the current trends in emerging market consumption. It highlights variations within different countries based on consumer sentiment surveys while also touching on factors such as wage growth and demographic patterns that influence consumer behavior within these markets. The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities and challenges surrounding emerging market consumption trends. 
This news article discusses the European Union's ability to accept new members and its ongoing institutional reforms. The European Parliament has asked the Commission to comment on the EU's ability to expand geographically and accept new members by the end of 2006. However, it notes that the future of the EU Constitutional Treaty, which would have provided new decision-making mechanisms, is uncertain.
As the EU grows in size, it becomes more challenging for it to make decisions, particularly in foreign policy. Therefore, it is crucial for the EU to improve its decision-making mechanisms. This process is currently underway.
The article also mentions that there are mixed feelings towards the EU. Some perceive it as a threat when it is strong. However, the author disagrees with this view since all member countries of the EU are democracies and market economies whose decisions align with their system of values.
Switzerland is highlighted as a partner in a bilateral relationship with the EU that depends on its ability to act as a party to agreements and negotiations. The Swiss government acknowledges that reducing social and economic inequalities in an enlarged EU contributes not only to Europe's security but also to Switzerland's prosperity.
However, any decision regarding Switzerland's relationship with the EU will have to wait until at least 2014-2020 when approval for the EU budget takes place—a delay of at least ten years from when this article was written.
The criteria for negotiations between Switzerland and the EU are already clear, encompassing high legal standards. Although negotiations are ongoing regarding their final outcome concerning Switzerland's relationship with Europe, no speculation can be made yet about what this means specifically for Switzerland.
Nevertheless, Switzerland already has close ties with both politically and economically important partners within Europe through various treaties such as free trade agreements and bilateral agreements I and II—18 vital treaties in total—which protect Swiss interests.
For this bilateral path between Switzerland and Europe to be successful requires shared responsibility from both sides. Potential referendums on Swiss contributions to an enlarged EU are mentioned, and the hope is that the Swiss people will continue to support this bilateral path.
The article also mentions Switzerland's historical efforts in supporting Eastern European countries since the 1990s by helping them introduce reforms and transition into democracies and social market economies. Switzerland has been providing aid to future EU member states Romania and Bulgaria for a long time, particularly as part of its assistance towards Eastern Europe.
The economic treaties Switzerland has with these countries will be replaced by bilateral treaties with the EU once they become members. For example, existing free trade agreements between Switzerland and accession states like Romania and Bulgaria would be replaced by the Switzerland-EU Free Trade Treaty on their accession dates.
In conclusion, this news article provides an overview of various aspects related to the European Union's ability to accept new members, ongoing institutional reforms within the EU, concerns about decision-making mechanisms in foreign policy, sentiments towards the EU in general, Switzerland's relationship with Europe through bilateral agreements, potential referendums on Swiss contributions to an enlarged EU, and support provided by both sides toward Eastern European countries. 
This news article discusses the problem of food wastage and the need for intervention to address this issue. The term "wastage" encompasses both food loss and food waste. Food waste refers to edible food that is discarded, while food loss refers to a decrease in the quantity or quality of food that was originally intended for human consumption.
In industrialized countries and emerging economies, consumers are primarily responsible for wasted foodstuffs. Lack of coordination among different players in the supply chain often leads to overproduction, resulting in more food being produced than can be sold. Examples of food waste include misshapen fruits deemed substandard according to quality criteria, expired products, and leftovers thrown away. Increasing consumer awareness can help reduce the amount of rejected and discarded food at the end of the supply chain.
In developing countries, logistical, technical, and financial limitations contribute to significant losses during production and transportation of foodstuffs. This is concerning since global production needs to increase by 60 percent by 2050 to meet the demands of a growing population with changing diets. To tackle this issue effectively, both public and private sectors must invest in infrastructure, transport systems, and packaging industries in developing countries.
Efficient food production not only reduces costs for consumers but also improves access for disadvantaged groups. Speed plays a crucial role in combating production losses – when moving quickly along the supply chain; there is a lower probability that foods will spoil. One potential solution is setting up processing plants closer to production facilities; however, this poses challenges for many developing countries without support from private or public sectors.
Interestingly enough, what may seem unthinkable in developing countries occurs regularly in high-income nations – significant amounts of perfectly edible foods intended for sale or consumption are thrown away each year. In Europe and North America alone, an average person discards between 95-115 kilos (209-253 pounds) annually compared to only 6-11 kilos (13-24 pounds) in sub-Saharan countries. Poor communication and cooperation among producers often result in surplus food that exceeds demand, requiring it to be discarded. Additionally, strict quality standards regarding the appearance of fruits and vegetables lead to the rejection of many foodstuffs that are not put on sale.
Thankfully, there has been a recent shift in thinking, with supermarket chains displaying imperfect produce such as three-legged carrots or bent cucumbers. Educating consumers about sell-by and expiry dates can also encourage responsible behavior when it comes to food consumption.
Peter Hess, a quality coordinator at DSR (a provider of Credit Suisse staff restaurants), suggests that guests becoming more tolerant toward the end-of-service offerings could significantly reduce food waste. If the salad bar doesn't need to look fully stocked until closing time, less food would be disposed of for safety reasons at the end of the day.
While reducing food waste may not solve all global supply shortage problems, it remains an effective way for each individual to make a positive impact. In June 2013 as part of the United Nations Environment Program's Think.Eat.Save campaign during World Environment Day, Credit Suisse's Sustainability Network launched an information campaign across its staff restaurants in Switzerland on the topic of food waste. The bank regularly measures food waste and implements annual measures aimed at reducing this problem.
Efforts such as precise planning by chefs, continuous fresh production practices, and service personnel's ability to cater specifically to guests' needs have already helped reduce plate-level wastage by about 30 grams since 2006.
Overall, this article emphasizes that addressing food wastage is crucial due to increasing global population growth and changing dietary patterns. It highlights how local communities can contribute through awareness-building campaigns while emphasizing public-private sector collaborations to invest in developing nations' infrastructure for increased production efficiencies. 
This news article discusses the global pattern of personal wealth and how it has changed over the past year. It focuses on two countries in particular, the United States and Japan, which have had contrasting experiences with regards to wealth accumulation.
The United States has seen a fifth successive year of increases in personal wealth. This growth has been driven by a recovery in house prices and a bullish stock market, particularly with regards to the Dow Jones index reaching new highs. As a result, the United States has added $8.1 trillion to global wealth stocks, increasing wealth ownership by 12.7% to $72.1 trillion.
On the other hand, Japan's aggressive monetary policy implemented by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) led to even greater rises in equity prices, up 52% in the year leading up to mid-2013. However, despite this positive development for equities, total household wealth in Japan has actually fallen by $5.8 trillion this year due to several factors. For instance, Japanese equities are much lower compared to international standards and account for less than 10% of household financial wealth. Additionally, these aggressive BOJ policies have resulted in a 22% decrease in the yen-USD exchange rate.
Interestingly, although Japan suffered relatively little during the global financial crisis between 2007 and 2008 – with personal wealth even growing during that period – their total wealth is currently only 1% above its level from back then.
Aside from these two countries' experiences highlighted above; overall economic conditions around the world have generally favored acquiring more personal wealth over this past year.
The article also provides information about other countries where changes in total household wealth exceeded $200 billion - China ($1.4 trillion), Germany ($1.2 trillion), France ($1.ltrillion), Italy , United Kingdom , Spain , Mexico , Sweden , India , Korea and Canada . In addition,the Eurozone countries have recovered over half of the significant wealth loss they experienced a year earlier, due to equity price increases and advantageous euro-dollar movements. The United Kingdom , India and Switzerland also managed to recover a significant portion of their recent losses.
According to the article, the average global household wealth per adult is at an all-time high of $51,600. However,this average masks variations across different countries and regions. The richest nations - mainly found in North America, Western Europe, rich Asia-Pacific and Middle Eastern countries - have an average wealth per adult exceeding $100,000. Switzerland leads this list with an average wealth exceeding $500,000 in 2011 which dropped below it in 2012 but reached a new peak value of $513,000 per adult this year.
Australia ($403k), Norway ($380k), Luxembourg ($315K) follow closely behind in second through fourth place respectively from 2012. The United States , Sweden , France , Singapore , Belgium and Denmark also have considerable average wealth per adult ranging from $250k to $300k.
The article goes on to reveal some striking numbers regarding how global wealth is distributed across individuals around the world. It states that an individual needs at least $75,000 in assets to be among the top 10% wealthiest people globally, while belonging to the top percentile requires holdings worth at least$753k or more . In contrast,the bottom half of the world's population owns less than 1% of total worldwide assets; meanwhile,the richest 10% hold around 86% of total global wealth.
 
Lastly,the author refers readers who'd like further information about total wealth distribution patterns across regions and countries during mid-2013 can refer Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report for that year 
The article discusses the current state of the Irish economy, which has been struggling since the collapse of a property bubble in 2008 led to a severe banking crisis. However, there are signs this year that capital markets and investors are gaining confidence in Ireland.
One positive development is that the government successfully sold 5 billion euros worth of new benchmark bonds for the first time in three years. This indicates that investors are showing trust in Ireland's economy. In addition, the government sold the state-owned insurance company Irish Life to a Canadian firm earlier this year.
The article also highlights that unlike some other European countries, Ireland does not have a competitiveness problem. In fact, its export prices fell relative to other Eurozone countries even during the boom years of the mid-2000s. Moody's recently praised Ireland's competitive exports when it affirmed its credit rating. However, Moody’s rating was still just below investment grade with a negative outlook due to concerns about Ireland's vulnerability to wider euro-area stresses and weaknesses in its banking sector.
The banking sector remains troubled in Ireland, but Credit Suisse analysts believe markets may not get overly concerned about it just yet because of several factors. Firstly, Ireland is already under a bailout program and has seen substantial declines in deposits since the start of the financial crisis. Secondly, post-crisis Irish banks are among Europe's best capitalized. The Irish central bank is also urging private banks to extend loans for struggling homeowners by lowering monthly bills or allowing interest-only payments for a period.
One major threat to Ireland is expected economic slowdown following Cyprus' bailout situation. Despite Cyprus having only a small share of GDP within Europe, precedent set by its bailout and shock to confidence due to how it was implemented can negatively impact growth in Eurozone.
But growth and stability are exactly what Ireland needs most at present; around 60% of their exports go to EU countries – hence any slowdown would be detrimental.Also noteworthy is Ireland’s large budget gap, expected to be 7.5% this year, which is one of the worst in the EU. Austerity measures will likely be necessary for at least the next three years to reduce this deficit. However, it is also crucial that the economy grows by 2% annually to ensure sustainable debt levels.
The article concludes by highlighting Ireland's vulnerability to shocks in near-term and how any negative effect on growth or delay in fiscal consolidation could seriously threaten its recovery. Therefore, while there may be more reasons for optimism compared to other periphery nations, Ireland will closely watch for signs of Cyprus contagion.
In summary, despite past economic challenges, Ireland has shown some recent positive signs such as successful bond sales and competitive exports. However, concerns remain regarding banking weaknesses and budget deficits which require a combination of fiscal consolidation measures and economic growth for long-term stability. To further expand on the article, it is important to understand the context of Ireland's economic struggles and how they have affected the country since 2008. 
The collapse of the property bubble in 2008 had a devastating impact on Ireland's economy. The bursting of this bubble led to a severe banking crisis, as many financial institutions faced significant losses due to bad loans tied to the real estate sector. This crisis resulted in a contraction in credit availability and a decline in business and consumer confidence, which in turn led to high levels of unemployment and decreased economic activity.
In response to these challenges, the Irish government embarked on a path of austerity measures aimed at reducing budget deficits and stabilizing public finances. These measures included spending cuts, tax increases, and structural reforms across various sectors of the economy.
Over time, these efforts started showing some positive results. The government's ability to sell benchmark bonds for the first time in three years indicates that there is growing confidence from capital markets and investors regarding Ireland's economic prospects. This renewed interest can be seen as a positive sign that Ireland is making progress towards restoring trust in its financial system.
Another positive aspect highlighted by Credit Suisse analyst Steven Bryce is that unlike some other European countries, Ireland does not have a competitiveness problem. Despite facing economic challenges over the past decade, Irish export prices remained competitive compared to other Eurozone countries even during boom years before 2008.
While there are encouraging signs for recovery, Moody's decision to affirm Ireland’s credit rating just below investment grade with a negative outlook reflects ongoing concerns about vulnerabilities within its banking sector and exposure to wider euro-area stresses.
The country’s banking sector remains troubled despite improvements made since 2008. However, it is worth noting that post-crisis Irish banks have strengthened their capitalization levels significantly compared to counterparts elsewhere in Europe—indicating progress toward stability within this crucial industry.
Furthermore, while many Irish citizens still struggle with mortgage repayments, the central bank is actively encouraging private banks to assist struggling homeowners by offering loan extensions, reduced monthly payments, or interest-only payment options. These measures aim to alleviate financial pressures for individuals and are also indicative of a proactive approach to addressing issues within the banking sector.
Looking ahead, there are concerns about potential spillover effects from the Cyprus crisis on Ireland's economy. The recent bailout situation in Cyprus has raised questions about the wider health of European economies and has the potential to impact growth in the Eurozone. Given that Ireland heavily relies on EU countries for export demand—around 60% of their exports go to these markets—an economic slowdown would have detrimental effects.
Additionally, Ireland faces challenges regarding its large budget deficit—the fifth largest in Europe—which is expected to be 7.5% this year. To address this issue, austerity measures will likely need to be enforced over several years alongside efforts to stimulate economic growth and create new jobs.
In conclusion, while there are positive signs emerging in Ireland's economy such as successful bond sales and competitive export prices, challenges persist with regards to its banking sector weaknesses and high budget deficits.
With ongoing efforts towards fiscal consolidation paired with steady economic growth targets moving forward—especially considering Europe's economic outlook—Ireland aims to solidify its recovery path without succumbing entirely 
to any negative contagion effect from external shocks such as those witnessed during Cyprus' financial crisis debacle.
 
This news article discusses the success and potential of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems in various cities around the world. BRT is a low-cost and high-impact transportation system that allows for efficient mass transit in urban areas.
The article highlights TransMilenio, a BRT system in Bogotá, Colombia, as a prime example of success. This system was completed in just three years and captured international attention due to its high capacity of over 40,000 passengers per hour. It operates through an innovative public-private partnership model, where the city builds the infrastructure and local entrepreneurs own and operate the fleet without subsidies.
The success of TransMilenio has led to its replication in many other cities globally. The article mentions that 150 cities have implemented BRT or bus corridors since 2000, with 115 created within this period alone. However, it emphasizes that planning, financing, and organizational difficulties are challenges that should not be overlooked during implementation.
The article stresses that each city is unique and requires tailored approaches instead of simply copying successful models from other places. It points out that most obstacles to implementing BRT systems are institutional rather than technical since they involve aligning diverse interests. Strong political leadership and effective communication are deemed essential for successful implementation.
Traditionally, urban transport planning has focused on expanding road networks instead of prioritizing people's mobility needs over cars'. The article argues against this approach as it leads to increased congestion rather than solving it. It cites examples like Seoul, San Francisco, Toronto, and Vancouver removing urban highways to make way for public transport infrastructure as a more sustainable alternative.
Redirecting funding from parking facilities and highways towards sustainable transport initiatives is advocated by the author who supports mobility projects in Mexico, Brazil Peru Turkey India China among others countries while partnering with researchers from Chile USA Portugal Australia through ALC-BRT Centre of Excellence initiative.
The article also mentions upcoming projects such as a 150 km BRT network in Rio de Janeiro and the expansion of Metrobús in Mexico City. It predicts that around 30 cities, mostly in Asia but also Africa, will introduce BRT systems in the next five years.
The article notes a cultural shift where more people aspire to live in denser mixed-use areas within the city rather than commuting from the suburbs. Strategies aligning land use with transportation planning are highlighted as successful examples from Copenhagen, Curitiba, and Singapore.
In terms of innovations, vehicle technology is improving to make trains and buses more efficient and environmentally friendly. The goal is to create integrated public transport networks with last-mile connectivity to other transit services, as well as car and bike sharing options.
Lastly, it mentions growing trends such as membership-based urban lifestyles instead of ownership-driven ones thanks to social networks and car-sharing programs. However, Latin America seemingly demonstrates an opposite trend with a middle-class population increasingly owning cars while public transport usage declines. To address this issue, service improvements, safety measures requiring subsidies may be necessary alongside congestion charging initiatives and parking management schemes.
Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of implementing sustainable transportation systems like BRT globally due to their potential for positively shaping future cities while addressing mobility challenges efficiently. 
This news article discusses the possibility of Portugal receiving a credit line from European countries to help support its economic recovery. The credit line is described as an appropriate instrument because Portugal has already been able to access the financial market by refinancing some bonds. The goal of the credit line is to assist Portugal in fully returning to the market and stabilizing its economy.
The article explains that a credit line is a less costly option for core countries (such as Germany) to provide, as it serves as a precautionary measure and may or may not be utilized by Portugal. A final decision on whether or not Portugal will receive this credit line is expected after the German elections in September.
Portugal is projected to face a funding gap of approximately 12 billion euros in 2014 when its current bailout program ends. The country has been struggling with a severe recession, with its GDP contracting by 1.8% in the last quarter of 2012 and an estimated further contraction of 3% in 2013. Unemployment rates remain high at around 17.5%.
One of the challenges facing Portugal is limited domestic demand, with reliance on external trade being necessary for economic growth. However, Spain (Portugal's main trading partner) also faces economic difficulties, which adds further pressure on Portuguese exports.
European officials have already revised down Portugal's deficit target for this year from 6% of GDP to 5.5%. This adjustment reflects a shift towards prioritizing structural reforms over immediate deficit reduction measures, which has been praised by Credit Suisse analyst Axel Lang.
Portugal implemented labor market reforms last year aimed at facilitating easier hiring and firing processes for employers - one example of successful structural reforms according to Lang's research note.
However, austerity measures continue to burden Portugal's economy heavily, and there have been recent setbacks due to budget cuts being rejected by the Constitutional Court. Lang anticipates that filling future budget gaps may present greater difficulties for the government, especially amid weak economic conditions, rising unemployment, social discontent, and political risks.
To counter these challenges, Portugal's leaders have been focusing on fostering economic growth. Measures such as cutting corporate taxes and providing incentives for foreign companies to invest in Portugal have been announced recently. The hope is that attracting large companies similar to the Irish model could improve employment prospects and enhance Portugal's business environment.
Overall, whether or not Portugal receives a credit line from European countries is significant in determining its long-term success. Reversing its status as one of the slowest-growing economies in the Eurozone will require time and concerted efforts from both domestic policymakers and support from international partners. In addition to the economic challenges Portugal is facing, the article also highlights the impact of spending cuts on essential services such as hospitals and schools. The government has acknowledged that these cuts will have an effect on public services, indicating the difficult choices that need to be made in order to address the country's financial situation.
The frustration regarding austerity measures has been growing among the Portuguese population. As a response, Portugal's leaders have been making efforts to stimulate growth and create a favorable environment for businesses. The announcement of measures such as corporate tax cuts and incentives for foreign companies to invest in Portugal reflects this strategy.
The article mentions that Portugal aims to replicate the Irish model, where attracting multinational corporations helped boost employment and improve economic prospects. Such initiatives demonstrate a recognition of the need for long-term structural changes aimed at promoting sustainable growth.
However, reversing Portugal's economic situation does not happen overnight. The country's long-term success hinges on its ability to fully recover from its recessionary state over the past decade. This requires implementing effective reforms, fostering domestic demand alongside external trade expansion, addressing unemployment rates, mitigating social discontent, and managing political risks effectively.
As mentioned earlier in the article, whether or not Portugal receives a credit line from Europe is crucial in determining its path towards recovery. Accessing this credit line would provide additional support during a critical time when existing bailout funds are set to end.
It's important to note that countries like Germany may be more inclined towards providing a precautionary credit line rather than outright grants or further financial assistance due to their own fiscal constraints amidst challenging economic conditions within Europe.
In conclusion, this news article highlights how receiving a credit line could potentially aid Portugal in stabilizing its economy by allowing it access to necessary financial resources during an ongoing recession. However, it also acknowledges that reversing years of slow growth requires significant structural reforms and sustained efforts on multiple fronts including fiscal consolidation with smart expenditure management techniques along with strategies promoting business investment and job creation. 
This news article discusses the approach and techniques used by composers in creating music that goes beyond mere calculations and aims to express complex emotions. The article focuses on two specific pieces: Sonata No 2 for Piano, Concord, Mass. by Charles Ives and Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano by John Cage.
The first piece mentioned is Sonata No 2 for Piano, Concord, Mass. composed by Charles Ives. This piece is known to be rarely performed due to its complexity and difficulty. Ives experimented with different rhythms occurring simultaneously, using various tonalities at the same time, and blending complex tonal languages with simpler ones. He drew influences from genres such as pop music of his time and Beethoven's fifth symphony, incorporating them into a single musical language.
The second work discussed is Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano by John Cage. This piece is considered a significant landmark in the repertoire of 20th-century music. Cage attempts to bring together elements from both Eastern and Western musical traditions through a unique method. He modifies the sound of the piano by placing metal objects inside its strings, producing percussive sounds reminiscent of Eastern percussion instruments. Additionally, he incorporates elements from Indian music philosophy while also utilizing Western sounds and tonality in certain parts of the composition.
Cage's work aims at translating specific emotions into music based on ancient Indian culture's nine permanent emotions such as anger, fear, love, jealousy etc. Each piece in this cycle revolves around a pivotal emotion derived from these nine emotions.
Silence plays a crucial role in Cage's ensemble as it is often employed alongside traditional musical notes or tones in his compositions—an element commonly found in many non-Western musical traditions that emphasize silence or meditation during performance.
Overall, this kind of contemporary 20th-century music is not usually part of typical repertoire performed at international series events; therefore being part of such performances affirms the artist's enthusiasm and honor for participating in the series. The article mentions the artist's excitement for bringing this repertoire to new audiences.
The Hong Kong Arts Festival is highlighted as a significant platform for showcasing global artistic talent in a vibrant city setting. Running annually from February to March, it features various performances and programs including music, theater, dance, popular entertainment, film, and exhibitions. The festival has attracted renowned artists from around the world since its inception in the early 1970s.
Since 2009, Credit Suisse has collaborated with the Hong Kong Arts Festival on their Emerging Artists Series. This series aims to provide a prestigious opportunity for rising young artists from various art forms to showcase their talent and creativity as they embark on international careers.
The 2013 series includes performances by Quatuor Ebène (string quartet), Martin Fröst (clarinetist), and Ralph van Raat (pianist).
In conclusion, this news article focuses on composers' desire to express emotions through music rather than relying solely on calculations. It highlights two specific compositions by Charles Ives an d John Cage that exemplify this approach. The article emphasizes the complexity and experimental nature of these compositions, as well as their unique incorporation of different musical elements.
The article also mentions the Credit Suisse Emerging Artists Series, which is a partnership between Credit Suisse and the Hong Kong Arts Festival. This series aims to showcase talented young artists from various art forms and provide them with an opportunity to launch their international careers. The 2013 series specifically features performances by Quatuor Ebène, Martin Fröst, and Ralph van Raat.
The Hong Kong Arts Festival itself is described as a pinnacle event in Hong Kong's performing arts scene. It attracts around 200,000 visitors annually with its diverse program of music, theater, dance, popular entertainment, film screenings, and exhibitions. The festival has a rich history of hosting world-renowned musicians and performers from different genres.
The article concludes by highlighting the artist's excitement at being included in such company and performing contemporary 20th-century music within an international series. It notes that this genre is not typically included in such events but now receives recognition through platforms like the Credit Suisse Emerging Artists Series.
Additionally mentioned are some upcoming performances on the artist's schedule—a tour featuring Tan Dun's "The Banquet" Piano Concerto conducted by Tan Dun himself; a performance of George Gershwin's Concerto in F with the Cairo Philharmonic; performances and CD recordings of Tauno Marttinen’s Piano Concerto with the Finnish Turku Symphony Orchestra; and a recital performance at the Bach Festival of Thüringen in Germany.
Overall, this news article celebrates composers who boldly experiment with new approaches to convey complex emotions through their music. It highlights specific works by Charles Ives and John Cage while also shedding light on events like the Hong Kong Arts Festival and partnerships such as Credit Suisse Emerging Artists Series that aim to elevate rising talents across various artistic disciplines. 
This news article discusses the expected recovery and growth of several economies in the coming year. The author believes that the United States will recover more rapidly than many people anticipate due to factors such as reducing their debt and becoming more self-sufficient in energy. Additionally, they predict that the United Kingdom may outperform current expectations, as it has a history of swinging further into recession or growth than forecasted.
China is highlighted as a significant player with a growth rate of 7.5 percent, which will contribute significantly to global economic expansion. However, despite some countries growing faster than expected, it is emphasized that this will not result in a boom scenario but rather a steady recovery.
The article acknowledges that it will take years to fully recover from the recent financial crisis and recession due to dealing with existing debt issues and implementing growth-related policies, which can be expensive. It also highlights caution in policy-making since this particular crisis was unparalleled for quite some time.
While there are uncertainties in the world economy, such as potential banking collapses or conflicts in regions like the Middle East, these factors are not deemed substantial enough to derail overall global recovery. Overall, maintaining a steady recovery is seen as healthier than stimulating rapid growth artificially.
The article expresses optimism about China's shift towards sustainable growth patterns through initiatives like expanding domestic demand and increasing wages for its citizens. This development is believed to benevolently impact both China's internal market and provide an expanded market for other countries worldwide.
On matters of military security, there is an assertion that humanity now resides in a safer place compared to decades ago when conflict between dominant powers posed serious intercontinental risks. As globalization continues connecting different nations economically and fostering common interests among major powers like China, America, and the European Union; chances of such conflicts have diminished significantly over time.
In conclusion, this news article presents an optimistic outlook on global economic recovery next year with both positive expectations for certain countries' performances and improved intercontinental relations. It also recognizes potential uncertainties, but overall believes that the world is headed towards a healthier state of the economy. The article emphasizes the interconnectedness of the global economy and how it has led to increased dependence among nations. As countries like the United States, China, and the European Union share common interests in various global matters, conflicts between them are seen as less likely compared to previous decades.
The author uses the example of the improved relationship between America and China today compared to America's relationship with the Soviet Union 30 years ago. This shift is attributed to shared economic interests and a decrease in the risk of serious intercontinental conflict. While certain challenges such as small wars, terrorism, and economic problems still exist, they are not considered on par with historical risks.
Despite this overall positive assessment, uncertainties remain. The possibility of another banking collapse or currency crisis is acknowledged as potential events that could significantly impact global stability. Similarly, conflicts or political instability in regions like the Middle East are mentioned as potential sources of trouble.
In terms of economic growth and recovery from a worldwide perspective, a steady approach is advocated for instead of pursuing rapid growth stimulated by artificial means. This viewpoint suggests that maintaining stable growth over time will be more beneficial in the long run than experiencing quick but unsustainable expansion.
The writer also briefly touches on military matters by highlighting some reasons why there may be an improved sense of safety today. This includes increased economic integration leading to shared interests among major powers and reduced chances for large-scale conflict. However, it is essential to note that this aspect is not extensively discussed in comparison to other points raised within the article.
Overall, despite acknowledging challenges ahead such as debt management and policy-making concerns related to growth initiatives post-financial crisis; optimism pervades this news article regarding future global recovery prospects. The interconnected nature of economies along with improved relations between major powers provides a foundation for cautious optimism moving forward.
It should be noted that while these perspectives provide valuable insights into potential trends for next year's economic outlooks; macroeconomic forecasts are always subject to change due to various unpredictable factors, global events, and policy adjustments. 
This news article discusses the ongoing debate in Switzerland regarding a proposed increase in the price of the motorway vignette, which is a permit that allows drivers to use all Swiss motorways and expressways. The current price of the vignette is 40 francs, and the proposed increase would raise it to 100 francs.
The main reason for this proposed price hike is to generate additional revenue for expanding the road network and facilitating the federal government's takeover of national roadways. It is estimated that this increase will bring in 300 million francs in extra revenue. The Swiss Federal Councilor Doris Leuthard, who heads the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC), supports this measure and considers it necessary given the increasing use of roadways and planned infrastructure investments.
On one side of the debate are those who argue that raising vignette prices would ensure fair financing for maintaining and expanding Switzerland's road network while benefiting all regions of the country. These supporters also highlight how Switzerland's excellent road network contributes to its competitiveness on a global economic scale.
On the other side are opponents who question why drivers should have to bear additional costs when they already cover more than 100 percent of the expenses associated with maintaining roads. Some argue that instead of increasing vignette prices, there should be greater investment in public transportation or exploration of mobility pricing based on actual usage.
Various individuals were present at a Lifefair Forum where these topics were discussed including politicians, transportation experts, and business leaders. The National Council approved this bill with support from both left-leaning parties like Green Party representative Bastien Girod as well as right-leaning parties like former Swiss People's Party (SVP) Vice President Walter Frey.
While those supporting an increase emphasize infrastructure needs due to increased traffic congestion around Zurich specifically, critics raise questions about whether so much transportation is actually necessary or efficient in today's world. Girod argues for greater efficiency rather than more asphalt, emphasizing that commuting can often be a burden for many individuals. Frey counters this by highlighting the importance of economic growth, suggesting it would not be possible without accessible transportation options.
In conclusion, the article describes the ongoing debate in Switzerland regarding a proposed increase in motorway vignette prices. Supporters argue that this measure is necessary to generate revenue for infrastructure development and fair financing of roads, while opponents question why drivers should pay more when they already cover excessive costs. The discussion extends to broader questions about the necessity and efficiency of transportation in today's society. The article also highlights the viewpoint of Hans-Jörg Bertschi, a business owner, who criticizes the proposed increase in vignette prices as a "tax on leaving your car at home." He disagrees with the idea of mobility pricing or collecting fees based on actual road usage. On the other hand, Kathrin Amacker, Head of Communications & Public Affairs for the Swiss Federal Railways, and Ernst Stocker, Zurich Cantonal Councilor for the SVP and Director of Economic Affairs, support the bill.
Amidst these arguments about financing and transportation needs in Switzerland, it is important to note that there will be a public vote on November 24 to decide whether or not to approve this proposed change to federal law. The fact that a referendum committee gathered enough signatures to bring this matter to public vote shows that there is significant opposition and interest in discussing this issue further.
The article suggests that while Switzerland does have an efficient road network compared to some other countries with less traffic congestion and fewer traffic jams, there is still room for improvement. However, critics argue that instead of investing more in roads and increasing vignette prices further burdening drivers economically, efforts should be focused on finding ways to promote alternative means of transport such as public transportation or carpooling.
Ultimately, this debate revolves around striking a balance between increasing revenue for infrastructure development while ensuring fair financing and considering factors such as environmental concerns related to transportation. Both sides raise valid points regarding efficiency versus expansion of road networks and potential alternatives such as mobility pricing.
As this topic continues to ignite heated debate among experts from different fields at forums like Lifefair Forum where leading minds gather together; it remains uncertain what decision will be reached by voters. 
This news article discusses various aspects of Switzerland's economic success and the challenges it currently faces. It highlights four key factors contributing to Switzerland's success: a liberal labor market, high workforce integration, well-trained employees, and openness towards international trade. These factors have allowed Switzerland to weather the financial crisis well.
However, the article also emphasizes a future challenge for Switzerland - an aging population combined with predicted immigration of about 40,000 people per year will result in a shortage of about 400,000 workers by 2030. The author argues that immigration is crucial for Switzerland's continued success and disagrees with initiatives against mass immigration and planned-economy quota-setting.
The article acknowledges certain problems that need attention regarding cultural differences with foreign bosses but suggests that the focus should be on utilizing untapped potential among skilled workers already in Switzerland rather than increasing immigration. The culture of working as an older person needs to be developed further, and there is room for increasing women's productivity in the workforce.
Wage discrimination has significantly reduced over recent years due to new hiring practices; however, employment relationships that have evolved over time still require further progress towards equal pay for equal work. Despite this issue, wages are distributed more equally in Switzerland compared to other countries according to statistical measures like the Gini coefficient.
The author also raises concerns about rising living costs in Switzerland which impact families' budgets significantly. Emphasizing economic considerations, they suggest focusing less on increasing wages and more on finding ways to lower living costs.
When discussing education systems in Switzerland, it is highlighted that while their dual educational system has been successful so far (combining vocational training with general education), there is social pressure threatening its value as it tends towards becoming similar to high school education. Reforms are suggested within primary schools as well by placing emphasis on teaching STEM disciplines (science, technology engineering, math).
Regarding the financial sector in Switzerland, it is suggested that increased regulation will lead to cost pressure and job cuts, but the author remains optimistic about the competitive strength of Swiss banks. They believe that a "clean money strategy" focused on performance and quality will be necessary in the future.
The article concludes by stating that Switzerland is well-positioned for the future, particularly in industries benefiting from global megatrends such as healthcare, energy, urbanization, water, and aging. However, it notes that Switzerland tends to forget its own excellence compared to other countries.
In summary, this news article discusses Switzerland's economic success based on factors like a liberal labor market and a well-trained workforce while also highlighting challenges such as an aging population and rising living costs. It emphasizes the importance of immigration for maintaining economic performance but suggests leveraging untapped potential among existing workers. The article also touches upon wage discrimination concerns, necessary reforms in education systems, and possible changes in the financial sector. Overall, it suggests that Switzerland's position remains strong but highlights areas where improvement is needed. The article explores Switzerland's economic landscape in greater detail, shedding light on various aspects that contribute to its success. One notable factor is the country's high level of workforce integration. Among the population between 15 and 64 years old, a staggering 82% are engaged in working life, surpassing any other country. This demonstrates Switzerland's ability to effectively incorporate individuals into its labor market.
Additionally, Switzerland boasts a strong work ethic, with its citizens working more hours per week than any other European nation - an average of 41.9 hours. This diligent approach has undoubtedly contributed to Switzerland's ability to weather economic crises successfully.
Another crucial component of Switzerland's success is its well-trained employees at every level. The article attributes this achievement to the country's dual educational system, which combines vocational training with general education. By providing students with practical skills alongside academic knowledge, the educational system sets a solid foundation for a highly competent workforce.
Switzerland's openness towards global trade and international engagement plays a vital role in driving its economy forward as well. The country earns approximately one out of every two francs from exports and demonstrates robust industrialization; 20% of its GDP stems from industry-related activities, solidifying it as one of the most industrialized nations globally.
However, despite these impressive accomplishments, there are challenges lying ahead for Switzerland due to demographic shifts and immigration patterns. An aging population combined with projected annual immigration rates indicate that by 2030, there will be a deficit of around 400,000 workers within the Swiss job market.
The author believes that this situation necessitates continued reliance on immigration as part of their economic strategy moving forward. They express concern over initiatives against mass immigration and argue against planned-economy quota-setting proposals marketed by groups like Ecopop; rather than finding practical solutions for managing labor shortages sustainably over time - focusing solely on fixed quotas wouldn't serve Swiss interests effectively.
Furthermore, by recalling fears from the early 1970s about foreign influences dominating Switzerland, the author suggests that similar arguments blaming free movement of persons for various problems today are misleading and unfounded. They highlight that a significant proportion of immigrants come to Switzerland for reasons unrelated to the free movement agreement. However, they do acknowledge cultural differences with foreign bosses as an issue but stress the importance of addressing such problems while aiming to keep immigration levels as low as possible.
The article suggests tapping into existing potential within Swiss society instead of solely relying on immigration to bridge the forthcoming labor gap. It suggests encouraging older individuals to continue working and increasing productivity among women, with untapped potential in both these demographics already present in Switzerland.
While wage discrimination has decreased significantly through improved hiring practices, further efforts are needed concerning employment relationships that have evolved over time. The introduction of tools like pay parity dialogue is recommended to help enterprises ensure equal pay for equal work. Nevertheless, compared to other countries, statistics indicate a more equitable distribution of wages in Switzerland, accompanied by a declining prevalence of working poor individuals.
In terms of living costs, families' budgets are increasingly strained due to rising expenses surpassing those allocated for food. Given this situation and economic considerations, the article recommends prioritizing efforts towards lowering living costs instead of focusing solely on wage increases.
Turning toward education systems within Switzerland, attention is drawn towards preserving the value and effectiveness of their successful dual system. Social pressures risk watering down vocational training elements in favor of a more generalized high school approach; hence reforms highlighting STEM disciplines at primary school level are forwarded emphasizing their significance considering engineering's substantial contribution historically towards Swiss prosperity.
Regarding Switzerland's financial sector –a key pillar supporting its economy– it acknowledges that increasing regulation will lead companies within this industry encountering cost pressure necessitating job cuts in order maintain competitiveness globally. However concerns aside it expresses confidence that current trends will pave an optimistic future for Swiss banks given promising markets such as healthcare, energy along with the burgeoning luxury goods industry driven by increasing global prosperity.
In conclusion, the article delves into Switzerland's economic success factors such as a liberal labor market, strong workforce integration, proficient education systems, and international trade openness. While acknowledging challenges such as an aging population and rising costs of living, it emphasizes the importance of immigration in maintaining productivity. The discussion spans wage discrimination concerns, the need for reforms within education systems at all levels, and potential adaptations within Switzerland's financial sector. Overall, it asserts that despite existing challenges and areas for improvement; Switzerland is well-positioned compared to other countries but must not undervalue its own achievements. 
This news article discusses the current state of the residential and commercial property markets in Switzerland. It highlights several factors that are influencing price growth and vacancy rates in both sectors.
In terms of residential property, it is noted that there may be a slight dampening effect on demand due to various factors such as stricter lending practices, limited speculative transactions, and a lack of oversupply. However, this is not expected to completely halt price rises, with estimates suggesting a 3-5 percent increase this year. This indicates that there is still a risk of a market correction happening at some point. The article suggests that the only thing likely to halt price growth entirely would be a sharp rise in interest rates.
One key factor preventing the residential property market from overheating is the limited speculative transactions taking place. Speculative transactions refer to buying properties with the intention of selling them quickly for profit, which can drive up prices artificially. Additionally, lending has been curbed by many institutions as they tighten monitoring and assess growing risks in order to avoid potential instability.
Furthermore, there is currently no oversupply on the residential property market despite having a full supply pipeline. This shortage of available residential space in central locations will likely continue to be an issue in 2013 since structural weaknesses in the construction sector make it difficult to produce more apartments.
Vacancy rates are expected to rise first in peripheral and rural regions before becoming noticeable overall. Despite this expectation, it is predicted that Switzerland's overall vacancy rate will remain below its long-term average of 1 percent for this year but only slightly below.
If interest rates were to substantially rise, high property prices would lead to higher running costs for homeowners which could affect demand and result in an increase in vacancy rates even further. However, it should be noted that these trends mainly pertain to owner-occupied residential properties rather than commercial properties.
Interestingly, while commercial office space prices have also seen significant increases like their residential counterparts, there is no sign of overheating in terms of demand. In fact, the office market is experiencing rising vacancy rates mainly in town centers as companies are attracted to cheaper locations with good transport links. This shift is facilitated by low interest rates which allow for office developments outside the city center and encourage businesses to consolidate different locations efficiently while reducing costs.
This trend toward new ways of working, such as desk sharing, adds to the overall impact on demand for office space. Desk sharing allows companies to have more flexibility in managing their space requirements and can result in space savings of 10-20 percent on average. The attractiveness of such practices has led more companies to explore similar approaches, further influencing overall demand for office space across the economy.
The article suggests that this rising supply and changing dynamics within commercial properties could potentially lead to an oversupply and increased vacancy rates by the end of 2012. However, it also mentions that the ongoing tertiarization process within industry - where industrial companies orient themselves towards services - will help alleviate any potential oversupply issues as it leads to a growing demand for office spaces.
Overall, this article provides insights into the factors affecting both residential and commercial property markets in Switzerland. It highlights trends such as limited speculative transactions and stricter lending practices that are preventing a complete halt in price growth for residential properties. It also emphasizes factors like desk sharing and businesses moving away from city centers which are impacting demand and vacancy rates within commercial properties. 
This news article discusses the current state of the real estate markets in the United States and the United Kingdom. It suggests that both countries are experiencing a slowdown in residential property prices, but there is still potential for investment opportunities in commercial properties.
In the United States, there has been a construction boom over the past five years, particularly in states like Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and Washington DC. This surge in construction was driven by low supply, growth in employment, expansionist monetary policy, and households redirecting their investments from stock markets to housing. However, sales volumes of newly constructed and existing houses have declined this year compared to last year. Median house prices have also leveled off after significant growth in 2004. Despite this slowdown, Zoltan Szelyes from Credit Suisse Research predicts a "soft landing" rather than a significant price fall.
In the UK, residential housing prices have remained buoyant for several years due to socio-demographic developments. Between 1996 and 2004, cumulative prices rose by 260 percent and have revived again this year despite a slowdown in 2005. Factors such as continued migration increasing demand for housing and a decrease in household size have contributed to this trend.
However, while both countries may be experiencing slower price growth or stability in residential property markets, Szelyes believes that it will not necessarily drag down their respective economies. He suggests that real estate's impact on consumption is overestimated and that income dynamics and employment growth should remain steady next year.
On the other hand, there are still plenty of investment opportunities available for commercial properties worldwide if one knows where to look. Some parts of Asia (Singapore & Tokyo), Eastern Europe (Poland & Czech Republic), Western Europe (German cities), and even Australia (due to high immigration) offer potential rewards for those interested in commercial real estate investments.
The article also discusses Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) as a popular option for investors in the real estate market. REITs allow small investors to participate in the equity ownership of real estate while distributing tax-exempt profits to shareholders. The popularity and potential of REITs are demonstrated by the recent 36 billion dollar buy-out of Equity Office Properties Trust by Blackstone Group.
In summary, while residential property prices may be stabilizing or slowing down in both the US and UK, there are still opportunities for commercial real estate investments worldwide. Szelyes suggests caution when investing in economically volatile countries but highlights potential dynamics and higher yields in regions like Eastern Europe, particularly Romania and Bulgaria. Furthermore, the rise of Real Estate Investment Trusts has made indirect investment opportunities more accessible to small investors around the globe. The article emphasizes that real estate investments have gained significant recognition as a highly regarded asset class since the mid-1990s. Alongside traditional direct investments, there are now various indirect investment opportunities available, which help eliminate potential disadvantages like low liquidity and lack of transparency.
One popular option for investors is the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) structure. REITs were created by a 1960 US act of Congress and allow small investors to participate in the equity ownership of real estate. One advantage of REITs is that they are not allowed to invest in riskier development projects, which provides some level of stability for investors. Additionally, they distribute tax-exempt profits to shareholders.
REITs have rapidly gained popularity and spread worldwide. Since 1994, the combined market capitalization has grown more than five times over. The success and potential of REITs can be observed through recent events such as Blackstone Group's acquisition of Equity Office Properties Trust for $36 billion – which was the largest owner of office buildings in the United States at that time.
Looking ahead, it is expected that REIT structures will continue to expand globally. In fact, they are set to be introduced in the UK next year, further opening up opportunities for small investor participation in real estate ownership.
The article also highlights specific regions where commercial property markets are showing signs of revival or growth potential. German cities, Swedish cities, French cities, Spanish cities, and British cities all demonstrate increased activity within their office property markets combined with strong economic growth. This suggests an accelerated real estate market situation primarily due to limited supply meeting robust demand.
Moreover, Eastern Europe also possesses great prospects for commercial real estate investment due to its relatively limited supply alongside strong economic growth trends. However,Szelyes advises cautiousness when investing in economically volatile countries like Hungary while recommending focusing on Poland and the Czech Republic instead.
In conclusion,the news article points out that while residential property markets might be experiencing a slowdown, there are still potential investment opportunities in commercial real estate globally. Real estate prices might stabilize or decelerate, but it is unlikely to have a severe adverse impact on the overall economy. Additionally, the popularity and growth of REITs further highlight the feasibility of indirect real estate investments for small investors. 
The news article consists of six questions, each with multiple choice options. Let me explain the context and the answers for each question.
Question 1: The question asks about the probability that a blue cab was involved in an accident. However, there is no information provided in the article to determine the color of the cab involved in the accident. Therefore, it is impossible to say what color the cab was.
Question 2: In this question, you are given two jars. Jar A has 50 white balls and 50 black balls, while Jar B contains an unknown number of black and white balls. You are asked to choose a jar and take out a ball. If it is black, you will win 100 Swiss francs.
Since Jar A has an equal amount of white and black balls (50 each), there is a higher chance of picking a black ball compared to Jar B's unknown composition of balls. Thus, it is more likely that you will win by choosing Jar A.
Answer: Choose Jar A.
Question 3: Two scenarios are presented regarding exposure to pathogen X that can lead to quick and painless death within one week:
a) You have been exposed to pathogen X with a likelihood of contracting this disease at exactly 0.1 percent, but there is a vaccine available that can prevent it.
b) A professor conducting research on pathogen X provides an experiment opportunity for participants where they also have a chance (0.1 percent) of contracting the disease without any vaccine available.
In both cases, you are offered compensation for participating or being vaccinated against pathogen X. The question asks how much compensation (in Swiss francs) would be acceptable or how much you are willing to pay for vaccination/participation.
This decision depends on personal values and preferences; however, without additional details about individual circumstances or financial capability/burden associated with payment/compensation options provided in these scenarios, it is difficult to determine a suitable answer. Therefore, it is subjective and depends on personal choice.
Question 4: The question provides information about a group of people where eight out of 1,000 have cancer. Among those with cancer, seven will test positive for cancer, whereas among the 992 people who do not have cancer, 70 will still test positive.
To determine the number of people who test positive and actually have cancer, we compare the number of true positives (people with both cancer and positive tests) with all positive tests:
Out of the eight people with cancer:
- Seven will test positive (true positives).
Out of the total population:
- Seven true positives + 70 false positives = 77 people tested positive.
Therefore, out of all people who tested positive (77), seven actually have cancer.
Answer: A) Seven out of 77 people
Question 5: Two scenarios describe different events resulting in bird deaths due to petroleum spills in the ocean:
a) An oil tanker collision causes over 1,200 bird deaths.
b) Natural oil seepage from earth's crust results in over 1,200 bird deaths.
The question asks about how serious these events are for the environment. The seriousness can be subjective; however, one can infer that an oil tanker collision might be considered more serious than natural oil seepage since human activities are involved.
Answer:
a) The effect is likely to be serious or disastrous (depending on personal interpretation).
b) The effect may be considered unfortunate or at most serious but not necessarily disastrous compared to an intentional human-caused event like an oil tanker collision that resulted in heavier ecological harm/impact on birds and marine life forms.
Question6: This question assesses how likely certain statements are true based on provided information about Linda's background:
A - Linda is active in the feminist movement
B - Linda is a bank teller
C - Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement
Since no information is provided indicating whether Linda is still involved in these activities or if she has pursued any specific career, it becomes difficult to determine a precise likelihood for the statements.
Therefore, without more context about Linda's current activities or profession, it is impossible to assign probabilities (0 to 100) to these statements.
I hope this explanation helps you understand the news article and its questions better. Let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with! 
This news article is about the creation and development of a unique luxury watch by the company HYT. The watch, called the H1, is a mechanical-fluidic hybrid watch that uses two flexible reservoirs filled with different-colored liquids to indicate the time. The concept was conceived by engineer and inventor Vouillamoz, who came up with the idea of using two liquids that repel each other to create a visually stunning display.
Vouillamoz teamed up with his friend Patrick Berdoz, an experienced entrepreneur in the medical technology field, to turn his idea into reality. They recruited additional engineers and together developed the first technical specifications for the watch. Emmanuel Savioz, another experienced start-up entrepreneur, also joined the team and they set up HYT company.
After a year of intensive research and development work, an initial prototype of the H1 was produced. However, before they could start producing luxury watches, they needed to overcome some challenges. Despite having no prior experience in the watch industry, they were able to hire CEO Vincent Perriard in 2010. Perriard had years of experience working for renowned watch companies such as Audemars Piguet and Concord.
The biggest challenges in creating this unique timepiece were finding an interface between the mechanical movement in the watch mechanism and fluid system, housing both systems in a confined space while ensuring perfect interaction between them. Additionally, they had to develop special fluids that meet requirements for resistance to vibration, knocks,and temperature fluctuations.
HYT also developed a special system for adjusting the time ofthe watc hhich prevents mixing ofthe two liquids by controlling their flow rate.Furthermore,the watch mechanism itself hadto be developed from scratch due too much space being taken up by thereservoirscontainingthe liquids.
The conceptofthisnewtypeofwatchwas presentedto variouswatch dealersand distributors starting from summer 2011.The H1 was finally presented to anenthusiastic audience at the Baselworld 2012 watch and jewelry fair. The watch was well-received, with many dealers and collectors paying upfront for their orders, which is unusual in the watch industry.
HYT has already started working on successor models totheH1, includingtheH2,H3,and H4. The target audience for these watches mainly consists of collectors andwatch aficionados from around the world.
To bring their product to market successfully, HYT received funding from SVC Ltd., a renowned investor specializing in risk capital for SMEs. This funding helped HYT deliver on advance orders and further expand their operations to fully exploit the potential of their innovation.
In addition to creating luxury watches, HYT's technology has also opened up new possibilities in other industries. They have acquired unique expertise in microfluidics through the development of the H1 watch, which could be applied to areas such as accurate injections in the medical sector or fragrance diffusion.
Overall, this news article highlights how engineer Vouillamoz's initial idea was transformed into a unique luxury watch through collaboration with experienced entrepreneurs and engineers. The challenges faced during development were overcome by leveraging expertise within different industries. HYT's success with the H1 has opened doors for future innovations and opportunities beyond just luxury watches. 
This news article discusses the forecast for the US currency in 2014. According to analysts, the US dollar's rally against other G10 currencies had stalled in early October. However, despite a slight weakening in December, the dollar has been trending higher since mid-October.
The Bank of England's effective exchange rate data shows that as of January 7th, the dollar is approximately 7 percent stronger than it was at the beginning of 2013. Credit Suisse expects the trade-weighted dollar index to continue rising over the next three months and throughout the year.
The analysts believe that a likely divergence in monetary policymaking among major central banks in 2014 will give further traction to this dollar rally. They provide three examples to support this claim:
1. The Federal Reserve (Fed) announced in December that it would begin reducing quantitative easing measures. This move towards normalization indicates a tightening policy by gradually reducing asset purchases.
2. The Bank of Japan is expected to step up its own asset-buying program early this year due to worries about low inflation levels.
3. The European Central Bank (ECB) is unlikely to raise rates and may even ease further due to concerns about low inflation levels as well.
These divergent policies among central banks suggest that there will be increased strength in the US dollar compared to other currencies.
In addition, Australia's mining investment boom is expected to come to an end soon, causing a major rebalancing of its economy. If Australia's currency value does not fall naturally, it puts pressure on their central bank (Reserve Bank of Australia) to push it down through interest rate cuts once again.
As a result of these factors, Credit Suisse analysts predict that both the yen and Australian dollar will decline substantially against the US dollar. They also anticipate a decrease in euro value later on.
Specifically, they expect USD/JPY exchange rate rise from its current level around 105 yen to about 120 yen for every dollar by the end of this year. They also project a decrease in the value of an Australian dollar against the US dollar, from around 0.89 to 0.80, and a decline in the euro from around 1.36 USD/EUR to around 1.24 USD/EUR by December.
The analysts do not expect these currency movements to be short-lived but rather see them as part of a period where the US dollar outperforms other currencies that historically can last from six to nine years.
They highlight past instances when interest rates rose and how it took some time for the dollar's response to become evident. In most cases, including those between March 1972 and June 2004, the US dollar actually lost value in the first year before strengthening over time.
Investors typically turn to government bonds as a way to profit from changes in exchange rates, with US Treasury bonds being prominent choices for trading dollars. However, since investors may already hold significant amounts of these bonds due to financing the US government's current account deficit, they may have seen their bond values erode as interest rates rise.
This likely made investors wary of buying more treasuries as they feared that new purchases would also decline in value if rates continued climbing higher.
However, now that asset purchases have been reduced by the Federal Reserve and yields are expected to stabilize at a higher level (around 3 percent on ten-year notes), there is an opportunity presented by higher yields which may shift investor mindset towards focusing on potential gains instead of recent capital losses.
In conclusion, this article discusses analysts forecasting an increase in strength for the US currency throughout 2014 due to divergent monetary policies among major central banks and other economic factors impacting different currencies like Australia's mining investment boom ending. The article notes historical patterns where it took some time for currency responses following interest rate changes before eventually strengthening. It also mentions the potential shift in investor mindset towards seeing opportunities in higher yields rather than focusing on past losses.
Overall, Credit Suisse analysts expect the US dollar to outperform other currencies for an extended period, potentially lasting anywhere from six to nine years. 
This news article revolves around a discussion between two individuals, Bigler and Rossini, regarding various topics related to the labor market, unemployment, immigration, national identity, and social cohesion in Switzerland.
The conversation begins with Bigler emphasizing the importance of access to the labor market for individuals. He believes that companies must conduct themselves in a responsible manner during streamlining processes and also focus on creating new job opportunities.
The conversation then shifts to the topic of unemployment and its impact on people's lives. Bigler asserts that losing one's job can deeply affect an individual's sense of self and personal views. Rossini suggests that competition with foreign workers might contribute to higher unemployment rates in French-speaking Switzerland. They both agree that amid humanitarian efforts, there should be careful considerations made between accepting true refugees versus economic refugees.
Rossini highlights the challenges faced by Swiss society due to individualism and emphasizes the need for openness and solidarity as part of their humanitarian tradition. She mentions federalism as an important pillar of national solidarity at both population and governmental levels.
The discussion turns towards political viewpoints regarding patriotism and values such as openness and social justice. Both individuals argue against common stereotypes surrounding these political ideologies.
When discussing national pride, Bigler attributes it partly to Switzerland's successful model during the financial crisis compared to other European countries. Rossini adds that being actively involved in global affairs is necessary for defending Switzerland's interests while recognizing free movement principles upheld by the EU.
Regarding bilateral agreements with the EU, they agree on maintaining a bilateral path while respecting EU rules but also highlighting Switzerland's right to defend its interests effectively without constant interference from proposed solutions.
They urge stakeholders not to foster fear but rather encourage optimism as an engine for innovation, creativity, stability factor, individual commitment, collective progress,and social advancement without hindering economic growth or questioning public sector developments.
Bigler expresses concerns about potential negative impacts on urban-rural voter solidarity caused by initiatives like abolishing lump-sum taxation and proposing an inheritance tax, which could threaten jobs in the SME sector.
In the final part of their discussion, Bigler emphasizes the significance of mutual support and community living for a better quality of life without unwanted government intrusion. Rossini supports this notion and adds that respect, tolerance, and solidarity are crucial qualities for social cohesion, prosperity, and happiness in Switzerland.
Overall, this article presents a dialogue between two individuals with differing perspectives on various topics affecting Switzerland's labor market, immigration policies, national identity, social cohesion, patriotism,and economic considerations. Continuing on from the previous explanation, the article delves into the topic of social cohesion and prosperity in Switzerland. Rossini emphasizes that respect, tolerance, and solidarity are crucial qualities that foster social harmony and contribute to the overall well-being of the country.
The conversation also touches upon economic factors that play a role in Switzerland's stability. Bigler stresses that a strong economy cannot be taken for granted and must consider both economic and political conditions, as well as locational advantages. He raises concerns over potential detrimental effects on tax revenues due to initiatives like abolishing lump-sum taxation. Additionally, he highlights how proposals for an inheritance tax could negatively impact job prospects in small-medium enterprises by jeopardizing succession plans.
Bigler then shifts focus to personal relationships within families and communities. He believes that mutual support, willingness to help one another, and minimizing unwanted government interference lead to a better quality of life, contentment,and social balance.
On a broader scale, Rossini emphasizes once again that respect,tolerance,and solidarity are fundamental values for ensuring social cohesion and prosperity in Switzerland. She argues that these qualities are instrumental success factors not just for coexistence but also for overall happiness within society.
In conclusion, this news article provides insights into a discussion between Bigler and Rossini exploring various aspects affecting Switzerland's labor market access,inclusion policies,national identity,social cohesion,economic considerations,political perspectives,and personal relationships.Throughout their conversation,the two individuals present different viewpoints,together highlighting significant issues while recognizing the need for openness,solidarity,respect,tolerance,and understanding.They stress the importance of positive engagement both nationallyand internationally,to achieve prosperity,stability,and individual fulfillment.Within this context,policies related to immigration,bilateral agreements with EU,maintaining economic stability without compromising societal progress come under scrutiny.The dialogue serves as an informative discourse regarding some noteworthy challenges faced by modern-day Switzerland while highlighting potential ways forward based on mutual cooperation,responsibility towards one another,and continued commitment to humanitarian values. 
The article discusses the economic situation in Argentina and criticizes President Cristina Kirchner's government for not addressing the root causes of the country's economic problems. According to a report by Credit Suisse analysts, the government is only alleviating the symptoms of economic malaise rather than implementing measures to solve them.
The primary problem in Argentina is out-of-control inflation. The government's current approach does not include tightening fiscal policy enough to curb inflation. The heavy public spending and subsidies provided by the government are fueling consumer price rises, which will lead Argentina back into a cycle of economic instability. The analysts predict that by the end of this year, Argentina might have to go through another devaluation, this time larger than before.
The report highlights that Argentina's current economic situation is unsustainable due to an improvised and uncoordinated approach by the government. Instead of addressing underlying causes, they have targeted symptoms like declining reserves. However, it was actually government policies that triggered this decline in reserves, not vice versa.
Foreign investment has been dampened due to actions such as expropriating private company assets, including Spanish oil company Repsol's operations in 2012. Additionally, since its default on international debt in 2001, Argentina has been locked out of international debt markets and forced to use foreign reserves for imports and debt repayment.
Reserves have significantly dropped from over $52 billion in 2010 to $30.6 billion in 2013. Credit Suisse predicts further plummeting with reserves projected at $22.1 billion this year and $15.7 billion in 2015.
The devaluation carried out by the government on January 22 and 23 was seen as a step in the right direction but merely provides temporary relief unless exports increase significantly after March or April when grains and oilseeds harvest begins bringing more dollars into the economy.
To tackle inflation, restrictions on individuals purchasing dollars for savings purposes were relaxed, as a black market for dollars had emerged due to tight currency controls. However, it is believed that dollar outflows have become more restricted since the devaluation, adding pressure on the parallel exchange rate and reserves.
The government plans to negotiate with labor unions in March and keep wage increases at a minimum to control inflation. However, these measures are seen as temporary solutions rather than addressing the root causes of inflation.
Credit Suisse expects inflation to reach 40% this year compared to 28.4% last year. If reserves continue to dwindle below $25 billion by year-end, another devaluation of around 30% might be necessary in the fourth quarter. This could lead to increased social and political tensions and further contraction of the economy.
The article also warns about falling reserves increasing the risk that Argentina may not be able to pay its creditors in 2015. While debt is manageable this year, next year's costs will amount to 56.4% of Credit Suisse's forecast for foreign reserves.
Overall, the article suggests that Argentina's current economic situation is concerning and criticizes the government for failing to address underlying causes or implement sustainable solutions. 
This news article discusses the current environment for stocks and predicts that European and Japanese equities will outperform British and American stocks in the next three to six months. The main reason for this prediction is the differences in monetary policy between these regions.
The article highlights that the Bank of England is expected to start draining liquidity soon, while it remains uncertain when the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates. On the other hand, both Europe and Japan have implemented measures to stimulate their economies. In early June, the European Central Bank introduced negative deposit rates and a targeted long-term refinancing operation (TLTRO), which could inject as much as 1 trillion euros into European banks over the next two years. Additionally, there are expectations that the Bank of Japan will also undertake further stimulus later this year.
According to O'Sullivan, an expert cited in the article, these measures should have a different impact on Europe compared to the United States due to differences in economic structure. While America is more market-driven, Europe relies more heavily on banks. Therefore, injecting more liquidity into Europe's banking system should provide a relatively larger benefit and help prevent deflationary shocks.
The article also mentions positive indicators for both Europe and Japan's economies. In June, European manufacturing expanded for its twelfth consecutive month while services businesses reported growth for an eleventh straight month. If consumer goods and industrial equipment demand continues rising, fresh loans may be sought by businesses looking to expand their operations.
In Japan, there has been an increase in inflation after several years of deflationary pressure. The consumer price index rose by 3.4% and 3.7% year-over-year in April and May respectively –the highest rates in 32 years-. Economists believe this rise is not solely due to retailers increasing prices ahead of a value-added tax hike but rather represents genuine inflationary pressures.
Credit Suisse analysts believe that equities from peripheral countries within Europe have performed well, but some markets, like Italy, may have overheated. They suggest that German stocks, benefiting from a strong economy and expected accelerating growth in the next six months, may present better prospects. Within Japan's equity market, companies included in the TOPIX index have announced substantial stock buybacks this year due to low valuations, low interest rates, and significant cash reserves. O'Sullivan identifies industrials and machinery manufacturers as potentially attractive sectors due to their potential cyclical upturn.
The article concludes by stating that investors in British and American equities have benefitted from central bank policies supporting economic recoveries over recent years. However it suggests that now the focus should shift towards opportunities in European and Japanese equities due to differences in monetary policy.
In summary:
- The article predicts European and Japanese equities will outperform British and American stocks over the next three to six months.
- Differences in monetary policy are a major factor behind this prediction.
- The European Central Bank's introduction of negative deposit rates along with a targeted long-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) is expected to benefit Europe more significantly compared to the US.
- Positive indicators such as manufacturing expansion in Europe and increased inflationary pressures in Japan contribute to these predictions.
- Specific sectors within these regions such as industrials and machinery manufacturers are highlighted as promising investment opportunities. 
This news article discusses the current state of the Swiss economy and provides analysis and projections for the future. The article begins by stating that while only 7 percent of voters expect their personal well-being to decline, two-thirds believe that their situation will remain unchanged. These survey results are consistent with economic indicators showing a moderate level of optimism but also some pessimism in the fall of 2014.
The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which measures the expansion or contraction in Switzerland's industrial sector, indicates continued growth. However, expectations for economic growth have declined since spring due to various factors. One major reason is a slowdown in the eurozone caused by Italy and France slipping back into recession, which has affected Germany, Switzerland's most important trading partner. Additionally, conflicts in Ukraine have led to a drop in German exports to Russia and Eastern Europe.
Germany's economic problems have had a significant impact on Switzerland's export industry, along with persistent economic slowdowns in China and other emerging markets. These negative effects cannot be offset by the relatively weak US economy.
Despite these challenges, Switzerland has been successful in weathering turbulence within Europe thanks to what is referred to as the "super cycle" in its domestic economy. This super cycle can be attributed to low interest rates set by the Swiss National Bank and increased demand for credit-financed residential property and durable goods.
The overall impact on Switzerland's economy will depend on two key questions: whether global growth will return soon and if the super cycle within Switzerland's domestic economy can continue or come to an abrupt end at some point.
Regarding global growth prospects, there are fundamental considerations suggesting that it may remain fragile. High levels of private debt around developed countries coupled with increased public debt make it unlikely that governments will adopt policies promoting growth through investments. Cautious consumers and financial uncertainty also discourage substantial corporate investment. Geopolitical tensions further inhibit investment activity, especially during periods of economic instability when protectionism tends to increase.
Another concern is the progressive aging of the population, which limits growth in Switzerland and other countries.
In terms of the super cycle within Switzerland's domestic economy, there are concerns about increasing household debt as a result of persistently low interest rates and a real estate boom. Regulators are starting to address potential instabilities in the financial system caused by rapid loan growth.
In conclusion, while some moderate optimism exists about Switzerland's economy, there are also reasons for pessimism. Global economic conditions remain fragile due to various factors such as high private and public debt levels and geopolitical tensions. The future of Switzerland's domestic super cycle also poses challenges due to concerns over increased household debt. The article goes on to highlight the difficulty in achieving cooperative and efficient international solutions, especially in stabilizing the international financial system. The multipolar world, which has replaced the dominance of the United States and the West, is marked by ongoing geopolitical tensions that are unlikely to decline in the long term. This further inhibits investment activity.
Furthermore, there is a structural problem contributing to pessimism about Switzerland's future super cycle - the progressive aging of the population. As more people retire and fewer young workers enter the workforce, growth becomes limited.
Additionally, concerns over potential instability in Switzerland's financial system have prompted regulators to impose self-regulatory measures to curb loan growth and address areas of potential risk.
All these factors suggest a cautious outlook for Switzerland's economy. While there are still favorable conditions such as low interest rates stimulating domestic demand for goods and property, external pressures from global economic fragility and geopolitical uncertainties pose significant challenges.
The overall tone of the article leans towards pessimism regarding global economic prospects and potentially an end or slowdown in Switzerland's super cycle. The question of whether robust global growth will return soon seems uncertain due to fundamental considerations such as high debt levels and geopolitical tension.
While it acknowledges that Switzerland has shown resilience against past upheavals in Europe, it remains unclear if this can be sustained given current economic conditions. The article highlights various risks that could impact both domestic demand within Switzerland as well as external factors affecting its export industry.
In conclusion, this news article provides an analysis of survey results indicating moderate optimism from voters but also notes declining expectations for economic growth. It discusses various challenges facing both global economies and specifically Switzerland's domestic economy. The outcome remains uncertain but leans towards caution or even pessimism given existing uncertainties surrounding debt levels, geopolitical tensions, ageing populations, regulatory measures aimed at curbing loan growth and other structural concerns impacting future economic growth. 
This news article is about the Swiss tennis players Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka. Following the Indian Wells tournament, they were jointly leading the annual ranking called "Race to London," which ranks players based on their performance throughout the season. They were followed closely by Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.
The article mentions that Federer and Wawrinka, also known as "Fedrinka," had a successful run in the Davis Cup, winning against Serbia and Kazakhstan. This led Switzerland to its first semifinal since 2003, giving them a chance to reach the competition's final for only the second time in history.
The article then goes on to discuss their performance during the clay season. Both players had some ups and downs but managed to maintain their positions in the Race to London rankings. Federer missed a couple of tournaments due to personal reasons, including his twin sons' birth, while Wawrinka struggled with early exits from several tournaments.
Despite their different performances on clay, both players are still considered strong contenders heading into Wimbledon Championships. The article highlights Federer's dominance on grass courts with his numerous title wins at Wimbledon and Halle. On the other hand, Wawrinka has a negative record on grass but expressed confidence in his preparation for this year's Wimbledon.
Tennis expert Heinz Günthardt believes that if Wawrinka gets through the first week of Wimbledon successfully, he could go far in the tournament. However, Federer is widely regarded as stronger and recently won another grass court tournament at Gerry Weber Open.
The article concludes by mentioning that neither player has much pressure heading into Wimbledon as they both experienced unexpected early losses in previous years' tournaments. Despite this, they continue to support each other's successes and use them as motivation for themselves.
Overall, this news article focuses on Federer and Wawrinka's current rankings in the Race to London, their performance in the Davis Cup, and their prospects for Wimbledon Championships. The news article also discusses the historical success of Federer on grass courts. He is considered the ultimate "grass king" with 14 grass titles, including seven Wimbledon titles and seven Halle titles. His record on grass is impressive, with 125 victories and only 18 defeats throughout his career.
Wawrinka, on the other hand, has not had as much success on grass courts. His record shows 15 victories and 19 defeats, indicating a comparatively weaker performance on this surface. However, Wawrinka remains optimistic about his prospects at Wimbledon this year, stating that he has never been able to prepare for grass as much as he has this time.
Swiss tennis expert Heinz Günthardt believes that if Wawrinka can have a strong start and survive the first week of Wimbledon, there's no reason why he couldn't win the tournament. Despite his past struggles at Wimbledon, Wawrinka has reached the last sixteen in previous years and should not be underestimated.
While Federer still holds a higher ranking than Wawrinka in the Race to London standings, both players are well-positioned to reach the season finale in November in London. The article emphasizes that they support each other rather than seeing each other as rivals. Federer frequently expresses himself as Wawrinka's biggest fan while Wawrinka acknowledges Federer's achievements and uses them as inspiration for himself.
The article also mentions some recent events related to Nadal and Djokovic leading into Wimbledon. Nadal lost his first game in a preparation tournament while Djokovic entered Wimbledon without playing any preparation matches. This could provide an advantage to both Federer and Wawrinka at the beginning of their grass season.
In conclusion, despite their differing records on grass courts, both Federer and Wawrinka have had notable successes recently leading up to Wimbledon Championships. They continue to support each other and are considered strong contenders in the tournament. The article highlights their positions in the Race to London, their performances in the Davis Cup, and their prospects for Wimbledon, showcasing the bond between these two Swiss tennis stars. 
This news article discusses the concerns surrounding sluggish global economic growth after major financial crises. The Vice Chairman of Global Fixed Income and Economics Research at Credit Suisse, Neal Soss, states that it is not unusual to experience periods of slow growth after a financial crisis as various entities retrench, including governments, businesses, financial institutions, and consumers. However, if this retrenchment phase lasts too long, it can lead to more permanent mediocre growth and a decline in investment incentives for businesses.
The article also highlights the potential negative consequences of prolonged sluggish growth. One concern is that the skills of long-term unemployed individuals may deteriorate to the point where they become permanently unemployable. Additionally, if sluggish growth continues without any new fiscal or monetary stimulus on the horizon, there is a risk that the potential of the economy will deteriorate.
The reluctance among world leaders to implement explicit fiscal stimulus due to concerns about public sector balance sheet leverage is causing further worry among economists. For instance, European officials have imposed strict austerity requirements on countries like Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland as part of their bailouts. In the United States too, a combination of tax increases and spending cuts has helped reduce the budget deficit but has also limited economic stimulus measures.
Similarly in Japan and China efforts are being made to reduce deficits by implementing austerity measures and reducing credit availability respectively. Additional monetary stimulus seems unlikely as central banks like Federal Reserve are winding down quantitative easing programs while other central banks have not eased further as expected.
Despite all these factors contributing to short-term pain for different economies across various regions due to reforms or fiscal policies aimed at reducing deficits or containing inflation rates; some positive indicators suggest potential improvements in business spending which could revive global economic activity. US businesses have been recording record profits post-tax which indicates healthy corporate cash flow levels; however private domestic business investment remains weaker than pre-crisis levels suggesting caution among business leadership about medium- and long-term future prospects.
The article concludes by suggesting that an unexpected positive surprise or a few more months of encouraging economic data could potentially boost confidence and prove that the current recovery, although slower and weaker than expected, is sustainable.
Overall, the article highlights concerns about sluggish global economic growth after financial crises and the potential consequences if this situation persists. It also identifies various measures taken by different economies to reduce deficits and contain inflation but discusses how these actions have contributed to short-term pain. Finally, it suggests the need for increased business spending or positive economic surprises to revive global economic activity. In addition to the concerns about sluggish economic growth and the potential risks associated with it, the article also discusses some specific measures taken by various countries in an attempt to revive their economies.
For example, China is trying to rebalance its economy by shifting its focus towards domestic consumption. This shift is expected to create a more sustainable growth model that is not reliant on risky local government borrowing financed by shadow banking. However, this transition has resulted in a decline in China's GDP growth, which is even lower than the government's own forecast.
Another example provided is India's aim to bring down inflation from an average of 8.4 percent since 2005 to 4 percent within two years. To achieve this goal, policymakers are implementing extremely conservative policies that are likely to restrict economic growth.
To counteract these challenges and stimulate economic recovery, increased business spending is suggested as a potential solution. The article highlights favorable conditions for businesses, such as record post-tax profits and high levels of corporate cash flow in the United States. Despite these positive indicators, however, private domestic business investment remains below pre-crisis levels. This cautious approach may be attributed to a lack of confidence among business leaders regarding medium- and long-term prospects.
The article concludes by posing possible solutions or factors that could boost confidence and strengthen the recovery process. It suggests that unexpected positive surprises or continued encouraging economic data could potentially provide the necessary impetus for businesses to invest and drive actual business activity.
In summary, this news article explores concerns surrounding sluggish global economic growth following major financial crises and highlights various measures taken by different countries in response. It emphasizes both short-term pain caused by fiscal policies aimed at reducing deficits or containing inflation rates and potential solutions such as increased business spending or positive surprises that could accelerate global economic recovery. 
This news article discusses the impact of containerization on global trade and the global division of labor since its introduction in the 1960s. The use of containers has revolutionized the shipping industry by eliminating the need to handle goods individually, saving time and money.
The article begins by highlighting how the introduction of containers increased trade volume by almost nine times in the northern hemisphere within a span of 20 years. Port workers' productivity also saw a sharp increase as handling pieces individually became unnecessary. For example, British ports could now handle 30 metric tons of goods per hour, which was over 15 times more than before.
The article acknowledges that while containers may seem logical and obvious today, they were initially seen as impractical due to expensive adjustments required. Container ships cost significantly more than traditional shipping methods, with container cranes costing millions and each container itself being thousands of dollars.
Despite these challenges, Australia was one country besides the US to adopt containers in domestic transportation initially before international usage began in 1966. As standardization took place with container sizes, making transfers between different modes of transport easier, more countries started building port infrastructure for containers in subsequent years.
While broad usage was initially led by US military shipments for wars like Vietnam and Cold War purposes during the late 1960s, providers offering partial containers contributed to wider adoption later on. This allowed smaller companies to utilize containers even if they didn't require an entire one.
Although only around 15 percent of maritime trade volume is transported in containers today, it represents over half of total trade value due to high-value electronics being transported this way compared to commodities like wheat or oil that are not typically containerized.
The center of container trade shifted towards Asia during the early millennium. Asian-North American routes became crucial for trading with just under 22 million standard containers transported in 2012. Asia-northern Europe routes followed closely behind with over13 million containers transported. Asia also houses nine of the ten largest ports, with seven being located in China.
The article mentions that the container industry experienced growth until the financial crisis of 2008, which led to a decrease in container trade volume and ongoing challenges with overcapacity and falling prices. Despite these challenges, larger and more cost-efficient ships capable of carrying over 18,000 containers are being launched.
In response to overcapacity issues, major European shipping companies plan to form alliances to divide up shipping routes and improve efficiency. However, regulatory approval is still pending. Smaller competitors are also considering similar alliances. These consolidations could offer customers a wider range of routes and services while potentially increasing trade integration.
Ultimately, the impact on prices will be influenced by efficiency improvements resulting from alliances formed between shipping providers. Lower rates may be offered as a result of increased efficiency while aiming to squeeze out smaller competitors.
In conclusion, this article highlights how containerization has revolutionized global trade since its introduction in the 1960s. It discusses the benefits it has brought in terms of time-saving, cost reduction, increased productivity at ports, and its role in shaping global division of labor. It also touches upon current challenges faced by the container industry such as overcapacity issues and falling prices due to economic conditions. 
This news article discusses the growing consumer market in China and its impact on various industries. It starts with the prediction that China will soon overtake Japan as the second largest consumer market. Currently, China has a trade surplus of about 7 percent of its GDP, which amounts to roughly $150 billion. While China imports around $800 billion worth of goods, a significant portion is used as inputs for manufactured goods industries that are then re-exported.
The imports into China are mainly focused on oil, mineral ores, components, intermediate goods, and construction equipment. However, there is a small percentage of direct consumer product imports because many multinational companies manufacture their products in China to sell domestically. Luxury products are also imported into the country.
The article highlights some successful luxury brands like LVMH Group (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy) and anticipates their continued success in the Chinese market. High-end automobiles such as BMW are also performing well according to a survey mentioned in the article.
Two important aspects that deserve attention are travel and the property market. The survey data reveals an interesting trend in travel behavior among Chinese consumers. While most people used to work six days a week with very limited vacation time, there has been a shift towards more holiday weeks and increased spend on vacations – almost equivalent to one month's disposable income for some individuals. Domestic travel within China is prevalent due to factors like improved accessibility through internet-based ticket agencies and successful domestic airlines.
As for international vacations, Europe and Southeast Asia attract significant interest from Chinese tourists due to visa policies facilitating individual travel or group visas for Europe destinations. France has specifically advertised its attractions within China while America ranks lower as an appealing destination for Chinese travelers.
In terms of automobile sales, the Chinese auto market continues steady growth but faces challenges related to pricing power and weak brand perception. Respondents from the survey indicate Volkswagen and General Motors have not performed well against competitors in this particular market.
The housing sector is a crucial topic, with around 60 percent of respondents already owning their own property – a result of mass privatization in the late 90s. Additionally, 18 percent of respondents plan to buy properties within the next year, either to upgrade or for first-time purchases. The article emphasizes that property plays a significant role in Chinese consumer wealth and mentions that majority of homeowners are not heavily indebted due to historical factors in property ownership and land distribution by the state.
The article concludes by discussing cultural influences from China on various domains beyond just the economy. These influences can be seen in Hollywood movies featuring Asian settings or an increase in fashion trends utilizing silk. As China's brand power grows, it is expected that Chinese branded goods will achieve success in Western consumer markets as well.
Overall, this news article highlights key insights into China's growing consumer market and its influence on different industries such as luxury goods, automobiles, travel/tourism, and housing.

The individual’s backstory of overcoming challenges as street children also adds depth to their character development within football – not just focusing on talent but also highlighting determination and resilience that paved their way towards success.
 
This news article highlights the success of tennis player Roger Federer in the Cincinnati Masters tournament. The article begins by mentioning that Federer has only won this particular tournament twice before, in 2007 and 2010, and both times he had responded to a defeat in the previous tournament with a victory in Cincinnati.
The article goes on to mention that Federer had played a total of ten matches in just 13 days, and also had to change locations during this time. It also highlights an important final match against David Ferrer, who has previously beaten Federer. Had Federer lost this match, it would have been his sixth final defeat of the season and fourth in the Masters series. This would have been damaging to his confidence.
However, Federer managed to win the final match against Ferrer. Although Ferrer performed exceptionally well during parts of their encounter, winning the second set with relative ease, Federer's response was impressive. He dominated the final set from start to finish and ultimately won the match.
The article continues by stating that this victory is significant for Federer as it is his most prestigious title in two years since winning Cincinnati in 2012. It is also his third title of the season after victories at Dubai and Halle. The win marks his 22nd title in t the Masters series and his 80th overall. Only Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl have achieved more success with 109 and 94 titles respectively.
Federer expressed his joy and satisfaction with the tournament, stating that he got stronger with each round, ultimately bringing out his best tennis during the final set. He emphasized that winning championships in this manner was exactly what he aimed for, making it even more special to be his 80th title. Federer acknowledged that at the beginning of the week, he briefly considered dropping out of Cincinnati due to fatigue from a previous event in Toronto where most matches were played late into the evening. However, he was glad that he decided against it as it led him to this well-deserved victory.
Looking ahead, Federer expressed anticipation for the upcoming US Open while also recognizing the importance of taking a momentary break after an intense period of matches. The article notes that although Federer had won numerous matches during this year's season and became the player with the most match wins so far, he had faced challenges at major tournaments losing to Stan Wawrinka, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic on several occasions.
The article provides updates on these other players as well. Nadal had suffered an injury to his right wrist which caused him to withdraw from several tournaments including New York where he emerged victorious last year. Meanwhile, Djokovic's performance since Wimbledon has been somewhat lackluster having won only two matches in two tournaments since getting married. Wawrinka has also struggled to make significant progress recently.
Nevertheless, Federer's successful run at Cincinnati has renewed hope among both himself and his fans worldwide regarding his ability to finish this year with another grand slam title - which would be his eighteenth one. The article acknowledges Federer's achievements over time as he remains optimistic about competing at Flushing Meadows despite tough competition from Djokovic and Wawrinka. Additionally, the young players Grigor Dimitrov, Milos Raonic, and Kei Nishikori are seen as potential contenders to break into the ranks of grand slam winners.
The article concludes by mentioning Federer's previous triumphs at Flushing Meadows where he was the first professional player to win the US Open five consecutive times from 2004 to 2008. It implies that although his success there has diminished in recent years, this victory in Cincinnati has provided Federer with renewed confidence and inspiration for the upcoming tournament.
Overall, this news article highlights Roger Federer's impressive performance at the Cincinnati Masters tournament, his resilience in overcoming challenges, and his aspirations for further success in future tournaments. 
This news article discusses the anticipation surrounding the launch of Apple's new smartwatch, known as the iWatch or Apple watch. The article highlights that the watch is expected to be a revolutionary product and could potentially be worn by millions of people worldwide.
The article mentions that Apple was granted a patent for a "wrist-worn electronic device" by the relevant authority in the USA on July 22, 2014. Illustrated drawings titled "iTime" show a strap that allows for attachments to be clipped into it. It also states that production has already begun in Asia, according to industry consultant Robert Weiss.
The author points out that what sets Apple's watch apart from competitors is its integration with other devices such as iPhones and iPads. This compatibility with existing devices is seen as crucial for success in the market. The announcement of iOS 8 also showed that Apple is placing emphasis on health functions, leading analysts to speculate on potential medical applications for the device.
Discussions between Apple and the United States Food and Drug Administration have allegedly taken place regarding health-related functionalities, suggesting that one day users may even be able to buy an iWatch through prescription if it can measure vital signs like blood pressure.
Although other companies like Swatch have announced their own smartwatches, experts believe that Apple's product will stand out due to its integration with Siri voice-activated software and its ability to serve as a communication center within an ecosystem of other devices.
Surprisingly, despite discussions between Swatch Group and Apple about potential partnerships, it appears Swatch declined any involvement. Industry consultant Robert Weiss expresses his astonishment at this decision since Swatch possesses expertise in areas such as production technology which could have been beneficial for both companies.
Luxury conglomerate LVMH (Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton S.A.) also seems interested in exploring their own means of accessing this market but without ignoring the new product entirely.
Credit Suisse analyst Uwe Neumann believes that the iWatch cannot stand alone but rather needs to be integrated with Apple's existing products like the iPhone and iPad. He suggests that the watch will provide an incentive for consumers to buy other Apple devices, while also noting the importance of having a wide variety of compatible apps available as previous smartwatches have suffered from inadequate integration.
Neumann further speculates that a slimmed-down and cheaper version of the iWatch might initially enter the market, offering basic functionalities such as receiving emails from linked iPhones. He estimates that this introductory version could cost between $150 and $200, while a fully matured product would likely cost around $350.
Overall, this article emphasizes Apple's entry into the smartwatch market with its highly anticipated iWatch. It highlights potential features, collaborations, and competition in various sectors related to wearable technology. The article suggests that the entry of Apple into the smartwatch market could have an impact on other manufacturers, particularly in the low- and medium-price segments. Fitness wearable companies like Polar may face increased competition and potentially be affected by Apple's presence in the market.
However, despite potential competition, experts believe that Apple's strong brand reputation and existing customer base give them a significant advantage. The integration of their smartwatch with other Apple devices is seen as a key selling point, as customers already invested in the Apple ecosystem are more likely to consider purchasing an iWatch.
The article also mentions that some industry experts see the iWatch as more than just a watch; it is intended to serve as a communication center within the larger ecosystem of devices. Integration with Siri voice-activated software is seen as a particularly intriguing feature that sets it apart from other smartwatches.
While some skeptics may argue that there are already competing smartwatches available on the market, analysts believe that Apple's strong emphasis on integration and its ability to leverage its existing products will give them an edge over competitors.
In terms of production, speculation suggests that manufacturing has already begun in Asia. The decision to headhunt experts from Swiss watchmakers indicates that Apple aims for high-quality production standards. This move might also challenge traditional Swiss watchmakers who could face increased pressure to innovate and adapt to technological advancements in wearable devices.
Overall, this news article highlights how anticipation surrounding one product—the iWatch—has managed to capture attention not only because it represents another innovation from tech giant Apple but also because it has generated discussions about potential impacts on various sectors such as fitness wearables and traditional watchmaking. The integration with existing popular devices and features like health functionalities further add excitement for potential buyers leading up to its expected launch date later in 2014. 
This news article discusses the importance of sleep and the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation on our physical and mental health. It explains how lack of sleep affects our ability to think properly and drive safely, leading people to rely on stimulants like caffeine to stay awake during the day. However, this can make it difficult for them to fall asleep at night. As a result, they may turn to alcohol or sleeping pills to induce sedation, but these don't allow for the necessary biological process of sleep.
The article also highlights that even though we may not be conscious during sleep, we still need it for its numerous benefits. Lack of sleep can affect our interpersonal skills and make us less empathetic towards others. It can also lead to depression as sustained stress from a lack of sleep activates the body's stress response.
Sleep deprivation has also been linked with suppressing the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer. Additionally, insufficient sleep increases the risk of weight gain and obesity as sleepy individuals tend to have higher levels of ghrelin hormone which makes them more likely to eat carbohydrates.
Moreover, as we age, our sleeping patterns change. Younger individuals tend to be night owls whereas older people become morning types due in part to changing sex hormone levels over time.
The human body clock operates on a cycle slightly longer than 24 hours so it needs daily adjustments in alignment with external factors such as light exposure. Light plays a critical role in regulating our internal clock; hence traveling across time zones often results in jet lag where various bodily clocks are out-of-sync until readjustment occurs.
To combat jet lag when traveling westward, seeking morning light is recommended while avoiding morning light but seeking afternoon light is advised when crossing more than six or seven time zones eastward. The use of melatonin as a supplement can aid in adjusting sleeping patterns when transitioning between time zones; however its exact biological impact is still not fully understood.
The article concludes by emphasizing the significance of sleep and suggests seeking out morning light for travelers going west and avoiding morning light for those traveling eastward. It further mentions that taking melatonin can help falling asleep quicker in a new time zone but recommends consulting with a doctor before doing so.
Overall, this news article highlights the importance of prioritizing adequate sleep for optimal physical, mental, and emotional well-being, while providing insights into how sleep deprivation can impact various aspects of our lives. In addition to emphasizing the importance of sleep, the article raises important concerns about individual differences in sleep needs. While there is variation in how much sleep each person requires, some individuals may falsely believe that they don't need much sleep due to chronic fatigue. This has been observed among nighttime taxi drivers who claim not to be tired despite suffering from significant sleep loss. Such misconceptions can have serious consequences, particularly for night-shift workers who may be impaired without realizing it.
To better understand an individual's natural sleep-wake cycle, the article suggests considering what happens on their free days and during vacations when they have more control over their sleeping habits. These periods can provide a clearer reflection of their true internal body clock timing. As we age, our sleep patterns naturally change as well. After the age of 10, we tend to go to bed progressively later and become night owls during our teenage years. However, this trend reverses around the age of 55 as we return to waking up and going to bed earlier, similar to our pre-puberty years.
The human body clock operates on a cycle slightly longer than 24 hours. Even in constant darkness and temperature conditions like being inside a cave, individuals would still fall into a regular rhythm of sleeping and waking; however, they would gradually shift their schedule by approximately 30 minutes each day due to this extra time in the internal cycle. This phenomenon mirrors what people experience during jet lag when adjusting between different time zones.
During jet lag adjustment periods, various clocks throughout our bodies (such as those found in the brain, liver, stomach) become temporarily out of sync with one another until they realign with external time cues provided by light exposure at the new location. The re-synchronization process typically takes about a day for every time zone crossed.
The article offers simple advice for travelers: when traveling westward seek morning light whenever possible since adapting to an expanding day is easier. Conversely, when traveling eastward and facing a contracting day, it is suggested to avoid morning light for three days at the destination and instead seek out afternoon light. These recommendations are based on the understanding that exposure to specific light signals can help reset our internal body clock more effectively.
While many people turn to melatonin as a supplement to aid in adjusting their sleep patterns, the precise biological impact of melatonin is not fully understood. It is known that melatonin production increases during nighttime when it's dark. Taking melatonin supplements provides the body with an artificial "dark signal," potentially enhancing the effects of light on resetting our body clocks. However, more research is needed to definitively establish its mechanisms and efficacy.
Recent findings from a study published in the journal "Cell" shed light on why it takes time for our bodies to adapt to new light-dark cycles when traveling across time zones. Understanding this process could significantly improve strategies for managing jet lag in the future.
In summary, this news article sheds important insights into the significance of sleep and its impact on various aspects of our lives such as cognitive function, emotional well-being, physical health, and even safety while driving. It also delves into individual differences in sleep needs and provides tips for coping with jet lag based on adjustments to environmental cues like light exposure. By understanding these factors better, we can improve our management of sleep-related issues and promote overall health and well-being.

This news article discusses the importance of slowing down and taking a break in our fast-paced world. The author emphasizes the need to appreciate and reflect on the past, history, and classical music as a way to counterbalance our frantic lives.
The article highlights how nostalgia has become prevalent in our society today. Museums, days of remembrance, history books, and old music are all ways for people to connect with the past. The author believes that this craving for a slower pace of life is why there are so many cultural offerings related to memories and classical music.
The Festival mentioned in the article aims to bring together these two worlds - the present and the past - in an intriguing way. The program is designed to confuse listeners positively, challenging them to discern whether they are listening to music from centuries ago or compositions created recently. This creative approach intends for audiences to reflect upon and ponder these musical experiences.
The Festival also offers flexibility by allowing attendees to come and go as they please during concerts. This freedom mimics how every musical work contains pauses where surprising moments often occur. By providing opportunities for breaks within performances, this creates a space for unexpected encounters with art.
An interesting aspect of the Festival is its collaboration with various musicians and ensembles like the Chamber Choir, Davos School of Music, Swiss Army Band, among others. By merging different artistic backgrounds together on stage during performances conducted by Dalia Stasevska with cellist Nicolas Altstaedt and pianist Friedrich Gulda playing alongside musicians from the Swiss Army Band; acute attention will be drawn towards experiencing new soundscapes.
The Swiss Army's involvement arose when Ueli Maurer was approached regarding his ministry's responsibility over safeguarding careful study through listening - something deemed endangered by those involved in organizing this eventful festival – which lead him promising 120 soldiers in their capacity as musicians from their very own Swiss Army Band.
One important theme shared throughout this piece is the notion of youth. The author believes that being young is not just about age; it also encompasses a carefree, original, and unreflective mindset. By combining the perspectives and experiences of both young and old musicians, the festival aims to create a unique and enriching experience for both performers and audiences alike.
The festivals' intention is not merely limited to hosting concerts; it aspires to become a platform for inspiration, an escape from daily routines or responsibilities. It encourages open-mindedness among participants, fostering an environment where questioning assumptions and engaging in discussion are encouraged.
The article concludes by mentioning that the opening piece at the Festival will be "Living Room" composed by American composer John Cage. This piece symbolizes the potential for anything to happen within this welcoming space created by the festival organizers. Davos itself is described as one big living room with its doors wide open, inviting people from all walks of life to gather together.
The author recognizes that most profound experiences occur before and after concerts when individuals discuss their thoughts and reflections on what they have heard. Surprisingly, they even express their desire for listeners to get incredibly bored during performances because boredom allows time to pass slowly – an amazing phenomenon according to them.
Overall, this news article highlights how important it is for individuals in our modern world filled with hectic schedules and constant distractions, to pause, reflect upon history while enjoying classical music alongside contemporary compositions featured at this unique festival held in Davos. 
This news article discusses the result of slower employment growth in Switzerland and the potential impact it will have on the economy. Despite this slowdown, one factor that remains constant is that interest rates will remain at zero for the next year. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to take a more expansionary approach to combat deflation risks, and as a result, Credit Suisse economists believe that the Swiss National Bank (SNB) will also maintain its zero interest rate policy to preserve the minimum exchange rate between the euro and Swiss franc.
The article points out that Switzerland has experienced low inflation rates and business cycle risks, which give no reason for SNB to change its monetary policy. This has resulted in consumer growth losing momentum compared to previous years when it was above 2 percent. Credit Suisse economists are predicting lower growth rates of 1.2 percent for this year and 1.0 percent for next year.
Several factors have contributed to this slowdown in consumer growth, such as saturation in the market for consumer durables and declining numbers of new consumers due to slower immigration. Additionally, price discounts driven by exchange rate appreciation are no longer happening, and distortions caused by hospital financing restructuring are disappearing.
The article also mentions lower levels of capital spending predicted for 2014 and 2015 due to subdued demand for exports. The trend is expected to continue with capital spending on machinery and equipment forecasted at 1.0 percent and 2.0 percent respectively in those years.
The approval of an initiative against mass immigration has had a small effect on lowering investment propensity as well. However, most companies surveyed have not made any changes to their capital spending plans outside Switzerland despite some intending to increase spending abroad due to changes in operating environments.
Given slow recovery in the eurozone and depressed investment climate globally, it is unlikely that Swiss export sector recovery will be sufficient enough to make up for lost momentum domestically.
Credit Suisse economists predict export growth of 5.0 percent in the coming year, after 3.0 percent in 2014, but it may not be enough to compensate for other economic factors.
The article also touches upon the importance of Switzerland's relationship with the European Union (EU) and how Swiss exporters have benefited more from bilateral agreements than the EU has. It also mentions the impact of a slowing super-cycle in China and other emerging economies on global demographic trends, highlighting that countries like China and Germany face declining populations which could affect long-term economic growth.
In Switzerland, there is concern that without immigration and increased labor force participation from women and older employees, economic growth will decline significantly. The article suggests that unless these changes occur, there could be economic stagnation in Switzerland within a little over 10 years.
The news article concludes by mentioning other topics covered in 'Monitor Switzerland' such as fiscal importance of expenditure-based taxation between cantons, forecasts for the real estate market, and a commentary on an extended Free Trade Agreement with the EU.
Overall, this news article highlights various factors contributing to slower employment growth in Switzerland and discusses their potential impacts on different sectors of the economy. 
The news article discusses the resurgence of vinyl records in the music industry. It highlights how vinyl, once considered obsolete with the rise of CDs, has experienced a surprising comeback in recent years.
The article starts by mentioning that vinyl sales have been steadily increasing for eight consecutive years in the US. In contrast, CD sales have seen a decline. According to Nielsen SoundScan, vinyl sales were up 46 percent in the first eight months of 2014 compared to the previous year, while CD sales declined by 19 percent during the same period.
The popularity of vinyl is further emphasized by Jack White's album "Lazaretto," which became the best-selling vinyl record since Pearl Jam's "Vitalogy" released in 1994. Around 67,000 vinyl copies were sold, accounting for 25 percent of its total US sales. Despite these successes, however, it is important to note that vinyl still represents only about 6.5 percent of the overall music market and remains far smaller than CDs.
Interestingly, independent record stores have become instrumental in driving this resurgence. The article mentions stores like Brooklyn's Permanent Records and San Francisco's Amoeba Music selling about two-thirds of total vinyl records in the US. Record Store Day has also played a significant role by allowing music stores to celebrate and promote vinyl through special releases.
Large retailers such as f.y.e and Target have also recognized this trend and are actively promoting and selling turntables alongside their other products. Major labels are getting involved too by releasing new albums on vinyl format—an occurrence not seen since the '90s.
Artists themselves are utilizing vinyl as an avenue for increased revenue. They can charge more for physical records compared to digital downloads and use special releases or promotions linked with their albums' physical editions to engage fans more effectively.
The article attributes consumer demand as a driving force behind this revival. Audiophiles appreciate that listening to music on vinyl offers superior sound quality to modern, data-compressed audio formats like mp3. Mainstream music buyers are also seeking the joy of owning a physical record collection and appreciating the artwork and packaging that accompanies vinyl records. This experience is often lost in streaming or digital purchases.
In conclusion, vinyl records have experienced a remarkable comeback in the music industry. Despite its small market share compared to CDs, vinyl sales have been steadily increasing for several years. Independent record stores, special events like Record Store Day, and the support of major retailers have played crucial roles in driving this resurgence. Artists have also recognized the potential benefits of releasing albums on vinyl format—not just for nostalgia but also as a means to generate higher revenue. Ultimately, it is consumer demand that is fueling this trend, with individuals seeking out the richer sound quality and overall experience that can be found through vinyl records. The article goes on to mention that vinyl sales have provided a much-needed boost for artists and retailers in a challenging market. The music industry has been grappling with declining digital sales, as online purchases of music fell for the first time in 2013 due to the rise of streaming services. This trend continued in 2014, with digital sales falling by 13 percent through August.
Vinyl has emerged as an unexpected ally for artists and retailers because it offers a physical format that fans are willing to pay more for. This is especially advantageous for independent artists who can showcase their creativity through unique vinyl packaging and special releases tied to their albums. By doing so, they can stimulate their fan base and generate additional revenue.
Notably, the popularity of vinyl is not solely driven by classic rock bands from the past when LPs were dominant. Contemporary artists like Arctic Monkeys, Beck, The Black Keys, and Lana Del Rey have also seen significant success with vinyl releases.
Moreover, nearly every major label is now releasing new albums on vinyl format—something that had not happened since the '90s when CDs took over. This further demonstrates how prevalent this trend has become across the industry.
While vinyl's resurgence is undoubtedly impressive, it is important to note that it still represents only a small fraction of overall music sales. In fact, at just 6.5 percent of the CD market size in terms of units sold (approximately 5.6 million records through August), it falls far short of offsetting the challenges faced by the struggling music industry.
However, despite its relatively small market share compared to digital formats or even CDs, vinyl's growth holds significant value beyond just numbers and percentages. Its re-emergence highlights consumers' desire for a more tangible music experience—one that provides superior sound quality and allows them to appreciate album artwork and packaging.
In conclusion, though still representing a relatively small portion of the overall music market size-wise, vinyl has managed to defy expectations and experience a notable comeback in recent years. Independent record stores, special events like Record Store Day, and the support of major retailers have all played their part in fueling this resurgence. Artists have found new opportunities for revenue generation through vinyl releases. The revival is largely driven by consumer demand for a more immersive music experience that values sound quality and the physicality of owning records. As a result, vinyl has become an important ally for artists and retailers looking to navigate an increasingly challenging music landscape. 
The news article discusses the current state of emerging markets (EM) and provides insights on whether it is a good time to invest in them. It highlights several factors that need to be considered both strategically and tactically.
Strategically, the article suggests that buying EM investments should be considered when their currency and equity markets are cheap. It also mentions that if commodities are likely to outperform the cycle, it could present a good opportunity for investment. Additionally, addressing fundamental problems such as excessive private sector leverage and abnormally low levels of unemployment is crucial for EM countries.
Tactically, the article mentions two buy signals: hedge fund exposure to EM, which dropped to a 3-year low in March; and EM funds, which have experienced high outflows close to a 12-year high. However, other tactical indicators such as earnings momentum, relative economic momentum, government yields, and price momentum are currently neutral.
The overall consensus from both strategic and tactical indicators does not favor buying into EM at the moment. The article suggests that while some individual countries may still be of interest within the broader emerging market landscape, caution should be exercised before making any investment decisions.
The characteristics of emerging markets have changed over the past decade. There have been fewer crisis situations compared to previous decades. Emerging markets have become less volatile compared to developed markets (DM) and are more tightly correlated amongst themselves as well as with DMs.
To diversify a DM equity portfolio successfully within emerging markets:
1. Buy on cheap valuations: Buying when dividend yields are high and price/earnings ratios (P/E) low tends to produce higher subsequent returns.
2. Buy on currency weakness or recent GDP weakness: This strategy has been effective historically.
   
The article also provides some insights into specific regions within emerging markets:
1. Latin America: The region's growth has been closer to developed markets rather than other emerging market regions like Asia or Eastern Europe. The underinvestment in infrastructure, both tangible and intangible, has contributed to this slower growth. However, there are efforts being made to address this issue through long-term strategic plans. Additionally, private consumption in countries like Mexico and Brazil have been booming due to the rise of the middle-income class.
2. China and India: These two largest markets differ significantly from each other. China records a wide range of incomes while India mostly consists of low-income consumers. It is worth noting that a significant number of households have entered the middle-income bracket in Brazil since 2010. 
In summary, emerging markets have evolved over the past decade and are currently showing mixed signals for investment opportunities. While some individual countries may still offer potential interest within these markets, caution should be exercised before making any investment decisions considering both strategic and tactical indicators mentioned in the article . The article also highlights the importance of understanding the characteristics and demographics of emerging market consumers. It states that the majority of EM consumers are still very poor, but the emergence of a middle class is significant, particularly in countries like Brazil. The rise of this middle-income class has led to increased consumption in these countries.
Furthermore, the article mentions that EM consumers tend to be young, with those aged 18-29 earning more than those aged 56-65 in seven out of the nine countries polled. This younger age group is also spending their money on various goods and services.
It is important to note that despite these positive factors related to consumer demographics and growth potential, other challenges remain for emerging markets. These challenges include issues such as excess private sector leverage and low levels of unemployment.
The article emphasizes caution when considering investments in emerging markets, stating that both strategic and tactical indicators currently do not support buying into EM as a whole. However, it suggests that certain individual countries may still present opportunities within this broader landscape.
The overall tone of the article suggests that while there are some positive aspects to consider within specific regions or demographic groups in emerging markets, investors should approach with caution due to the challenging economic conditions faced by many EM nations.
It's worth mentioning that this analysis represents Credit Suisse's viewpoint at a particular point in time and does not guarantee future performance or conditions in emerging markets. Investors should conduct their own research before making any investment decisions.
 
This news article discusses the success and impact of the cashless money transfer system called M-Pesa in Kenya. M-Pesa is a service operated by Safaricom, the leading cell phone company in Kenya, that allows users to transfer money using their mobile devices. The article highlights how M-Pesa has revolutionized payment methods in Kenya and even other parts of Africa.
The article begins by explaining that M-Pesa offers a convenient and easy way for Kenyans to pay for purchases, transportation, and services using their mobile phones. It emphasizes that this system has become more accessible than traditional methods of payment found in major cities around the world. The name "M-Pesa" originates from combining "mobile" with "pesa," which means money in Swahili, one of Kenya's national languages.
The success of M-Pesa started eight years ago when many Kenyans already owned mobile phones with Safaricom numbers. The creators of M-Pesa recognized this opportunity and turned these phone numbers into virtual bank accounts. Users could upload money to their phone and send it to other Safaricom customers within minutes. This service quickly gained popularity, resulting in millions of active users within months.
Today, there are over 20 million registered customers who can use more than 83,000 agents across cities and rural areas for uploading, sending or receiving money through M-Pesa.
However, transferring money between cell phones is just one aspect of what M-Pesa can do now. Users can also pay utility bills (electricity and water), withdraw cash from ATMs using their M-Pesa account balance as well as buy airline tickets or concert tickets directly from their mobile phones. Furthermore,M- Pess encourages saving by offering savings accounts through partnership with Commercial Bank of Africa; interest rates start at 2 percent up to a certain amount.
Mention is made about how important the system is to Kenya's economy; transactions via M-Pesa represent 39 percent of the country's GDP. The success of M-Pesa has inspired its expansion into other countries such as Tanzania, Egypt, Afghanistan, India, and several others in Africa. In fact, it has even been introduced in Romania as a trial market for Europe.
The article also notes that while banks initially viewed M-Pesa as competition and fought against it, they eventually recognized the opportunities it presented. Banks have now come on board with supporting M-Pesa by enabling transfers to M-Pesa accounts and facilitating the system's savings and loan functions.
The article concludes by highlighting individuals like Billy Warero who use M-Pesa for various financial transactions such as paying bills or shopping at supermarkets. It emphasizes how the banking industry has benefited from this revolution by allowing customers to transfer funds between their bank accounts and M-Pesa accounts.
Overall, this news article provides an overview of how M-Pesa has transformed money transfer and payment methods in Kenya through mobile phone technology. It shows that this electronic payment system is not only convenient but also essential to many Kenyans' financial activities. The article goes on to explain that M-Pesa has had a significant impact on the economy of Kenya. According to the Central Bank of Kenya, the value of all transactions made through M-Pesa between June 2013 and June 2014 accounted for 39 percent of the country's GDP. This highlights how integral M-Pesa has become in facilitating financial transactions and contributing to economic growth.
The success and potential of M-Pesa have not gone unnoticed beyond Kenya. The article states that Safaricom has expanded its operations by introducing M-Pesa in other African countries such as Tanzania, Egypt, Afghanistan, India, and plans to expand further into Uganda, Zambia, Mozambique, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It even mentions that Vodafone exported M-Pesa to Romania as a test market for Europe.
This global expansion demonstrates the value and applicability of mobile money transfer systems like M-Pesa across different regions with varying levels of financial inclusion. It offers a solution for individuals who previously had limited access to banking services or faced challenges with traditional payment methods.
The article also highlights how M-Pesa has empowered rural Kenyans who previously had few banking options. These individuals have transitioned from relying solely on agriculture-based income into embracing digital financial services provided by mobile technology. By enabling them to transfer money easily from one cell phone to another and pay their bills or access loans digitally, M-Pesa has bridged the gap between these communities and mainstream financial services.
Furthermore, there is an emphasis on how users are encouraged to save through their participation in this system. Safaricom's partnership with Commercial Bank of Africa allows customers to open savings accounts via their mobile phones. This inclusionary approach not only promotes financial literacy but also provides an opportunity for individuals who may have never earned interest before in their lives.
As mentioned earlier in the article regarding Billy Warero's experience using M-Pesa for various transactions instead of going to the bank, it highlights how even though banks initially viewed M-Pesa as a competitor, they have now integrated their services with the mobile payment system. This shows that traditional financial institutions have recognized the value and convenience of digital payment systems like M-Pesa and have adapted accordingly.
In conclusion, the article portrays M-Pesa as a groundbreaking and highly successful electronic payment system that has transformed the way people in Kenya conduct financial transactions. It emphasizes how this mobile money transfer service has not only provided convenience but also improved access to financial services for individuals in both urban and rural areas. With its widespread adoption in Kenya and expansion into other countries, M-Pesa is not just a local success story but a global example of how technological innovation can bring about meaningful changes in financial inclusion and economic development. 
This news article provides an overview of the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the significant role it plays in the United States economy and global financial systems. The Fed is a central government agency, known as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, which is responsible for controlling all US dollars in circulation and influencing international liquidity.
The article explains that there are seven members on the Board of Governors, each nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. These governors serve a full term of 14 years, ensuring their independence from political pressure. The President also nominates one member to serve as chairman of the Board, who holds considerable power and influence over monetary policy.
The Chairman of the Fed not only oversees its operations but also serves as chairman of another important committee called Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This committee holds eight meetings per year to discuss interest rate policy and make decisions on whether to raise or lower key interest rates.
The Fed's decisions are crucial not only for domestic monetary policy but also have significant implications internationally. As they control all US dollars in circulation, their actions impact global liquidity levels and can affect currencies worldwide.
The article highlights Alan Greenspan's tenure as Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006. Greenspan was widely regarded as a legend during his time at the helm due to his astute analyses and measures regarding monetary policy. His mysterious communication style during FOMC meetings added to his legendary status, often leaving analysts interpreting his words with speculation.
Greenspan's policies contributed to an unprecedented economic boom in America lasting almost a decade between 1992 and 2000—the longest period of sustained growth in American history. He found support among Wall Street brokers who admired him greatly.
Upon stepping down from his position|on January 31, 2006|Alan Greenspan was succeeded by Ben Bernanke—Bush’s economics adviser at that time—who subsequently became the new chairman of the Federal Reserve. The article notes that Bernanke, unlike Greenspan, is an academic and has not previously worked in a free market economy. However, his vast knowledge and expertise make him highly regarded among economists.
The article concludes by emphasizing the uncertainties that lie ahead for Bernanke and highlights the importance of his ability to navigate challenges such as strong inflation or a severe recession. If he succeeds in maintaining economic stability, he can build confidence among markets and stabilize the economy further.
In summary, this news article provides an overview of the Federal Reserve's role in overseeing monetary policy in the United States. It highlights key figures like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke who have held influential positions as Fed chairman and discusses their impact on domestic and global economies. Furthermore, the article underscores the significance of the Federal Reserve's role in maintaining a healthy banking system and a stable economy. The Fed's primary responsibility is to ensure that banks operate soundly and efficiently, minimizing risks to financial stability.
The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the FOMC, has the power to set interest rates. By adjusting these rates, they can influence borrowing costs for businesses and individuals, thereby affecting spending and investment behaviors that impact economic growth.
Given its immense power over monetary policy and its influence on global economies, every statement made by the Fed chairman carries substantial weight. Investors closely scrutinize their remarks for hints on future policy decisions or shifts in economic sentiment. This interest is evident from brokers hanging onto Alan Greenspan's every word throughout his tenure as chairman.
Alan Greenspan was renowned not only for his expertise in economics but also for his enigmatic communication style during FOMC meetings. He intentionally chose cryptic language at times, leaving it up to market participants to interpret his messages accurately—a strategy that added an air of mystique around him.
Despite Greenspan's penchant for secrecy within FOMC meetings, he was widely acknowledged as one of history's most influential central bankers—referred to by some as the greatest Fed chairman ever. His policies were credited with fostering sustained economic growth during his tenure.
Following Alan Greenspan's departure in 2006 came Ben Bernanke—the man tasked with stepping into these sizeable shoes as chairman of the Federal Reserve. While differing from Greenspan in professional background – being an academic rather than having experience within free markets – Bernanke was well-regarded among economists due to his extensive knowledge and expertise.
The article mentions that Bernanke had been serving on the Board of Governors since 2002 before being appointed as chairman by President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers in 2005 ahead of taking office early next year. The author highlights Bernanke's strength as a specialist, making him untouchable in that regard.
Despite the recognition of Bernanke's capabilities, uncertainties lie ahead for his tenure. The article cites the conservative American Enterprise Institute, which predicts that volatile challenges are on the horizon. As chairman of the Fed, Bernanke will be tasked with maintaining a delicate balance between managing inflation and avoiding a severe recession. Successfully navigating such hurdles will enable him to inspire confidence in both markets and the broader economy.
In conclusion, this news article offers insight into the Federal Reserve's crucial role in shaping monetary policy within the United States while influencing global financial systems. It discusses influential figures like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke – former and current Fed chairs – emphasizing their impact on economic stability and prosperity. Additionally, it acknowledges uncertainties surrounding Bernanke’s leadership during testing times but also highlights his vast knowledge as an asset to overcome upcoming challenges effectively. 
This news article discusses the concerns surrounding the Swiss National Bank's (SNB) balance sheet, which has reached a record level of 75% of gross domestic product (GDP) as a result of massive foreign exchange purchases during the euro crisis. Despite economic data pointing towards deflationary trends, there are fears that this development could lead to uncontrollable inflation and distort savings and investment decisions in the private sector.
The article dismisses the idea of reintroducing simple, mechanical rules for central bank behavior, such as a return to the gold standard. It argues that historical evidence shows that adherence to rigid rules during times of crisis can increase economic instability. The Taylor rule, which proposed using interest rates based on capacity utilization and inflation rates to achieve stable inflation targets, is also criticized for failing to prevent severe economic imbalances.
Instead of focusing solely on the size of central banks' balance sheets, the article suggests that improving financial stability requires attention to be given to the entire financial system's balance sheets. It mentions an initiative called "full money" that aims to prevent commercial banks from creating money through lending by requiring all assets to be financed by central bank money. However, it argues that this approach would nullify decentralized information systems brought about by competition between financial companies and would not prevent future crises as "shadow banks" could still create money.
The article suggests that strengthening capital bases and increasing responsibility for banks and financial institutions are more effective approaches in addressing risks associated with lending and money creation. It highlights Switzerland's efforts in strengthening its financial stability through regulatory measures.
From a regulatory standpoint, the article raises concerns about political pressure on central banks if they were solely responsible for money creation under a full money system. It argues that maintaining market-driven banking systems with stronger boundaries between monetary authority and financial regulation is preferable.
It also warns against potential misallocations of capital due to policies like government bond purchases by central banks leading to speculative bubbles. The article proposes two pillars for regulatory policies: strengthening the independence of central banks from politics and ensuring long-term fiscal stability through mechanisms like the debt ceiling.
In conclusion, the article emphasizes the need to address concerns about inflation, financial stability, and potential misallocations of capital in a comprehensive manner without relying on simplistic rules or solutions. It advocates for a balanced approach that considers various factors and reinforces both the independence of central banks and fiscal responsibility. The article further expresses concerns about the blurred boundaries between monetary and financial policy since the financial crisis, leading to an increased fear of inflation. It argues that when central banks buy government bonds, they effectively finance government deficits and make it easier to refinance debt. This policy, coupled with rising asset values, can potentially lead to the misallocation of capital and speculative bubbles.
In response to this mixing of monetary and financial policies, the article suggests two key pillars for regulatory measures. Firstly, it recommends strengthening the independence of central banks from political influence. By ensuring that central banks are free from political pressures, they can make unbiased decisions based on economic considerations rather than short-term political interests.
Secondly, the article advocates for fiscal policy obligations to maintain long-term fiscal stability. It mentions a successful approach in Switzerland where a debt ceiling is built into their constitution. Expanding this concept to other areas like financing social welfare could reduce pressure on monetary policy by promoting responsible fiscal management.
Despite these suggestions, the article acknowledges that many industrialized countries face significant challenges in managing their debt dynamics. It suggests that these challenges may hinder efforts towards maintaining long-term fiscal stability and increase reliance on monetary policy as a problem-solving tool.
Overall, the article highlights several risks associated with current macroeconomic conditions and raises important questions about how best to address them. It cautions against simplistic solutions or rules for central bank behavior but emphasizes comprehensive approaches that strengthen financial stability while maintaining independence for central banks and promoting responsible fiscal policies.
It concludes by suggesting that a realistic assessment of debt dynamics is crucial in understanding potential risks facing industrialized nations today. By acknowledging these risks and adopting appropriate measures within both monetary and fiscal domains while respecting institutional boundaries, countries may be better equipped to navigate complex economic challenges in a more stable manner 
This news article discusses the impact of buying stocks that trade less frequently, such as hourly instead of every minute. The author introduces two concepts: a liquidity premium and a popularity premium.
The liquidity premium refers to the additional return that can be created by investing in less liquid stocks, which are typically riskier. However, the author argues that this extra return might not necessarily be a risk premium because stocks that trade less often actually show lower volatility and do not seem more risky.
On the other hand, the popularity premium suggests that stocks with higher trading volumes are more popular among investors. The author points out that there is mispricing in these heavily traded stocks because they become "too" popular. This mispricing occurs due to their high demand and can lead to different return structures among less popular and more popular stocks.
The article draws a comparison between bond markets and equity markets. In bond markets, investors can see the yields to maturity upfront, providing clarity on future returns. In contrast, equity market returns are volatile and difficult to predict since investors only see the end result rather than forward returns.
Furthermore, there is behavioral bias in the equity market where people tend to be attracted to highly traded stocks despite having no clear indication of their future performance. This behavior parallels consumer choices based on brand popularity; individuals may be willing to pay more for popular brands without considering underlying value or quality.
Mispricings exist in both bond and equity markets but may be smaller and more visible in bonds than equities due to their mathematical nature with visible spreads. Liquidity is also an important consideration as investors require some liquid assets alongside illiquid ones like real estate or private equity investments. It is noted that illiquid assets can pose challenges during financial crises when selling becomes difficult at favorable prices.
The article mentions an interesting argument suggesting retail investors tend to follow opposite trends compared to overall stock market movements - selling after crashes and buying after rises - potentially indicating suboptimal trading behavior. Restricting overtrading by retail investors might lead to better performance. However, despite potentially making wrong decisions due to liquidity preference, people still desire liquidity.
In conclusion, the article emphasizes the impact of trading frequency on stock returns and perceived risk. Different return structures exist among less popular and more popular stocks, with mispricing occurring in heavily traded ones. It highlights the visibility of yield-to-maturity in bond markets compared to equity markets' volatile returns and discusses the challenge of balancing liquidity with illiquid investments. Overall, investor behavior is influenced by popularity and liquidity despite potential drawbacks in decision-making processes. The article further delves into the benefits of investing in stocks that trade less frequently. One significant advantage highlighted is the ease of selling these stocks in times of crisis without having to accept substantial discounts. This suggests that low-frequency trading stocks offer a level of liquidity and stability during turbulent market conditions, making them more attractive to investors seeking steady returns.
The author also touches upon the behavior of retail investors in relation to stock market trends. It is noted that retail investors tend to sell their holdings after a market crash and buy when prices have already risen. This behavior implies that emotional decision-making based on fear and herd mentality often leads retail investors to make suboptimal investment choices.
However, the article acknowledges that despite these irrational tendencies, people still have a strong preference for liquidity. The desire for liquidity stems from various reasons such as meeting immediate financial needs or having the flexibility to adjust investments according to changing circumstances. Restricting or discouraging overtrading by retail investors might theoretically lead to better performance, but it overlooks the fundamental need individuals have for liquid assets.
In addition, there is a mention of evidence suggesting that overall stock market trends tend to go against what retail investors do – essentially moving in an opposite direction. This observation further supports the notion that uninformed behavioral biases can impact investment outcomes negatively.
To conclude, the article seeks to shed light on two premiums associated with different trading frequencies: liquidity premium and popularity premium. It highlights how heavily traded stocks often experience mispricing due to their popularity among investors while less frequently traded stocks exhibit lower volatility without necessarily being riskier. The comparison between bond markets and equity markets emphasizes the importance of visibility regarding future returns in determining risk and making informed investment decisions.
Despite acknowledging potential flaws resulting from emotional decision-making processes driven by popularity and liquidity preferences, it underscores people's inherent desire for liquidity in investment portfolios while also recognizing its importance for asset diversification purposes during financial crises.
Overall, understanding various premiums, investor behavior, and the role of liquidity is crucial in comprehending market dynamics and making informed investment choices. The article provides insights into these factors, highlighting the complexities involved in trading frequencies and their impact on stock prices and market efficiency. 
This news article discusses the European Central Bank's (ECB) quantitative easing (QE) program and its potential impact on the Eurozone. QE is a monetary policy tool used by central banks to stimulate economic growth and combat deflation. It involves the purchase of government bonds and other assets from banks, thereby injecting liquidity into the financial system.
The article highlights that the ECB's QE program will involve buying €60 billion worth of assets per month from March 2015 until at least September 2016. This amounts to a total of €1,140 billion, slightly above market expectations. It is estimated that around €40 billion per month will be allocated to sovereign bonds, totaling approximately €760 billion.
The article explains that commercial banks in Northern Europe may have little interest in participating in the program because they can borrow at similar rates in the market. Additionally, weak demand for corporate credit in some Eurozone countries limits their banks' need for ECB loans. The structure of the Eurozone's central banking system and political compromises have made the details of this program fairly complex.
Furthermore, purchases across markets within the Eurozone will be allocated based on each national central bank's capital shares (capital key). For example, Germany’s Bundesbank will buy more bonds than Italy’s Banca d'Italia. Purchases are limited to 25 percent of outstanding debt or 33 percent issuance by a particular issuer within a maturity range of 2-30 years.
Greece's government bonds are excluded from this program due to their insufficient credit quality. Countries under an adjustment program must fulfill specific criteria to qualify for participation.
In addition to bond purchases, interest rates charged on targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) have been reduced by 10 basis points to match the main refinancing rate at 0.05 percent.
There has been discussion surrounding risk-sharing within this QE program; however, it is concluded that other mechanisms are in place to reduce the risk of government default. These mechanisms include the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) acting as a backstop and conditional support programs (OMT) being deemed legal by the European Court of Justice. The TARGET2 system also acts as a key backstop, allowing central banks within Eurozone member states to borrow from each other.
The article argues against claims that QE will not work in the Eurozone and provides counterarguments. It suggests that bond yields in peripheral Eurozone countries could decline even further, reducing overall borrowing costs. It posits that buying government bonds from banks and other investors will incentivize them to invest elsewhere, potentially enhancing bank lending. Additionally, the article suggests that bond purchases will increase asset prices, making it more attractive for companies to raise equity capital and creating positive wealth effects for households. Moreover, expanding the ECB's balance sheet through QE while other central banks have halted their asset purchases is expected to weaken the euro and stimulate Eurozone competitiveness.
The overall impact of this QE program is viewed positively by suggesting it adds another piece to an improving policy framework in the Eurozone. The article notes progress made with fiscal consolidation and highlights efforts made towards financial market integration through launching the European Banking Union.
In conclusion, this news article explains the details of ECB's quantitative easing program, its potential benefits for boosting growth in the Eurozone economy, and discusses various aspects related to its implementation within different countries of Europe's monetary union.
 
This news article discusses the concept of responsible investing and compares the performance of two contrasting funds: The Vice Fund (now renamed as the Barrier Fund) and the Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund.
The Vice Fund invests in businesses considered to be socially questionable, such as tobacco, alcohol, gaming, and defense/aerospace industries. On the other hand, the Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund consists of stocks of companies that have been screened for certain social, human rights, and environmental criteria.
Data gathered over a period of nearly 14 years shows that the Vice Fund performed better than the Social Index Fund. The example of the Vice Fund suggests that investments in what are considered "unethical" stocks tend to outperform.
The rationale for vice investing is that these companies have a steady demand for their goods and services regardless of economic conditions. They tend to operate globally, are high-margin businesses with high entry barriers.
The article also mentions another study investigating stock markets in countries characterized by corruption. Surprisingly, it concludes that better returns were generated from investments made in countries generally considered most corrupt. Responsible investors may contribute to the outperformance of "sin stocks." If a large enough proportion of investors avoid sin businesses due to ethical considerations, their share prices will be depressed and offer elevated returns to those less troubled by ethical considerations.
To provide a long-term perspective on sin stocks' performance, researchers looked at over 100 years of tobacco industry data. It was discovered that during the transition period from when tobacco was not considered harmful until its negative impact became widely recognized in 1950s; its shares underperformed in America. However, from 1960s to 2000s when its health impact was well-known; tobacco companies outperformed comparable firms by over +3% per year.
Although sin stocks can deliver strong financial performance despite their negative societal impact, there is evidence suggesting responsible investing can also be fruitful. Responsible investors who still have a stake in non-ethical companies have two options - "exit" and "voice." Exit means withdrawing from the investment relationship, while voice refers to speaking out and attempting to improve corporate behavior. By engaging with executives, submitting proxy proposals, and influencing regulators and standard setters, responsible investors believe they can guide management toward improved financial performance and enhanced social conditions.
The article highlights the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) as an example where the voice strategy proved more rewarding than exit. Initially blacklisting entire countries that didn't meet certain criteria, CalPERS faced significant losses on its emerging markets portfolio. However, in 2007 it switched to a principles-based approach that involved carefully selecting companies in the developing world and engaging with them through dialogue, engagement, and shareholder activism.
According to Credit Suisse's report cited in the article, engagement is not only socially responsible but has also proven to be profitable.
Overall, this news article provides insights into responsible investing and discusses the performance of sin stocks compared to socially screened funds. It suggests that investments considered unethical may deliver better returns but also emphasizes that responsible investing can be fruitful when done right. 
This news article discusses the conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Switzerland and their prospects for success. The article highlights the factors that contribute to business success, such as infrastructure and skilled employees. However, it also mentions that overall, SMEs' assessment of Switzerland as a business location has slightly deteriorated compared to the previous year.
One of the main reasons for this decline is the appreciation of the Swiss franc since the abandonment of the EUR/CHF exchange-rate floor. This currency appreciation has had negative effects on SMEs, with many viewing its impact on the economic environment and international ties as negative. Furthermore, regulatory framework conditions are seen as an impediment to success, with many firms expecting further deterioration in this area.
The article emphasizes that addressing these challenges is crucial if Swiss SMEs want to secure their chances of success, especially in a more troubled economic climate. It suggests that easing regulations on businesses should become a priority in political agendas.
The article also discusses investment patterns among SMEs between 2009 and 2014. Around 90 percent of surveyed SMEs made investments during this period, spending an average of 10 percent of their sales on investments. Service-sector companies and high-tech industries were found to have higher investment proportions compared to retail companies.
Real estate was identified as the most significant area for investment, followed by equipment. The survey indicated that real estate investment has gained importance across all sectors over the past six years. Tourism/entertainment sectors, healthcare/education/social services sectors were found to be above-average investors in real estate while high-tech industries focused more on research and development.
In terms of foreign investments, only 6 percent of all surveyed SMEs invested abroad between 2009-2014. The appreciation of Swiss franc this year was predicted by many SMEs to be more difficult to absorb than what was experienced during 2010/2011 when it appreciated before. Around 40 percent of SMEs anticipated a decline in sales and margins due to the currency appreciation, with 30 percent expecting a decline in competitiveness. Industrial and retail sectors were particularly under pressure.
The article found that SMEs that are reducing their investment due to the strong Swiss franc tend to be more export-oriented compared to those maintaining or increasing investment. It also noted that diversification through strategic interests and cooperation agreements helped alleviate some of the negative effects of Swiss franc appreciation on SME investment.
Regarding financing, cash and traditional bank loans were identified as the primary sources for financing investments among Swiss SMEs. Non-bank loans played a role for young businesses, while low interest rates between 2009-2014 had only a moderate effect on overall SME investment activity. The uncertainty about the future course of the economy was cited as a significant factor influencing investment decisions.
Lastly, the article highlighted some barriers to investment faced by SMEs. Around one-third of respondents stated that laws and regulations severely hampered key investment projects between 2009-2014. Economic and political uncertainty, as well as shortages of specialist skills, were also major obstacles according to more than one-quarter of surveyed SMEs.
In conclusion, while Switzerland has favorable conditions for business success such as infrastructure and skilled employees, challenges like currency appreciation, regulatory framework conditions, economic/political uncertainties remain concerns for Swiss SMEs' prospects for success. The article suggests easing regulations on businesses should be prioritized in order to secure their chances of success in an increasingly troubled economic climate.
 
This news article discusses the impact of recent events on the Swiss economy and various industries. It starts by mentioning that public budgets are under pressure due to higher savings, which has affected certain industries. However, the construction industry had a successful year in 2014 due to low interest rates and extensive planning activities.
The article then goes on to discuss the export industry, which picked up pace in 2014 but not as much as expected. In 2015, there was a significant change in monetary policy that led to a sharp appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro. This made Swiss products and services more expensive compared to foreign counterparts, leading to losses for some companies.
The stronger franc is expected to have an impact on both the export industry and domestic economy in 2015. The article revises Switzerland's GDP growth forecast from 1.6% to 0.8%. Despite this slowdown, a recession is not expected due to an average exchange rate of just over 1.00 with the euro.
The lifting of the CHF/EUR exchange rate floor was influenced by stagnant global economic recovery and concerns about mass immigration initiatives on bilateral agreements with the EU.
The hospitality industry is likely to be greatly affected by recent events as Switzerland becomes a more expensive vacation destination. This could result in fewer hotel visits by foreign guests and Swiss travelers choosing other countries for their vacations.
Most export sectors will face difficulties due to the strong franc affecting nearly all industries differently depending on factors such as export orientation, margin level, percentage of costs originating in Switzerland, and customers' price sensitivity.
Industries such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemicals/pharmaceuticals manufacturing may experience limited growth or even declines due to exchange-rate effects; however pharmaceuticals and watch manufacturers may be able better cushion these effects by increasing margins.
Retailers will also face challenges as shopping tourism is expected to increase further reducing retail sales compared with last year potentially leading to decreased employment in the industry.
While service industries may have a lower impact from the strong franc this year, telecommunications, hospitals, and other service providers may experience reduced demand due to lower overall economic demand for workers combined with lower immigration rates. However, this effect is not expected to be noticeable until 2016.
IT companies will also see slower growth in sales and employment due to tight budgets under the strong franc; however key trends such as increasing regulation in the financial sector and rapid technological progress will still drive investments in productivity-boosting IT solutions.
The article concludes by mentioning that while economic and exchange-rate fluctuations have short-term impacts on various sectors, long-term factors such as demographic change and advancements in medical technology make healthcare and IT industries noteworthy opportunities.
Overall, the strong franc is expected to dominate discussions across many industries throughout 2015, impacting growth rates, sales figures, employment levels, and prompting adjustments across sectors as they navigate both short-term uncertainties and long-term trends. In addition to discussing the short-term impacts of the strong franc and other recent events, the article also highlights some medium and long-term factors that are shaping various industries in Switzerland.
One significant trend mentioned is demographic change. The aging population in industrialized nations, coupled with advancements in medical technology, is leading to a constant increase in demand for healthcare, nursing care, and support services. This presents opportunities for industries such as pharmaceuticals and medical technology to cater to this growing need.
Another sector with an above-average opportunity-risk profile is IT. The ongoing digitalization of the economy and society is driving demand for IT services. Companies are adapting their systems and processes to keep up with technological progress, resulting in larger order books for the IT industry. Additionally, stricter compliance requirements and increasing regulations are also boosting demand for IT solutions.
The article acknowledges that amidst economic fluctuations and exchange-rate effects in the short term, there are also structural factors at play that have medium- and long-term impacts on industry sectors. It suggests that by creating a medium-term opportunity-risk profile of different Swiss sectors each year, these long-term trends can be identified.
While certain industries may face challenges due to immediate circumstances like exchange rate fluctuations or geopolitical risks related to bilateral agreements with the EU following immigration initiatives; others have opportunities linked to broader trends such as healthcare demands associated with an aging population or increasing use of IT services driven by digitalization.
It's important to note that this news article paints a broad overview rather than delving into specific details about each industry or providing extensive analysis beyond stating expectations based on current economic conditions. However, it gives readers a snapshot of how various sectors are likely to be impacted by recent events while pointing out some underlying factors that will shape their future prospects.
Overall, it suggests that 2015 will be a difficult year for many industries due to the strong franc's impact on exports as well as domestic spending patterns influenced by higher prices. However, industries with opportunities linked to longer-term trends may still find avenues for growth despite the prevailing challenges. 
This news article discusses the potential impacts of Brexit on various economies, particularly focusing on the United Kingdom and its trade partners. The article suggests that investment spending is likely to be immediately affected by Brexit, while private consumption may experience a slower and less pronounced reaction. The UK's domestic demand is expected to slow down and potentially even contract for a few quarters.
The long-term impact of Brexit on the UK will largely depend on future economic relations with the European Union (EU). The article predicts that these relations will most likely be negative, resulting in reduced trade access and labor market mobility. This will likely have a negative effect on investment, productivity, and income in the UK.
Regarding its impact on other major economies, three main channels are examined: trade, confidence, and financial contagion. The UK is one of the world's largest importers and has a significant trade deficit. As a consequence of Brexit and the weaker British pound (GBP), overall import volumes are expected to stagnate in the second half of this year and decline around 2 percent year-on-year in 2017. Export values to the UK are also expected to drop further as most exporters would have to make price concessions due to the weaker GBP.
While countries such as China and USA may experience some decline in exports to the UK, their overall vulnerability appears less significant since exports to the UK account for only 0.5 percent and 0.3 percent of their respective GDPs.
Among European trading partners, Ireland has relatively minimal export declines due to its focus on pharmaceuticals, food, and agriculture products which are considered relatively inelastic goods. Norway's mineral fuel exports are also shielded from demand fluctuations due mainly to commodity price drops during previous recessions.
Spain, Italy, France ,and other European trading partners are expected to suffer more substantial export declines ranging from 5-10 percent next year; however estimating these numbers comes with considerable uncertainty.The direct negative effects on GDP are estimated to fall within the 0.1-0.3 percentage points range for European trading partners.
The article suggests that a second potential channel of contagion is via consumer and business confidence. Uncertainty over the EU's future after Brexit is likely to increase, potentially leading to a dampening effect on investment and consumer sentiment. However, the extent of this impact remains unclear as it is uncertain how much policy uncertainty will rise outside the UK due to the Brexit vote.
A third potential channel by which Brexit could impact the European economy is via financial contagion. Concerns have arisen that financial conditions might worsen in countries such as Italy and Spain. While bond yield spreads initially widened after the Brexit vote, they have since returned to pre-Brexit levels, suggesting market confidence in the European Central Bank's ability to prevent a sovereign debt crisis.
However, refinancing conditions for many European banks have worsened significantly since the Brexit vote, resulting in drops in stock and bond prices for these banks. This has raised concerns about economic outlooks and profitability.
Overall, tighter financial conditions are predicted to result in sub-par investment and economic growth. While there may not be a renewed financial crisis in the Eurozone due to reduced leverage in banks' balance sheets, lending activity may remain constrained.
In conclusion, this news article highlights potential impacts of Brexit on various economies both directly through trade channels as well as indirectly through changes in consumer/business confidence and potential financial contagion effects . The exact magnitude of these impacts remains uncertain but it can be expected that there will be negative consequences for most economies affected by Brexit. 
This news article discusses the current state of monetary policies in various economies, as well as the potential risks and outlook for global economic growth.
The Bank of England (BOE) is expected to loosen its monetary policy further by implementing rate cuts and possibly reactivating asset purchases. After maintaining interest rates for almost four years, recent developments such as the UK's Brexit referendum and an economic slowdown have increased downside risks for the country's economic outlook. However, despite these challenges, growth rates above 1 percent are still anticipated for both 2016 and 2017.
Similarly, the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to extend its asset purchase program by at least six months in September. This move may involve adjusting key program parameters to ensure flexibility. Political uncertainty looms over Italy with a constitutional referendum scheduled for October. If rejected, Prime Minister Mario Renzi has stated that he would step down and call for new elections. Current polls indicate that the EU-skeptic "Five Star" movement could become the largest party in parliament if this scenario unfolds.
The US Federal Reserve faces implications from weaker growth in Europe and additional easing measures implemented by other central banks. This situation will likely keep the Fed cautious about raising interest rates despite less pronounced downside risks to US growth and inflation compared to the Eurozone. Recent data from June's payroll report confirms a robust US economy; however, substantial uncertainty remains regarding when exactly a rate hike will occur. The current expectation is now December 2016.
Global business activity measured by Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) experienced subdued expansion even before Brexit was decided upon in June. A significant setback for July cannot be ruled out; thus, sluggish global economic growth is projected for H2 of 2016 with primarily downward risks observed in major economies like China where a renewed slowdown is anticipated following a recent rebound.
Concerns about a potential US recession arise due to slow overall growth worldwide. Although recent US economic data showed a decline in industrial production (a typical sign of recession), manufacturing production has not displayed the same trend, and retail sales and employment continue to rise. This suggests the US economy is still distant from entering a recession.
Different models assess the likelihood of a US recession in the coming quarters. A model developed by Glenn D. Rudebusch from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco indicates that there is little evidence supporting the notion that recoveries necessarily collapse due to their age alone. The model calculates approximately 2.6 percent probability for an ending expansion next month which accumulates to slightly more than 25 percent over one year's time.
Another model by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, utilizing the yield curve as an indicator, currently shows around an 8 percent risk of recession within one year. While this is considerably higher compared to last year's prediction at 2.2 percent, it was already indicating a higher probability before the Great Recession began in December 2007.
It is crucial to consider that low longer-term interest rates stimulate economic growth by providing leverage for continued expansion while stabilized energy prices alleviate negative impacts on US manufacturing activity stemming from fluctuations in oil prices.
In conclusion, this news article emphasizes central banks' monetary policy decisions- specifically those regarding rate cuts and asset purchases- as well as potential risks for global economic growth across advanced economies like Europe and China. It also surfaces concerns about a possible US recession but highlights positive factors such as low longer-term interest rates stimulating growth and other robust components of domestic demand like private consumption and residential investment, resulting in stable projections for US economic performance in both 2016 and 2017 
This news article discusses the integration of technology in the fashion industry, highlighting its potential benefits and impact on e-commerce, garment production, and consumer experience.
The article begins by introducing the concept of a smart garment that allows consumers to track its production process and verify its authenticity. It also mentions how such garments can be easily retrieved if misplaced. The compatibility between technology and fashion is then explored, discussing various advancements such as e-textiles or smart fabrics and 3D printing.
The use of computer design in clothing production is already prevalent, with 3D-printed fashion prototypes being showcased at fashion shows or online videos. E-commerce has been effective so far, particularly for items like underwear and jeans purchased for their affordability and convenience. The article suggests that the future may involve body scanning to create personalized measurements for virtual retail stores, where purchases would be sent directly to consumers' doors.
The article then highlights Fits.me as a pioneering company in biorobotics and virtual fitting rooms. It mentions their partnership with retailer Hawes & Curtis as an example of how their technology helps solve a major problem in apparel e-commerce - customers being unable to try clothes on before buying them. By using shape-shifting robotic mannequins that mimic customers' body measurements, Fits.me provides an accurate representation of how garments will fit an individual's body shape. This innovation has led to increased clothing sales at online retailers like Quelle while decreasing returns by 28 percent.
Another groundbreaking development discussed is the emergence of e-textiles or smart fabrics that embed digital components within them to provide added value to wearers. These smart textiles can communicate, transform, conduct energy, grow, among other capabilities beyond traditional fabrics' limitations. One notable application mentioned is therapeutic textiles that provide healing or protective properties when in contact with the skin. Examples include herbal extracts coating fabric surfaces which can relieve stress or rejuvenate skin ailments.
The article emphasizes how choosing underwear will change in the future once consumers become aware of the additional benefits they can provide. It suggests that garments will become intelligent and capable of monitoring wearers' health. For instance, smart fibers with embedded sensors would detect changes in physiology such as heart rate, body temperature, or biochemistry. This information can then be stored or transmitted to monitoring clinics, aiding in assessing and improving overall health or providing high-quality supervision for chronic illnesses.
Furthermore, the article states that smart clothes will be knitted directly with conductive or optical sensors into fabrics like T-shirts, shorts, and underwear. This allows for a greater range of body signal detection at higher sensitivities compared to traditional rigid sensors like clip-ons or wristbands.
The author concludes by discussing how technology is gradually reshaping fashion perception and shopping behaviors. While encouraging readers to embrace these innovations and inventions early on, it assures them that fashionable clothing will continue to be worn despite being made from different materials due to technological advancements.
In summary, this news article highlights the impact of technology on the fashion industry. It discusses concepts like tracking garment production and authenticity verification through smart garments while also addressing advancements such as e-textiles/smart fabrics and 3D printing. Additionally, it explores Fits.me's virtual fitting rooms' success in solving apparel e-commerce's key challenge—customers' inability to try clothes before purchase—as well as future possibilities including wearable health monitoring through sensor-embedded smart clothes. 
This news article discusses the key strategies and challenges faced by fashion companies in today's competitive market. It highlights the success of Zara, a Spanish fashion company that has revolutionized the supply chain model by closely following high-end fashion shows to stay ahead of trends and quickly deliver products to their stores. This approach enables them to avoid selling at discounted prices and reduce fashion mistakes.
Zara owns its supply chain and stores, allowing them to have direct control over production and sales. Their designers actively keep an eye on street styles and internet blogs to continuously update their collections throughout the season. This fast-paced model has inspired other apparel manufacturers like H&M, who initially focused more on pricing than fashion but have since adapted their supply chains for faster production and delivery.
Another example mentioned is Uniqlo, a Japanese retailer that focuses on inventory control, positioning products strategically in specific locations at the right time. While they manufacture clothing in Japan, they also outsource some work to China.
The article emphasizes how globalization has transformed fashion companies into global entities. For example, H&M started in Sweden but successfully expanded into Europe (both Northern and Southern), China, and the USA. Similarly, Zara was originally successful in Southern Europe and Latin America before expanding into Asia, emerging markets,and ultimately entering the US market.
The article also provides cautionary tales of overexposure leading to brand fatigue. Abercrombie & Fitch became immensely popular among teenagers but lost appeal when its logo became too widespread. Similarly, Michael Kors experienced rapid growth as a brand but struggled when it expanded aggressively and suffered from overexposure.
To achieve long-term success in the industry, brands need longevity and resilience. The article cites Hermes as an example of a conservatively managed brand with enduring popularity for its Birkin bag since its creation in 1984. Another success story is Burberry which successfully repositioned itself under new designer Christopher Bailey by adding higher-margin accessories, fragrances, and babywear to its product lineup.
In conclusion, the article advises that fashion companies can be worth investing in when riding a successful trend, conservatively managed, or recovering from setbacks. However, it also warns about the pitfalls of overexposure and brand fatigue. The importance of a well-managed supply chain and selling products at full prices is highlighted as key factors for profitable growth. Additionally, globalization offers significant growth opportunities for successful fashion companies.
Overall, this article provides insights into the strategies employed by successful fashion companies as well as cautionary tales from those who have faced challenges in the industry. The article further delves into the significance of a brand's longevity and resilience. It mentions Hermes as an exemplary example of a conservatively managed brand that commands one of the highest valuations in the luxury goods sector. The iconic Birkin bag, introduced in 1984, has maintained its allure and desirability among fashion enthusiasts.
Additionally, Burberry is cited as a brand that successfully rejuvenated itself. The article highlights how the Burberry check logo had become overexposed due to its widespread adoption by British football fans and cheap imitations flooding the market. However, with the appointment of Christopher Bailey as a new designer in 2001, Burberry repositioned itself as a fashionable luxury brand. By adding higher-margin accessories, fragrances, and babywear to their product offerings, they managed to transform their worth from £200 million in 1997 to £6 billion.
The article also acknowledges that not every fashion brand can effectively expand into new product categories like Burberry did. It underscores the importance of carefully considering each company's unique strengths and capabilities when assessing investment opportunities within the industry.
In summary, this news article provides insights on successful strategies employed by fashion companies such as Zara's supply chain management and quick response to trends. It discusses how brands like H&M adapted their production processes for faster delivery but remained price-focused rather than purely driven by fashion trends.
Furthermore, it warns about potential pitfalls associated with overexposure and brand fatigue using examples like Abercrombie & Fitch losing appeal among teenagers when their logo became too common and Michael Kors facing challenges due to aggressive expansion causing overexposure.
The article concludes by emphasizing that investing in fashion companies necessitates thorough analysis of not only current success but also factors such as longevity, resilience, supply chain efficiency,and maintaining value across different markets worldwide.
