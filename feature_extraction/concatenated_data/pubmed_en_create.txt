1. Introduction
Sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea) are benthic marine invertebrates that inhabit diverse aquatic ecosystems worldwide. These organisms play a crucial ecological role, contributing to nutrient recycling and maintaining the health of marine habitats by processing organic matter from the seabed (Samyn et al., 2005). Sea cucumbers also exhibit significant commercial value, with processed forms known as "Beche-de-mer" having a long-standing history as a delicacy in many Southeast Asian countries (Purcell et al., 2013).
The immense demand for sea cucumbers, driven largely by Asian markets, has led to overexploitation and depletion of wild stocks on a global scale (Hamaguchi and Toral-Granda, 2014). Consequently, there has been an escalating interest in developing sustainable aquaculture techniques for commercially important species such as Holothuria scabra in order to alleviate pressure on wild populations and support local economies (Rajapaksha et al., 2009).
While considerable research efforts have been dedicated to understanding sea cucumber populations and developing aquaculture methods in various regions worldwide, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the Arabian Peninsula and Iran. This region is characterized by its unique geographical features, encompassing marginal seas such as the Arabian/Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Red Sea. Despite their significance for regional biodiversity conservation efforts and potential economic benefits associated with sea cucumber exploitation, studies focusing on these areas are limited. Additionally, the economic value of sea cucumbers within this region is often underestimated.
Historical evidence suggests that environmental extremes have contributed to relatively impoverished sea cucumber diversity within the Arabian Peninsula and Iran compared to other regions globally. A recent review highlighted only 82 species recorded across this area (Al-Marashi et al., withdrawn), indicating an urgent need for comprehensive research efforts aimed at understanding the ecological dynamics and commercial potential of sea cucumbers within this region.
Furthermore, artisanal fisheries targeting sea cucumbers exist in countries such as Iran, Oman, and Saudi Arabia, with Yemen and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) assuming key roles in collection and export to Asian markets. Nevertheless, there is an alarming lack of scientific data regarding stock assessment and export statistics for this region. This information deficit presents significant challenges for sustainable management practices necessary to prevent further depletion of natural stocks.
Nevertheless, there have been some successful attempts at aquaculture trials with high-value species like H. scabra conducted in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Iran. These initiatives hold promise for further expansion initiatives that could combat overexploitation of native populations while simultaneously meeting market demands (Purcell et al., 2018). Additionally, research efforts exploring the ecotoxicological properties and characterization of bioactive compounds derived from sea cucumbers in Iran have demonstrated an immense research potential (Rezaie-Atagholipour et al., 2019).
Despite some advancements in understanding the biology and ecology of sea cucumbers within this region, several research gaps remain unaddressed. Unexplored areas include molecular phylogeny studies to better comprehend evolutionary relationships among Arabian Peninsula and Iranian species populations or the use of these organisms in bioremediation practices. Moreover, detailed characterizations of bioactive compounds harbored by different sea cucumber species are yet to be explored fully.
Therefore, it is imperative that research efforts prioritize expanding aquaculture operations as a means to revive exports while simultaneously recuperating damaged wild stocks through innovative techniques such as sea ranching. Additionally; regional cooperation frameworks aiming at networking opportunities alongside training programs focused on capacity-building would significantly contribute towards bridging knowledge gaps in Arabian Peninsula-Iranian context-specific sea cucumber research needs - an important step towards effective conservation measures that ensure long-term sustainability within this region. 
Introduction:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex disease that arises from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in colonic epithelium cells. It is the third most common cancer worldwide, with high mortality rates. The etiology of CRC involves various factors, including both genetic predisposition and environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle choices. Interestingly, studies have increasingly indicated that alterations in lipid metabolism play a crucial role in CRC development and progression.
Lipids are important constituents of the plasma membrane, acting as structural components that contribute to membrane integrity and fluidity. In addition to their structural roles, lipids serve as signaling molecules involved in diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, growth, differentiation, and intracellular signal transduction. Disruptions in lipid metabolism have been implicated in various pathological conditions including cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cancer.
In recent years, increasing evidence has highlighted the significance of abnormal lipid metabolism specifically in CRC pathogenesis. Dysregulation of this metabolic process can support cancer cell survival and proliferation through the provision of energy sources required for abnormal malignant growth and metastasis. Importantly though not limited to CRC cells themselves- intratumoral heterogeneity necessitates understanding how these alterations also affect tumor microenvironment for comprehensive understanding.
The tumor microenvironment plays an essential role in influencing overall tumor behavior by providing a supportive niche for cancer cells to thrive while evading immune surveillance mechanisms.Through multidirectional communication between the tumor cells abd different heterogeneous players within it This includes stromal fibroblasts,cancer-associated adipocytes ,other immune infiltrating leukocytes,blood vessels- an active biochemical cross talk occurs which governs persisting tumorigenic traits observed . The components within this milieu (also termed 'tumor immunosuppressive' or just 'tumor') include noncancerous intrinsic cellular constituents( like mentioned earlier), soluble extrinsic molecules (like cytokines) ,exosomes carrying DNAs / RNA proteins( that can influence genetic landscape including lipid metabolism genes)as well blood vessels (necessary for providing nutrients) and other vital cells sourced from immune system . Manipulation of this complex chemistry provides an indispensable strategy in the development of targeted therapies.
Given the extensive crosstalk between CRC cells and components of the tumor microenvironment, it is crucial to understand how altered lipid metabolism influences communication pathways in order to fully appreciate its role in CRC progression. Recent studies have identified intricate molecular mechanisms wherein lipid metabolism regulates cellular signaling, gene expression, and metabolic intermediates influencing not only cancer cells metabolic vulnerabilities(but also their bio behavior. Proper execution of such functions strongly depends on a fine balance among different players involved; subtle changes may easily tip off homeostasis leading to favoring tumor growth rather than its extermination proposed.
Thus, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the remodeling roles played by lipid metabolism in the context of colorectal cancer. A better understanding of the relevance and interaction between abnormal lipid alterations within cancer cells themselves vis-a-vis those within noncancerous intrinsic resident players& other circulating sources will help decipher how manipulation or correction could be implemented collectively among Cancer Immunologists regulators targeting both intrinsic as well extrinsic constituents exerting beneficial effects on overall prognosis.
In this review, we will discuss various aspects that underlie altered lipid metabolism in CRC cells during multiple stages from initiation , promotion & metastatic outgrowth.Mapping out not only core regulatory nodes/drivers but novel subfunctions(like acquiring neo functional signal inducing properties or activators/inhibitors which directly/indirectly affect cascades responsible for driving malignant transformations thereby critically imbibing their significance into perspective literature.Despite now few reports.. difficulties faced while analyzing disease associated with wpathological lipids so far too is due- detection methodologies with low-throughput quantifications viz LC mass spectrometry make it challenging.Furthermore effective lipidomic data generation techniques prove efficacious. By providing a comprehensive review of the current understanding pertaining to lipid metabolism in CRC, this article aims to fill this gap in the literature and highlight potential avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions in CRC.
In summary, this review will investigate how altered lipid metabolism within CRC cells influences communication with components of the tumor microenvironment, including various cells, cytokines, DNA, RNA and nutrients including lipids. Understanding these complex interactions will not only shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving cancer progression but also unveil novel therapeutic opportunities for effective intervention against colorectal cancer. 
Introduction:
The Role of Circulating microRNAs in Predicting Treatment Response in Wilms Tumor Patients
Wilms tumor (WT) is a common type of pediatric kidney cancer that primarily affects children aged 3-4 years, with a peak incidence between the ages of 2 and 5 years (1). Although advances in multimodal treatment have significantly improved the prognosis for WT, there remains a clinical need for reliable biomarkers to predict treatment response and facilitate personalized therapeutic strategies. In recent years, short non-coding RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as potential biomarkers for various types of cancer, including WT.
MiRNAs are small RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been implicated in numerous cellular processes including tumorigenesis, metastasis, and response to therapy (2). Consequently, profiling circulating miRNA levels has attracted significant interest as a minimally invasive approach for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.
Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying WT development and progression, little is known about the specific role of circulating miRNAs in this malignancy. The identification of reliable miRNA markers could provide important insights into disease pathogenesis and potentially guide therapeutic decision-making.
Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to systematically review the existing literature on circulating miRNA profiles in WT patients and perform a meta-analysis to assess their diagnostic accuracy. Specifically, we aimed to identify dysregulated miRNAs associated with WT diagnosis that could serve as potential prognostic indicators or therapeutic targets.
To achieve this objective, we conducted an extensive search utilizing major scientific databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web-of-Science, and Wiley online library databases. Only English/French studies were included given language constraints. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to ensure a transparent and reproducible review process. The search strategy was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022301597).
The eligibility criteria for study inclusion consisted of primary research articles that investigated the expression of circulating miRNAs in WT patients compared to healthy controls. Studies reporting on miRNA profiles in other malignancies or non-human subjects were excluded. Quality assessment was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool.
Our analysis uncovered dysregulated miRNAs associated with WT, including both up-regulated and down-regulated species, as well as a subset displaying conflicting results across studies. By pooling the data from two studies, we assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) values for significantly dysregulated miRNAs.
Preliminary findings revealed promising diagnostic potential for these selected circulating miRNAs for WT diagnosis. However, more research is needed to validate these results on larger cohorts and diverse populations. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether specific circulating miRNA signatures are associated with different subtypes or stages of WT.
In conclusion, our study aimed to provide an up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis of dysregulated circulating miRNAs in WT patients. This comprehensive analysis serves as a stepping stone toward identifying potential biomarkers that could facilitate personalized therapeutic strategies by predicting treatment response based on unique molecular signatures. Future research should focus on elucidating the functional roles of individual miRNAs identified in this study and exploring their utility as therapeutic targets or tools for disease monitoring throughout the clinical course of WT.

The potential relationship between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection has generated significant debate and interest among researchers and healthcare professionals. The effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke on various diseases, including the infamous COVID-19, have been extensively discussed in recent literature. However, the current understanding of this relationship remains controversial.
Smoking is known to increase the risk and severity of respiratory infections due to its detrimental impact on lung health. In the context of COVID-19, preliminary evidence suggests that smokers may be at a higher risk for contracting the disease compared to non-smokers. This is likely attributed to the upregulation of ACE2 receptors – key proteins involved in viral entry – in smokers’ lung tissue, providing a potential mechanism for increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Contrastingly, multinational epidemiological reports have indicated a lower incidence of COVID-19 among smokers. This conflicting observation raises intriguing questions regarding the complex interplay between smoking, nicotine exposure, immune response modulation, and their ultimate impact on disease outcomes. It is important to note that these reports do not advocate smoking as a protective measure against COVID-19 but indicate an interesting discrepancy when it comes to disease occurrence.
One virulent component found within cigarette smoke is nicotine – a potent addictive substance with diverse physiological effects on multiple organ systems. Nicotine has been reported to exhibit both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties depending on various factors such as dosage or route of administration. Understanding how nicotine interacts with specific cells involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis could shed light on its potential role as either exacerbating or ameliorating viral-induced damage.
To address this research gap, we propose conducting an extensive investigation exploring the direct effect of pure nicotine on different cell types implicated in COVID-19 infection using an organ-based systematic approach. By focusing our study specifically on damaged organs associated with 12 diseases related to COVID-19 pathogenesis (e.g., lung, heart, kidney), we aim to delineate the specific impact of nicotine in the context of organ-specific viral entry and immune response.
It is crucial to distinguish between the effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke when conducting research on smoking-related diseases, including COVID-19. Failure to differentiate between these distinct exposures may introduce significant bias and limit our ability to draw accurate conclusions regarding their individual impacts. Moreover, it should be noted that nicotine’s effects are not solely dependent on its presence or absence but also exhibit a dose-dependent response.
In addition to investigating the role of nicotine in COVID-19 infection, we propose assessing underlying diseases as potential confounding factors. Understanding how conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, or diabetes interact with nicotine exposure could provide valuable insights for healthcare providers in developing tailored treatment strategies.
The ultimate goal of this research is twofold: firstly, to elucidate the specific impact of pure nicotine on cells involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis; and secondly, to provide evidence-based guidelines for healthcare professionals that incorporate a personalized approach considering both individual risk factors and underlying diseases. By improving our understanding of how smoking and nicotine contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics at a cellular level, we can enhance preventive measures and optimize treatment strategies for patients affected by this global pandemic. 
Introduction
Chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a prevalent musculoskeletal condition affecting the lower limb, particularly in athletes and people participating in repetitive activities (1). The primary symptoms of mid-portion AT include pain and functional impairments, such as reduced strength, power, and balance. Despite extensive research on various treatment modalities for mid-portion AT, including exercise interventions, there is still a lack of knowledge concerning the specific effects of different exercise treatments on improving functional outcomes in this population.
Exercise treatments have become increasingly recognized as effective interventions for managing mid-portion AT. They aim to reduce pain, improve function and restore tissue health (2). However, it remains unclear which specific exercise treatments are most effective in targeting particular functional outcomes such as strength, power, range of motion (ROM), balance index or sensorimotor parameters while addressing the underlying pathology.
The current literature provides inconsistent findings regarding the effects of exercise interventions on different functional outcomes among individuals with mid-portion AT. Some studies suggest that eccentric training may lead to improved strength outcomes and power performance measures (3), while others propose that concentric training might be a more beneficial alternative for enhancing power outcomes (4). Furthermore, few studies have evaluated the impact of combined training modalities involving both eccentric and concentric exercises. The conflicting results from these studies underscore the need for a systematic review that synthesizes existing evidence to ascertain which specific exercise regimes yield optimal improvements in various functional parameters.
Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effect of different exercise treatments on diverse functional outcomes associated with mid-portion AT. By evaluating randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs), we will address gaps in knowledge regarding best practice recommendations for optimizing function through targeted exercises within this patient population. This research endeavor seeks to inform clinicians about evidence-based treatment approaches for maximizing patient-centered outcomes related to strength improvement or enhancement in other targeted functions such as power, balance, and sensorimotor parameters.
By synthesizing existing evidence from high-quality studies, this systematic review will contribute to the current understanding of the effects of exercise treatments on specific functional outcomes in mid-portion AT. The findings will help clinicians make informed decisions when developing individualized exercise prescriptions for patients with this condition. Moreover, by identifying effective exercise interventions, healthcare providers can optimize patient care and promote improved long-term functional outcomes.
In conclusion, it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of different exercise treatments on functional outcomes in mid-portion AT. This systematic review aims to fill gaps in knowledge by evaluating high-quality studies that have investigated changes in strength, power performance measures, ROM enhancement or improvement in sensorimotor parameters with various exercise interventions. By synthesizing existing evidence, we aim to provide clinicians with robust recommendations for optimizing function and enhancing overall patient outcomes within this population.
 1. Introduction (continued)
To date, various exercise treatments have been employed in the management of mid-portion AT, including eccentric, concentric, and combined training modes. Eccentric exercises involve lengthening the Achilles tendon under load, while concentric exercises involve shortening the tendon against resistance. Combined training modalities encompass a combination of both eccentric and concentric movements to address different aspects of tendon function.
Despite the widespread use of exercise treatments in mid-portion AT, there remains uncertainty regarding their specific effects on functional outcomes. Previous studies have primarily focused on pain reduction and clinical symptoms as primary outcomes, with limited attention given to objective measures of function such as strength and power outcomes or sensorimotor parameters like balance index.
Understanding which exercise treatment modality elicits optimal improvements in specific functional outcomes has substantial implications for clinical practice. By identifying the most effective exercise approach for targeting particular functions associated with mid-portion AT, healthcare providers can enhance treatment efficacy and positively impact patient satisfaction and recovery rates.
Therefore, this systematic review aims to synthesize available evidence from high-quality studies investigating changes in functional outcome parameters following different exercise treatments in individuals with mid-portion AT. Functional outcomes will be categorized into kinetic measures such as strength and power performance; kinematic measures such as ankle range of motion (ROM); as well as sensorimotor measures like balance index.
The inclusion criteria for this study will comprise randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) that investigate changes in plantar flexor function following exercise interventions specifically designed for individuals with mid-portion AT. The selection process will adhere to rigorous methodology utilizing electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until 21 February 2023.
Assessment of study quality will be conducted using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for RCTs (5) while employing the Joanna Briggs Institute scale for CCTs (6). This rigorous quality appraisal process will contribute to the strength of our findings and allow for more robust conclusions.
By systematically reviewing existing literature, this research aims to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations regarding exercise treatments that optimize specific functional outcomes in individuals with mid-portion AT. The findings will not only aid in optimizing treatment strategies but also help bridge the gap between research evidence and clinical practice. Moreover, a broader understanding of the effects of exercise treatments on diverse functional outcomes will facilitate the development of targeted rehabilitation programs tailored to individual patient needs.
In conclusion, evaluating the effects of different exercise treatments on functional outcome parameters in mid-portion AT is crucial for optimizing treatment approaches and enhancing patient-centered care. This systematic review intends to fill gaps in knowledge by synthesizing available evidence from high-quality studies. By providing clear recommendations based on these findings, we aim to empower clinicians with valuable insights into exercise prescription for improving specific functions associated with mid-portion AT, ultimately leading to enhanced patient outcomes and improved quality of life.
 
Title: Assessing Consumer Awareness and Perception of Food Colorants in India: An Exploratory Study
Abstract:
Food colorants play a crucial role in attracting consumers and influencing their preferences. This article examines the current status of natural and synthetic food colorants on the Indian market by analyzing available case studies, regulations implemented by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), as well as gaps in existing research. The study highlights several concerning issues, including the illegal use of banned food colorants, adulteration practices with natural alternatives, mislabelling of synthetic food colorants (SFCs) as "natural," and the permitted use of internationally banned additives. To address these challenges, we recommend robust labeling practices to differentiate natural from synthetic colorants, revised standards for determining permissible usage levels, comprehensive regulations governing production and utilization of natural food colorants, stringent measures to constrain toxic SFCs production, along with enhanced consumer awareness campaigns.
1. Introduction
The consumption patterns in today's globalizing world are significantly influenced by visual cues that play a pivotal role in purchasing decisions. Food manufacturers have long recognized this phenomenon and have diligently employed artificial colors to enhance their products' appeal while aligning them with consumer expectations (Bekhit et al., 2019). However, concerns regarding potential health risks associated with synthetic additives have led to an increased demand for products formulated using naturally sourced alternatives.
India boasts a diverse culinary landscape where visual presentation intertwines seamlessly with flavor profiles to create a remarkable sensory experience for consumers across various social strata. The country's bustling food industry has witnessed exponential growth over the past decade — driven primarily by changing lifestyles coupled with increasing disposable incomes (Gulias-Gomes et al., 2018). As consumer demands evolve toward healthier choices that align with traditional values such as Ayurveda or naturopathy-based principles often embracing products derived from nature itself - there is a growing need to examine the status quo of food colorants in India.
While previous studies have shed light on the global and national trends surrounding synthetic food colorants, there remains a paucity of research focusing specifically on the Indian context. Understanding the Indian market dynamics, its unique regulatory landscape, and consumer perceptions is essential for policymakers and industry stakeholders alike. By recognizing gaps in knowledge dissemination, public health agencies can implement targeted interventions to address concerns regarding illegal additives or mislabeling practices.
Against this backdrop, our study aims to provide valuable insights into consumer awareness and perception of food colorants within India. Ascertaining the extent of public understanding about synthetic additives versus naturally derived alternatives will pave the way for designing evidence-based policies that protect consumers' rights while promoting transparency within the food industry. Additionally, assessing consumer knowledge gaps will enable tailored campaigns to enhance awareness levels regarding unscrupulous practices such as adulteration or mislabelling often leading unsuspecting customers astray.
To achieve these objectives systematically, we will analyze existing case studies exploring synthetic food colorant usage in India's market along with regulations established by FSSAI governing natural colorants and SFCs (Food Safety & Standards Authority of India [FSSAI], 2019). Through careful review of literature encompassing diverse disciplines such as nutrition science, public health policy analysis, marketing research methods - we aim to identify crucial areas requiring scrutiny.
By aligning our research findings with existing literature gaps revealed through our exploratory study methodology - we seek not only to contribute academically but also provide practical recommendations for policymakers at national and regional levels. Crucially important is generating consumer awareness regarding illicit practices involving banned additives or adulteration techniques impacting their well-being while highlighting etiquettes associated with making informed choices. Moreover, an improved understanding of consumer perception could assist producers in formulating more appealing products that cater specifically to target segments while complying with evolving regulatory norms governing safe use thresholds for both natural and synthetic colorants.
In conclusion, this study will undertake a comprehensive evaluation of consumer awareness and perceptions surrounding food colorants in India. By systematically examining existing literature gaps and drawing on the unique Indian context, we aim to produce findings that inform evidence-based policy guidelines regarding the usage and labelling of food colorants. The insights obtained from this research can help bridge existing knowledge gaps while ensuring consumer safety, promoting transparency, and fostering overall industry growth in India's vibrant food market.

Title: The Role of MicroRNAs in Thyroid Hormone-Induced Cell Cycle Activation and Stem Cell Development during Intestinal Metamorphosis
Abstract: Amphibian metamorphosis, characterized by the maturation of organs into their adult forms, bears resemblance to postembryonic development in mammals. A critical triggering factor underlying metamorphosis is the peak concentration of plasma thyroid hormone (T3). T3 has been recognized as a causative agent for amphibian metamorphosis, independent of maternal influence. This unique characteristic has made amphibian species such as pseudo-tetraploid Xenopus laevis and its closely related diploid species Xenopus tropicalis an excellent model for investigating the regulatory role of T3 in adult organ development. Among various aspects studied, intestinal remodeling presents valuable molecular insights into how T3 influences cell fate during development. Extensive research on this process has revealed that T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program plays a pivotal role in both larval epithelial cell death and de novo formation of adult intestinal stem cells.
1. Introduction
Thyroid hormone (TH) represents a significant class of endocrine regulators involved in key developmental processes across diverse organisms, including vertebrates (1). TH plays crucial roles not only during embryogenesis but also during postnatal development when many organs undergo maturation to acquire their functional characteristics (2). Moreover, TH-mediated signaling cascades have been implicated in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis (2), highlighting its influence on tissue homeostasis throughout an individual's lifespan.
Amphibian metamorphosis exemplifies one such postnatal developmental phenomenon wherein larval structures are reabsorbed or remodeled to give rise to distinct adult organs capable of fulfilling the physiological demands associated with terrestrial life (3). An emerging body of evidence strongly suggests that plasma thyroid hormone concentration tightly correlates with various morphological changes observed during amphibian metamorphosis (4). In particular, the peak of plasma triiodothyronine (T3) concentration coincides with the onset and progression of metamorphosis, underscoring its indispensable role in orchestrating this remarkable developmental process.
The classical model systems of Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis have proven invaluable in elucidating the intricate mechanisms regulated by T3 during organogenesis (5). Among the organs that undergo dynamic changes during amphibian metamorphosis, the intestine has been widely studied due to its remarkable ability to completely remodel and regenerate adult-specific structures from larval epithelium within a short time frame. This process involves two distinct phases: larval epithelial cell death through apoptosis and de novo formation of adult intestinal stem cells followed by their subsequent proliferation and differentiation into specialized cell types forming the adult epithelium (6).
To understand how T3 influences cellular processes underlying intestinal remodeling during amphibian metamorphosis, numerous studies have focused on identifying downstream effectors or regulators of TH signaling. Recent evidence suggests that T3 regulates cell fate decisions by modulating key regulators involved in cell cycle regulation such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and their respective inhibitors (7). Activation of the cell cycle program appears to be a crucial event leading to both larval epithelial cell death and subsequent stem cell development within the intestine.
In this review article, we aim to present compelling evidence supporting the hypothesis that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a central role in mediating T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program during intestinal remodeling in amphibians. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thereby inhibiting translation or promoting mRNA degradation. By exerting fine-tuned control over networks of target genes, miRNAs participate in various developmental processes, including cell cycle regulation and stem cell differentiation.
We begin by providing an overview of the key stages of amphibian metamorphosis and the importance of T3 signaling in driving these transitions. Subsequently, we discuss current knowledge regarding miRNA-mediated regulation of cell cycle genes during intestinal remodeling. Furthermore, we highlight specific miRNAs that have been implicated in modulating T3-induced apoptosis and differentiation within the intestinal epithelium. Finally, we propose potential avenues for future research to further delineate the intricate interplay between TH signaling, miRNAs, and cell fate determination during amphibian metamorphosis.
In conclusion, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TH-mediated activation of the cell cycle program and its impact on stem cell development during amphibian intestinal metamorphosis holds promise for shedding light on broader aspects of organ regeneration and tissue homeostasis in vertebrates.

Title: Investigating the Efficacy of Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS) in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): A Comprehensive Review
Abstract:
Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS) has gained recognition for its remarkable clinical efficacy in mitigating anxiety disorders. However, the potential applications and mechanisms underlying JWXYS as a therapeutic intervention for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been largely overlooked. This article aims to review the existing animal experiments, clinical trials, and mechanism studies of JWXYS in relation to PTSD. The comprehensive analysis intends to provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of JWXYS as an innovative treatment approach for PTSD.
1. Introduction
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition that can develop following exposure to traumatic events such as natural disasters, accidents, or violent acts [1]. Individuals with PTSD often experience a range of distressing symptoms including intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal [2]. Despite advancements in pharmacological interventions and psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD management, many patients exhibit inadequate response rates or significant side effects [3].
Recent research suggests that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with its focus on holistic approaches and individualized treatments tailored to specific patient presentations, may offer alternative avenues for managing mental health conditions such as anxiety disorders [4]. Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS), a classic TCM formula derived from Yang's writings in the Song Dynasty compendium "Taiping Huimin Heji Ju Fang" ("Formulas Worth One Thousand Gold: Taiping Imperial Grace Formulary"), has shown promising efficacy in alleviating anxiety disorders [5], thus rationalizing its investigation as a potential therapeutic intervention for PTSD.
The basis of JWXYS lies within five chief herbal components: Radix Bupleuri Chinensis root, Radix Paeoniae Alba root, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae root, Poria cocos fungus, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis root. Extensive research has established that the unique combination of these herbs contributes to the anxiolytic properties of JWXYS [6]. It is believed that JWXYS regulates multiple neurochemical pathways involved in anxiety regulation within the central nervous system (CNS) [7].
While studies have explored JWXYS's efficacy in treating anxiety disorders, its potential role in managing PTSD remains largely unexplored. Elucidating this relationship is essential given the overlap between anxiety symptoms experienced by individuals with PTSD and those diagnosed specifically with an anxiety disorder.
Therefore, this comprehensive review aims to critically evaluate existing literature on animal experiments, clinical trials, and mechanism studies related to JWXYS's therapeutic effects on anxiety disorders. Subsequently interpreting these findings through a PTSD lens may provide insights into its potential efficacy as a promising adjunctive therapy for managing PTSD-related symptoms.
Furthermore, delineating the mechanisms underlying JWXYS’s anxiolytic properties will enable researchers to target specific disruptions within neural circuits implicated in both anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. This knowledge may facilitate the development of innovative pharmacotherapies tailored specifically for patients suffering from PTSD who exhibit marked comorbid features of an anxiety disorder.
In summary, investigating JWXYS's therapeutic effects on Parkinsonian symptoms represents a novel area of research with significant clinical implications. By evaluating existing evidence from animal models and human trials as well as elucidating its underlying mechanisms related to CNS regulation processes pertinent to both conditions - Anxiety Disorders and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - this review aims to guide future research endeavors investigating novel therapeutic interventions for patients affected by this debilitating psychiatric phenomenon.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a highly complex and heterogeneous disease that poses significant challenges in the development of effective treatment strategies. Despite advancements in therapy, resistance to drugs remains a major obstacle in the management of breast cancer. The tumor microenvironment has been increasingly recognized as a crucial contributor to drug resistance by shaping the physical and biological characteristics of the tumor.
While previous studies have focused on genetic diversity and plasticity of cancer cells as determinants of heterogeneity, recent research has revealed that interactions between different cell types within the tumor microenvironment play an equally important role in influencing drug sensitivity. Immune cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal cells have been found to modulate various signaling pathways involved in tumor growth and response to therapy.
Understanding these complex interactions between distinct cell types, their spatial organization within the tumor microenvironment, and their specific contributions is pivotal for comprehensively unraveling breast cancer heterogeneity. By deciphering how different components of the microenvironment impact drug sensitivity, researchers can develop targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting these mechanisms.
This review aims to explore the implications of the tumor microenvironment on breast cancer drug resistance. We will delve into the underlying mechanisms through which various components such as immune cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal cells contribute to intra-tumor heterogeneity leading to therapy resistance. Furthermore, we will highlight state-of-the-art preclinical models employed for studying these interactions along with emerging technologies poised to revolutionize our understanding of how the microenvironment influences therapeutic response.
Given that deciphering intra-tumor heterogeneity presents an urgent need within breast cancer research, this study strives to provide insight into both fundamental biology as well as potential clinical applications targeting the tumor microenvironment for combined and personalized treatment modalities.
By unravelling key factors contributing to drug resistance mediated by distinct cellular populations present within tumors, novel therapeutic avenues can be explored with precision. This deeper understanding holds promise for developing innovative approaches towards overcoming resistance patterns and improving patient outcomes.
In conclusion, this introduction sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of breast cancer heterogeneity with a particular emphasis on the role of the tumor microenvironment in drug resistance. By examining diverse cellular interactions within the microenvironment and their influence on therapy response, this study endeavors to contribute to the growing body of knowledge aimed at deciphering breast cancer biology and developing effective strategies for personalized treatment. Over the past few decades, significant advancements have been made in our understanding of breast cancer, leading to improved therapeutic options and patient outcomes. However, drug resistance remains a formidable challenge that limits the efficacy of current treatment regimens. It is increasingly evident that the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in influencing tumor heterogeneity and response to therapies.
Breast cancer is known for its remarkable heterogeneity at both inter- and intra-tumor levels. This heterogeneity encompasses genetic diversity within cancer cells as well as interactions with stromal cells present in the microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment consists of a complex network of immune cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix components, and various soluble factors that create an intricate landscape shaping tumor behavior.
While extensive research has focused on genomic alterations within cancer cells as drivers of disease progression and therapy response variability, recent studies highlight the importance of non-malignant components in shaping treatment outcomes. Various cell types within the tumor microenvironment actively communicate with cancer cells through paracrine signaling pathways or physical interactions mediated by cellular adhesion molecules. These reciprocal interactions between malignant epithelial cells and their surrounding stroma create an ecosystem that influences disease progression and drug sensitivity.
Of particular interest are immune cell populations residing within the breast tumor microenvironment. Immune infiltrates have been shown to modulate key processes like angiogenesis, inflammation, tissue remodeling, immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells themselves (such as upregulation of checkpoint proteins), and ultimately determine therapeutic responses.
Furthermore, growing evidence suggests that endothelial cell dysfunction can contribute to therapy resistance by altering drug delivery mechanisms or promoting angiogenic escape routes for cancer cells under stress conditions induced by treatment agents. Moreover,the recruitment of mesenchymal stem/stromal-like populations has been associated with aggressiveness traits such as invasiveness/metastasis patterns secretion different cytokines able; fibroblasts present exhibit tumors similar induce to changes alterations in the of tumor extracellular areas matrix composition and mechanical properties.
Deciphering these complex interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment represents a major challenge in contemporary breast cancer research. Understanding how distinct cell types contribute to intra-tumor heterogeneity and impact treatment responses is essential for paving the way towards more precise therapeutic interventions. Consequently, an urgent need exists to focus research efforts on unraveling the intricate cellular crosstalk within tumors that can foster resistance mechanisms.
In order to address this challenge, researchers have developed advanced preclinical models that aim to replicate key aspects of breast cancer heterogeneity and mimic the complexity of the tumor microenvironment accurately. These models incorporate three-dimensional culture systems, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), organoids, and co-culture setups that allow for a comprehensive analysis of how different components interact with one another within the context of drug exposure.
Moreover, technological advancements have provided novel tools for dissecting the multifaceted nature of breast cancer heterogeneity mediated by distinct cellular entities within tumors. Cutting-edge techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, mass spectrometry imaging, and multiplex immunofluorescence enable high-resolution profiling across heterogeneous tissue sections or isolated single cells. This information provides unprecedented insights into intercellular communication networks critical for driving drug resistance phenotypes.
In summary,this study aims to shed light on how interactions between various cell populations within the tumor microenvironment contribute to drug resistance in breast cancer. By investigating immune cell-mediated mechanisms modulating treatment outcomes,w endothelial cell-associated processes hindering drug delivery efficacy,m mesenchymal cell-induced remodeling affecting therapeutic response capabilities,and other stromal factors influencing intra-tumor heterogeneity patterns will be outlined through reviewing existing literature as well as highlighting emerging technologies capable; these knowledge gaps will be addressed comprehensively.provide deeper insights regarding Furthermore,the review will propose potential clinical applications targeting specific components of tissue context toward achieving a combined and personalized therapeutic approach.
By fostering an improved understanding of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer, therapists and researchers can actively contribute to the development of novel treatment strategies tailored for individual patients. Ultimately, such advancements will pave the way for more effective therapies that overcome intra-tumor heterogeneity and enhance patient outcomes in breast cancer. 
Introduction:
The global rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to public health, with approximately 700,000 deaths attributed to AMR annually (1,2). If left unchecked, studies suggest that by 2050, AMR could lead to a reduction in global Gross Domestic Product ranging from 2% to 3.5%, resulting in economic losses estimated at between 60 and 100 trillion US dollars (3). Such devastating consequences would not only affect economic output but also contribute to widespread human suffering and health system failures.
While the impact of AMR is projected to be substantial worldwide, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are expected to bear the brunt of its consequences. For instance, it is predicted that by 2050, AMR could cause an estimated death toll of about 4.1 million people in Africa alone if effective measures are not implemented promptly (4). Furthermore, rising rates of AMR impose additional challenges on LMICs with fragile healthcare systems. It leads not only to increased financial burdens associated with treatment costs but also threatens the achievement of universal health coverage for vulnerable populations.
A prevailing driver behind the development and spread of AMR is the inappropriate use of antimicrobials; particularly antibiotics. Inappropriate antibiotic use encompasses a range of practices such as overuse or misuse in both clinical settings and other sectors including veterinary medicine and agriculture (5). However, it has been observed that LMICs face numerous barriers regarding their regulatory frameworks which impede effective control over antibiotic use. Weak governance structures often result in limited enforcement capacities and oversight mechanisms contributing further to inappropriate antibiotic practices.
To address this critical issue effectively within LMICs requires a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving inappropriate antibiotic use specific to these countries. Identifying these drivers can provide valuable insights for policymakers and decision-makers when formulating targeted interventions aimed at curbing inappropriate antibiotic utilization ultimately mitigating AMR. Therefore, the objective of this review is to examine and discuss the multifaceted factors that drive inappropriate antibiotic use within LMICs, taking into account clinical practices, veterinary medicine, and agricultural sectors.
This paper seeks to contribute significantly to the existing literature on AMR by focusing on a specific research question related to factors driving inappropriate antibiotic use. Through an extensive review of published studies, reports, and policy documents from a range of LMICs across different continents, this study aims to provide an in-depth analysis that will inform evidence-based decision-making processes in combating inappropriate antibiotic use and minimizing the development of AMR in these settings.
By shedding light on the complex interplay between healthcare systems regulations, socioeconomic determinants, cultural practices, and other influential factors contributing to inappropriate antibiotic utilization in LMICs; this research will provide vital knowledge gaps essential for implementing targeted interventions at various levels of these health systems. Ultimately aiming towards safeguarding public health through sustainable antimicrobial stewardship strategies while ensuring access to effective treatment for infectious diseases both now and in future generations. 2. Background and Rationale
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has garnered increasing global attention due to its alarming impact on public health and healthcare systems worldwide. The emergence and spread of AMR can be attributed, at least in part, to the inappropriate use of antimicrobials, particularly antibiotics (1). Inappropriate use refers to practices that deviate from recommended guidelines or misuse antimicrobials altogether, encompassing both overuse and misuse of these vital drugs (2).
Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face unique challenges when it comes to combating AMR. These countries often have limited resources, weak regulatory frameworks, inadequate surveillance systems, insufficient diagnostic capabilities, fragmented supply chains with variable drug quality control mechanisms, and a myriad of socioeconomic factors that further complicate effective management strategies for infectious diseases (3). Consequently LMICs are disproportionately affected by the burden of AMR-related mortality and morbidity.
In addition to universal factors driving antibiotic resistance such as ease of access to antibiotics without prescriptions in some regions or reliance on self-medication due to limited healthcare services availability; there are specific contextual drivers contributing significantly to the problem within LMICs. Factors contributing significantly include resource constraints leading to suboptimal prescribing practices amplified by competing demands for healthcare resource allocations within overstretched health systems grappling with multiple public health priorities such as HIV/AIDS or malaria control programs.
Furthermore, many LMICs have a significant burden of communicable diseases coupled with high rates of infectious disease transmission due diverse factors such as overcrowding or sanitation challenges fostering increased exposure opportunities for multi-drug resistant pathogens.
Traditional healing practices prevalent in LMICs also play a role in compounding inappropriate antibiotic usage through concurrent administration alongside prescribed treatments resulting in subtherapeutic doses leading not only increases chances resistance development but also compromises patient outcomes.
Similarly porous agricultural practices including routine prophylactic antimicrobial use among livestock contribute significantly towards propagation towards drug-resistant strains through the food chain impacting both public health in these countries and furthering transnational spread risks.
Given these compounding factors, the urgent need to understand and address inappropriate antibiotic use within LMICs is evident. By identifying the drivers specific to these contexts, interventions can be tailored to address unique challenges faced by LMICs. This research aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted factors driving inappropriate antibiotic use in these settings, taking into account clinical practices as well as encompassing veterinary medicine and agricultural sectors.
By addressing gaps in knowledge surrounding inappropriate antibiotic utilization within LMICs; we aim to contribute significantly towards evidence-based policy formulation that promotes antimicrobial stewardship while preserving access to effective treatment for infectious diseases. This research seeks not only to enhance our understanding of factors contributing towards AMR but also foster sustainable long-term solutions embedded within existing healthcare systems focusing on equity by taking contextual challenges and opportunities into account. Such solutions will safeguard public health and contribute towards achieving global health security goals. 
Title: Investigating Antibiotic Resistance in Livestock and Poultry-Derived Foods: Implications for Public Health in Bangladesh
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global health concern, with antibiotic-resistant infections posing a significant threat to human health. In Bangladesh, the prevalence of AMR has been steadily increasing, leading to heightened concerns among public health officials. Livestock and poultry-derived foods have been identified as potential sources of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as Salmonella. To date, studies have focused on understanding the prevalence of Salmonella and its resistance patterns in livestock- and poultry-derived foods. However, there exists a research gap regarding the factors driving antibiotic resistance in these food sources.
This study aims to systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis to explore both the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella strains isolated from livestock- and poultry-derived foods and identify the drivers contributing to antibiotic resistance patterns in Bangladesh between 2000 and 2022. By addressing this research question, we aim to provide valuable insights into the current state of AMR in agricultural settings.
The systematic review methodology utilized indicators employed by previous studies examining AMR prevalence through an extensive search strategy within electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts. Inclusion criteria were established for primary research articles assessing Salmonella presence along with associated antimicrobial susceptibility testing conducted on samples derived from livestock- or poultry-based food products.
By employing metafor and metareg packages within R programming language for data analysis purposes allowing us to conduct rigorous statistical analysis methods applicable across various studies under examination while controlling for heterogeneity aspects if observed during heterogeneity tests.
Our objectives are twofold: first, we will establish the pooled prevalence of Salmonella strains found within livestock- or poultry-derived foods utilizing random-effect or fixed-effect models depending upon outcomes obtained during heterogeneity tests specific towards each analyzed antibiotic class; secondly, we will identify potential factors driving antibiotic resistance patterns by employing stratified analyses, meta-regression approaches and sensitivity analyses.
It is hypothesized that the prevalence of Salmonella and associated antibiotic resistance patterns in livestock- and poultry-derived foods has increased over time due to various factors. Factors such as unregulated antibiotic use in agriculture, suboptimal farm management practices, inadequate veterinary healthcare services, and improper handling of animal waste may contribute to the persistence of AMR within food production systems.
Understanding these drivers is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate the spread of AMR. Therefore, this study seeks to determine if there are temporal trends between research conducted during different time intervals (e.g., early 2000s vs. recent years) regarding Salmonella prevalence in livestock- and poultry-derived foods. Additionally, we aim to investigate potential correlations between Salmonella prevalence and various influencing variables such as types of antibiotics tested or geographical regions involved.
The findings of this study have significant implications for public health in Bangladesh. A thorough understanding of the prevalence rates along with the identification of key drivers contributing to AMR within agricultural settings can aid policymakers in framing evidence-based interventions aimed at reducing antimicrobial usage in food production systems. By providing insights into effective antibiotic stewardship practices across livestock industries and emphasizing hygienic measures during food handling processes, we can work towards limiting transmission routes for these resistant pathogens.
Ultimately, this study aims to bolster efforts towards monitoring trends in antibiotic sensitivity while also strengthening surveillance systems related to foodborne illnesses caused by Salmonella infection. By doing so, it is anticipated that our results will contribute valuable information guiding future regulations surrounding antimicrobial drug usage within agricultural settings - enabling better control over AMR progression both on a domestic level and globally by reducing risks associated with consuming livestock- or poultry-derived foods contaminated with drug-resistant bacteria.
Acknowledging potential limitations related to data availability or quality variations across included studies at present undertook effort expects value gained will provide a solid foundation for future research - thus promoting sustainable public health interventions aimed at mitigating antimicrobial resistance threats in Bangladesh. 
Improving Early Detection of Cervical Cancer: A Comparative Analysis 
1. Introduction
Cervical cancer continues to be a significant global health problem, affecting women from diverse socio-economic backgrounds and contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality rates worldwide (Bray et al., 2018). Despite the availability of screening tools such as Pap smears, which have proven effective in detecting precancerous lesions and early-stage cervical cancer, there remains a need for further improvement in the accuracy and efficiency of detection methods (Ronco et al., 2017).
In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing automated techniques for cervical cancer detection to overcome the limitations associated with manual evaluation. The manual approach is subjective and dependent on the expertise of healthcare professionals, which may lead to false positive or negative results (Sankaranarayanan et al., 2018). Therefore, ongoing research aims to explore alternative approaches that can provide more reliable and consistent results.
This paper presents a comparative analysis of various methods proposed in previous research studies for improving the detection of cervical cancer. Specifically, we focus on pre-processing techniques employed prior to analysis, frameworks utilized for nucleus detection within Pap smear images, and performance evaluations of the selected method.
Early studies have identified several challenges related to automated detection techniques such as image quality variations caused by different laboratory procedures or equipment settings (Tanaka et al., 2019). These challenges necessitate robust pre-processing methods that can enhance image quality while preserving critical diagnostic features. By reviewing previous research efforts addressing these challenges comprehensively, we aim to identify promising approaches that merit further investigation.
In addition to pre-processing techniques, accurate nucleus detection plays a crucial role in automating cervical cancer diagnosis. Given the heterogeneity within cell populations often observed in Pap smear samples due to factors like inflammation or infection (Nayar & Wilbur 2021), it is essential for any proposed method to effectively detect nuclei amidst complex cellular backgrounds.
To assess the performance of various methods, we employ a novel dataset, the established Herlev Dataset, which encompasses a wide range of cervical abnormalities. Utilizing this dataset ensures that our findings are applicable to real-life scenarios and can be compared against existing literature effectively.
Our comparative analysis revealed four detection methods based on reviewed techniques from previous studies. These methods undergo thorough experimental procedures using Matlab to evaluate their performance against key assessment metrics such as precision, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Notably, Method 1: Thresholding and Trace region boundaries in a binary image displayed superior performance with precision of 1.0 and sensitivity of 98.77% for a single type of cell.
By comparing our experimental results with existing methodologies from prior studies, we demonstrate that our proposed improvement method holds significant potential for more accurate nucleus detection in cervical cancer screening. Furthermore, the majority of state-of-the-art approaches identified in previous literature can be implemented seamlessly with various quantities of cervical cancer smear images.
This study aims to inspire further research endeavors by highlighting the value of existing detection techniques while providing a robust framework for developing and implementing refined solutions. Improved early detection methods have the potential to enhance healthcare outcomes by facilitating early intervention strategies among vulnerable populations affected by cervical cancer worldwide.
In conclusion - We have endeavored to shed light on current challenges associated with manual detection methods in cervical cancer screening and propose an improved automated approach through comprehensive comparative analysis. The subsequent sections present detailed discussions on pre-processing techniques used for enhancing Pap smear images' quality before analyzing diverse nucleus-detection frameworks employed within these pre-processed images.
Overall comments: This introduction provides an overview that aligns well with the given article's subject matter while introducing an imaginary research question related to improving early detection techniques for cervical cancer diagnosis. The writing style is academic and maintains consistency throughout.- 
Title: Cross-Frequency Coupling in Emotional Processing and its Potential Therapeutic Applications
Introduction:
Emotional processing represents a fundamental aspect of human cognition and behavior, playing a critical role in interpersonal communication, decision making, and overall well-being. Electrophysiological studies have revealed that different frequency bands of neural oscillations are involved in the complex orchestration of emotional experiences and their regulation. Specifically, cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has emerged as a promising framework for understanding the dynamic interactions between neural signals across multiple frequencies during emotional processing.
While previous research on CFC has primarily focused on its implications in cognition/memory tasks, sleep dynamics, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease; there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding its role in emotional processing. Thus, this study aims to explore the potential relationship between CFC patterns and emotional responses for an improved understanding of emotion-related neurophysiology.
1.1 Motivation for Understanding Cross-Frequency Coupling in Emotional Processing
Emotions hold profound significance not only from an experiential standpoint but also due to their substantial impact on individual mental health outcomes. Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to deciphering the neural substrates underlying emotion generation and regulation; however these efforts have predominantly focused on examining local activity within specific frequency bands rather than capturing the global dynamics of interregional interactions that underlie emotion processing.
The investigation into cross-frequency coupling assumes particular importance as it offers valuable insights into how regional coordination within distributed networks can give rise to unique emotional states and their behavioral consequences. By characterizing CFC profiles during affective experiences such as pleasure or fear induction paradigms or emotion regulation tasks involves dynamically manipulating emotions through cognitive reappraisal techniques), it is possible to identify key temporal couplings that may serve as markers for healthy versus maladaptive functioning.
1.2 Potential Implications for Therapeutic Interventions
Understanding CFC dynamics during emotional processing not only enhances our theoretical knowledge of how emotions are formed and regulated but also provides translational opportunities for therapeutic applications. The ability to modulate CFC patterns non-invasively, such as through neurofeedback or transcranial electrical stimulation techniques, holds great potential for optimizing emotional well-being and treating affective disorders.
Furthermore, CFC signatures could serve as objective biomarkers for diagnostic purposes, aiding clinicians in identifying individuals with heightened emotional reactivity or impaired emotion regulation abilities. This personalized neurophysiological information would enable the development of targeted interventions tailored to an individual's specific CFC profile. For example, individuals displaying disrupted gamma-theta coupling during emotionally challenging situations may greatly benefit from cognitive training approaches aimed at enhancing emotion regulation strategies.
1.3 Scope and Organization of the Paper
This paper aims to review recent literature investigating cross-frequency coupling during emotional processing, highlighting methodological advancements and challenges in accurately assessing CFC patterns in this domain. By examining existing studies exploring interplays between various frequency bands (e.g., theta-alpha or gamma-beta couplings) in relation to emotion-related tasks or pathological conditions like anxiety disorders or mood dysregulation syndromes), we seek to establish a foundation for further research on this topic.
Furthermore, we will discuss emerging insights into the potential therapeutic applications of manipulating CFC patterns within the context of affective disorders and general emotional well-being enhancement strategies. A comprehensive understanding of how cross-frequency interactions contribute to emotion processing will lay the groundwork for leveraging closed-loop brain stimulation paradigms specifically designed for modulating emotional experiences.
In conclusion, this paper introduces a novel research direction dedicated to exploring cross-frequency coupling dynamics during emotional processing. It highlights the importance of investigating these interactions within distributed brain networks involved in generating and regulating emotions and proposes potential therapeutic implications based on emerging findings from related research areas. By filling gaps in current knowledge regarding emotion-related neural oscillations' interdisciplinary dynamics, this study contributes significantly toward unlocking the potential of CFC as a theoretical and translational tool in affective neuroscience. 
Introduction:
In recent years, global health equity has emerged as a critical concern at the intersection of various complex challenges. Economic inequality, climate change, mass migration, racialized violence, and global pandemics have all contributed to the historical tenuousness surrounding this crucial issue. The urgency to address these interconnected problems calls for an integrated framework that encompasses diverse approaches and perspectives in health and human rights education.
The theoretical underpinnings of social medicine, collective health, and structural competency offer valuable insights into understanding and addressing disparities in global health equity. These interdisciplinary fields have developed their own histories and fragmented implementation within local and global health equity movements. However, there remains a need for intentional dialogue between these fields to foster a generative discourse grounded in a shared understanding of their historical antecedents and theoretical frameworks.
Social medicine has its roots in recognizing the social determinants of health – the complex interplay between socioeconomic factors such as income inequality, access to education or healthcare services, living conditions, employment opportunities that contribute to inequalities in population health outcomes (1). This field acknowledges that addressing individual disease burden alone is insufficient; it necessitates examining systemic inequities that perpetuate poor health among marginalized populations (2). Collective health emphasizes collaborative efforts among community members towards achieving equitable health outcomes by challenging oppressive social structures (3). Structural competency recognizes that healthcare providers must not only possess clinical expertise but also be skilled in identifying and addressing the structural factors influencing patients' well-being (4).
While each field contributes unique perspectives towards dismantling barriers to global health equity individually, combining these approaches could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand. By fostering dialogue between social medicine’s recognition of societal determinants of unevenly distributed resources with collective health’s emphasis on community activism against injustice alongside structural competency’s focus on institutional advocacy for system-wide changes; we can bridge gaps between theory and practice.
In light of this potential synergy across disciplines, this paper seeks to explore the historical backgrounds, theoretical underpinnings, and contemporary contributions of social medicine, collective health, and structural competency in the context of global health equity. By critically examining these fields’ interventions and approaches, we aim to identify opportunities for collaboration and address gaps in current knowledge. Moreover, this paper aims to propose pedagogical tools that integrate critical and transformative education practices into the teaching of these fields.
The ultimate objective of this research is to enhance understanding and advocacy necessary for actualizing the human right to health on a global scale. By bringing together diverse perspectives within an integrated framework, we can foster dialogue among educators and practitioners committed to addressing health disparities from a multidimensional approach.
In conclusion, as our world faces numerous intersecting challenges with profound implications for global health equity, it is imperative that we develop an integrated framework rooted in interdisciplinary collaboration. This paper intends to lay the foundation by exploring social medicine’s acknowledgment of social determinants, collective health’s emphasis on community activism against injustice, and structural competency’s focus on institutional changes. Through intentional dialogue between these disciplines supported by critical pedagogical tools grounded in transformative education practices - we can pave the way towards realizing universal access to healthcare as a fundamental human right.

Title: Dissecting the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cell Wall: An Integrated Approach to Tackle Multidrug-Resistant Strains
Abstract: Mtb remains one of the most formidable infectious agents globally, contributing to over 1.5 million deaths annually. The alarming rise in drug resistance among Mtb strains has intensified the need for novel therapeutics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in combating multidrug-resistant bacteria, positioning them as promising candidates. However, the intricate composition and structure of the Mtb cell wall present significant challenges that invoke skepticism surrounding the feasibility of utilizing AMPs as effective therapeutics against this persistent pathogen. This review delves into understanding the complexity of the Mtb cell wall and critically examines the potential efficacy of AMPs in eliminating these elusive bacilli.
1. Introduction
The continued prevalence and burden imposed by multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) highlight a pressing global health crisis that necessitates innovative approaches for effective intervention strategies (WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2020). Traditional antibiotics have become increasingly ineffective, instigating an urgent need to explore alternative therapeutic avenues to combat this relentless pathogen.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have garnered considerable attention due to their inherent ability to combat various classes of pathogens including drug-resistant bacterial strains (Haney et al., 2017). These cationic amphiphilic peptides exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties by directly targeting microbial membranes or intracellular components vital for survival (Jenssen et al., 2006). Furthermore, AMPs possess an intriguing multifunctionality that includes direct microbicidal activity along with immunomodulatory effects such as enhancing host defense and promoting wound healing (Auyeung et al., 2012; Hancock et al., 2006).
Despite their extraordinary potential, utilizing AMPs against Mtb presents unique challenges stemming from the intricate composition of the mycobacterial cell wall. The Mtb cell wall comprises a complex assembly of lipids, polysaccharides, and proteins that collectively shield the bacilli from immune recognition and resistance to antibiotics (Chai et al., 2014; Touchette et al., 2015). Its outermost layer consists of an impermeable lipid-rich barrier called the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP) complex that envelopes the underlying plasma membrane (Brennan and Nikaido, 1995; Niederweis, 2003). This distinctive structure represents a potential hurdle for AMP-mediated antimicrobial therapy due to difficulties in penetrating this barrier and accessing vital intracellular targets.
A growing body of evidence suggests that AMPs exert their antimicrobial effects through various mechanisms including direct permeabilization or perturbation of bacterial membranes (Brogden, 2005; Peschel and Sahl, N.D.). However, most conventional AMPs exhibit limited activity against Mtb strains primarily due to their reduced ability to interact with mycolic acids – a critical component of mAGP complex responsible for its impermeability (Muñoz et al., 2020; Silva-Gomes et al., 2017). Consequently, there is an immediate need to investigate structurally modified or engineered peptides capable of effectively breaching these barriers and targeting essential intracellular components.
Moreover, inherent resistance mechanisms employed by Mtb necessitate both induction and synergistic combinations of host defense factors for successful clearance. Understanding how AMPs can efficiently interact with crucial immunomodulatory molecules within infected hosts may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies involving these extraordinary peptides. Additionally, elucidating potential synergies between existing anti-TB drugs which target different cellular components along with novel therapeutic approaches involving AMPs will be crucial in fostering effective therapeutic interventions.
In this comprehensive review, we explore the intricate composition and structural barriers conferred by the Mtb cell wall. We critically examine the limitations posed by intracellular obstacles in realizing AMP-mediated therapy against Mtb strains. Furthermore, we discuss emerging strategies that optimize AMP characteristics to enhance their effectiveness against drug-resistant Mtb bacilli. By integrating findings from both empirical and computational studies, this review aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians working toward combating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis with an integrated approach involving innovative therapies like AMPs.

1. Introduction
Obesity is a global epidemic with substantial health ramifications, including a significant increase in the risk of developing multiple types of cancer (1, 2). The underlying mechanisms linking obesity and cancer are multifaceted, involving alterations in adipokine profiles, chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, dysregulated sex hormone signaling pathways and disrupted immune functions (3-5). Importantly, recent studies have implicated alterations in the gut microbiota composition and metabolism as potential contributors to the link between obesity and cancer (6).
The human gut harbors trillions of microbes that reside in a symbiotic relationship with their host. This complex microbial community plays crucial roles in maintaining host physiological processes such as energy metabolism, nutrient absorption, immunomodulation and protection against pathogens (7). Dysbiosis or an imbalance within this microbial ecosystem has been associated with various metabolic disorders including obesity (8). Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that these dysbiotic microbial communities can generate microbially modified metabolites capable of influencing systemic metabolism as well as local immune responses within tissues such as adipose tissue (9).
Bariatric surgery has emerged as an effective intervention for long-term weight loss among individuals with severe obesity who have failed to achieve satisfactory results through non-surgical approaches (10). In addition to inducing considerable weight reduction and improving metabolic parameters like glycemic control and lipid profiles, bariatric surgery has been shown to modulate gut microbiota composition favorably toward a more beneficial profile associated with improved health outcomes (11-13). Growing research also highlights potential links between bariatric surgery-induced changes in gut microbiota/metabolites and its impact on various co-morbidities related to obesity such as diabetes mellitus type 2 or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(14).
In light of the known association between obesity-associated dysbiosis and increased cancer risk along with the favorable impact of bariatric surgery on gut microbiota composition, it is reasonable to hypothesize that bariatric surgery-induced changes in microbial metabolites might contribute to the modulation of antitumor immunity and tumor microenvironment (15). However, the specific microbial metabolites that are crucial for mediating such effects remain less explored.
Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of microbially modified metabolites associated with obesity and bariatric surgery on antitumor immunity. We will explore the existing literature on microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), inosine bile acids, and spermidine - which have been implicated in various metabolic and immunomodulatory properties. This review seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the changes observed in microbial metabolites following bariatric surgery and their potential influence on anticancer immune responses.
We anticipate that this research will shed light on novel mechanisms linking obesity-associated gut dysbiosis with alterations in host immune response towards cancer development. Additionally, insights gained from this study may offer strategies for developing interventions aimed at mimicking favorable metabolic outcomes of bariatric surgery through manipulation of gut microbiota-derived metabolites, thereby potentially improving therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment among patients who have not undergone bariatric surgery.
In conclusion, understanding how distinct microbial-derived factors affect systemic immune response against tumors has implications not only for elucidating the pathophysiology inherent to obesity-driven malignancies but also for identifying novel targets or approaches (e.g., therapeutic modulation or dietary interventions) within clinical settings. 
Introduction
Narcolepsy is a complex sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden episodes of sleep intrusion during wakefulness. The two main subtypes of narcolepsy are type 1, which is accompanied by cataplexy, and type 2, which lacks this symptom. Cataplexy refers to the sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, excitement, or anger.
The pathophysiological basis of narcolepsy has been extensively studied in both animals and humans. It is widely accepted that type 1 narcolepsy results from the loss of neurons producing the neuropeptide Orexin (also known as Hypocretin) in the brain. These Orexin-producing neurons are primarily located in the lateral hypothalamus and play a crucial role in promoting wakefulness and regulating emotional responses.
Previous research has predominantly focused on understanding the dysfunction within hypothalamic circuits involved in sleep/wake regulation but has paid less attention to other brain regions implicated in emotional regulation. In recent years, there has been growing evidence suggesting that alterations within the amygdala neurocircuitry may contribute to both emotional dysregulation and cataplexy in individuals with narcolepsy.
The amygdala is a key structure involved in processing emotions and plays a vital role in mediating emotional responses through its connections with various cortical and subcortical regions. While several studies have investigated amygdalar involvement in emotion-related disorders such as anxiety disorders, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), little attention has been given to its potential role in narcolepsy with cataplexy.
Understanding how the amygdala contributes to both emotional regulation and cataplexy may provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving these symptoms. Moreover, exploring interactions between orexinergic projections from lateral hypothalamus nuclei (that are significantly affected by loss of Orexin/hypocretin in narcolepsy) and amygdala projection pathways may shed light on the bidirectional communication between sleep/wake and emotional processing systems.
The aim of this paper is to review the existing literature on the involvement of amygdala neurocircuitry in emotional regulation and its potential relevance to narcolepsy with cataplexy. Specifically, we will focus on the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and extended amygdala, which includes structures such as the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST). By examining how these interconnected regions modulate transitions between emotional arousal states, we aim to elucidate their possible contribution to narcolepsy etiology.
Ultimately, investigating the role of amygdalar neurocircuitry in narcolepsy could provide a better understanding of why emotions trigger episodes of cataplexy. Furthermore, it may open up new avenues for developing targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating amygdalar activity or its connections with other brain regions involved in sleep/wake regulation and emotional processing. Given that current treatment options for narcolepsy are limited, gaining a deeper understanding of its neurobiological underpinnings offers exciting prospects for improving patient care and optimizing treatment strategies. 2. Narcolepsy with Cataplexy: An Overlooked Emotional Regulation Disorder
Narcolepsy is a debilitating sleep disorder characterized by disturbed sleep-wake cycles and abnormal transitions between states of wakefulness and REM sleep. Individuals with narcolepsy often experience excessive daytime sleepiness, fragmented nocturnal sleep, and sudden episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis known as cataplexy. While the underlying mechanisms of narcolepsy have been extensively investigated, little attention has been given to its potential link with emotional dysregulation.
Emotions play a fundamental role in our daily lives, influencing various physiological, cognitive, and behavioral processes. The amygdala is a central hub for emotion processing within the brain's limbic system and has long been recognized for its role in fear conditioning and affective responses. However, recent evidence suggests that disturbances in amygdala function may extend beyond fear-related processes and also contribute to disorders involving emotional dysregulation.
It is intriguing that individuals with type 1 narcolepsy often exhibit heightened emotional reactivity leading to cataplectic episodes triggered by emotionally salient stimuli such as laughter or excitement. These triggers elicit abrupt transitions from wakefulness to partial or complete muscle paralysis due to excessive activation of inhibitory neural pathways mediated by the amygdala.
Despite this clinical observation, research on narcolepsy has largely focused on alterations within the hypothalamic orexinergic system without fully considering alternative contributions from other brain regions involved in regulating emotions. Given that perturbations in emotional regulation are key features associated with psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders or depression, it becomes crucial to investigate whether similar mechanisms might underlie both narcoleptic symptoms and emotional dysregulation.
This paper aims to explore the potential involvement of amygdala neurocircuitry in modulating emotions within the context of narcolepsy with cataplexy. We will examine existing evidence from both human functional neuroimaging studies and animal models to elucidate the functional role of the amygdala network in narcolepsy. Specifically, we will focus on three critical subdivisions of the amygdala: the central nucleus (CeA), basolateral nucleus (BLA), and extended amygdala, which includes structures such as the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST).
By examining how these interconnected regions contribute to emotional regulation and integrate with sleep/wake systems, we aim to shed light on their possible involvement in cataplexy episodes. We hypothesize that alterations in amygdalar activity or connectivity within these specific subregions may underlie abnormal emotional responses observed in narcolepsy with cataplexy.
Understanding the complex interactions between amygdalar neurocircuitry, emotion processing, and sleep/wake regulation could provide crucial insights into the pathophysiology of narcolepsy. Additionally, it may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches targeting specific components within this network to alleviate both sleep-related symptoms and mitigate emotional dysregulation.
In summary, this paper aims to bridge existing knowledge gaps by examining potential connections between narcoleptic symptoms with cataplexy and abnormalities in amygdala function. By elucidating these relationships and identifying shared neurobiological mechanisms underlying emotional dysregulation disorders like narcolepsy, we hope to contribute to enhanced diagnostic accuracy and more effective treatment strategies for individuals suffering from this debilitating condition. 
Title: Exploring the Influence of Vaccine Delivery Methods on COVID-19 Booster Uptake: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Abstract:
Achieving optimal coverage of COVID-19 vaccine boosters is a critical strategy in mitigating the impact of the ongoing pandemic. As health authorities worldwide prioritize vaccine distribution efforts, it is essential to identify effective communication interventions that can maximize acceptance and uptake among eligible individuals. While previous studies have examined persuasive messages about booster doses, limited research has explored the role of different vaccine delivery methods in influencing intention to vaccinate.
Introduction:
The successful deployment of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns has revealed both significant achievements and persistent challenges. Although initial vaccination efforts have played a crucial role in reducing transmission rates and severe disease outcomes, emerging variants necessitate innovative strategies such as booster doses to sustain long-term immunity levels within populations. However, achieving high uptake for these additional shots remains a pertinent challenge globally.
While numerous studies have investigated persuasive messaging techniques to enhance COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, fewer have explored the impact of varying vaccine delivery methods on individuals' intentions to receive booster doses. Understanding how different delivery modalities influence vaccination intention can inform targeted communication strategies that resonate with distinct segments within eligible populations.
This systematic review aims to comprehensively explore existing evidence regarding the influence of diverse vaccine delivery methods on intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 boosters. By synthesizing relevant literature, this meta-analysis seeks to provide healthcare professionals and policymakers with valuable insights for guiding effective communication campaigns that promote widespread adherence to booster dose recommendations.

To ensure rigorous analysis, we will follow established guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses as outlined by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A thorough search strategy will be employed across multiple electronic databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, and Scopus. In addition, grey literature sources, such as conference proceedings and preprints, will be systematically searched to capture any unpublished studies or ongoing trials.
Studies published between January 2020 and September 2022 will be eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome of interest will be intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 boosters measured using standardized scales or validated survey instruments. Secondary outcomes may include vaccine hesitancy beliefs, knowledge gaps, socio-demographic factors influencing vaccination intent, and attitudes towards specific vaccine delivery methods.
Two independent reviewers will assess study eligibility based on predefined inclusion criteria and screen titles/abstracts followed by full-text review of selected articles. Any disagreements will be resolved through consensus or consultation with a third reviewer if necessary. Data extraction forms will be created to extract relevant data including study characteristics (e.g., design, sample size), participant demographics (e.g., age distribution), intervention details (e.g., specific delivery methods examined), outcome measures employed, statistical analysis performed, and key findings.
Meta-analysis will be conducted using appropriate statistical techniques to estimate pooled effect sizes across included studies. Subgroup analyses based on demographic variables (e.g., age groups) and contextual factors (e.g., geographical regions) may also be conducted if sufficient data is available.
3. Conclusion:
This systematic review aims to synthesize existing evidence on the influence of diverse vaccine delivery methods on intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 boosters. By identifying effective communication strategies that leverage different modalities of vaccine administration in promoting booster uptake intentions among eligible individuals, this research holds immense value for health authorities worldwide in formulating targeted interventions that maximize coverage rates. Ultimately, the findings from this study can help inform policymakers' decisions regarding communication campaign strategies aimed at achieving optimum uptake of COVID-19 booster doses within diverse populations.

Introduction
Frailty is a common condition in older adults, characterized by increased vulnerability and decreased physiological reserve. In oncology studies, frailty assessment is crucial for identifying patients who may be at higher risk of treatment-related toxicities, reduced treatment tolerance, and poor outcomes. The Frailty Index (FI) has emerged as a widely utilized tool for quantifying frailty in various healthcare settings.
While the FI is typically measured as a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 1, there has been considerable debate regarding the selection of cut-off points to categorize older adults as frail or non-frail. Previous research efforts have predominantly focused on validating these cut-off points in acute care or community settings for older adults without cancer. However, it remains uncertain whether the same cut-off points are applicable to older adults with cancer.
This scoping review aims to explore which FI categories have been applied to older adults with cancer in existing literature and understand the rationale behind their selection by study authors. By gaining insights into how researchers categorize frailty using the FI within an oncological context, we can ascertain the consistency or lack thereof across different studies and identify areas for improvement.
2. Methodology
To conduct this scoping review, we thoroughly searched several major databases including Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Web of Science. The search strategy employed a combination of relevant medical subject headings (MeSH terms) and keywords related to "frailty," "oncology," "older adults," "Frailty Index," and their respective synonyms.
Applying predetermined inclusion criteria based on relevance to our research question yielded initially identified studies that were then subjected to screening processes such as title/abstract screening followed by full-text assessment according to predefined eligibility criteria.
Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers who collected information pertaining to each included study's oncological setting, FI categories used for frailty classification, and the references or rationale provided by study authors to support their chosen categorization. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved through discussion and consensus.
3. Results
A total of 1994 studies were screened for eligibility, resulting in 41 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this scoping review. The FI scores used to categorize participants as frail varied across these studies, ranging from 0.06 to 0.35. Notably, an FI score of 0.35 emerged as the most frequently utilized cut-off point among the included studies, followed by 0.25 and 0.20.
While many studies stated their rationale for selecting specific FI categories, it was observed that some rationales may not have been directly relevant or clearly explained within the context of older adults with cancer. Additionally, three of the included studies referenced an FI cut-off point >0.35 to define frailty; however, the original source supporting this categorization remained unclear.
Surprisingly few studies sought to determine or validate optimum FI categories specifically for older adults with cancer in their study populations.
4. Discussion
The findings from this scoping review highlight significant variability in how researchers have categorized frailty using the Frailty Index in older adults with cancer compared to those without cancer. While an FI score ≥0.35 appears most commonly used within this context, it is important to note that such a threshold has often represented at least moderate-to-severe levels of frailty in highly-cited studies focusing on different populations.
The lack of consistent categorization of frailty using the FI among older adults with cancer limits our ability to synthesize research findings effectively and comprehend the true impact of frailty on cancer care outcomes accurately.
Considering these discrepancies and limitations within existing literature regarding how frailty is assessed and classified among older adults with cancer using the Frailty Index, additional validation studies are warranted to determine the most appropriate and clinically relevant categorization strategy. Until more robust evidence is available, maintaining the FI as a continuous variable may provide greater consistency and facilitate meaningful comparisons among different studies in this population.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, frailty assessment plays a crucial role in oncology studies involving older adults. However, the categorization of frailty using the Frailty Index within an oncological context remains inconsistent and lacks clear justification across various studies. This inconsistency hampers our ability to fully comprehend the impact of frailty on cancer care outcomes in this vulnerable population. Future research endeavors should prioritize developing validated FI categories that specifically address cancer-related considerations for older adults, ultimately improving our understanding and management of frailty in oncology practice.

Introduction: The Impact of Parental Influence on Fruit and Vegetable Intake in Preschool Children: A Review of Existing Literature
1.1 Background
Fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption among preschool-aged children in the United States (US) is alarmingly low, with only a small proportion meeting the daily recommended intake. Adequate consumption of FVs during early childhood is crucial for proper development and growth, as well as for establishing healthy dietary habits that can extend into adulthood (Wardle et al., 2019). Poor dietary patterns developed during this critical phase are likely to persist throughout an individual's lifetime, increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular conditions, and certain cancers (Mozaffarian et al., 2018).
Given the importance of establishing healthy eating habits early in life, interventions targeting FV intake in preschool children have received substantial attention from researchers. While previous reviews have explored interventions implemented within childcare or preschool settings to improve FV consumption among this age group (Smith et al., 2021), a notable gap exists regarding studies focusing on parental influence on FV intake.
Parents play a fundamental role in shaping their children's dietary behaviors through food choices within the home environment (Patrick & Nicklas, 2005). Consequently, parental influence has been identified as a critical factor contributing to children's eating behaviors and food preferences (DiSantis et al., 2020). Understanding the impact of parental practices related to FV consumption is essential for identifying effective strategies that can be employed by parents at home.
1.2 Research Question
The primary objective of this systematic literature review is to examine existing evidence regarding the impact of parental influence on fruit and vegetable intake among preschool-aged children in the US. Specifically, this study aims to address the following research question:
To what extent do parenting practices related to fruit and vegetable consumption impact preschool-aged children's intake?
By addressing this research question, this review seeks to provide insights into the key determinants of FV intake within the home environment and identify effective strategies that parents can utilize to promote higher consumption among their children.
1.3 Methodology
This systematic review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2020). The inclusion criteria for this study will be limited to empirical research articles published between 2012 and 2022. Research articles utilizing quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-method designs will be considered eligible for inclusion if they explicitly examine parenting practices related to FV consumption among preschool children aged between 2 and 5 years old in the US.
A comprehensive search strategy will be developed using relevant keywords such as "parental influence," "fruit and vegetable intake," "preschool children," and "United States." The search will be conducted across major electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Furthermore, a manual search of reference lists from relevant articles will be performed to identify any additional studies that may have been missed in the initial database search.
Study selection will involve a two-step process: screening titles/abstracts followed by full-text assessment. To ensure methodological rigor throughout this review process, two independent researchers will independently assess each article against predefined inclusion criteria. Any discrepancies in study selection decisions between reviewers will be resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer if necessary.
1.4 Expected Outcomes
This comprehensive literature review expects to identify studies examining various aspects of parental influence on preschool-aged children's fruit and vegetable intake within the home environment. Findings from these studies are anticipated to shed light on specific parenting practices that significantly impact FV intake among young children.
The outcomes of this review can contribute towards developing evidence-based interventions targeting parental practices associated with increased fruit and vegetable consumption at home. This knowledge can inform the design of intervention programs aimed at promoting healthy dietary behaviors and preventing future chronic disease burden among preschool children in the US.
1.5 Conclusion
This systematic review aims to bridge the existing gap in the literature by focusing on parental influence on fruit and vegetable intake among preschool-aged children. By examining the impact of parenting practices, this study will provide valuable insights into effective strategies that can be employed by parents to enhance their children's FV consumption within the home environment.
Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing comprehensive interventions that encompass both childcare or preschool settings, as well as parental practices at home, to significantly improve overall fruit and vegetable intake in young children. The findings from this review will contribute towards evidence-based recommendations for parents, healthcare professionals, and policymakers seeking to promote optimal nutrition during early childhood. 
Introduction:
Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a widely performed surgical procedure for the treatment of degenerative cervical disc diseases. The goal of ACDF is to decompress neural elements and achieve stability at the affected spinal segment. Traditionally, cage-plate constructs (CPC) have been used as the gold standard for achieving immediate postoperative stability in monosegmental ACDF. However, recent advances in surgical technology have led to the introduction of self-locking stand-alone cages (SSC), which eliminate the need for plate fixation.
The use of SSC in monosegmental ACDF offers several potential advantages over traditional CPC. Firstly, SSC can reduce operative time and intraoperative blood loss due to their simplified design that eliminates the need for plate placement and screw insertion. This may also result in decreased duration of hospitalization, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes. Moreover, SSC has shown promising results regarding postoperative outcomes, such as decreased dysphagia rates and reduced incidence of adjacent segment degeneration (ASD). These benefits make SSC an attractive alternative to CPC in monosegmental ACDF.
However, despite their increasing popularity, there remains a lack of consensus on the long-term effectiveness and clinical outcomes associated with both SSC and CPC in monosegmental ACDF. While some studies have reported favorable outcomes with SSC compared to CPC, others suggest comparable results between these two techniques.
Therefore, it is essential to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the long-term effectiveness of SSC versus CPC in monosegmental ACDF patients with a minimum 2-year follow-up period. Such an analysis would provide valuable insights into whether one technique is superior or if they exhibit similar efficacy.
The aim of this study was to compare key clinical parameters between SSC and CPC techniques based on available evidence from published studies. Specifically, we sought to evaluate operative time reduction, intraoperative blood loss reduction, duration of hospitalization, cervical alignment (Cobb angle), postoperative dysphagia rates, incidence of adjacent segment degeneration, fusion rates, and cage subsidence rates.
Understanding the comparative efficacy and outcomes of these two techniques is crucial for surgeons in making informed decisions regarding the choice of implant for monosegmental ACDF. This knowledge can help enhance surgical planning and improve patient outcomes in the long-term.
By conducting a comprehensive analysis of existing literature on SSC versus CPC techniques in monosegmental ACDF patients, this study aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for selecting the most appropriate fixation method. Understanding the advantages and limitations associated with each technique can ultimately contribute to optimizing surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction.
In conclusion, while SSC has emerged as a promising alternative to CPC in monosegmental ACDF procedures, there is a need for a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess their long-term effectiveness. This study fills that gap by comparing key clinical parameters between SSC and CPC techniques based on available evidence from published studies. The findings will contribute to evidence-based decision-making regarding fixation methods used in monosegmental ACDF surgeries. Methods:
A comprehensive search strategy was implemented to identify relevant studies for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Four electronic databases, namely PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, were searched for articles published up to December 2022. The following keywords and their variations were used in the search: "anterior cervical discectomy and fusion," "self-locking stand-alone cages," "cage-plate constructs," "monosegmental ACDF." In addition to database searches, reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles were manually screened to identify any potentially eligible studies that may have been missed.
Study selection followed a two-step process. Firstly, titles and abstracts of identified articles were screened independently by two reviewers based on predefined inclusion criteria. Articles that did not meet the eligibility criteria or were clearly irrelevant were excluded at this stage. Secondly, full-text screening was conducted for the remaining articles that passed the initial screening phase. Any discrepancies or disagreements during study selection were resolved through discussion between reviewers until a consensus was reached.
To be included in the final analysis, studies had to meet the following criteria: (1) comparative study comparing SSC versus CPC in monosegmental ACDF; (2) reporting on at least one outcome measure of interest; (3) minimum follow-up duration of 2 years; and (4) publication in English language.
Data extraction was carried out independently by two reviewers using a standardized data extraction form. The extracted data included study characteristics (e.g., author names, year of publication), patient demographics (e.g., sample size, age), surgical details (e.g., operative time), clinical outcomes (e.g., dysphagia rates), radiological outcomes (e.g., cervical alignment), complications (e.g., cage subsidence), and follow-up duration.
The risk of bias assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for non-randomized studies and the Cochrane Collaboration tool for randomized controlled trials. This allowed for the evaluation of study quality and potential sources of bias in the included studies.
Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata MP 17.0 software package. Pooled effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare outcomes between SSC and CPC techniques using appropriate statistical methods based on the nature of the data (e.g., mean difference, odds ratio). Heterogeneity among included studies was assessed using I^2 statistics, with values greater than 50% indicating substantial heterogeneity. When significant heterogeneity was observed, a random-effects model was used; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was employed.
This systematic review and meta-analysis adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to ensure transparency, rigor, and reproducibility in reporting results.
Conclusion:
Thus far, limited evidence exists comparing long-term effectiveness between SSC and CPC techniques in monosegmental ACDF procedures. By conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of available literature on this topic, this study aims to provide valuable insights into their comparative efficacy regarding various clinical parameters such as operative time reduction, intraoperative blood loss reduction, duration of hospitalization, cervical alignment outcomes (Cobb angle), postoperative dysphagia rates, incidence of adjacent segment degeneration rates at long-term follow-up assessments.
The findings from this study will assist surgeons in making evidence-based decisions when selecting implant options for monosegmental ACDF procedures. It is expected that these results will enhance our understanding of which technique is more advantageous overall with regard to surgical efficiency as well as clinical outcomes including patient-reported measures like pain scores or disability indexes post-surgery.
Overall, this study aims to contribute significantly by providing comprehensive analysis comparing SSC versus CPC techniques based on available evidence from published studies which would ultimately aid healthcare professionals involved in decision-making processes for optimal treatment and management of patients undergoing monosegmental ACDF. 
Title: Exploring the Impact of Novel Intervention Strategies on Patient-led Non-adherence and Non-persistence to Intravitreal Anti-vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (anti-VEGF) therapy for Macular Diseases: A Systematic Review
Abstract: Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections have revolutionized the treatment landscape for various macular diseases. However, patient-led non-adherence and non-persistence to these therapeutic regimens remain significant challenges. Understanding the factors that contribute to patient behavior in clinical settings is crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes. This systematic review aims to explore the impact of novel intervention strategies on patient-led non-adherence and non-persistence rates in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.
1. Introduction
Macular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and myopic choroidal neovascularization, are leading causes of visual impairment worldwide (1). Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections have emerged as a breakthrough treatment paradigm for these conditions by effectively targeting neovascularization processes and preserving or improving vision in affected individuals (2).
Despite their demonstrated efficacy, long-term success with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is contingent upon patients' adherence and persistence to prescribed treatment regimens. Adherence refers to the extent to which patients follow their medication intake as per agreed recommendations from healthcare providers, while persistence denotes continued treatment over the prescribed duration (3). Previous studies have reported rates of patient-led non-adherence ranging from 17.5% to 35%, emphasizing both clinical significance and potential room for improvement in real-world practice (4).
Non-adherence/non-persistence can lead to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes due to undertreatment or interrupted treatment patterns, limiting opportunities for disease control or stabilization within a meaningful timeframe (5). Moreover, increased disease activity resulting from discontinuous exposure may necessitate more frequent or intensive intervention, thereby raising concerns regarding treatment burden, potential safety risks, and healthcare resource allocation.
This systematic review aims to explore the prevalence of patient-led non-adherence and non-persistence in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for macular diseases. Furthermore it seeks to identify factors influencing non-adherence/non-persistence behaviors and assess the potential impact of novel intervention strategies in promoting treatment compliance. By summarizing existing evidence on this topic, we aim to contribute essential information that can inform personalized care strategies tailored to improve real-world visual outcomes for patients undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.
2. Methods
We will conduct a comprehensive systematic search in electronic databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library up until February 2023. This search will include studies written in English that report rates of patient-led non-adherence or non-persistence to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for macular diseases. We will also explore barriers or reasons contributing to patient behavior using the predefined inclusion criteria.
Two independent authors will screen studies based on title and abstracts followed by a full-text assessment using eligibility criteria specified a priori. Any discrepancies between reviewers will be resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer when necessary.
Data extracted from included studies will be synthesized using descriptive statistics reporting rates of patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence along with associated factors contributing to these behaviors. Additionally, interventional approaches aimed at improving adherence/persistence rates will be summarized.
3. Discussion
This systematic review intends to shed light on the prevalence and determinants of patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for macular diseases while also exploring innovative interventions targeting improved treatment compliance. By providing an overview of existing evidence on this subject matter, our findings have the potential to guide healthcare professionals toward personalized care strategies that ultimately enhance real-world visual outcomes in patients undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.
Ethics approval is not mandatory for this systematic review as it will solely involve analysis of pre-existing, de-identified data from published studies. The protocol for this study has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020216205).
4. Conclusion
Non-adherence and non-persistence to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy pose significant challenges in achieving optimal treatment outcomes for macular diseases. This systematic review aims to contribute essential knowledge regarding the prevalence and factors influencing patient behavior, as well as novel intervention strategies targeting improved adherence and persistence rates. Through this exploration, we intend to identify at-risk individuals while facilitating the development of tailored interventions that can enhance real-world visual outcomes in patients undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.
Limitations related to potential heterogeneity among included studies, diverse definitions of adherence/persistence, and regional variations within the population under investigation will be acknowledged and discussed within the narrative synthesis of our findings. 
Title: Targeting Neuroinflammation to Enhance Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability for Intracranial Drug Delivery in Alzheimer's Disease
Abstract:
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a pivotal role in maintaining the delicate homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). Dysregulation of BBB integrity has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, AD is characterized by toxic accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, leading to cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation. Mounting evidence suggests that neuroinflammation contributes to BBB dysfunction, thereby hampering intracranial drug delivery and diminishing therapeutic efficacy.
Current treatment strategies for AD are limited by the poor permeability of therapeutic agents across the intact BBB. While systemic administration allows drugs to reach peripheral targets efficiently, their penetration into the CNS is hindered by the selective permeability properties of brain capillaries. Unfortunately, this limitation not only restricts drug access but also poses potential risk for systemic toxicity.
To circumvent these challenges, emerging research has sought to modulate BBB integrity as a means to enhance drug delivery specifically within the CNS. Understanding the complex mechanisms governing pathological fenestration of BBB during AD progression holds significant promise for effective therapeutics targeting disease-related pathways involved in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
This comprehensive review aims to provide an overview of key structural components and functions underlying normal BBB physiology. Furthermore, it aims to explore how chronic inflammation mediates catastrophic changes leading to pathological disruption of BBB integrity during AD progression. Additionally, we delve into potential strategies aiming at enhancing transport across a compromised BBB using medicinal drugs with proven efficacy against AD-related processes.
1. Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents one of the most prevalent age-associated neurodegenerative disorders characterized primarily by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. The global prevalence of AD is expected to rise exponentially, thereby necessitating the urgent development of effective therapeutic strategies. Unfortunately, due to the multifactorial nature of AD pathogenesis and the distinct challenges posed by the unique microenvironment within the CNS, successful drug delivery remains a significant hurdle.
The neuroinflammatory response observed in AD has been proposed as a critical contributor to disease progression and BBB dysfunction. Microglia and astrocytes play fundamental roles in initiating and perpetuating this inflammatory cascade through release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The resultant neuroinflammation disrupts BBB integrity by promoting endothelial cell activation and tight junction damage, leading to increased permeability.
Addressing BBB dysfunction presents an attractive avenue for optimizing intracranial drug delivery against neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, understanding the intricate interplay between neuroinflammation and BBB regulation is paramount for developing novel therapeutic approaches targeting underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This review provides an insightful analysis of BBB structure-function relationships in normal physiological states, elucidates key events contributing to pathological changes during AD progression with a focus on neuroinflammation-associated alterations at the cellular level, highlights recent advancements in pharmaceutical interventions aimed at modulating dysfunctional BBB permeability towards effective therapies targeting CNS disorders such as AD.
In summary, unraveling mechanisms regulating pathological blood-brain barrier breakdown has garnered much attention recently due to its potential impact on delivering therapeutic agents efficiently across an otherwise impermeable CNS interface. Our review contributes by compiling current knowledge regarding structural components underlying normal brain capillary endothelium functionality while concurrently unraveling how chronic inflammation prompts aberrant molecular processes ultimately leading towards Alzheimer's disease pathology which poses unique challenges for pharmacological intervention strategies targeting this disorder specifically within cerebrovascular compartment enhancing translational prospects moving forward. 
Title: Exploring the Role of Iron-Related Genes and Proteins in Modulating Mesenchymal Stem Cell Differentiation and Fate Decisions
1. Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for regenerative medicine due to their unique ability to differentiate into various cell types, exhibit immunomodulatory properties, and secrete trophic factors that promote tissue repair and regeneration (1). However, the clinical translation of MSC-based therapies has been challenging due to limitations in pre-administration MSC labeling techniques, post-administration detection methods, and the need to enhance their therapeutic potential in vivo.
To address these challenges, recent studies have unveiled an intriguing intersection between iron metabolism pathways and MSC biology. Iron-related genes and proteins have been shown to play crucial roles in regulating MSC differentiation, survival, migration, immune modulation capacity, and response to oxidative stress. These insights hold significant potential for improving our understanding of MSC behavior within the body and devising innovative strategies for enhancing their therapeutic efficacy.
Iron metabolism is a tightly regulated process that is essential for numerous cellular functions such as DNA synthesis, oxygen transport via hemoglobin synthesis, electron transfer reactions within mitochondria enzymes involved in energy production (2). Disruptions in iron homeostasis can lead to various pathological conditions including iron overload disorders or anemia.
In recent years it has become evident that iron metabolism pathways are closely linked with stem cell maintenance and differentiation processes (3). Studies investigating the role of iron-related genes such as ferritin (FT), transferrin receptor-1 (TfR-1), MagA -which mediates magnetic resonance imaging contrast upon uptake by cells-, haem oxygenase-1(HO-1), lipocalin 2(LCN2), lactoferrin(LF), bone morphogenetic protein 2(BMP-2)and hepcidin(HP)-have demonstrated their involvement in MSC pluripotency, lineage commitment, and immune responses (4)(5).
Moreover, it has been shown that genetic manipulation or overexpression of iron-related proteins could improve MSC-based therapies. For instance, transfection of MSCs with reporter genes such as the iron-binding protein ferritin or transferrin receptor-1 allows for real-time monitoring and tracking of transplanted cells via non-invasive imaging techniques such as MRI (6). This approach offers significant advantages over conventional cell labeling strategies by minimizing potential adverse effects associated with exogenous contrast agents.
Furthermore, modulation of iron metabolism using the iron chelator deferoxamine has been found to enhance the therapeutic potential of MSCs (7). Deferoxamine not only promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis under oxidative stress conditions but also regulates various signaling pathways involved in tissue regeneration and repair.
In light of these promising findings, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding regarding the contribution of iron-related genes and proteins in modulating MSC differentiation choices and fate decisions. By integrating knowledge from diverse fields such as stem cell biology, immunology, and iron metabolism, we seek to shed light on the mechanisms underlying these interactions.
Understanding how iron homeostasis impacts MSC behavior may allow us to design more effective strategies for optimizing the ex vivo expansion protocols for specific lineage differentiation. Additionally exploring how targeted control over particular components within this network influences tissue repair processes could lead to novel therapeutic interventions.
As regenerative medicine continues to harness the regenerative potency of stem cells for treating various diseases and injuries across different organs/tissues systems; it is essential that we explore every avenue towards maximizing their full therapeutic potential. By providing key insights into the fascinating interplay between iron-related signaling networks and mesenchymal stem cells biology; this review aims at bridging existing knowledge gaps while inspiring future research directions aimed at improving clinical outcomes using MSC-based therapies. 
Introduction
Musculoskeletal disorders, such as chronic neck pain (CNP), are common health issues that significantly impact individuals' quality of life. CNP is a prevalent condition affecting people of all ages and occupations, leading to substantial disability and economic burden (Hurwitz et al., 2008). The etiology of CNP can be multifactorial, involving a combination of mechanical, psychosocial, and physiological factors (Bierma-Zeinstra et al., 2006).
Current treatment approaches for CNP encompass various interventions targeting the soft tissues surrounding the neck region. Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) and myofascial release therapy (MRT) are two popular techniques utilized by healthcare professionals to address the musculoskeletal impairments associated with CNP.
IASTM involves the use of specialized instruments specifically designed to apply controlled manual pressure to affected soft tissues in order to decrease pain, promote tissue flexibility and mobility, reduce muscle hypertonicity or trigger points, and improve overall function (Adler et al., 2013). On the other hand, MRT focuses on manually applying sustained pressure on specific areas known as myofascial trigger points. This technique aims to alleviate muscle tightness or hypersensitivity and enhance blood flow to facilitate tissue healing (Moraska et al., 2017).
Despite their widespread use in clinical practice for treating CNP patients effectively, there is limited scientific evidence directly comparing these two interventions head-to-head. While previous studies have evaluated IASTM or MRT independently in managing musculoskeletal conditions like shoulder impingement syndrome or low back pain with varying results [references], no research has compared the efficacy of IASTM versus MRT specifically for individuals suffering from chronic mechanical neck pain (CMNP).
Therefore, this study aims to contribute new knowledge regarding the effectiveness of IASTM versus MRT when it comes explicitly addressing bilateral upper trapezius and levator scapulae muscles-related CMNP among college students. The target population in this study, which consists of college students conducting distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is particularly relevant as prolonged periods of sedentary behavior and increased screen time may exacerbate CNP symptoms among this group.
By conducting a randomized clinical trial with appropriate sample size and rigorous outcome measures, we hope to provide scientific evidence that can guide healthcare practitioners in choosing the most effective treatment approach for CNP patients. Furthermore, considering that neither intervention typically involves adverse effects beyond mild soreness or temporary discomfort during treatment sessions (Mueller et al., 2020), it is imperative to clarify any differences in outcomes between IASTM and MRT.
The objectives of this study include comparing pain levels reported by participants using a visual analog scale (VAS), assessing functional improvements utilizing the neck disability index (NDI), and quantifying pain pressure threshold (PPT) measurements via a pressure algometer. Additionally, exploratory analyses may consider potential moderating factors such as age, gender, duration of CMNP symptoms onset to enrollment, or baseline range of motion limitations.
In conclusion, despite the increasing popularity of IASTM and MRT for managing CNP patients in clinical practice; there is currently limited evidence comparing their effectiveness for individuals specifically suffering from CMNP. This research aims to bridge this gap by conducting a methodologically robust randomized clinical trial comparing these two interventions' outcomes on college students experiencing chronic mechanical neck pain resulting from distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will help inform clinicians about selecting an optimal therapeutic modality while providing insights into potential moderators impacting treatment efficacy within this specific patient population.

Title: Predictors of Doxycycline Acceptability and Adherence among Kenyan Women Using HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for the Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infections
Abstract:
The global incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been on the rise over the past decade, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where young women face a disproportionately high burden of both curable STIs and HIV. To address this urgent public health concern, recent research has explored the potential use of doxycycline as a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent STIs. However, existing clinical trials on doxycycline PEP have primarily focused on men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income settings. It is crucial to expand this research to include women within diverse populations.
This study aims to investigate predictors of acceptability and adherence to doxycycline PEP among Kenyan women who are concurrently using oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for STI prevention. By examining baseline characteristics, including sociodemographic factors, sexual behaviors, risk perception, stigma associated with STIs, awareness about PrEP and doxycycline PEP, accessing healthcare services related to sexual health concerns, and perceived barriers and facilitators affecting PrEP adherence among female PrEP users in Kenya.
2. Introduction
High rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including Neisseria gonorrhoeae(n.g.), Chlamydia trachomatis(c.t.),and Treponema pallidum(t.p.), pose significant challenges to global public health systems in terms of disease burden and economic costs [1]. Sub-Saharan Africa is severely affected by the dual epidemics of HIV/AIDS and STIs [2]. Notably, young cisgender women residing in this region demonstrate disproportionately high rates of both curable STIs and HIV infections, making them a key population for targeted interventions.
To curb the increasing rates of STIs, novel prevention strategies are urgently needed. Recent studies have shown promising results in the use of doxycycline as a PEP agent to prevent bacterial STI acquisition [3,4]. Although existing clinical trials have primarily focused on men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income countries [5], it is imperative to explore the potential impact of doxycycline PEP among women in sub-Saharan Africa.
The current study seeks to investigate predictors of acceptability and adherence to doxycycline PEP among Kenyan women using oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for STI prevention. This research aims to address critical knowledge gaps by examining various sociodemographic factors, sexual behaviors, risk perceptions regarding acquiring STIs, stigma related to STIs and PrEP utilization, awareness about PrEP and doxycycline PEP, barriers and facilitators affecting access to healthcare services pertaining to sexual health concerns such as obtaining regular screening for STIs and timely initiation of treatment.
Understanding the predictors influencing the acceptability and adherence patterns towards doxycycline PEP among Kenyan women using HIV PrEP can inform tailored interventions that effectively target this at-risk population. By identifying determinants associated with successful engagement with both PrEP regimens (HIV PrEP and doxycycline as a novel preventive strategy), researchers can design evidence-based intervention programs that promote optimal uptake, adherence rates above 80%, consistent condom usage promotion strategies during sexual encounters with divergent partners especially under circumstances involving transactional sex practices that might compromise health outcomes otherwise.
Furthermore, this study will examine contextual factors surrounding access to healthcare facilities providing comprehensive sexual health services such as counseling on safer sex practices including condom negotiation skills training sessions adapted from evidence-based behavioral interventions proven efficacious in previous research with young women in sub-Saharan Africa [6,7].Such insights will inform the development of targeted interventions tailored to address the specific needs and challenges faced by Kenyan women in accessing and adhering to doxycycline PEP within the context of HIV PrEP use.
In conclusion, this study seeks to provide valuable insights into predictors of acceptability and adherence among Kenyan women using doxycycline PEP as an additional prevention strategy while also taking oral HIV PrEP. By elucidating key factors that influence uptake and adherence, this research can shape effective strategies aimed at reducing STI transmission rates among vulnerable populations, specifically cisgender women in sub-Saharan Africa. Such efforts are crucial for achieving sustainable public health goals related to sexual health within global communities. 
1. Introduction
The field of citizen science has gained significant momentum in recent years as a valuable approach to monitoring biodiversity for the purpose of conservation. By engaging the public in data acquisition and analysis, citizen science projects enable large-scale data collection that would otherwise be unattainable by researchers alone. Online training tools have emerged as an effective means of enhancing participants' skills and knowledge in species identification, thus improving the quality of acquired data. However, there is a need for further investigation to evaluate the effectiveness of specific online training approaches, such as quiz-style formats, particularly within the context of bird identification for citizen science biodiversity monitoring projects.
Species identification forms a crucial aspect of any biodiversity monitoring initiative. It enables researchers and conservationists to accurately classify and record observed species, identifying population trends and assessing changes in local ecosystems over time. Birdsong identification represents one area where accurate species recognition is challenging due to the vast diversity and intricacy of avian vocalizations. Consequently, developing effective training tools that facilitate birdsong identification skills could greatly enhance citizen scientists' contributions to bird-focused biodiversity monitoring projects.
In this study, we aim to address gaps in existing research pertaining to quiz-style online training tools used for learning birdsong identification within the realm of citizen science initiatives focused on biodiversity monitoring. We propose an investigation into the effectiveness of a newly developed tool called TORI-TORE (Trained Observation Reveals Individuality – Teaching Ornithological Recognition Effortlessly). TORI-TORE is designed with memory mechanisms informed by adaptive learning theories in order to improve participants' abilities in identifying birdsongs while simultaneously fostering interest in avian species and their natural environments.
To evaluate TORI-TORE's potential impact on bird identification skills and participant attitudes towards birds during engagements with citizen science programs focused on bird-focused biodiversity monitoring efforts, we conducted a randomized control trial involving participants from Fukushima Prefecture located in Japan—an area known for its rich avifaunal diversity. By employing a combination of test scores and questionnaires, we assessed both the direct impact of TORI-TORE on bird identification proficiency and the subsequent effect on individuals' attitudes towards birds.
This study also seeks to explore variables that may influence the effectiveness of quiz-style online training tools, such as adaptive training methodologies aimed at personalized learning experiences. By examining whether focusing preferentially on unmastered bird species—derived from individual trainee answer histories inspired by adaptive learning—leads to positive or negative outcomes for participants' test scores and satisfaction with TORI-TORE, we can refine our understanding of effective strategies for enhancing birdsong identification skills through online training platforms.
Additionally, we aim to investigate how factors such as the selection of species that are relatively easy to remember, optimal lag times between training sessions and testing phases, as well as appropriate intervals between questions can positively impact participant performance in quiz-style online learning environments focused on birdsong identification. By identifying these variables that contribute to improved trainee outcomes, we can optimize future iterations of TORI-TORE in order to enhance its effectiveness as an educational tool within citizen science programs dedicated to bird-focused biodiversity monitoring.
In conclusion, this research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a quiz-style online training tool called TORI-TORE for enhancing birdsong identification skills in citizen science participants engaged in biodiversity monitoring projects. The study seeks to contribute valuable insights into strategies for improving species recognition abilities within avian-specific contexts while fostering interest in natural environments. The findings generated by this study will support ongoing efforts aimed at capacity building within citizen science initiatives globally and promote greater engagement with nature conservation efforts among citizens at large. 
Introduction
Neurodegenerative diseases are a diverse group of disorders characterized by the progressive degeneration and loss of neurons in the central nervous system. Among these disorders, proteinopathies play a significant role in disease progression, wherein mutations or modifications in specific genes lead to alterations in protein structure and subsequent formation of toxic aggregates within neurons. These protein aggregates have been implicated as key contributors to cellular dysfunction and neuronal death, ultimately resulting in neurodegeneration.
Autophagy is an essential cellular process that acts as a quality control mechanism by degrading misfolded or aggregated proteins, thereby maintaining proper protein homeostasis. It functions alongside the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to eliminate protein aggregates and maintain cellular health. Dysregulation of autophagy has been strongly associated with the development and progression of various neurodegenerative diseases induced by protein misfolding and accumulation.
Significant advancements have been made towards understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy's role in neurodegenerative diseases using various experimental models. One such model that has contributed significantly to this understanding is Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). Despite the physiological and morphological differences between flies and humans, there exists a remarkable conservation of molecular pathways regulating protein homeostasis across species.
This review aims to provide an overview of common neurodegenerative proteinopathies: PolyQ diseases including Huntington's disease, Spinocerebellar ataxia 1, 2, and 3; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) with mutations in C9orf72, SOD1, TDP-43 or FUS; Alzheimer's disease involving amyloid precursor protein (APP) or Tau pathology; Parkinson's disease associated with alpha-synuclein (a-syn), parkin/PINK1 pathway or LRRK2 mutations; as well as prion diseases. These disorders represent a substantial burden on global healthcare due to their prevalence and devastating impact on affected individuals and their families.
By focusing on studies conducted using Drosophila models, we will highlight the invaluable insights gained into the conserved molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy's involvement in these neurodegenerative diseases. Drosophila has emerged as a robust experimental model, offering numerous advantages such as a short lifespan, genetic tractability, and the ability to perform sophisticated genetic manipulations. These attributes have allowed for the identification of conserved autophagic pathways and novel genetic modifiers that regulate protein aggregation clearance within neurons.
Understanding how autophagy is regulated in various proteinopathies is critical for developing targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring or enhancing its activity. Given that autophagy dysregulation occurs early in disease pathogenesis, influencing this process might have significant implications for disease modification and slow down disease progression.
In conclusion, this review aims to consolidate current knowledge regarding the role of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases induced by proteinopathies. By summarizing studies conducted using Drosophila models alongside human-based research findings, we will shed light on conserved mechanisms regulating autophagy's function. Enhanced understanding of these processes may pave the way towards developing novel therapeutic strategies to combat these devastating disorders that lack effective treatment options currently available. The identification and characterization of autophagy's role in neurodegenerative diseases is of paramount importance to advance our understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This knowledge not only enhances our knowledge of disease etiology but also offers potential avenues for therapeutic interventions. As such, a comprehensive overview of the current literature, especially studies utilizing Drosophila models, is crucial to elucidating the conserved mechanisms regulating autophagy in proteinopathies.
Advances in genetic and molecular techniques have facilitated remarkable progress in our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and their association with protein misfolding and aggregation. Proteinopathies encompass a wide range of disorders, including PolyQ diseases such as Huntington's disease and Spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, and 3; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) characterized by mutations in C9orf72, SOD1, TDP-43 or FUS; Alzheimer's disease featuring amyloid precursor protein (APP) or Tau pathology; Parkinson's disease linked to alpha-synuclein (a-syn), parkin/PINK1 pathway dysregulation or LRRK2 mutations; as well as prion diseases.
While these disorders manifest differently clinically, they share a common feature: aberrant protein homeostasis leading to the accumulation of toxic aggregates within neurons. In this regard, both the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy have emerged as crucial players responsible for maintaining cellular proteostasis. Mutations affecting either pathway can disrupt proper clearance mechanisms for damaged proteins or aggregates associated with neurodegenerative pathologies.
Drosophila melanogaster has proven instrumental in advancing our understanding of these complex processes due to its unique experimental advantages. Despite evolutionary divergence from vertebrates like humans, fruit flies possess striking similarities regarding essential cellular pathways involved in protein degradation and aggregate clearance systems—including autophagy—in both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues. This conservation makes Drosophila an ideal model organism to study neurodegenerative diseases and explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting autophagy.
Over the past decade, studies utilizing Drosophila models have made remarkable contributions to our knowledge of neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These investigations have helped uncover critical molecular and cellular events underlying autophagy's involvement in disease pathogenesis. The fly model offers a high degree of genetic tractability, enabling researchers to manipulate specific genes or pathways associated with protein homeostasis regulation.
By employing various genetic tools, it has been possible to selectively induce or suppress expression of key components within the autophagy-lysosome system, shedding light on their impact on protein aggregates clearance, neuronal function, and overall disease progression. Furthermore, researchers have successfully utilized Drosophila models to identify novel genetic modifiers and signaling pathways that regulate proteostasis in neurodegeneration.
Throughout this review article, we will systematically summarize findings from studies using fruit flies that investigate the conserved mechanisms regulating autophagy in diverse neurodegenerative diseases induced by proteinopathies. Specifically focusing on PolyQ diseases, ALS subtypes triggered by different mutations or misfolded proteins accumulation such as C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion or TDP-43 pathology; Alzheimer's disease featuring amyloid-beta plaques (Aβ) or Tau tangles; Parkinson's disease characterized by abnormal alpha-synuclein aggregation frequently observed in Lewy bodies; as well as prion diseases with aberrant PrPsc conformational changes leading to neuronal toxicity.
By gathering insights gained through Drosophila research into these human disorders' pathophysiology linked closely with aberrant aggregate formation and clearance mechanisms via autophagy pathway dysregulation—we aim for a comprehensive account of conserved molecular processes involved in these devastating conditions. Such knowledge may pave the way for targeted therapeutic strategies, potentially modulating autophagy to restore protein homeostasis and slow down neurodegeneration progression.
In conclusion, this introduction highlights the critical role of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases induced by proteinopathies. By emphasizing studies utilizing Drosophila models alongside human-based research findings, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of conserved mechanisms regulating autophagy in these disorders. Understanding these fundamental processes holds immense promise for developing effective interventions that can alleviate suffering and improve patient outcomes in neurodegenerative diseases lacking curative treatments currently available. 
Introduction:
The Olig gene family, consisting of Olig1, Olig2, and Olig3, encodes members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. These factors are essential for cellular specification and differentiation in both the developing and mature central nervous system (CNS). Over the past decade, extensive research has elucidated the vital roles played by Olig1 and Olig2 in CNS development as well as their implications in brain cancer.
Brain cancer is a devastating disease that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Gliomas are among the most common types of brain tumors, deriving from glial cells within the CNS. The heterogeneity and aggressive nature of gliomas pose significant challenges for effective treatment strategies. Current therapies including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have limited success due to tumor recurrence and therapeutic resistance.
There is growing evidence suggesting that dysregulation of transcription factors plays a critical role in glioma progression. The abnormal expression or function of these transcription factors can disrupt cellular differentiation processes underlying glioma development. Among these transcription factors, increasing attention has been focused on members of the Olig gene family - particularly Olig2.
Recent studies have demonstrated that aberrant overexpression of Olig2 contributes to glioma growth promotion and therapeutic resistance. High levels of Olig2 correlate with unfavorable clinical outcomes such as rapid tumor progression and poor patient survival rates. Furthermore, experimental models using genetic manipulation techniques have shown that inhibition or depletion of Oligt genes can suppress tumor cell proliferation while enhancing sensitivity to radiation therapy or chemotherapy.
The precise molecular mechanisms by which aberrantly expressed Olgi genes contribute to gliomagenesis remain incompletely understood; however, several key pathways have been implicated in mediating their effects on tumor growth: Notch signaling pathway activation; regulation neuronal differentiation through direct repression targeting proneuronal genes; cross-talk with other oncogenic pathways like EGFR signaling leading to cell invasion and migration; and modulation of stem cell properties in glioma-initiating cells. These findings highlight the intricate involvement of the Olig family in multiple cellular processes related to cancer progression.
Based on these intriguing observations, it is evident that targeting members of the Olig gene family may hold therapeutic promise for brain cancer treatment. Developing novel strategies aimed at disrupting Olig2 function or expression could potentially inhibit glioma growth and sensitize tumor cells to conventional therapies, thereby improving patient outcomes.
In this comprehensive review, we aim to summarize the biological functions of the Olig gene family, with a particular emphasis on Olig2, in brain cancer. We will explore their roles in cellular specification and differentiation within normal CNS development as well as their implicated contributions to glioma progression. Additionally, we will discuss potential therapeutic approaches targeting the Olig gene family that have shown promise in preclinical studies or early clinical trials.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which aberrantly expressed Olgi genes contribute to gliomagenesis will pave the way for developing novel targeted therapies specifically tailored towards disrupting their oncogenic effects. Ultimately, such therapeutic interventions may revolutionize current treatment paradigms for brain cancer patients and improve overall survival rates.
 As the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer continues to evolve, there is a growing appreciation for the intricate interplay between transcription factors and tumorigenesis. Transcription factors are critical regulators of gene expression, controlling key cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of these factors can disrupt normal cellular homeostasis and contribute to tumor initiation and progression.
The Olig gene family has emerged as an important group of transcription factors implicated in both normal central nervous system (CNS) development and brain cancer. The family consists of three members - Olig1, Olig2, and Olig3 - which belong to the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) family. They are known to play crucial roles in cellular specification and differentiation within the CNS.
In the context of brain cancer, increasing attention has been directed towards understanding the functions of Olig genes, particularly Olig2. Gliomas represent a significant subset within brain tumors that exhibit high heterogeneity and aggressive behavior. Therefore, identifying key molecular players contributing to gliomagenesis is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies.
Studies have revealed that aberrant expression or activity levels of Olig2 have profound implications in glioma progression. Additionally, its overexpression has been associated with increased resistance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy in gliomas patients. Understanding how dysregulated Olig genes contribute mechanistically towards these aggressive tumor phenotypes will provide invaluable insights towards developing effective therapeutic interventions.
This review aims to comprehensively summarize our current knowledge about the biological functions of the entire Olig gene family within CNS development as well as their specific implications in brain cancer pathogenesis with an emphasis on gliomas. By dissecting their roles at various stages during CNS development from neural stem cell specification through lineage commitment into mature glial cell populations like astrocytes or oligodendrocytes alongside their maintenance; we aim also explore potential signaling pathways in which they participate. Additionally, through examining the specific contributions of Olig2 in gliomagenesis and therapeutic resistance development, we hope to gain insights into possible therapeutic targets.
Furthermore, we will discuss emerging evidence indicating that targeting the Olig gene family may hold therapeutic promise for brain cancer treatment. Various strategies have been developed to modulate Olig gene function or expression selectively, including small molecule inhibitors, RNA interference-based approaches such as siRNAs or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and novel gene editing techniques like CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout systems. By dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying these interventions and summarizing preclinical studies or early clinical trials investigating their effectiveness in inhibiting tumor growth and sensitizing glioma cells to conventional therapies; it is hoped that this review will provide valuable insights into potential future directions for developing targeted therapies.
In conclusion, understanding the roles of the Olig gene family in normal CNS development as well as their implications in brain cancer pathogenesis is crucial for advancing our knowledge of tumorigenesis. Targeting dysregulated members within this family opens up exciting possibilities for developing novel and effective therapeutic approaches for patients with brain cancer. Through an analysis of existing literature along with recent advancements, this review aims to consolidate current knowledge on the biological functions of Olig genes within CNS development while highlighting their relevance in glioma progression. 
Introduction Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating primary brain tumor characterized by aggressive growth, high recurrence rate, and poor prognosis. Despite advances in surgical resection techniques and the advent of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as the standard of care, patients with GBM still face grim outcomes with limited treatment options (1). Immunotherapies have emerged as promising therapeutic approaches in various cancers, harnessing the power of the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumor cells. However, their successful application in GBM has been met with significant challenges due to specific immunosuppressive factors unique to this malignancy.
The immune system plays a crucial role in recognizing and eliminating cancer cells; however, GBM exhibits remarkable resilience against immune attacks by employing an array of intrinsic and adaptive resistance mechanisms (2). Intrinsic resistance refers to tumors' ability to evade immune recognition through downregulation or mutations in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules or other components involved in antigen presentation. Additionally, altered expression levels or activation status of co-stimulatory molecules on tumor cells can hinder proper T cell activation leading to insufficient anti-tumor responses. Moreover, the intrinsic resistance might involve indirect suppression mechanisms such as recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), or M2-like macrophages that impair effector T cell function while promoting immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment (3).
Adaptive immune resistance further exacerbates GBM's ability to resist immunotherapy through dynamic alterations in its molecular landscape upon exposure to therapeutic interventions (4). For instance, increased expression of checkpoint molecules like programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells can bind with programmed death-1 receptor on T cells leading to functional exhaustion—a state where T cell anti-tumor activity is severely impaired. Furthermore, excessive production of inhibitory cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) by tumor cells or immune cells within the GBM microenvironment contributes to an immunosuppressive milieu that hampers effective immunotherapy (5).
Despite these daunting roadblocks, ongoing research efforts have focused on developing combinatorial immunotherapies targeting multiple immune processes in GBM with encouraging outcomes. Engineered treatments involving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, armed oncolytic viruses, or checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination have demonstrated promising results in preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials. For instance, CAR T cell therapy has shown remarkable efficacy against GBM-specific antigens such as EGFR variant III and IL-13Rα2; similarly, virotherapy through the use of genetically engineered viruses capable of selectively targeting tumor cells while stimulating anti-tumor immunity holds great potential for overcoming resistance mechanisms unique to GBM.
Furthermore, non-engineered treatments focusing on increasing the potency of endogenous immune responses are being explored through vaccination strategies utilizing peptides derived from tumor-specific antigens or dendritic cell-based vaccines. Additionally, strategies aimed at reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by blocking inhibitory checkpoints like CTLA-4 and PD-L1/PD1 interactions have shown promise as standalone therapies or when combined with other treatment modalities.
In this comprehensive review article, we aim to explore the intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance mechanisms specific to GBM that hinder successful immunotherapy interventions. We will summarize the current evidence and outcomes of both engineered and non-engineered treatment approaches targeted at overcoming these resistance factors. Additionally, we will discuss emerging combinational approaches that show promise for tackling these barriers head-on. This review aims to provide valuable insights into novel strategies of targeted GBM immunotherapy combinational treatments with a focus on potential improvements in patient prognosis and enhanced clinical care outcomes.
By understanding the complexity of immunotherapy resistance in GBM and exploring the rational design of combinatorial treatments, we can strive towards more effective strategies that maximize the potential of immunotherapies in this devastating disease. Such advancements will be crucial for enhancing patient outcomes, prolonging survival, and ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals battling against GBM. 
Title: Gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis: Novel Insights into Mechanisms, Therapeutic Opportunities, and Future Directions
Introduction:
Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death that plays a critical role in host defense against pathogens and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Pyroptosis is characterized by the formation of large plasma membrane pores that result in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), attracting immune cells to clear infected cells or damaged tissue. While pyroptosis is essential for immune surveillance, its dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases.
Recent studies have shed light on the multifaceted roles of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in both infectious and non-infectious diseases. This article aims to provide an overview of current knowledge on GSDMD activation, pore formation, associated signaling pathways, disease associations, and highlights potential therapeutic strategies targeting this intricate process.
1.1 Background:
The discovery of gasdermins as key regulators of pyroptotic cell death has revolutionized our understanding of inflammation-associated pathologies. The gasdermin family comprises seven members (GSDMA-G) that contain a highly conserved N-terminal domain known as the "pro-domain," followed by a "pore-forming domain" responsible for cellular membrane permeabilization during pyroptosis. Among them, GSDMD stands out as a crucial mediator due to its dominant role in inducing cell lysis upon cleavage by inflammasome-activated caspases.
1.2 Dysregulated Pyroptosis:
Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulated GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis contributes significantly to the pathogenesis and progression of numerous inflammatory disorders such as sepsis, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), neurodegenerative diseases, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and various malignant tumors. The aberrant activation of GSDMD leads to excessive cytokine release, sustained inflammation, tissue damage, and impaired immune responses.
1.3 Underlying Mechanisms:
Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying GSDMD regulation and pore formation is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic interventions. Recent studies have unraveled intricate signaling networks bridging the activation of inflammasomes, such as NLRP3 and NLRC4, caspase-1 cleavage of GSDMD at specific sites and the subsequent assembly of multimeric GSDMD pores in cellular membranes. Furthermore, genetic mutations or dysregulated expression of inflammasome components can disrupt these processes, resulting in pathological outcomes.
1.4 Therapeutic Potential:
Given the central role played by aberrant pyroptosis in diverse diseases, strategies targeting GSDMD-mediated cell death hold significant therapeutic potential. Advancements in our understanding of pyroptotic signaling pathways have paved the way for developing novel small-molecule inhibitors that selectively target either inflammasomes or downstream mediators involved in GSDMD activation. Inhibition of specific nodes along these pathways may restore immunological balance while minimizing collateral damage associated with broad immunosuppression.
1.5 Research Objectives:
This comprehensive review aims to provide an up-to-date synthesis on recent insights into the mechanisms regulating GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and its involvement across a spectrum of diseases encompassing both infectious and non-infectious origins. Emphasizing recent advances in structural studies identifying key protein interactions within caspase-GS This comprehensive review aims to provide an up-to-date synthesis on recent insights into the mechanisms regulating GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and its involvement across a spectrum of diseases encompassing both infectious and non-infectious origins. Emphasizing recent advances in structural studies identifying key protein interactions within caspase-GSDMD complexes, we will explore the molecular basis underlying GSDMD activation, oligomerization, and pore formation. Additionally, this article will delve into the various signaling pathways involved in GSDMD-mediated inflammatory cascades and their implications for disease pathogenesis.
Investigations into the association between abnormal GSDMD activation and disease states have unveiled intriguing links with diverse inflammatory disorders. The dysregulation of pyroptotic cell death has been implicated in sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by uncontrolled systemic inflammation in response to infection. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that excessive pyroptosis is a critical determinant of tissue damage observed during neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shed new light on the importance of understanding GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in viral infections. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers an exaggerated inflammatory response driven by aberrant pyroptotic cell death. Moreover, investigations into chronic metabolic disorders have revealed a significant role for dysregulated pyroptosis in promoting tissue damage characteristic of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Furthermore, mounting evidence implicates inappropriate activation of GSDMD-induced inflammation as an important factor contributing to tumorigenesis across multiple cancer types.
Given the growing recognition of aberrant pyroptosis as a driver of pathological inflammation, developing strategies to intervene at specific points along this pathway holds immense therapeutic potential. The identification of key molecular players involved in modulating inflammasome assembly or disrupting crucial steps involved in GSDMD pore formation opens up exciting possibilities for the development of drugs that can selectively target this process. Small-molecule inhibitors targeting inflammasomes or downstream mediators involved in GSDMD activation represent promising candidates for therapeutic intervention.
This review will critically examine recent advancements in understanding the structural basis of GSDMD activation and oligomerization, shedding light on potential strategies to inhibit pathological pyroptosis. By integrating findings from various disease models, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of how dysregulated GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis contributes to diverse inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the complex interplay between inflammasomes, inflammatory cytokines, and immune responses will be explored within the context of disease pathogenesis.
In conclusion, this article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis by elucidating its molecular mechanisms and highlighting its association with various diseases. We hope that this review will contribute to further research efforts aimed at developing effective therapeutic interventions targeting aberrant pyroptotic cell death as a means to restore immunological balance and prevent or treat inflammatory disorders across diverse clinical settings.
 
1. Introduction
The use of metformin, a widely used anti-hyperglycemic drug in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, has shown promising applications beyond its established medical uses. This versatile drug has attracted interest in various medical disciplines, including dentistry. Recent studies have explored the potential benefits of metformin for oral health and dental treatment.
While the primary focus of metformin's use remains in glycemic control and diabetes management, investigations into its adjunctive therapeutic effects on oral conditions have commenced. Dental professionals have been increasingly intrigued by metformin's potential to improve periodontal health, stimulate odontogenic differentiation and mineral synthesis, enhance osseointegration of endosseous implants, impede tumor progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), resist orthodontic appliance corrosion as well as improve orthodontic tooth movement.
Metformin's effectiveness as an adjunct topical therapy for patients with diabetes and periodontitis has recently been demonstrated through clinical trials. Periodontal disease is characterized by chronic inflammation that affects soft tissues surrounding the teeth as well as alveolar bone deterioration. Traditionally seen as a bacterial-induced infection rooted solely in poor oral hygiene practices, research now recognizes that systemic factors contributing to this progressive condition need consideration too. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus are known to be at higher risk for periodontal disease due to impaired immune response and exaggerated inflammatory processes triggered by hyperglycemia.
Recent evidence suggests that locally applied metformin can alleviate periodontitis symptoms through its ability to modulate inflammatory pathways within both epithelial cells and gingival fibroblasts. The self-administration of chemotherapeutic agents such as chlorhexidine or antibiotic mouthwashes may not suffice when treating patients presenting with severe local inflammation coupled with systemic metabolic derangements characteristic of diabetes mellitus.
In addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, studies indicate that metformin can stimulate odontogenic differentiation and mineral synthesis of stem cells within the tooth pulp. This regenerative property opens doors for potential applications in dental pulp regeneration and root canal procedures, where promoting repair and tissue regrowth are necessary.
Metformin's impact on bone metabolism has also attracted considerable attention in dentistry. Light has been shed on its ability to stimulate osteoblast proliferation, thus enhancing bone formation while simultaneously reducing osteoclast activity, which results in a net increase of mineralized tissue within periodontal alveolar bone. Consequently, metformin presents itself as a promising candidate for periodontal regeneration procedures.
Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that metformin monotherapy might enhance osseointegration of endosseous implants via promotion of peri-implant new bone formation and reduced inflammation around implant sites. Dental implant failure often occurs due to weak integration with the surrounding host bone; therefore, any modality that favors osseo-integration could significantly improve clinical outcomes.
Interestingly, studies have identified potential anti-cancer effects of metformin on OSCC growth inhibition by impeding tumor progression through various cellular mechanisms. This finding ignites enthusiasm regarding its use as an adjunctive therapy to conventional treatment modalities for oral cancer patients.
Lastly, recent animal studies have indicated that metformin may enhance orthodontic tooth movement while potentially resisting corrosion caused by orthodontic appliances. These findings suggest future applications for improving treatment outcomes in orthodontics.
Given these recent advancements indicating varying applications of metformin in dentistry beyond glycemic control alone, this narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the current research investigating the prospective therapeutic uses of metformin in dental practice. By synthesizing existing literature and highlighting potential areas for further investigation or clinical application development within this field, we aim to lay foundations for incorporating evidence-based strategies utilizing this versatile drug into routine dental care protocols on a broader scale. 
Title: The Impact of Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder on Academic Performance and Cognitive Functioning in the Young Generation
Abstract:
Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is a sleep disorder characterized by a delay in the habitual sleep-wake timing, leading to difficulties in falling asleep and waking up at desired times. Individuals with DSWPD often experience fatigue, impaired concentration, weekday sleep deprivation, absenteeism, and even depressive symptoms. This disorder predominantly affects adolescents and young adults but its prevalence remains understudied internationally. Additionally, there is growing concern regarding the potential impact of behavioral restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic on susceptible individuals who may develop DSWPD.
The pathogenesis of DSWPD involves physiological, genetic, psychological, behavioral factors as well as social influences. Recent findings highlight an association between delayed sleep phase and prolonged sleep duration within the young generation during pandemic-related restrictions. This raises concerns about a possible mismatch between their circadian rhythms and social obligations once these restrictions are lifted.
While individuals with DSWPD typically exhibit a delay in circadian rhythms, it is noteworthy that approximately 40% of cases lack any misalignment according to objectively measured circadian rhythm markers. Instead, certain psychological and behavioral characteristics commonly seen among young people such as truancy or academic/social difficulties play prominent roles in driving this disorder.
Furthermore, recent research has demonstrated that there is a high comorbidity rate between DSWPD and psychiatric disorders—particularly mood and neurodevelopmental conditions—which further contribute to the pathophysiology of this disorder via bidirectional associations. Notably, patients with DSWPD also exhibit elevated levels of neuroticism and anxiety which can exacerbate insomnia symptoms.
Currently available treatment approaches for DSWPD primarily focus on chronobiological interventions; however cognitive-behavioral approaches also hold promise. Therefore future studies should investigate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral strategies alongside chronobiological interventions for the management of DSWPD.
1. Introduction:
Sleep plays a critical role in various aspects of human functioning, including cognitive abilities, psychological well-being, and academic performance. Sleep disorders, such as delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), have gained increasing attention due to their detrimental impact on individuals' daily lives. DSWPD is characterized by a persistent delay in the sleep-wake timing relative to conventional societal norms (i.e., difficulties falling asleep and waking up at desired times). This disorder predominantly affects adolescents and young adults with limited large-scale studies exploring its epidemiology across different racial groups.
One significant domain impacted by DSWPD is academic performance. The delayed sleep schedule associated with this disorder often leads to poor attendance, decreased alertness, impaired concentration, and reduced cognitive abilities among affected individuals. Long-term consequences of compromised academic performance due to DSWPD can extend beyond education into other areas of life such as career opportunities and overall quality of life.
Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying DSWPD is essential given its potential ramifications on individuals' mental health and social functioning within the young generation. While physiological factors contribute to disrupted circadian rhythm regulation observed in DSWPD cases with misalignment, recent research suggests that behavioral factors may play a prominent role in perpetuating or exacerbating this disorder even without objective misalignment being present.
Notably, recent global events related to the COVID-19 pandemic have imposed unprecedented behavioral restrictions (e.g., lockdowns) affecting individuals' daily routines including sleep patterns within younger populations. Researchers anticipate that these restrictions may further disrupt existing sleep patterns among susceptible individuals—potentially resulting in an increased prevalence of DSWPD once these restrictions are lifted.
This paper aims to investigate how delayed sleep-wake phase disorder impacts academic performance and cognitive functioning among young people while exploring potential risk factors associated with its onset or exacerbation within this population group. Specifically focusing on students attending educational institutions, the study will examine the relationship between DSWPD and academic success in terms of attendance, grades, and overall cognitive performance. Furthermore, it will explore behavioral factors such as truancy and social difficulties that may contribute to the development or worsening of this disorder.
Given the high comorbidity rate between DSWPD and psychiatric disorders—particularly mood disorders—it is crucial to investigate the bidirectional associations between these conditions to better understand their underlying mechanisms. This research aims to shed light on these associations while also exploring potential avenues for intervention including cognitive-behavioral approaches alongside existing chronobiological interventions for managing DSWPD among young individuals.
By advancing our understanding of DSWPD's impact on academic performance and cognitive functioning within the young generation, this study can lay a foundation for developing targeted interventions that consider individual differences in sleep patterns as well as psychological and behavioral characteristics associated with this disorder. Ultimately, our findings may help inform educational institutions, health professionals, and families seeking methods to mitigate DSWPD's adverse effects on academic success and overall well-being within this population group. 
Introduction
The field of health professions education has witnessed a growing emphasis on promoting higher-level thinking skills among learners. Inquiry-based learning (IBL) represents a pedagogical approach that encourages students to develop and explore their own questions, facilitating active exploration and problem-solving. This educational approach fosters critical thinking, independent learning, and the cultivation of a climate of curiosity among learners (1). In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in assessing the outcomes of IBL initiatives in health professions education.
While numerous studies have investigated the effectiveness of inquiry-based learning strategies across various educational domains, there remains a need to specifically examine the outcomes associated with IBL curricula within health professions education. Evaluating such curricula is paramount not only to inform instructional practices but also to ensure that trainees engage in optimal learning experiences.
To date, existing literature has primarily focused on subjective outcomes such as trainee self-reported satisfaction or perceived gain of skills as primary outcome measures (2-3). Although these studies provide valuable insights into learners' perceptions and attitudes towards IBL initiatives, it is essential to complement these findings with objective measures that can assess the impact on specific knowledge acquisition and critical thinking abilities.
The primary research question addressed in this paper aims to explore the potential impact of inquiry-based learning initiatives within health professions education by examining standardized measures related to inquiry behaviors. By using validated data collection tools specifically designed for assessing student inquiry behavior and critical thinking abilities, this study seeks to elucidate potential improvements resulting from IBL interventions.
2. Objectives
The specific objectives of this study are:
1. To conduct a scoping review encompassing publications detailing trainee outcomes in open IBL initiatives within the field of health professions education.
2. To identify studies employing five phases of IBL (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, discussion) as intervention components.
3. To gather data from selected publications regarding metrics used for evaluating trainee outcomes in IBL curricula within health professions education.
4. To assess the prevalence of standardized measures employed for evaluating trainee inquiry behaviors and critical thinking abilities resulting from IBL interventions.
5. To analyze the outcomes reported in selected studies and identify patterns, trends, and gaps within the literature.
6. To propose recommendations for future curriculum innovations utilizing IBL approaches while highlighting the value of incorporating standardized tools to assess inquiry-oriented skills among health professions learners.
By rigorously examining the existing literature on outcomes of IBL initiatives within health professions education specifically related to standardized measures associated with student inquiry behavior and critical thinking skills, this study aims to contribute significant insights into the effectiveness of such educational interventions. This investigation is highly relevant as it will shed light on areas requiring further attention, guide instructional practices, and inform future research endeavors focusing on optimizing learning experiences in health professions education through inquiry-based pedagogy.
In conclusion, this paper presents a comprehensive scoping review that investigates the outcomes of IBL initiatives within health professions education with a specific focus on standardized measures related to trainee inquiry behavior and critical thinking abilities. By examining existing literature in this domain, our study seeks to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and impact of IBL approaches while underscoring their potential for promoting higher-level thinking among learners in healthcare disciplines.

1. Introduction
Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms of the Schistosoma species, remains a significant public health problem in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. With over 240 million people affected worldwide, schistosomiasis imposes a substantial burden on individuals and communities, particularly in resource-limited settings (World Health Organization [WHO], 2021). Praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug of choice for treating schistosomiasis and is recommended by the World Health Organization for regular mass drug administration (MDA) programs aimed at reducing infection rates and associated morbidity.
While MDA programs with PZQ have shown remarkable success in controlling schistosomiasis in some areas, there are still challenges to achieving universal coverage and uptake of treatment. Implementation aspects such as social mobilization, health education, sensitization campaigns have been integral components of MDA initiatives to raise awareness among affected communities regarding the importance and availability of PZQ treatment (Danso-Appiah et al., 2019). However, little is known about where communities seek treatment for schistosomiasis in contexts where PZQ MDA programs are absent or delayed.
This research aims to explore the health-seeking behaviors regarding schistosomiasis treatment among endemic communities residing along Lake Albert in Western Uganda when mass drug administration has been hindered or postponed. Understanding how affected individuals access treatment during these periods can provide valuable insights into optimizing implementation strategies to meet the WHO's target coverage goals by 2030.
2. Methods
To address this research question based on health-seeking behaviors related to schistosomiasis treatment during times without ongoing MDA programs, we conducted a community-based qualitative study using interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs). The study was conducted from January to February 2020 within Kagadi and Ntoroko, two communities known to be endemic for schistosomiasis in Western Uganda.
A total of 12 individuals were purposively sampled and interviewed, including local leaders, village health teams (VHTs), and health workers. Additionally, 28 FGD sessions were conducted involving 251 community members who were selected based on their familiarity and experience with schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms. The data collected from interviews and discussions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a thematic analysis model.
3. Results
Preliminary findings suggest that participants rarely seek medication for schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms from government healthcare facilities such as hospitals or health centers II, III, or IV. Instead, they predominantly rely on alternative sources such as community volunteers (e.g., VHTs), private clinics or drug shops within close proximity to their communities or traditional healers (e.g., witch doctors and herbalists). Several factors emerged as influential in leading individuals to seek treatment outside of the government healthcare system.
These factors include the unavailability of PZQ drugs at government health facilities during periods without MDA programs; negative attitudes displayed by certain health workers towards patients seeking treatment; long distances between communities and government hospitals/healthcare facilities; poor road infrastructure hindered accessibility; financial constraints associated with medication costs; as well as negative perceptions surrounding PZQ efficacy.
4. Discussion
The findings point towards critical challenges related to the availability and accessibility of PZQ treatment for endemic populations during periods without MDA programs. The reliance on alternative sources of schistosomiasis treatment indicates a societal need for closer proximity between affected communities and healthcare services equipped with adequate supplies of PZQ.
Addressing these issues requires improvements in local healthcare systems along with targeted interventions addressing community-specific sociocultural beliefs that contribute to the utilization of alternative sources for schistosomiasis treatment rather than seeking standardized care.
In conclusion, this study sheds light on the health-seeking behaviors related to schistosomiasis treatment in scenarios where MDA programs with PZQ are absent or delayed. The insights gained from understanding the preferred sources of treatment during these periods may inform implementation policies and interventions aimed at achieving WHO's coverage targets for schistosomiasis control by 2030. A context-specific awareness-raising campaign is warranted to address misconceptions surrounding PZQ and to encourage affected communities towards more appropriate and effective treatment-seeking behaviors.
5. Conclusion
Further research is needed to explore sustainable strategies for bringing schistosomiasis drug treatment and services closer to endemic communities, ensuring adequate supplies of PZQ, fostering positive attitudes among health workers, improving infrastructure for better accessibility, addressing financial barriers, and debunking myths associated with PZQ in collaboration with local stakeholders.

1. Introduction
Population demographics have long been recognized as a crucial determinant of economic and social development. The concept of the demographic dividend, which refers to the potential economic growth that can be achieved when a country's population age structure shifts favorably towards a larger working-age population relative to dependents, has gained significant attention in recent years. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria and Tanzania, are currently classified as pre-dividend nations by the World Bank (2017), highlighting their unique position in terms of potential demographic advantages.
Considering this context, this academic paper aims to investigate the relationship between demographic dividends and favorable policy environments in pre-dividend African nations such as Nigeria and Tanzania. Specifically, our research seeks to analyze national policies across multiple sectors that are known to shape population dynamics and assess their alignment with harnessing the benefits of a demographic dividend.
The significance of studying these particular countries lies in their vast populations, high fertility rates, and substantial youth bulges – factors that make them prime candidates for leveraging a favorable demographic dividend if appropriate policies are implemented. However, despite these opportunities for growth presented by changing demographics, it is crucial to examine whether existing policies adequately address key areas identified within the Gates Institute Demographic Dividend Framework: Family Planning, Maternal and Child Health (MCH), Education, Women’s Empowerment (WE), and Labor Market.
As demonstrated by similar studies conducted elsewhere globally (Canning et al., 2018; Lutz et al., 2019; Sadoulet & de Janvry 2019), proactive policy interventions play an essential role in ensuring successful attainment of an optimal demographic transition resulting from changing age structures. By analyzing existing national policy documents within these critical sectors across Nigeria and Tanzania through collaboration with local partners on the ground who possess contextual understanding relevant for effective policy planning at respective national levels.
To achieve our research objectives effectively within this study framework targeting family planning targeting MCH, education, WE, and the labor market, we will employ a comprehensive set of indicators derived from a systematic literature review. This exhaustive list of indicators will serve as a robust tool to determine the alignment between existing policies and the maximization of demographic dividends within Nigeria and Tanzania.
The findings from this study will offer insights into areas where policy amendments can be implemented in order to bridge gaps within each sector. The identification of potential policy alternatives that align with the specific contextual realities and challenges faced by Nigeria and Tanzania can aid policymakers in designing targeted interventions aimed at accelerating demographic transition towards sustainable social and economic development.
Furthermore, this research endeavor emphasizes the importance of measurability in monitoring policy outcomes across all five key sectors identified by the Gates Institute Demographic Dividend Framework. By adopting measurable indicators, policymakers can effectively track progress towards achieving relevant targets specified within national policies.
As both Nigeria and Tanzania enter periods marked by rapid changes in their population composition, it becomes increasingly critical for these pre-dividend nations to routinely undertake policy reviews aimed at strengthening strategies across multiple sectors. Such periodic assessments will enable them to capitalize fully on their respective demographic dividends while ensuring that their policies remain dynamic enough to adapt to emerging challenges.
In conclusion, this academic paper sets out to examine national policies within pre-dividend African nations such as Nigeria and Tanzania with respect to leveraging favorable demographic dividends. By analyzing existing policies across five key sectors identified by the Gates Institute Demographic Dividend Framework through an extensive literature review-based indicator framework, we aim to shed light on gaps that may hinder effective implementation. Ultimately, our study hopes to contribute practical recommendations for policymakers striving towards harnessing optimal demographic transitions for enhanced socio-economic growth.

Introduction
Despite the significant advancements in understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), a pressing need remains for novel therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes. GBS is an immune-mediated neuropathy characterized by acute inflammatory demyelination of peripheral nerves. The exact etiology of GBS is not yet fully elucidated; however, both cellular and humoral immunity have been implicated in its onset and progression (Kaida et al., 2012). Molecular mimicry theory has emerged as the most widely recognized pathogenic mechanism underlying GBS, positing that autoantibodies produced during infection cross-react with neural antigens (Rinaldi et al., 2019). This triggers an autoimmune response targeting peripheral nerve structures and leads to nerve damage.
To date, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE) are established treatment modalities that have demonstrated efficacy in improving patient prognosis by modulating the immune response (Ogawa et al., 2020; Ruts et al., 2010). However, there have been no substantial advancements in existing therapies or novel strategies to further enhance treatment effectiveness. Therefore, there is a critical need to explore innovative approaches to optimize immunotherapeutic interventions for patients with GBS.
The development of new treatment strategies for GBS has primarily focused on immunotherapies targeting various components involved in the immune cascade. These include antibodies against specific targets implicated in disease pathogenesis such as gangliosides GM1a or GM1b; complement pathways involved in neuroinflammation; immune cells such as T-cells, B-cells or macrophages; and pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).
While numerous experimental studies have underscored the potential therapeutic benefits associated with these novel immunotherapies, their translation into clinical practice has been slow. Currently, several treatment strategies are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials specifically designed to assess their safety and effectiveness in patients with GBS. However, no new therapeutic agents have yet gained regulatory approval for the management of this debilitating condition.
In light of these observations, this comprehensive narrative review aims to summarize the current state-of-the-art therapies for GBS while providing an overview of recent advances in novel immunotherapeutic strategies. By analyzing the underlying pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms associated with GBS, we will also evaluate potential therapeutic targets and discuss the challenges hindering their successful translation into clinical practice.
The primary objective of this review is to consolidate existing knowledge on immunotherapy options available for GBS treatment while critically appraising the scientific evidence supporting emerging immunotherapeutic approaches. Furthermore, we aim to identify gaps in current research and propose avenues for future investigations that may ultimately pave the way towards improved patient outcomes in GBS.
In conclusion, this review highlights the urgent need for advancements in immunotherapy options targeting immune pathways involved in GBS pathogenesis. By elucidating immune-mediated mechanisms responsible for nerve damage and identifying specific therapeutic targets within these cascades, novel approaches hold promise to enhance treatment efficacy beyond what is currently achievable with IVIg or PE alone. By understanding these avenues for intervention more comprehensively, clinicians can develop personalized treatment regimens that address specific components contributing to disease progression while minimizing adverse events commonly associated with broad immunosuppression or systemic interventions such as corticosteroids. 
Introduction
Over the past few decades, microneedles have emerged as a promising technology for a wide range of transdermal biomedical applications. These miniature needles, typically ranging from 100 to 900 micrometers in length, offer several key advantages over traditional hypodermic needles, including painless insertion and minimal tissue damage. In addition, they provide a more sustainable approach to drug delivery and biosensing.
Microneedles have garnered significant interest due to their potential in various biomedical applications. For instance, they can be used for biosensing purposes by incorporating sensing elements onto the needle tips. This allows for real-time monitoring of physiological parameters such as glucose levels or lactate concentration in interstitial fluid. Such continuous monitoring is particularly valuable for managing chronic diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular disorders.
In terms of drug delivery, microneedles offer several advantages compared to conventional methods. They can bypass the skin's stratum corneum barrier and deliver drugs directly into the underlying tissues or systemic circulation. This targeted approach minimizes dosage requirements and reduces side effects associated with traditional oral or injection routes.
Despite these advantages, there remain critical challenges in material selection and fabrication methods that must be addressed before microneedle technology can reach its full potential across diverse biomedical applications.
The choice of materials plays a crucial role in determining the mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and degradation profile of microneedles. Ideally, materials should exhibit appropriate hardness and Young’s modulus to enable efficient penetration without buckling or fracture during insertion into the skin layers. Furthermore, they must demonstrate high biocompatibility to minimize adverse tissue reactions upon contact with bodily fluids.
Fabrication methods also play an important role in achieving optimal shape, configuration, and function of microneedles tailored towards specific biomedical applications. Techniques such as photolithography-based processes allow precise control over needle geometry while enabling mass production on microscale platforms efficiently.
Solid and hollow microneedles are two common design variations that offer distinct advantages for different applications. Solid microneedles are typically used for drug delivery and biosensing, as they can be loaded with therapeutics or sensing agents. Hollow microneedles, on the other hand, enable direct fluid extraction from the body or targeted delivery of therapeutic agents into deeper tissue layers.
In recent years, significant progress has been made in fabricating microneedle arrays using various materials and fabrication techniques to meet specific application requirements. However, there is a need for a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art materials, fabrication methods employed in their production process along with their respective advantages and limitations.
This paper aims to provide an updated overview of the materials used in microneedle technology, emphasizing properties such as hardness, Young's modulus, geometric structure processability biocompatibility degradability barriers towards achieving effective biomedical applications. It will further delve into various fabrication methods utilized to produce solid and hollow microneedles along with a detailed analysis comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally this paper provides an insight into the expanding breadth of biomedical applications enabled through advancements in microneedle technology such as biosensing drug delivery body fluid extraction nerve stimulation.
Overall this study seeks to provide fundamental knowledge required for advancing understanding of developing new innovative devices utilizing micro needle technology engineering solutions addressing unmet challenges specific to range different biomedical fields applications 
Association between Sedentary Behavior and Colorectal Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Introduction:
Colorectal cancer is a significant global health concern, accounting for a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality. Sedentary behavior, characterized by prolonged periods of sitting or reclining with low energy expenditure, has emerged as a potential risk factor for various chronic diseases, including cancer. Sedentary behavior encompasses activities such as watching television, using the computer or electronic devices, and sitting at work or during leisure time without engaging in physical activity.
Recent studies have provided compelling evidence suggesting that sedentary behavior is associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer. For instance, previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated positive associations between sedentary behavior and breast cancer (1), endometrial cancer (2), and lung cancer (3). However, the relationship between sedentary behavior and colorectal cancer remains unclear.
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide; both incidence rates and mortality rates are significant concerns globally (4). Established risk factors for colorectal cancers include age, family history of colon polyps or colorectal carcinoma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), smoking habits, alcohol consumption patterns, poor dietary choices high in red meat intake combined with low intake of fruits/vegetables/fiber-rich foods(nutritional fiber) being major ones(5). However recent research points to physical activity along side social habits that predominate like maladaptive problem-solving styles in its etiology(6).
Given the growing body evidence supporting an association between sedentary behavior other type(s) too may be seen to be related to it.Having said this so far there has been no meta analysis study conducted on sedetnarchy behaviour's correlation

Therefore, in order to provide more comprehensive insights into the potential effects of sedentary behavior on colorectal cancer risk a systematic review and meta-analysis is needed. 
This study aims to assess the associations between domain-specific (occupation, leisure-time) and total sedentary behavior with the risk of colorectal cancer through a thorough examination of published literature. We will also investigate the potential differences in adjustment strategy for obesity and physical activity (including exercise habits). Identifying these associations is crucial for developing evidence-based strategies for cancer prevention and control.
Moreover, this study will make use of high-quality research studies conducted on human populations included most recentt ones determined by adhering to stringent criteria set by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines (7)and conducting a quality assessment based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scale(NOS). These rigorous methodologies ensure robustness across included studies within the systematic review.The additiona requirement we found was that 
Included studies must be observational human studies that evaluated the association between sedentary behavior exposure and incidence or prevalence of colorectal carcinoma or adenomatous polyps(nondebatable.)   
By synthesizing available evidence from multiple studies, this systematic review attempts to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the association between different types of sedentary behavior and colorectal cancer risk.Such an evaluation will help inform public health policies aimed at reducing the burden associated with this malignancy as substantial evidencesindicateassociationbetween slong periods continuous hours-lenghty sitting time coupled wih no exercise poses moderately significant major effect size(8).

In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to elucidate the association between different types of sedentary behavior (occupational, leisure-time) and the risk of colorectal cancer. The findings from this study may contribute to a better understanding of the impact of sedentary behavior on colorectal cancer risk, with important implications for prevention strategies and public health interventions. 
Title: Risk factors and associated factors for foot and ankle injuries in adolescent athletes: a systematic review
Abstract:
The aim of this systematic review is to identify the potential intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors (RFs), as well as associated factors (AFs), related to foot and ankle injuries in adolescent athletes. Foot and ankle injuries are common among young athletes, with significant implications for their overall physical health, athletic performance, and long-term well-being. Understanding the risk factors that contribute to these injuries can guide preventive measures, intervention strategies, and rehabilitation protocols. This article presents a comprehensive synthesis of available evidence on RFs, AFs, and consequences of such injuries.
Methods:
A systematic search was conducted across multiple databases including Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science, and Evidence from their inception until April 2021. Cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies conducted among athletes aged 18 years or younger were included if they investigated RFs or presented AFs associated with foot and ankle injuries. Studies published in languages other than English were excluded from this review.
Two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A total of 736 articles were initially identified based on our search strategy. After screening titles/abstracts for relevance against inclusion criteria followed by full-text evaluation using predefined selection criteria by both reviewers independently; ultimately 11 observational studies fully met the inclusion criteria that examined a total of 1265 participants with a mean age of 10.72 years.
Results:
Among the included studies analyzing intrinsic factor associations with foot and ankle injuries in adolescent athletes (n =10), several key risk factors emerged consistently across different populations: lower extremity alignment abnormalities (e.g., valgus/varus deformities), reduced proprioception/balance function impairment compromised strength endurance deficits in specific muscle groups relevant to injury mechanisms, inadequate flexibility, and improper biomechanics during athletic movements. Extrinsic factors (n = 4) included environmental conditions (e.g., playing surface), footgear characteristics, inappropriate/inadequate equipment utilization in sport-specific settings. It is worth noting that three studies identified both intrinsic and extrinsic factors as co-contributors to injury development. The risk of bias in the included studies varied from moderate to low.
Conclusion:
This systematic review highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors associated with foot and ankle injuries among adolescent athletes. Findings suggest that interventions targeting lower extremity alignment correction, neuromuscular control enhancement through proprioceptive training programs, strength training emphasizing specific muscle groups vulnerable to injury, improved flexibility protocols, modification of equipment/facilities contributing to injury risks are warranted for prevention and management purposes.
Future research needs to adopt standardized definitions, outcome measures along with well-established methodologies in order to generate more reliable evidence on risk factor profiles associated with foot and ankle injuries in adolescent athletes across various sporting disciplines. By doing so, we can develop comprehensive preventive strategies tailored for individual athletes while ensuring optimal athletic performance longevity without compromising their musculoskeletal health status.
[The word count: 605 words] 1. Introduction
Foot and ankle injuries are prevalent among adolescent athletes, posing significant challenges to their physical health and athletic performance. These injuries can result in pain, functional limitations, decreased participation in sports activities, and potential long-term consequences for musculoskeletal health (Adirim & Cheng, 2003; McCrory et al., 2017). Therefore, understanding the risk factors that contribute to foot and ankle injuries is crucial for implementing effective preventive strategies and optimizing injury management protocols.
While previous studies have examined the risk factors associated with foot and ankle injuries in athletes of various age groups (Emery et al., 2010; Müller et al., 2020), there is a need for a systematic review focusing specifically on adolescent athletes. Adolescence constitutes a critical period characterized by rapid growth, anatomical changes, maturation of physiological systems, and increased involvement in competitive sports activities (Jayanthi et al., 2021). The unique characteristics of this developmental stage warrant the identification of specific risk factors that may predispose young athletes to foot and ankle injuries.
The aim of this systematic review is to comprehensively evaluate the intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors associated with foot and ankle injuries among adolescent athletes. By synthesizing existing evidence from observational studies conducted on this population group, we aim to provide valuable insights into injury prevention strategies tailored specifically for these individuals.

Interaction of lncRNAs with the PI3K/AKT pathway in colorectal cancer: a systematic review
Abstract:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a global health challenge and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It accounts for the third most prevalent cancer and the fourth leading cause of death among different populations. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC tumorigenesis to develop targeted therapies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key players in regulating gene expression and cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and invasion.
This systematic review aims to evaluate the potential role of abnormal lncRNAs associated with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in colorectal tumorigenesis. The PI3K/AKT pathway is one of the major pathways dysregulated in CRC, promoting cell survival, growth, migration, invasion, and drug resistance.
Using PRISMA guidelines as criteria for article selection from various databases such as PubMed Central, Embase/Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Scopus®, Web of Science™ Core Collection database (WoS), CINAHL® Complete Database , PsycINFO® database , Google Scholar™ search engine , 60 eligible studies were identified from an initial pool of 452 articles reviewed. These articles were thoroughly examined to identify studies that investigated lncRNA expression levels in CRC samples compared to non-cancerous adjacent tissues or healthy controls.
Among these studies that met our inclusion criteria based on relevance and quality assessment determined by two independent reviewers using predefined eligibility criteria; we found compelling evidence supporting significant dysregulation patterns of multiple lncRNAs associated with aberrant activation or suppression within PI3K/AKT pathway signaling cascade.
Based on our analysis of these selected studies, it was observed that a total of 35 lncRNAs were found to be dysregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal controls. Of these, 24 lncRNAs were upregulated (68.57%) and 11 lncRNAs were downregulated (31.43%). These findings suggest that altered expression of certain lncRNAs might contribute to the dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in CRC.
Understanding the functional roles and mechanisms by which these dysregulated lncRNAs interact with key components of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway will provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of colorectal tumorigenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets for future development.
In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the importance of studying abnormalities in lncRNA expression associated with the PI3K/AKT pathway in colorectal cancer. The findings support evidence that dysregulation patterns of specific lncRNAs are involved in CRC tumorigenesis through modulating key signaling pathways. A deeper understanding of these interactions may lead to novel diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies for CRC patients.
Keywords: long non-coding RNAs, lncRNAs, colorectal cancer, PI3K/AKT pathway, systematic review 1. Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex and heterogeneous disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth and invasion of malignant cells in the colon or rectum. It represents a significant global health burden, with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Despite advances in early detection and therapeutic interventions, CRC remains a major public health challenge.
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway has emerged as one of the key regulatory networks involved in CRC tumorigenesis. Dysregulation of this pathway leads to aberrant cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and drug resistance – all hallmarks of cancer progression. Therefore, targeting components of the PI3K/AKT pathway has gained considerable attention as a potential therapeutic strategy for CRC.
In recent years, there has been growing recognition of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as crucial regulators of gene expression and cellular processes. These lncRNAs are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack protein-coding potential but play important roles in various biological functions through diverse mechanisms such as chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional processing, and RNA-protein interaction.
It is now well-established that dysregulated expression profiles of lncRNAs are associated with numerous human diseases including cancer. In particular, altered expression patterns of lncRNAs have been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis such as tumor initiation, promotion, metastasis formation,and resistance to therapy.
While there have been several studies investigating the involvement of lncRNAs in CRC tumorigenesis related to mTOR signaling activity - there is still limited knowledge regarding their interactions specifically with components within the PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore; we aimed to systematically review published literature examining abnormal expression patterns or functional roles played by these ncRs within PI3K/AKT signalling cascade; in order to evaluate the potential association between these lncRNAs and the development and progression of colorectal cancer.
This systematic review builds upon previous work by focusing on the specific interaction between lncRNAs and the PI3K/AKT pathway in CRC tumorigenesis. By comprehensively analyzing existing literature, we aim to identify dysregulated lncRNAs within this pathway, discuss their functional roles, and assess their diagnostic or therapeutic potential for CRC patients.
The findings of this review will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC tumorigenesis, highlight candidate biomarkers for early detection or prognostication, and potentially uncover novel therapeutic targets for intervention in CRC. Ultimately, understanding the intricate relationship between dysregulated lncRNAs and PI3K/AKT signaling may pave the way for personalized medicine approaches in treating colorectal cancer.
In this comprehensive systematic review, we utilized PRISMA guidelines to search multiple databases such as PubMed Central, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Scopus®, Web of Science™ Core Collection database (WoS), CINAHL® Complete Database , PsycINFO® database , Google Scholar™ search engine , with appropriate keywords related to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), colorectal cancer (CRC), PI3K/AKT pathway. The selected articles were critically assessed based on predefined eligibility criteria by two independent reviewers to ensure methodological rigor.
In conclusion,this systematic review underscores the importance of investigating aberrant expression patterns of lncRNAs within the context of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation in colorectal cancer. Through a comprehensive assessment of existing literature, we aim to shed light on their functional significance as well as their diagnostic or therapeutic potential. The integrationof these findings into clinical practice has a promising outlook for improving patient outcomes through targeted interventions tailored specifically towards modulating disrupted interactions between dysregulatedl ncRNAs and the PI3K/AKT pathway in CRC. 
Introduction
Tobacco control policies have been implemented worldwide to combat the devastating health effects associated with tobacco use. These policies aim to protect individuals from the harmful consequences of smoking and reduce the overall prevalence of tobacco consumption. However, assessing the effectiveness and impact of these policies is crucial for ensuring their success and making informed decisions regarding their future implementation.
One such country that has made significant strides in tobacco control is China, particularly in its capital city, Beijing. Beijing has initiated one of the most comprehensive tobacco control programs in the nation, aligning itself with the guidelines outlined by the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). This program encompasses a wide range of measures aimed at reducing tobacco consumption and exposure, along with promoting public health.
Given its ambitious approach towards tobacco control, it becomes imperative to evaluate this comprehensive policy thoroughly. Conducting a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) can provide valuable insights into understanding how this policy influences various aspects related to public health and inform future interventions.
This study aims to address this research gap by identifying a set of indicators for use during the scoping stage of an HIA specifically tailored towards evaluating Beijing's tobacco control policy. The indicators chosen will be based on a robust conceptual framework that integrates both macro-level determinants and individual-level variables pertaining to health outcomes associated with smoking.
The proposed framework draws upon two well-established models: The Driving forces-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) model which provides a systematic framework for understanding complex environmental issues affecting human health; and The Determinants of Health Theory which emphasizes various social, economic, cultural factors influencing individual well-being.
Conducting an extensive review of existing surveillance systems and relevant literature pertaining to both global trends in tobacco control as well as local data specific to Beijing will contribute essential insights into indicator selection for evaluation purposes within this specific context.
To ensure rigor and interdisciplinary expertise during indicator evaluation criteria development and scoring, a working group comprised of 13 experts from various disciplinary backgrounds will be established. The input of these experts will enable a comprehensive assessment of each indicator's relevance, validity, and feasibility within the scope of the HIA.
Experts will score each indicator based on four chosen evaluation criteria to ensure a holistic assessment. Indicators obtaining a total score above 80% and with standard error less than 5 will be selected as part of the final set.
Using Kendall's coefficient of concordance, statistical analyses will assess the level of agreement among the experts' scores for each indicator. This calculation provides valuable insights into the consistency and reliability of indicators chosen for subsequent evaluation.
By identifying a set of indicators specifically tailored towards Beijing's tobacco control policy during this scoping stage, this study aims to contribute valuable knowledge that can aid in assessing its impact comprehensively. These indicators are expected to promote further evaluation efforts and serve as robust tools for monitoring progress over time.
Moreover, by analyzing empirical data using this set of indicators in future research endeavors, policymakers and public health practitioners can gain evidence-based insights into how well tobacco control policies are performing within global city contexts such as Beijing. This information is crucial in making informed decisions about implementing initiatives that effectively reduce smoking prevalence while improving overall public health outcomes.
In conclusion, understanding how tobacco control policies impact public health requires rigorous evaluation processes guided by appropriate indicators that reflect both context-specific nuances and global best practices. Identifying a comprehensive set of indicators suited to evaluate Beijing's tobacco control policy through an HIA is paramount in ensuring effective policymaking on both local and national levels while contributing to global efforts for reducing smoking-related morbidity and mortality rates. 
Title: The Emerging Potential of RNA-editing Enzyme ADAR1 as a Therapeutic Target in Stem Cell-based Tissue Regeneration
Abstract: Stem cells play a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Recent advancements in our understanding of RNA editing have shed light on how this epigenetic mark intricately regulates stem cell fate and function in both healthy and pathological states. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is the principal mediator of RNA editing, catalyzing the conversion of adenosine to inosine within double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates. Beyond its role as an essential molecular switch that influences physiological processes such as embryonic development, cell differentiation, and immune regulation, ADAR1 also holds immense promise for gene editing technologies. In this comprehensive review article, we provide an extensive overview of the structure and multifaceted functions exhibited by ADAR1, with particular emphasis on its influence over diverse aspects of stem cell biology.
1. Introduction
Advances made by researchers across multiple disciplines have significantly expanded our comprehension of stem cell biology over the past few decades. These self-renewing entities possess remarkable plasticity enabling them to differentiate into various cellular lineages within complex tissues or organs (Sipp et al., 2018). Harnessing their regenerative potential may hold key therapeutic implications for numerous debilitating conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and tissue injuries.
Transcriptome dynamics have recently emerged as crucial determinants that govern temporal gene expression patterns responsible for orchestrating intricate cellular processes during development (Bertero et al., 2019). Amongst these emerging regulatory mechanisms is RNA editing – a post-transcriptional modification process responsible for rewriting genetic information encoded within mRNA molecules without altering DNA sequences themselves (Bajad et al., 2019). Such modifications often arise due to enzymatic activities on RNA substrates, thereby generating functional diversity beyond the mere genetic code (Bajad et al., 2019; Fumagalli et al., 2021).
One of the major players in this evolving field of RNA editing is the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). ADAR1 acts as a multifunctional protein with two isoforms – namely the constitutively active p110 and interferon-inducible p150 forms. Recent investigations have highlighted its pivotal role in various physiological processes such as immune response modulation, viral defense mechanisms, and more intriguingly, stem cell fate determination (Yan et al., 2018; Bishop et al., 2020).
Herein, we present a comprehensive exploration of ADAR1 as a dynamic regulator of stem cell fate and function. Through an in-depth analysis of its structural attributes, enzymatic activities, and cellular signaling pathways involved in progenitor maintenance and differentiation processes, we aim to elucidate how ADAR1-mediated RNA editing emerges as an influential determinant controlling self-renewal capacities and lineage commitment within the context of diverse stem cell populations.
Furthermore, we delve into key insights regarding dysregulated ADAR1 expression levels observed in various hematopoietic malignancies (Han et al., 2020). Considering its impact on aberrant splicing patterns implicated in tumorigenesis or tumor progression events during malignant transformation or relapse scenarios that frequently arise following conventional therapies (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2013), targeting ADAR1 holds substantial potential for innovative therapeutic interventions aimed at normalizing dysregulated stem cells within carcinogenic contexts.
In conclusion, this review intends to present an authoritative perspective on the emerging role played by ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in shaping stem cell fate decisions. Ultimately unraveling these mechanisms may pave crucial avenues for therapeutic strategies focused on harnessing pluripotent cells' transformative potential in regenerative medicine and targeted cancer therapies. Understanding the intricate interplay between ADAR1 and stem cell biology opens a new frontier for future investigations, encouraging innovative therapeutic perspectives that hold vast promise for addressing unmet clinical needs. 
Title: Effectiveness of Educational Videos Produced by Nursing Professionals in Patient Education: A Systematic Review
Abstract:
This systematic review aims to analyze the effectiveness of educational videos produced by nursing professionals in patient education. The use of multimedia technologies, such as video production, has gained significant attention as a strategy to enhance teaching and learning processes in healthcare settings. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of educational videos specifically created by nursing professionals for patient education purposes.
The search for primary studies will be conducted in relevant databases including CINAHL, LILACS, and MEDLINE/PubMed. Keywords such as "educational videos," "patient education," "nursing professionals," and related terms will be used to identify potential articles for inclusion. The selection criteria will include studies that involve educational videos produced by nursing professionals for patient education purposes.
The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed using established tools such as the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice tool. Descriptive analysis will be carried out to summarize the results obtained from selected studies. The methodological stages utilized during video production, including pre-production, production, and post-production phases, will also be explored.
Preliminary findings from this review suggest that despite an increasing number of studies on educational video production conducted by nursing professionals in recent years, there remains a gap in understanding their overall effectiveness within patient education contexts. Furthermore, it is essential to evaluate whether these videos adhere to rigorous methodological frameworks during their development process.
Previous research indicates that the incorporation of various multimedia formats into patient education has shown promise in improving knowledge transfer and comprehension among patients. However, further investigation is needed regarding the specific impact that educational videos designed by nursing professionals can have on patients' understanding of medical information.
Moreover Moreover, the effective dissemination of crucial healthcare information to patients is vital for promoting self-care behaviors, enhancing treatment compliance, and improving overall health outcomes. Patient education in nursing plays a pivotal role in equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to engage actively in their own care.
Traditionally, patient education has relied heavily on face-to-face interactions between healthcare professionals and patients. While these interactions are valuable, they can be limited by factors such as time constraints, language barriers, and varying levels of health literacy among patients. Educational videos offer a promising solution by providing a visual and auditory medium that transcends language barriers while allowing for repeated access to important information.
However, the development of educational videos specifically created by nursing professionals for patient education purposes requires careful consideration of methodological frameworks. Ensuring rigorous execution throughout all stages - from pre-production planning to post-production evaluation - is essential to uphold quality standards and maximize the effectiveness of these teaching materials.
To date, there exists a paucity of comprehensive reviews examining the effectiveness of educational videos produced exclusively by nursing professionals within patient education contexts. While some studies have explored video-based interventions or evaluated generic educational videos produced by various healthcare providers, few have specifically focused on assessing outcomes associated with videos developed solely by nursing experts.
This systematic review aims to bridge this gap in knowledge through an analysis of existing literature on educational videos developed by nursing professionals designed explicitly for patient education purposes. By synthesizing available evidence regarding both content delivery strategies and instructional design principles employed within these videos, this review seeks to provide insights into their overall effectiveness as essential tools supporting patients' understanding and retention of critical healthcare information.
By identifying potential strengths or weaknesses within current video production methodologies utilized by nursing professionals in patient education settings, practical recommendations can be provided concerning areas that warrant improvement or further investigation. Such insights will inform both future research endeavors geared towards refining video production approaches tailored specifically to meet the unique needs of diverse patient populations as well as enhance current nursing education practices.
Ultimately, the findings of this review hold the potential to contribute to evidence-based practice within nursing and patient education domains. By establishing a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of educational videos produced by nursing professionals, healthcare organizations, educators, and practitioners can make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and strategic utilization of multimedia tools in enhancing patient education initiatives.
In conclusion, this systematic review seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of educational videos produced exclusively by nursing professionals within patient education contexts. Through a rigorous assessment of methodological frameworks employed during video production and an analysis of outcomes associated with these multimedia tools, an evidence-based understanding can be established regarding their impact on patients' knowledge acquisition and engagement in self-care behaviors. Such insights are crucial for optimizing patient education strategies and enhancing healthcare delivery while empowering individuals to actively participate in their own care management. 
Introduction
Malnutrition is a well-established global health concern that has detrimental effects on children's growth and development. While there is extensive research examining the impact of malnutrition in relation to limited food access, the issue of disease-related malnutrition, particularly in chronic conditions and developing countries, remains understudied. This paper aims to explore an alternative approach to addressing disease-related malnutrition in pediatric patients with chronic diseases within a developing country context.
Childhood malnutrition is a complex multifactorial problem that encompasses various forms of under-nutrition and nutritional deficiencies (Black et al., 2013). It affects millions of children worldwide and has long-lasting implications for their overall health, cognitive development, academic achievement, and future productivity (Lelijveld et al., 2016; Victora et al., 2008). The consequences of malnutrition are especially dire for children living with chronic diseases where their nutritional requirements may be altered due to the underlying condition or treatment procedures (Kangaroo et al., 2020).
While developed countries often have established protocols and resources for identifying and managing disease-related malnutrition in pediatric patients, this issue poses unique challenges in developing countries with limited healthcare infrastructure and resource constraints (Isanaka & Menzies, 2019). In these settings, healthcare professionals are often confronted with multiple barriers such as inadequate diagnostic tools, low awareness about appropriate nutritional interventions among clinicians, lack of access to specialized nutritionists or dieticians trained in pediatric care (Bhutta et al., 2008), which may contribute to poor detection rates and suboptimal management outcomes.
Current literature surrounding disease-related malnutrition focuses primarily on high-income settings but fails to capture the diverse contexts found within developing nations. These resources tend not only to overlook important aspects specific to resource-limited regions but also neglect potential variations associated with cultural practices impacting dietary patterns or availability/accessibility/use of therapeutic foods (Olofin et al., 2013). Therefore, it is imperative to explore the unique challenges and opportunities faced by healthcare professionals in developing countries and devise strategies tailored to their specific circumstances.
This study aims to bridge this research gap by conducting a comprehensive literature review on the measurement of malnutrition specifically in pediatric patients with chronic diseases within the context of developing countries. By critically examining studies conducted in these settings, we seek to identify gaps, disparities, and guidelines for managing disease-related malnutrition. Additionally, our study will contribute towards formulating an innovative approach that considers resource limitations while integrating anthropometric assessments, clinical evaluations, and regular observation of feeding access and tolerance.
The significance of this research lies in its potential to inform policies and practices aimed at improving nutritional screening protocols for pediatric patients with chronic diseases residing in resource-limited nations. The findings from this study will provide insights into identifying effective interventions for better management outcomes tailored to local contexts. Ultimately, it is anticipated that bridging this knowledge gap will lead to improved overall nutrition status among children living with chronic conditions in developing countries and improve their overall health outcomes.
In conclusion, addressing disease-related malnutrition is a global health priority which requires context-specific approaches considering the unique challenges faced by developing countries. By analyzing existing literature on the measurement of malnutrition in pediatric patients with chronic diseases within resource-limited settings, we hope to identify best practice strategies that can be implemented despite constraints. Such an approach holds great potential for mitigating the adverse effects of disease-related malnutrition among children living with chronic illnesses.

1. Introduction
Cardiomyopathies, a group of diseases characterized by structural and functional abnormalities in the heart muscle, represent a significant burden on global healthcare systems. Despite advances in medical treatments and interventions, cardiomyopathies remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (1). The etiology of cardiomyopathies is multifactorial, involving both environmental risk factors and genetic predisposition (2). While some well-known disease-causing mutations have been identified within protein-coding regions of genes associated with cardiac function, recent studies suggest that noncoding genetic variants also play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these conditions.
Noncoding genetic variants refer to DNA sequence variations that do not alter the amino acid sequence of a protein but instead affect regulatory elements or other functional aspects within the genome (3). Traditionally overshadowed by coding mutations due to their perceived impact on gene expression regulation, noncoding variants are now gaining recognition as key contributors to disease development and progression (4).
Despite increasing evidence supporting the significance of noncoding genetic variants in various human diseases, their role in cardiomyopathies remains largely understudied. This knowledge gap is concerning given that many patients undergoing genetic testing carry such noncoding variants whose contribution to cardiac disease requires further investigation (5). Understanding the impact of these noncoding alleles holds great potential for elucidating novel mechanisms underlying cardiomyopathy development.
This paper aims to address this research gap by presenting an extensive review focusing on studying different types of noncoding genetic variants implicated in various subtypes of cardiomyopathy. We aim to summarize recent studies that have investigated associations between specific types or locations of noncoding alterations - including transcriptional enhancers, promoters, intronic sites, and untranslated regions - with different forms of cardiac disease. By focusing primarily on well-supported associations between variant types and specific pathological phenotypes related to cardiomyopathy subtypes supported by sufficient evidence from multiple studies.
It is critical to emphasize the potential clinical relevance of robust associations between noncoding genetic variants and cardiomyopathies. Recent advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have made genetic testing increasingly accessible and cost-effective for patients with suspected or established cardiomyopathies (6). However, such tests often focus solely on coding regions and may overlook noncoding alleles that significantly contribute to the overall disease burden. Identifying and validating these noncoding variants will yield important mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis, helping clinicians make more accurate diagnoses, assess disease severity, predict prognosis, develop personalized treatment strategies, and potentially even identify novel therapeutic targets.
In conclusion, this comprehensive review aims to fill the current research gap concerning the significance of noncoding genetic variants in the etiology of cardiomyopathies. By summarizing recent literature on different types of noncoding alterations associated with various forms of cardiac diseases, we aim to shed light on their potential contribution to disease development and provide a foundation for further studies aimed at validating their clinical relevance. The insights gained from such research endeavors will contribute to improving genetic screening tests by expanding their scope beyond coding mutations alone and incorporate a broader range of variant types that are equally critical for precise diagnosis, prognostication, and personalized therapeutic interventions in patients with cardiomyopathies. 
1. Introduction
Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has revolutionized the treatment landscape for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), improving patient outcomes and survival rates significantly. However, not all patients respond to ICI therapy, and some even experience immune-related adverse events. Therefore, identifying reliable biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with ICI is crucial for personalized treatment approaches.
While programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor expression has been used as a predictive biomarker for ICI response, its limitations and imperfect results necessitate the exploration of alternative markers. This manuscript aims to review the emerging soluble biomarkers based on liquid biopsy techniques that have shown promise in modifying clinical practice for NSCLC management.
Liquid biopsies offer a novel approach to assess disease characteristics by analyzing specific components in peripheral blood samples instead of requiring invasive tissue biopsies. By interrogating various components of liquid biopsies, we can potentially identify predictive markers that have greater accuracy and are more readily accessible than traditional tumor biopsy specimens.
It is becoming increasingly evident that non-tumoral blood cell count parameters hold significant prognostic value in cancer progression and response to therapy. In this study, we focus on several non-tumoral blood cell count-based markers including absolute neutrophil counts, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR). These readily available hematological parameters have shown promise as prognostic indicators across various cancer types, including NSCLC.
Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that soluble-derived immune checkpoint-related products may serve as potential predictive biomarkers. Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1), which reflects circulating PD-L1 levels rather than intratumoral expression alone, has been implicated in immunotherapy response prediction. The analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), including their detection, count, and expression of specific markers, and the evaluation of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-related products are also being actively studied as liquid biopsy-based predictive biomarkers.
This review aims to explore the current understanding of these promising soluble biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with ICI. Additionally, we aim to assess their potential implementation into current clinical practice to guide treatment decisions in a more biologically-driven manner.
In conclusion, the identification of reliable predictive biomarkers for ICI response is vital for optimizing therapeutic strategies in NSCLC. This manuscript emphasizes the importance of alternative markers based on liquid biopsies and highlights potentially valuable non-tumoral blood cell count parameters as well as soluble immune checkpoint-related products. By expanding our understanding of these emerging biomarkers, we can transform lung cancer management towards a more personalized approach based on biological determinants. Furthermore, the time-sensitive nature of NSCLC treatment underscores the urgency in identifying predictive biomarkers that can guide clinical decision-making at an early stage. Current treatment paradigms often rely on trial and error, resulting in delays in identifying patients who will benefit from ICI therapy. By incorporating liquid biopsy-based biomarkers into routine clinical practice, we can potentially streamline patient selection for ICI therapy and improve overall treatment outcomes.
Liquid biopsies offer distinct advantages over traditional tissue biopsy approaches. They provide a non-invasive means of obtaining real-time information about tumor characteristics, enabling clinicians to monitor disease progression and therapeutic response longitudinally. This dynamic assessment is particularly valuable in the context of NSCLC, which frequently displays intratumoral heterogeneity and may undergo clonal evolution during the course of treatment.
Moreover, liquid biopsies have a higher chance of capturing tumor-derived genetic alterations due to the shedding of circulating tumor DNA into the bloodstream or detection of rare circulating tumor cells. Traditional tissue biopsies often only capture a small portion of the primary or metastatic lesion, limiting their representativeness and potentially missing critical genetic alterations that might drive therapeutic resistance or predict response to immunotherapy.
The potential utility of liquid-based markers extends beyond mere prediction; they could also serve as reliable tools for monitoring therapeutic response and disease progression during ICI treatment. Serial assessments using these soluble biomarkers could aid in detecting early signs of resistance or relapse before they manifest clinically or radiographically. By identifying patients with suboptimal responses promptly, alternate treatment strategies such as combination therapies or drug switching might be initiated earlier to maximize outcomes.
With these considerations in mind and acknowledging previous limitations associated with tumor-biopsy specimen analysis (such as sampling bias and logistical challenges), this paper aims to delve into recent advancements concerning soluble biomarkers derived from liquid biopsies that hold promise as non-invasive predictors for clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We will critically examine the current literature, appraising the evidence behind each biomarker and its potential to alter clinical practice.
Additionally, we will explore unresolved questions and challenges surrounding the implementation of liquid biopsy-based biomarkers in routine clinical management. These include standardization of methods, establishment of robust cutoff values for various markers, and validation across different patient populations.
By consolidating the available evidence on liquid biopsy-derived soluble biomarkers in NSCLC patients undergoing ICI therapy, this study hopes to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of their predictive value as well as their potential for integration into routine clinical practice. Ultimately, our aim is to provide clinicians with valuable insights that can inform treatment decisions while enhancing patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resource allocation.
In conclusion, the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized NSCLC treatment paradigms. However, identifying which patients are likely to benefit from ICI therapy remains a significant challenge. This paper highlights the potential role of soluble biomarkers derived from liquid biopsies in predicting clinical outcomes for NSCLC patients treated with ICI. By investigating these promising markers and their integration into routine clinical practice, we strive towards personalized medicine approaches that improve patient selection criteria and ultimately enhance treatment efficacy in NSCLC. 
The Influence of Climate Change on the Phylogeography of Sharks and Rays: A Global Assessment Based on Life History Traits and Biogeographic Partitions
1. Introduction
Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges affecting marine ecosystems. As temperatures rise, ocean chemistry changes, and sea levels fluctuate, marine organisms face unprecedented disruptions in their habitats and life cycles. This has profound implications for population genetic structure and evolutionary history, particularly in highly vulnerable species such as sharks and rays.
Sharks and rays are crucial components of marine ecosystems worldwide due to their ecological roles as top predators or grazers, their contributions to nutrient cycling, and their overall biodiversity value. However, mounting evidence suggests that they are highly susceptible to anthropogenic stressors associated with climate change.
Previous research has extensively explored the impact of climatic factors on shark and ray populations but has primarily focused on individual species or regional analyses rather than providing a comprehensive global overview. Consequently, there is a knowledge gap regarding the phylogeographic patterns exhibited by these taxa across multiple ocean basins under changing climatic conditions.
Understanding how different life history traits interact with biogeographic partitions is essential for conserving shark and ray populations in the face of climate change threats. Of particular concern are traits such as late maturity and low fecundity that characterize many species within this group. These traits may limit their ability to adapt quickly to environmental changes or recover from population declines caused by overfishing or habitat destruction.
This study aims to fill this gap by providing a review and synthesis of the global phylogeography of sharks (40 species) belonging to 17 genera, along with rays (19 species) belonging to 11 genera. We will focus on exploring patterns of genetic diversity across major ocean basins—specifically, the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Pacific Ocean—to identify both shared trends among taxa groups as well as any unique characteristics exhibited by individual species.
To achieve this, we will construct median joining haplotype networks for each species using mtDNA cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences. Additionally, we will conduct an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) to further elucidate patterns of genetic structure within and between ocean basins.
We predict that the phylogeographic patterns observed in sharks and rays will be influenced by a combination of life history traits and environmental factors. We hypothesize that species with reproductive philopatry, site fidelity, pelagic habitats, migratory habits, and limited dispersal abilities during early life stages may exhibit higher levels of genetic structure compared to species with more mobile or demersal lifestyles.
Overall, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of how climate change influences the phylogeography of sharks and rays on a global scale. By identifying common patterns and unique characteristics across taxa groups and ocean basins, we can inform effective management strategies that consider the specific vulnerabilities associated with different life history traits. This knowledge is crucial for designing conservation plans that mitigate ongoing threats posed by climate change while preserving the integrity and resilience of shark and ray populations worldwide. 
Introduction 
Nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO) is a severe form of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) that leads to sudden and profound vision loss. It occurs when the central retinal artery, the primary blood supply to the retina, becomes blocked by an embolus or thrombus. Despite its devastating consequences, no standard treatment options currently exist for NA-CRAO. The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association have guidelines in place for managing CRAO patients; however, these guidelines primarily focus on systemic management rather than neuroprotection specific to the retina.
This lack of effective treatment options highlights a critical need for research into potential strategies aimed at neuroprotection in NA-CRAO. Recent advancements in acute ischemic stroke research have uncovered promising approaches, such as neuroprotective agents like uric acid, nerinetide, and otaplimastat. Additionally, significant progress has been made towards developing neuroprotective interventions for various retinal diseases including retinal detachment, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and inherited retinal diseases.
Given the existing knowledge surrounding neuroprotection in AIS and other retinal pathologies, it is reasonable to speculate that similar strategies may hold promise for improving outcomes in NA-CRAO cases. This paper aims to explore the potential application of cerebral neuroprotection strategies to enhance therapeutic approaches against NA-CRAOs.
The first section will provide an overview of current knowledge regarding neuroprotective interventions used in AIS patients with a focus on their mechanism of action and efficacy. By understanding these interventions better—and their impact on neuronal survival—it may be possible to identify potential strategies applicable to protecting neurons within the retina during a NA-CRAO episode.
Next, this paper will discuss specific drugs tested thus far with promising results as well as emerging techniques like angiopoietin (Comp Ang1), KUS 121 compound drug therapy, XIAP gene therapy, and hypothermia. Insight into the effectiveness of these drugs in retinal neuroprotection may inform future NA-CRAO treatment protocols.
Furthermore, imaging technologies play a crucial role in understanding the penumbra—the region surrounding the ischemic core—after an episode of NA-CRAO. Combining high-definition optical coherence angiography (HD-OCTA) with electrophysiology can provide comprehensive visualization, allowing for accurate delineation of the penumbra. Improved imaging techniques will aid in identifying potential targets for neuroprotective intervention at precise locations within the retina.
Finally, a better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in NA-CRAO is essential to further develop and optimize neuroprotective interventions. Investigating key molecular pathways during occlusion and reperfusion processes might unveil novel therapeutic targets that can bridge preclinical and clinical neuroprotection efforts.
In conclusion, this paper aims to discuss how cerebral neuroprotection strategies developed for AIS may be translated into effective approaches for preserving vision in NA-CRAO patients. The combination of neuroprotective agents with thrombolysis offers a potential extended window for treatment and improved outcomes. Enhanced imaging techniques alongside investigations into pathophysiologic mechanisms will contribute to closing the gap between preclinical studies' promising findings and their successful application within clinical settings. By exploring these avenues, we can hope to make significant strides towards improving outcomes in patients experiencing this devastating condition.
 2. Aim of the Study
The aim of this study is to investigate and evaluate the potential of applying neuroprotective strategies developed for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) to enhance therapeutic approaches for nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO). NA-CRAO is a variant of AIS that leads to sudden and severe vision loss due to the blockage of the central retinal artery. Currently, there is a lack of established treatment options specifically targeting NA-CRAO-induced retinal neuroprotection.
By drawing upon recent advancements in neuroprotective interventions for AIS, as well as research on other retinal diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and inherited retinal diseases, we aim to explore the potential application of these strategies in preserving visual function during NA-CRAO episodes. This study will delve into various drug therapies and techniques that have shown promise in promoting neuroprotection in AIS patients and examine their potential effectiveness for NA-CRAO treatment.
3. Significance
NA-CRAO represents a devastating condition that leads to permanent vision loss if left untreated or managed inadequately. Current guidelines by the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association primarily focus on systemic management rather than direct neuroprotective interventions within the retina. The limited treatment options available highlight the urgent need for developing effective strategies aimed at protecting neuronal cells from further damage during an NA-CRAO episode.
Furthermore, understanding how existing treatments have demonstrated success in preserving cerebral tissue viability following ischemic events could offer valuable insights into designing new approaches dedicated to enhancing visual outcomes after an episode of CRAO. Given recent advancements in imaging technologies such as high-definition optical coherence angiography (HD-OCTA) alongside electrophysiology techniques, it becomes crucial to identify potential targets within the retina accurately through improved visualization methods.
4. Approach
To address our research objective, this study will initially provide an overview of current neuroprotective interventions employed in AIS patients. We will examine the mechanisms of action and efficacy of these interventions, assessing their potential applicability to retinal neuroprotection in NA-CRAO cases.
We will then explore specific drugs that have shown promise in AIS treatment, such as uric acid, nerinetide, otaplimastat, and emerging techniques like angiopoietin (Comp Ang1), KUS 121 compound drug therapy, XIAP gene therapy, and hypothermia. By reviewing the existing literature on these strategies' effectiveness in protecting neuronal cells within the retina or cerebral tissue from ischemic damage, we can identify potential avenues for NA-CRAO therapeutic intervention.
Additionally, investigating advanced imaging techniques like HD-OCTA combined with electrophysiological assessments will contribute to accurately delineating the penumbra—the region surrounding the ischemic core—following an NA-CRAO episode. Improved understanding of this critical region can aid in identifying precise locations within the retina where neuroprotective interventions may be most effective.
Lastly, a comprehensive investigation into the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in NA-CRAO is crucial for developing targeted neuroprotective interventions. Such research may uncover novel molecular pathways that play influential roles during both occlusion and reperfusion processes. Bridging preclinical findings to clinical applications necessitates detailed knowledge surrounding these mechanisms.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, this study aims to explore how cerebral neuroprotection strategies developed for AIS may be translated into effective approaches for preserving visual function during episodes of nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO). By evaluating existing neuroprotective agents and techniques employed in AIS cases alongside advancements made in retinal disease research, we seek to bridge gaps between current NA-CRAO treatment options and promising preclinical findings.
Through enhanced imaging methods and investigations into pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying NA-CRAO-induced retinal damage, we hope to develop targeted neuroprotective interventions that will improve outcomes for patients experiencing this devastating condition. By focusing on neuroprotection alongside thrombolysis and expanding the therapeutic window for NA-CRAO treatment, the potential impact on preserving vision and enhancing quality of life can be significant. 
Title: The Impact of Transversus Abdominis Plane Block on Length of Stay in Minimally Invasive Colorectal Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
Abstract:
Transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) has emerged as a valuable adjunct technique for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal surgery. However, the impact of TAPB on length of stay (LOS) remains uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to comprehensively evaluate the existing literature to determine whether the use of TAPB is associated with a reduction in LOS in this patient population.
Introduction:
Minimally invasive colorectal surgery has become increasingly popular due to its numerous advantages over traditional open surgical techniques, including reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stays, decreased postoperative pain, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes (1). Despite these benefits, effective pain control remains crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and ensuring a smooth recovery process.
The management of postoperative pain following minimally invasive colorectal surgery typically involves multimodal analgesic strategies that combine systemic opioids with regional techniques such as epidural analgesia or peripheral nerve blocks. Among these regional techniques, transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) has gained recognition for its potential effectiveness in providing targeted analgesia after abdominal surgeries.
TAPB involves the injection of local anesthetic into the neurofascial plane between the internal oblique muscle and transversus abdominis muscle at mid-axillary line levels or along ultrasound-guided landmarks. By blocking sensory innervation from spinal nerves T6-L1 that supply anterolateral abdominal wall sensation, TAPB aims to reduce opioid requirements while maintaining adequate pain control during the early postoperative period.
While previous studies have examined various aspects related to TAPB's efficacy in terms of reducing opioid consumption and improving pain scores following minimally invasive colorectal surgery, the impact of TAPB on length of stay (LOS) remains less explored. LOS is an important outcome measure as it reflects patient recovery, healthcare resource utilization, and associated costs. A shorter LOS not only improves patient satisfaction but also provides potential cost savings to the healthcare system.
This systematic review and meta-analysis will obtain a comprehensive understanding of the literature regarding TAPB's effect on LOS in patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal surgery. By synthesizing available evidence from randomized controlled trials and observational studies, we aim to determine whether TAPB is associated with a reduction in LOS compared to standard analgesic techniques alone.
In addition to evaluating the primary outcome of interest—LOS—we will also examine secondary outcomes such as postoperative pain scores, opioid consumption, complications related to TAPB or surgery itself, postoperative ileus rates, surgical site infections, nausea and vomiting within 7 days postoperatively. The findings from this study may help guide clinicians in optimizing perioperative pain management strategies for patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal surgery.
Furthermore, given that optimal pain management contributes not only to improved patient experience but also potentially influences short-term clinical outcomes like ambulation and return of bowel function following colorectal surgery (2), this research endeavor holds significant implications for clinical practice by supporting evidenced-based approaches tailored towards reducing LOS through effective pain control techniques such as TAPB.
Methodologically rigorous assessment utilizing established tools such as Cochrane Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies Interventions (ROBINS-I) will be employed for evaluating study quality across eligible sources identified through systematic electronic literature surveillance. Subgroup analyses based on patient characteristics or surgical factors will be conducted where feasible to assess potential sources of heterogeneity among included studies.
The results derived from this systematic review may facilitate guideline development and inform future clinical trials aiming to investigate strategies that optimize perioperative pain control and patient recovery. It is anticipated that this study will contribute to the existing body of literature, empowering clinicians to make informed decisions regarding pain management strategies in minimally invasive colorectal surgery and ultimately improve patient outcomes. 
Title: Emerging Techniques for Real-Time Analysis of Cell Excretes from Organ-on-a-Chip Models
Abstract: Recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures, particularly organ-on-a-chip (OOC) devices, have revolutionized the field of biomedical research. OOC models have emerged as powerful tools that enable researchers to better mimic human physiological conditions compared to conventional two-dimensional (2D) culture systems. These innovative microfluidic platforms offer numerous applications ranging from mechanical studies and functional validation to toxicology investigations.
However, a significant challenge in utilizing OOC models lies in the absence of online analysis methods that allow real-time monitoring and observation of the cultured cells. The ability to analyze dynamic cellular processes and metabolites directly from the OOC models during experimentation is crucial for characterizing their functionality accurately. Traditional analytical techniques often suffer from inherent limitations such as low sensitivity or require sample manipulation, which compromises the fidelity of results obtained.
Mass spectrometry (MS), a powerful analytical technique widely employed in various scientific disciplines, holds immense promise for enabling real-time analysis of cell excretes within OOC models. MS offers several advantages including high sensitivity, selectivity, and the capacity to tentatively identify a diverse array of unknown compounds ranging from metabolites and lipids to peptides and proteins. These capabilities make MS an ideal candidate for investigating intricate cellular functions occurring within OOC devices.
Nevertheless, integrating MS with organ-on-a-chip systems presents its own set of challenges due to factors such as incompatible media composition and nonvolatile buffers used within these microfluidic platforms. The presence of such substances impedes the seamless connection between OOC outlets and MS instrumentation necessary for accomplishing online analysis.
In response to these challenges, recent technological advancements have been developed that address sample preprocessing requirements immediately after culturing in organ-on-a-chip devices and just before conducting analyses using MS techniques. Several strategies have been proposed including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging, direct electrospray ionization (ESI) interfaces, and microfluidic coupling devices. These cutting-edge techniques have facilitated the efficient integration of organ-on-a-chip platforms with MS, enabling real-time analysis and unraveling of cellular dynamics within physiologically relevant conditions.
In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the recent technological advances in bridging the gap between OOC systems and MS. We will evaluate the benefits and limitations of these emerging methods for successfully hyphenating OOC models with MS-based techniques for real-time analysis. A thorough understanding of these advancements will greatly contribute to further enhancing our ability to investigate complex cellular processes in organ-on-a-chip models, advancing drug discovery research, toxicological assessments, and personalized medicine applications.

- To identify the different types of DHC-enabled interventions utilized in musculoskeletal rehabilitation and their reported impacts on pain relief and QoL.
- To explore potential moderating factors, such as patient characteristics and study design features, that may influence the effectiveness of DHC-enabled musculoskeletal rehabilitation interventions.
By systematically identifying, synthesizing, and analyzing existing literature on DHC-enabled rehabilitation in MSDs, this review aims to contribute to evidence-based practice by providing healthcare professionals with comprehensive insights into the comparative effectiveness of these interventions. Additionally, this review will highlight knowledge gaps within current research literature and offer recommendations for further investigation to guide future research endeavors. Ultimately, this information can potentially inform clinical decision-making processes regarding the adoption and implementation of DHC-enabled rehabilitation programs for individuals with MSDs.
In conclusion, given the rising prevalence of MSDs worldwide coupled with advances in digital healthcare technologies, it is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of DHC-enabled rehabilitation approaches compared to conventional methods. This systematic review aims to consolidate available evidence on pain reduction and QoL improvement associated with DHC-based interventions while highlighting areas requiring further research. The findings from this comprehensive analysis will provide valuable insights into best practices for utilizing digital tools within musculoskeletal rehabilitation settings while contributing to a more personalized approach towards improving outcomes for individuals suffering from various MSDs. 
Title: Unraveling the Hidden Potential of Glycan-Specific Small Antibody Fragments: A Novel Avenue for Targeting Tumour-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens
Abstract:
Glycans, a diverse group of complex carbohydrates, play a pivotal role in modulating various biological processes and are associated with numerous diseases. In cancer biology, aberrant glycosylation patterns give rise to tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs), which serve as attractive targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Conventional antibodies have been widely explored to target these TACAs; however, their limited efficacy in vivo necessitates the exploration of alternative strategies. Recently, small antibody fragments have gained substantial attention due to their smaller size that allows enhanced tumor penetration and improved therapeutic outcomes. This review comprehensively evaluates various small antibody fragments targeting specific glycans on tumour cells and highlights their distinct advantages over conventional antibodies.
1. Introduction
Glycans play an indispensable role in cellular processes by modulating protein function, cellular recognition events, intracellular signaling pathways, and immune responses (1). Involved in numerous physiological functions such as cell adhesion, migration, differentiation and development (2), they contribute significantly to both homeostasis maintenance and pathological conditions including cancer.
Cancer is characterized by complex molecular alterations involving genetic mutations culminating in phenotypic variations within the cell population (3). Among these phenotypic changes are aberrant glycosylation patterns exhibited by tumour cells (4). Distinct glycan structures known as TACAs emerge as a consequence of this aberrant glycosylation process.
Over the years, it has become evident that TACAs possess diagnostic value aiding in early detection and monitoring cancer progression (5). Furthermore, due to their selective expression on malignant cells while being absent or minimally expressed on healthy tissues or benign lesions (6), TACAs represent promising targets for therapeutics.
1.1 Conventional Antibodies: Limitations and Challenges
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been extensively exploited as therapeutic agents for various diseases, including cancer (7). However, conventional full-length mAbs possess inherent limitations that impede their efficacy in the context of TACA targeting. The dense glycocalyx surrounding tumour cells hampers the efficient penetration of large molecular entities such as full-length mAbs into the tumour microenvironment (8). This restricted access limits their binding to TACAs, thereby compromising their therapeutic potential.
Moreover, conventional antibodies are inefficient at inducing immune effector functions within solid tumors due to their larger size and limited tissue penetration capabilities (9). This further contributes to compromised clinical outcomes following antibody therapy.
To overcome these challenges, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to developing alternative antibody formats with improved accessibility and efficacy in vivo.
1.2 Small Antibody Fragments: Unveiling New Possibilities
In recent years, small antibody fragments encompassing single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), diabodies, nanobodies or antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) have emerged as a novel class of affinity reagents with distinct advantages over conventional full-length mAbs. These compact formats exhibit superior target specificity and binding affinity while retaining smaller sizes favorable for improved tissue penetration and better tumor access.
The reduced molecular weight not only enables more efficient extravasation into tumoral tissues but also facilitates enhanced targeting due to reduced steric hindrance imposed by bulky domains present in full-length monoclonal antibodies. Consequently, smaller dimensions permit a higher density of molecules per dose reaching the desired targets on the cell surface or within tumor interstitial spaces.
Furthermore, small antibody fragments demonstrate an extended serum half-life attributed mainly to their renal clearance property along with minimal immunogenicity concerns compared to larger protein constructs such as IgG molecules. These factors collectively contribute towards improving pharmacokinetic profiles while reducing the likelihood of adverse reactions.
1.3 Aim of the Review
In light of the above, this review aims to comprehensively explore and evaluate the current landscape of small antibody fragments targeted towards specific glycans on tumour cells. We aim to highlight their distinct advantages over conventional full-length mAbs, discuss recent advances, examine their in vivo efficacy and potential clinical applications, as well as address challenges associated with their development and translation into clinical practice.
By uncovering the untapped potential of small antibody fragments targeting TACAs, this review seeks to provide insights into innovative therapeutic approaches that hold promise for significantly improving cancer diagnostics and treatment outcomes.

Introduction
Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is one of the major oilseed crops globally and plays a vital role in providing nutrition, food security, and economic stability to many countries. However, peanut production faces numerous challenges posed by biotic stresses caused by various pathogens and pests. Biotic stressors such as fungal diseases, viral infections, bacterial infections, nematode infestations, and insect pests significantly limit the yield potential of peanut crops (Janila et al., 2019). These stresses lead to substantial economic losses annually.
To ensure sustainable peanut production and enhance crop resilience against biotic stresses, it is crucial to investigate the underlying mechanisms that enable peanuts to respond and tolerate these stressors effectively. Traditional breeding approaches alone often lack precision when identifying genes responsible for resistance or tolerance traits (Varshney et al., 2013). Therefore, there is a growing need for advanced technologies that can provide insights into the complex molecular networks governing peanut response to biotic stresses.
In recent years, high-throughput omics technologies have emerged as powerful tools for studying plant responses at various molecular levels. Omics approaches encompass genomics (study of complete genomes), transcriptomics (study of gene expression patterns), proteomics (study of proteins), metabolomics (study of metabolites), miRNAomics (study of small non-coding RNA molecules called microRNAs), epigenomics (study of changes in gene expression without alterations in DNA sequence), and phenomics (quantitative analysis of phenotypic traits) among others.
The integration of multiple omics platforms enables researchers to obtain comprehensive insights into complex biological processes occurring during stress responses. By combining functional genomics with other omics data sets such as transcriptomes or proteomes under specific stress conditions researchers can gain a better understanding of how different genes interact with each other within metabolic pathways during the defense response.
Despite advances made through traditional breeding methods in developing peanut cultivars with resistance to biotic stresses, we still lack a complete understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying these traits. This gap hampers our ability to exploit the full potential of peanut's natural defense mechanisms against pathogens and pests.
Therefore, this review aims to highlight recent advances in various omics approaches applied specifically to investigate peanut responses and tolerance to biotic stresses. We will discuss how genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, miRNAomics, epigenomics, and phenomics have contributed towards identifying genes involved in response pathways for various pathogens or pest stressors. Additionally, we will explore integration strategies for these omics technologies that have proven successful in elucidating temporal and spatial changes that occur during peanut defense responses.
This comprehensive review will also discuss the challenges faced by researchers when employing omics technologies in studying peanut response to biotic stresses. Furthermore, it will provide insights into future directions for improving our understanding of peanut's resistance/tolerance mechanisms using omics approaches.
Ultimately, by unraveling the complex networks involved in peanut's response to biotic stresses through integrative omics approaches such as genomics and transcriptomics among others , we hope to enhance sustainable food production by developing peanuts with enhanced resistance or tolerance traits against diverse pathogenic diseases and pests. These advancements are critical as they align with global efforts aimed at meeting future food demands for a rapidly growing population while reducing dependence on chemical interventions that may harm human health or the environment. 
Title: The Impact of Wnt/β-catenin Signaling Inhibition on HPV-Induced Cervical Cancer Progression: A Novel Approach for Immunotherapy
Abstract:
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially with HPV-16 and HPV-18, is a significant etiological factor in the development of cervical cancer. The expression of viral oncoproteins encoded by HPV promotes the early stages and transformation of normal cells into malignant counterparts. This process involves disruption in tumor cell recognition by immune cells, including T lymphocytes and dendritic cells, mediated by the upregulation of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the surface of transformed cells. Furthermore, exhausted tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T lymphocytes with increased PD-1 and CD39 levels contribute to this evasion mechanism through cytokine release. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been identified as a crucial modulator driving tumor progression by regulating gene expression associated with tumorigenic markers.
Introduction:
Cervical cancer remains a substantial public health burden worldwide, accounting for over half a million new cases and an estimated quarter-million deaths annually (Bray et al., 2018). Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), primarily types 16 and 18, plays a pivotal role in its pathogenesis (Walboomers et al., 1999). While preventive vaccination strategies have shown promise in reducing HR-HPV-related cervical abnormalities among young women globally (Kreimer et al., 2020), there remains an urgent need to advance therapeutic interventions for already infected individuals.
The immune system constitutes one line of defense against oncogenic transformation; however, HR-HPV employs various mechanisms to evade immunosurveillance while establishing persistent infection. Viral-induced lesions often elude eradication due to weak or ineffective antitumor immune responses, subsequently progressing to invasive malignancies. The emerging field of cancer immunotherapy has opened new avenues for therapeutics by exploiting and enhancing the host's immune response against tumor cells (Galon and Bruni, 2019). Navigating these immunological checkpoints has shown great potential in improving outcomes for various malignancies.
Recent studies have elucidated the intricate interplay between HR-HPV oncoproteins and immune evasion mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This research has highlighted the relevance of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand PD-L1 in attenuating T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Upon binding to PD-1, PD-L1 dampens effector T-cell function, leading to immune suppression and progressive tumor growth (Pardoll, 2012). Notably, increased expression of PD-L1 on HR-HPV-positive cervical cancer cells correlates with worsened clinical outcomes (Heeren et al., 2015).
Conversely, aberrant activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a hallmark feature observed across multiple cancers, including cervical cancer. Dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling confers self-renewal capacity and malignant transformation potential upon normal stem cells or progenitor cells in HPV-infected cervical tissue (Manoso et al., 2020; Tambuwala et al., 2020). Activation of this pathway upregulates tumorigenic markers such as c-MYC (Zhao et al., 2020), while promoting evasion from immune surveillance through altered interactions between tumor cells and infiltrating lymphocytes.
Given the critical roles played by both HR-HPV-induced PD-L1 expression on transformed cervical epithelial cells and dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling during tumorigenic progression, exploring their intricate connection becomes a research imperative. However, comprehensive investigations examining the impact of Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibition on PD-L1 expression to enhance immunotherapeutic approaches in the context of HPV-induced malignancies remain limited.
The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the relationship between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and PD-L1 expression in HR-HPV-positive cervical cancer. Consequently, we aim to investigate how targeted Wnt/β-catenin pathway blockade influences PD-L1 regulation, immune evasion, and malignant progression. By evaluating these mechanisms, we anticipate providing important insights into potential novel therapeutic strategies for HR-HPV-related cervical carcinoma using small molecular inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies against key components within this pathway.
In conclusion, an improved understanding of the intricate interplay between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and HPV-induced immune evasion mechanisms driving cervical carcinogenesis holds immense promise for revolutionary immunotherapeutic interventions. The outcome of our study will contribute significantly towards an integrated approach utilizing targeted inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling as an adjunctive strategy with existing immunotherapies in combating HR-HPV-induced cervical cancer progression. 
Introduction
Depression among youth is a significant public health concern, characterized by high prevalence and distressing consequences. Despite the increasing recognition of this issue, limited progress has been made in advancing our understanding of depression's features or developing effective interventions to address its growing prevalence. This has prompted the need for novel research questions that can shed light on unexplored aspects and enhance our knowledge base regarding youth depression.
The current study aims to investigate the impact of social media use on depression among adolescents and young adults. In recent years, social media platforms have gained immense popularity, serving as crucial tools for communication and information dissemination. However, concerns have been raised regarding their potential negative influence on mental health outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations such as youths. Understanding the relationship between social media use and depression is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate its adverse effects.
Adolescence marks a critical period wherein individuals experience significant physical, emotional, and social changes. It is during this developmental stage that they are most susceptible to various psychosocial stressors that may contribute to depressive symptoms. The pervasive use of social media platforms among young people amplifies these stressors by exposing them to unrealistic standards of beauty, constant peer comparisons, cyberbullying experiences, and reduced face-to-face interactions – factors known to contribute significantly to mental health difficulties.
While previous research has explored the association between social media use and mental health outcomes in general populations or adults separately, there remains a paucity of studies specifically examining this relationship among youth populations. Therefore,the present study aims not only to fill this gap but also expand upon existing literature by exploring unique aspects related explicitly to depression.
To better comprehend the interplay between social media usage patterns—such as frequency of use,dimensions (e.g., active posting versus passive consumption),and duration—and depressive symptoms among youths,a mixed-methods approach will be employed.Such an approach will encompass both quantitative survey data collection assessing participants' demographic characteristics,social media usage patterns, and depression levels, in addition to qualitative interviews that will capture participants' subjective experiences and perceptions.
In line with previous research on mental health among adolescents, it is hypothesized that increased social media use will be positively correlated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the investigation of nuanced dimensions of social media usage may provide insights into specific facets that amplify or mitigate the risk for depression.
Understanding how social media affects youth mental health is imperative for developing effective interventions to mitigate its detrimental effects. By identifying the underlying mechanisms linking social media use and depression, this study can contribute to formulating evidence-based strategies aimed at promoting healthy online behavior and reducing depressive symptoms among adolescents and young adults.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a comprehensive review of relevant literature surrounding youth depression, focusing on current theories explaining its etiology.

Title: Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Community Health in the Arctic Region
Abstract:
The discourse on vulnerability to COVID-19 or any other pandemic has traditionally focused on susceptibility to disease outbreaks. This approach typically relies on the assessment of vulnerability using universal indicators, without fully considering the unique socioeconomic, cultural, and demographic characteristics of specific communities. As a result, this method may underestimate Arctic communities' capacity to withstand and recover from pandemic exposure. A more comprehensive understanding of vulnerability and resilience is essential for accurate assessment and effective response planning.
Previous studies have recognized vulnerability as a dynamic concept influenced by multiple dimensions. However, limited research has explored how community resilience can influence overall vulnerability during pandemics or other health crises in remote regions with large Indigenous populations. Understanding these interrelated dimensions offers valuable insight into identifying which populations are at greatest risk or in need of specific interventions.
The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel approach that incorporates both vulnerability and resilience as distinct but interrelated dimensions when assessing the potential impact of climate change-related health risks on remote Arctic communities. Specifically, we focus on addressing the research question: "What is the relationship between environmental changes induced by climate change and their impact on community health in the Arctic?"
The rapidly changing climate poses significant challenges for fragile ecosystems and vulnerable communities worldwide. In particular, Arctic regions are experiencing accelerated warming that leads to various ecological shifts such as declining sea ice coverage, permafrost thawing, changes in wildlife migration patterns, alterations to traditional subsistence practices among Indigenous peoples living in these regions.
These environmental changes directly affect community health through additional stressors such as increased exposure to contaminants (e.g., pollutants released from melting sea ice), altered food security resulting from disrupted subsistence hunting and fishing activities due to changing animal habitats or reduced availability of traditional food sources.
Understanding how these environmental shifts interact with societal factors within different contexts is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies tailored specifically for Arctic communities facing the multi-dimensional challenges posed by climate change-related health risks. By integrating vulnerability and resilience into our assessment framework, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how Arctic communities can cope with and adapt to such challenges.
To operationalize this new approach, we present a case study focused on the state of Alaska's Arctic communities. Drawing from existing data sources, including census data and health records, we develop a pandemic vulnerability-resilience framework that incorporates community-level risk factors associated with COVID-19 or future pandemics' epidemiological outcomes.
Through an integrated analysis combining vulnerability and resilience indices, our study reveals variations in disease severity across highly vulnerable census areas and boroughs within Alaska. Notably, areas displaying higher levels of resilience have demonstrated lower cumulative death rates per 100 000 population and case fatality ratios. This finding highlights the importance of considering both vulnerability and resilience when planning for public health emergencies.
The insights gained from incorporating these dual dimensions could facilitate accurate identification of populations or communities at high risk or requiring specific support during pre-pandemic preparation as well as during an evolving crisis. Our proposed resilience-vulnerability-focused approach has broader implications as it can be applied to assess potential impacts of COVID-19 or similar future health crises in other remote regions worldwide characterized by large Indigenous populations.
Overall, this research contributes to bridging important gaps in current literature around assessing complex social-ecological systems' adaptive capacity in the face of climate change-related health risks. Our hope is that this integrated approach will inform policymakers, public officials, and concerned parties about effective allocation strategies for resources and services crucial for enhancing community resilience in Arctic regions worldwide facing similar environmental challenges induced by various climate-related hazards.

Furthermore, our findings may shed light on methodological factors critical for designing future studies aimed at evaluating novel therapeutic approaches introduced near or at the end-of-life phase. Standardization in research design would facilitate direct comparisons between studies alongside a better understanding of relative treatment benefits and risks associated with different regimens across diverse cancer populations.
Overall, through this comprehensive exploration into emerging therapeutic interventions employed during anticancer drug use at the end-of-life stage, we aim to contribute valuable insights toward optimizing patient care strategies while considering individualized preferences, safety profiles, treatment efficacy, cost-effectiveness considerations as well as ethical implications surrounding resource allocation within healthcare systems.
 
Title: The Effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions on Migraine Symptoms: An Evidence-Based Review
Abstract:
This article provides an evidence-based review exploring the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on migraine symptoms. Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent headache attacks that can be debilitating, impacting individuals' quality of life and productivity. Pharmacological approaches are often utilized to manage migraine; however, they may have limitations and potential adverse effects. As such, there is a need to identify non-pharmacological interventions that can complement or serve as an alternative to traditional treatments.
1. Introduction
Migraine affects approximately 12% of the global population and is more prevalent in women than men (1). It is characterized by moderate-to-severe headaches accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and in some cases, aura (2). The management of migraine traditionally involves pharmacotherapy with medications such as triptans or preventive agents like beta-blockers or antiepileptic drugs (3). While these medications are effective for many individuals, some patients may experience side effects or limited response to treatment.
In recent years, there has been growing interest in non-pharmacological approaches for the management of migraine. Mindfulness-based interventions have gained attention due to their potential efficacy in reducing pain intensity and frequency while improving overall well-being (4). Mindfulness involves intentionally paying attention to present moment experiences with an attitude of acceptance and non-judgment (5). This practice cultivates self-awareness while promoting emotional regulation and stress reduction.
Studies have shown promising results regarding mindfulness-based interventions' effectiveness in various chronic pain conditions but limited research specifically focuses on their impact on migraines (6). Thus, the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review exploring the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on migraine symptom severity reduction.
Mindfulness may influence multiple facets underlying migraines' pathophysiology. Chronic stress has been implicated as a trigger factor and exacerbating factor for migraines (7). Mindfulness practice can modulate the stress response, reducing sympathetic arousal and promoting parasympathetic activation (8). Additionally, mindfulness-based interventions target cognitive and emotional dimensions, which are often altered in individuals with migraines (9).
The methodology used to conduct this evidence-based review adhered to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) guidelines (10). A systematic literature search was conducted in several electronic databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Relevant studies exploring the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on migraine symptoms in adults were included.
The evaluation of study quality followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Each study's evidence quality was assessed based on design limitations, sample size considerations, consistency of results across studies, effect sizes reported or estimable from available data sources.
The expected outcomes of this review include an overview of existing research investigating the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing migraine symptom severity. Additionally,it will explore potential mechanisms underlying these effects while discussing recommendations for future research.
In conclusion,the findings from this comprehensive review could have significant clinical implications by providing healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations regarding integrating mindfulness-based interventions into standard migraine management protocols. By expanding our understanding beyond pharmacological treatments alone,this research aims to contribute insights into the diverse treatment options available to improve overall patient outcomes.
 
Introduction
The gut microbiome, a complex community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, plays a crucial role in maintaining human health. It is involved in various physiological processes, including digestion, metabolism, immune modulation, and protection against pathogens (1). Disturbances in the gut microbiome have been associated with numerous chronic diseases such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mental health disorders (2-4).
Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that regulates calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Beyond its classical role in musculoskeletal health, emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D also influences immune function and modulates the gut microbiota composition. The link between vitamin D status and the gut microbiome has primarily been explored through observational studies with inconsistent findings.
Preliminary research has suggested that vitamin D supplementation may affect the diversity and abundance of microbial communities within the gut. However, these findings have yet to be validated by well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Previous studies investigating this relationship have yielded conflicting results due to limitations such as small sample sizes or inadequate control groups.
To address these gaps in knowledge regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the gut microbiome composition, we conducted a comprehensive RCT known as the Gut-Vita Trial. This study aimed to investigate whether daily high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation alters the diversity and abundance of microbial populations within the human gastrointestinal tract.
2. Methods
2.1 Study Design
The Gut-Vita Trial was a multicenter randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate whether long-term high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation affects various aspects of human health including immune function and cardiovascular outcomes. The trial adhered to CONSORT guidelines for conducting RCTs (5).
2.2 Participants
A total of 1,000 older Australians aged 65-80 years were recruited from diverse geographical locations using targeted community outreach campaigns between August 20XX and November 20XX. Participants were required to meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) age 65-80 years, (2) no history of severe chronic illness (e.g., cancer, liver or kidney disease), and (3) not taking long-term medications known to influence vitamin D metabolism or gut microbiota. Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of [Institution name], and all participants provided written informed consent.
2.3 Randomization and Intervention
Following baseline assessments, eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation or placebo for a duration of two years. The intervention group received a daily dose of 2000 IU vitamin D3, while the control group received an identical-looking placebo capsule. Allocation concealment was maintained through computer-generated randomization codes provided by an independent statistician.
To ensure blinding, both study investigators and participants were unaware of treatment assignment throughout the trial period. Compliance with capsule ingestion was monitored using a medication log completed by participants who recorded tablet consumption on a daily basis.
2.4 Assessment of Gut Microbiome Composition
Stool samples were collected from each participant at baseline, after one year, and at trial completion using sterile collection kits that included instructions for proper sample storage until retrieval by trained research personnel. DNA extraction was performed using established protocols followed by amplification of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene.
Sequencing library preparation employed Illumina MiSeq technology with paired-end reads for high-throughput sequencing analysis per standard operating procedures developed specifically for this trial cohort.
2.5 Statistical Analysis
Exploratory analysis included characterization of alpha diversity indices such as Shannon index (primary outcome), richness, inverse Simpson index generated through QIIME software package version X.X.XX based on OTU profiling data matrices exported from QIIME output files.
Differences in alpha diversity and the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa between intervention groups were assessed using linear regression models, adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), dietary intake, and physical activity levels.
3. Expected Results
Based on preliminary evidence from observational studies and the potential immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D, we hypothesize that participants receiving high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation will demonstrate a more diverse gut microbiome compared to those in the placebo group. Additionally, we anticipate observing alterations in the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa associated with immune regulation and metabolic processes.
By elucidating the impact of high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation on gut microbial composition, this study aims to provide novel insights into the role of this essential nutrient in modulating host-microbe interactions within the gastrointestinal tract. The findings from this trial may have implications for personalized nutrition strategies aimed at optimizing gut health and preventing chronic diseases related to dysbiosis.

Introduction:
Lung cancer remains a major global health concern, with its incidence continuing to rise year by year. As the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, lung cancer accounts for a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide (Bray et al., 2018). Traditional treatment strategies for lung cancer have primarily involved open thoracotomy procedures, which are associated with significant postoperative pain and longer recovery times (Pettiford et al., 2007). In recent years, advancements in technology and surgical techniques have led to the increasing adoption of minimally invasive approaches such as thoracoscopy for lung cancer resection.
Thoracoscopy has proven to be effective in removing tumors while minimizing surgical trauma and hastening patient recovery compared to open thoracotomy (Paul et al., 2010). However, even with these benefits, lung cancer patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery still experience varying degrees of stress that affect their overall well-being and impair postoperative recovery. Therefore, it is imperative to explore innovative strategies aimed at enhancing postoperative nursing care for patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery.
The concept of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), also known as rapid rehabilitation or fast-track surgery, has gained popularity over the past two decades. ERAS protocols encompass a multidisciplinary approach involving preoperative optimization, intraoperative techniques to minimize surgical stress response, and standardized postoperative care. The central aim of ERAS is accelerating patient recovery by reducing complications and hospital length of stay without compromising clinical outcomes (Varadhan et al., 2010).
While there is extensive literature on ERAS protocols following open thoracic surgeries or multi-hole thoracoscopic approaches in lung cancer resections, research specific to rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery is limited. Single-port thoracoscopy offers distinct advantages over multi-hole approaches due to its reliance on only one incision point; however, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding postoperative nursing interventions tailored to the unique needs of these patients.
Therefore, the objective of this paper is to review the research progress on rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. By synthesizing existing evidence and identifying gaps in knowledge, this review aims to provide key insights into optimizing postoperative care for lung cancer patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery. The findings from this study will contribute to advancing our understanding of how specific nursing interventions can be tailored to enhance patient recovery after single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.
Ultimately, our goal is not only to improve patient outcomes but also to maximize healthcare resource utilization by reducing length of hospital stay and associated costs. As single-port thoracoscopic surgery becomes increasingly prevalent, it is crucial that we establish evidence-based guidelines for rapid rehabilitation nursing specific to this surgical approach. Such guidelines will ensure standardized care delivery and enable healthcare professionals worldwide to optimize postoperative outcomes for lung cancer patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery.
In conclusion, by embracing the principles of ERAS, there is an opportunity for significant improvements in postoperative care following single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. This review article will provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing research on rapid rehabilitation nursing in this context and highlight areas that warrant further investigation. It is hoped that the findings from this study will serve as a catalyst for future studies aimed at refining and expanding our understanding of effective nursing interventions within the framework of ERAS protocols for single-port thoracoscopy in lung cancer resections.

Title: Evaluating the Impact of Tumor-Associated Gut Microbiota on Cancer Progression and Therapeutic Response
Abstract:
Microorganisms within tumor specimens have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential role in cancer development and treatment response. However, the majority of research has focused on the tumor-associated microbiota found within the tumor microenvironment itself, neglecting a potentially influential factor – the tumor-associated gut microbiota. The purpose of this study is to investigate how alterations in gut microbial composition may influence cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes.
1. Introduction
Cancer remains one of the most pressing global challenges, accounting for millions of deaths each year (Bray et al., 2018). Traditional theories attributed cancer initiation and progression solely to genetic alterations within malignant cells. However, recent advancements have highlighted an intricate interplay between a host's physiology, lifestyle factors, and microbial communities residing both within healthy tissues as well as within tumors themselves (Hannigan et al., 2018). These discoveries have led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of tumorigenesis by acknowledging that cancers are not solely driven by autonomous oncogenic events but are also influenced by complex interactions with surrounding cells, extracellular matrix components, immune system mediators, and diverse microorganisms (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018).
While much emphasis has been given to investigating bacterial communities inhabiting various anatomical sites adjacent to tumors or incorporated into their proximity via vasculature or lymphatics (Costello et al., 2020), including those present in lung carcinomas (Greathouse et al., 2020) or breast cancers (Xuan et al., 2021), comparatively less attention has been devoted towards exploring correlations between distant microbial niches such as the gastrointestinal tract - home to an extensive array of commensal microflora - and tumorigenesis.
Recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota, comprising complex microbial populations adapted to this niche, play a crucial role in modulating host immune system function and metabolism (Lee and Lee, 2020). Moreover, the gut microbiota is known to influence various systemic processes through the production of small molecules that can be absorbed into circulation and subsequently exert effects on peripheral tissues (Thaiss et al., 2016). This communication between gut microbes and distant organs raises exciting prospects for studying the potential impact of tumor-associated gut microbiota on cancer progression.
Emerging studies have demonstrated associations between alterations in the abundance and composition of gut microbiota with both cancer incidence and therapeutic efficacy. Manipulation of gut microbial communities has been shown to influence tumor development in preclinical settings by modulating host immune responses through increased production of immunosuppressive factors or altered infiltration by immune cells (Sethi et al., 2018).
Furthermore, recent clinical investigations have revealed intriguing correlations between distinct bacterial taxa residing within the gastrointestinal tract and responses to cancer therapies such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy. These studies suggest that specific microbial signatures could potentially serve as predictive biomarkers for therapeutic outcomes while providing an opportunity for personalized interventions targeting tumor-associated gut microbiota.
Nevertheless, despite these promising findings, many questions remain unanswered. The complexity inherent within human tumors presents significant challenges associated with isolating putative true effects caused by specific microbial communities from confounding variables including individual variability across patients (Schwabe and Jobin, 2013). Consequently, future research should aim at understanding which specific microorganisms are correlated with disease progression or treatment response across different cancer types while considering other influential factors such as host genetic background, geography, diet patterns or antimicrobial usage.
This study seeks to take a step forward from previous investigations by comprehensively exploring how alterations in tumor-associated gut microbiota correlate with cancer progression at various stages across multiple malignancies. Additionally, we aim to elucidate whether modifying these bacterial populations can enhance therapeutic response. Through this research, we hope to provide insights into the role of gut microbial communities in shaping cancer outcomes and offer novel avenues for developing efficacious therapeutic strategies personalized to individual patients' specific gut microbiome profiles. Understanding the tumor-associated gut microbiota's impact on cancer progression and treatment response may represent a critical leap forward in improving patient outcomes and expanding our understanding of complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment.

Title: The Intracellular Transport of cGAMP and Its Implications in Cellular Signaling
Abstract:
2’3’-cGAMP is a crucial molecule in the cGAS-STING pathway, serving as a second messenger to activate STING and induce immune responses against infection, cancer, or cellular stress. Traditionally, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) were believed to signal the production of interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines solely within the cell where sensing occurred. Recent studies have challenged this viewpoint by revealing multiple transport mechanisms that allow 2’3’-cGAMP to travel from cell to cell independently of DNA sensing by cGAS. This paradigm shift has significant implications for understanding immune responses against microbial invaders and cancer, as well as for developing therapeutics targeting the dysregulated processes associated with the cGAS-STING pathway.
1. Introduction:
The innate immune system is responsible for recognizing molecular patterns associated with pathogenic microbes or cellular damage and initiating appropriate defense responses (Takeuchi & Akira, 2010). Cells possess diverse pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can recognize these pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Kawai & Akira, 2006). Upon PRR activation, downstream signaling cascades are triggered to elicit various antimicrobial or inflammatory responses necessary for eliminating pathogens and maintaining tissue homeostasis.
One such important PRR involved in innate immunity is cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which recognizes cytosolic dsDNA derived from both pathogens and host cells experiencing genomic stress signals (Sun et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019). Once activated upon binding to dsDNA motifs in a sequence-independent manner through its DNA-binding domain, cGAS undergoes conformational changes leading to its enzymatic activity converting ATP and GTP into cyclic dinucleotide, 2’3’-cGAMP (Sun et al., 2013). Subsequently, 2’3’-cGAMP acts as a second messenger that binds to and activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Ishikawa & Barber, 2008; Wu et al., 2013).
Upon activation, STING recruits and activates downstream signaling molecules such as TBK1 and IRF3 to initiate type-I interferon (IFN) production and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression through the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway (Burke et al., 2019; Kondo et al., 2017). These cytokines play crucial roles in mediating antiviral responses, tumor immunosurveillance, immune cell recruitment, and modulating adaptive immunity against microbial invaders or transformed host cells.
Conventional dogma assumed that PRR signaling occurred within the same cell where detection of pathogens or danger signals took place. It was thought that locally produced type-I IFNs would induce an autocrine response within that cell while also acting in a paracrine manner on surrounding cells to induce similar defense mechanisms. However, recent studies have challenged this classical view by identifying unconventional mechanisms through which cGAS-generated second messenger molecule 2'3'-cGAMP can traffic from its production site to neighboring cells without relying on direct DNA sensing by cGAS.
This discovery has brought about paradigm-shifting implications for understanding how intercellular communication potentiates immune responses against microbial infection and cancer development. Moreover, dysregulation of the cGAS-STING pathway has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases where antagonists targeting this pathway remain elusive. Harnessing our evolving knowledge regarding intercellular transport mechanisms could potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies in the context of cancer immunotherapies, vaccine design, and the treatment of cGAS-STING pathway-associated diseases.
In this review article, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements made in elucidating the mechanisms by which 2’3’-cGAMP can be transported between cells. Furthermore, we will highlight its significance in immune responses against microbial invasion and cancer development while delving into how this paradigmatic shift could inform novel therapeutic approaches for combating inflammatory diseases associated with dysregulated cGAS-STING signaling.

Investigating the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on tumor metastasis and the role of cadherin switching in advanced prostate cancer: A comprehensive overview
1. Introduction
Prostate cancer remains one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies among males worldwide, with increasing prevalence observed in both developed and developing countries. For over 80 years, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a standard treatment approach for advanced prostate cancer. ADT primarily aims to reduce circulating levels of androgens, such as testosterone, to inhibit the activation of androgen signaling pathways. This therapeutic strategy initially shows promising outcomes; however, subsets of cells within tumors eventually become resistant to ADT, leading to disease progression characterized by metastatic dissemination.
Emerging evidence suggests that ADT may induce a phenomenon termed "cadherin switching" in prostate cancer cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cadherins are transmembrane glycoproteins crucial for maintaining cellular adhesion within epithelial tissues. In this molecular process known as cadherin switching, there is a transition from E-cadherin expression towards N-cadherin expression.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is vital for elucidating its involvement in driving tumor progression during ADT treatment. Recent studies have shown that cadherin switching plays a significant role in promoting invasive behavior among tumor cells that have acquired resistance to hormone therapies such as ADT. Consequently, these altered cellular characteristics contribute to increased migration potential and subsequent metastasis formation.
Despite several studies identifying associations between cadherin switching-mediated EMT transitions and therapeutic resistance mechanisms, many aspects remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap hampers our ability to develop targeted interventions aimed at preventing or reversing these changes effectively.
In this study, we present a comprehensive overview focusing on how ADT affects cadherin expression profiles during advanced prostate cancer progression with an emphasis on the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially those regulated through the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. We aim to dissect the intricate relationship between ADT, cadherin switching, and EMT, highlighting their contributions to disease progression and therapeutic resistance.
To achieve these objectives, we will review a collection of relevant literature encompassing both in vitro and in vivo studies. Furthermore, we will explore existing clinical data sets from patients undergoing ADT as well as preclinical models that mimic hormone therapy regimens used in human prostate cancer treatment. By amalgamating evidence from across these multiple experimental systems, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis and functional consequences of cadherin switching during advanced prostate cancer progression under ADT conditions.
Ultimately, our findings may aid in identifying novel therapeutic targets directed towards reversing or preventing cadherin switching-mediated EMT transitions. Developing strategies aimed at mitigating this phenotypic alteration could enhance current treatment approaches for advanced prostate cancer and have significant implications for patients experiencing therapy resistance. 2. Significance of the research question
Investigating the impact of ADT on tumor metastasis and comprehending the role of cadherin switching in advanced prostate cancer is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, understanding the molecular mechanisms driving resistance acquisition during ADT treatment is essential for improving patient outcomes. Despite initial positive responses, a significant proportion of patients eventually develop resistance to ADT, leading to disease progression and poorer prognosis. Identifying cellular alterations associated with therapy resistance will aid in developing more effective approaches to prevent or overcome these challenges.
Secondly, characterizing the mechanisms underlying cadherin switching-mediated EMT transitions will provide valuable insights into how prostate cancer cells acquire invasive properties that promote metastasis formation. As metastatic disease contributes significantly to mortality rates among prostate cancer patients, uncovering the factors driving this process could potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or delaying metastatic spread.
Thirdly, elucidating key molecular pathways involved in cadherin switching during ADT may present opportunities for targeted interventions. By identifying critical transcriptional factors regulated through the TGF-β pathway or other signaling cascades connected with this phenotypic alteration, specific pharmacological agents could be developed to inhibit or reverse these changes in tumor cells resistant to hormonal therapies.
Lastly, by integrating data from both preclinical models and clinical cohorts of patients undergoing ADT treatment for advanced prostate cancer, we aim to bridge translational gaps and improve our understanding of how findings observed in experimental systems relate to human disease biology. This comprehensive approach will enable us to extract clinically relevant information that can guide future investigations towards personalized therapeutic interventions.
3. Objectives of the study
The primary objective of this study is twofold: (1) To evaluate how ADT modulates cadherin expression profiles during advanced prostate cancer progression with an emphasis on exploring differences between nuanced stages within therapy-resistant tumors; (2) To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying cadherin switching, focusing on transcriptional factors regulated through the TGF-β signaling pathway.
To achieve these objectives, we will pursue a systematic analysis of relevant published literature, encompassing cell line and animal models as well as data from clinical cohorts. By employing diverse experimental approaches and integrating findings across different stages of prostate cancer progression under ADT conditions, we aim to provide a comprehensive molecular perspective on cadherin switching-mediated EMT transitions.
4. Conclusion
This study aims to shed light on the intricate relationship between ADT, cadherin switching, and EMT in advanced prostate cancer. By comprehensively reviewing existing evidence and investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon, we hope to uncover novel insights that can inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or reversing therapy resistance associated with cadherin switching during ADT treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Ultimately, our findings may lead to advancements in patient care by offering new targets for therapeutic intervention and improving outcomes for those affected by this disease. 
1. Introduction
In recent years, the field of education has undergone significant transformations due to advancements in technology and changing pedagogical approaches. One prominent shift in instructional methods is the integration of blended learning approaches, which combine traditional face-to-face instruction with online learning activities. Blended learning has gained recognition for its potential to enhance student engagement, collaboration, and self-directed learning.
While much research has focused on the effectiveness of blended learning in improving student outcomes such as academic performance and satisfaction, there is a growing need to explore its impact on higher-order cognitive skills. Among these skills, critical thinking stands out as a fundamental competency necessary for individuals to navigate a complex and rapidly evolving world.
Critical thinking refers to the ability to analyze information objectively, evaluate evidence meticulously, and make reasoned judgments based on logical reasoning (Ennis, 1987). It is essential not only for academic success but also for lifelong learning and effective decision making in various professional fields (Paul & Elder, 2006). Recognizing critical thinking as a crucial skill within higher education institutions is imperative in preparing students for the challenges they will face upon graduation.
Therefore, this paper proposes an exploration of how blended learning approaches influence university students' critical thinking abilities. Specifically, we aim to investigate the effects of blended learning methodologies on different aspects of critical thinking skills and dispositions among university students. By examining various subcategories within blended learning – namely the flex model,
the self-blended model,
the enriched virtual model,
and the rotation model – we seek to provide insights into how each approach contributes uniquely towards fostering critical thinking.
To conduct this investigation effectively, a systematic review methodology will be utilized. A comprehensive search strategy will be employed using well-established search engines and databases such as PubMed and ERIC (Education Resources Information Center) databases to ensure inclusivity of relevant literature within our study's scope.
By synthesizing existing empirical studies that examine the relationship between blended learning strategies implementation and critical thinking, this research aims to contribute to the current body of knowledge and inform educators and instructional designers about the potential benefits of incorporating blended learning into their teaching practices. Moreover, the findings from this study will help educational policymakers make informed decisions about integrating technology-enhanced instructional approaches like blended learning at the institutional level.
Ultimately, understanding how blended learning influences critical thinking skills and dispositions among university students has the potential to shape pedagogical strategies that align with contemporary educational objectives. By leveraging both face-to-face instruction and online platforms effectively, educators can promote an active and reflective learning environment that cultivates critical thinking competencies, empowering students with essential skills for lifelong success in an increasingly complex world.
In summary, this paper aims to explore the effects of blended learning on university students' critical thinking skills and dispositions through a systematic review methodology. By examining various subcategories within blended learning approaches, we seek to provide evidence-based insights on how these methodologies contribute towards fostering critical thinking among higher education students. 2. Methodological advancements in education have paved the way for innovative instructional practices that go beyond traditional lecture-based approaches. Blended learning, which integrates face-to-face instruction with online learning components, has emerged as a promising pedagogical strategy that offers flexibility and personalized learning experiences (Garrison & Kanuka, 2004). 
While there is a growing body of research on the effectiveness of blended learning in improving student outcomes such as academic achievement and course completion rates (Graham et al., 2013; Means et al., 2013), limited attention has been given to its impact on higher-order cognitive skills such as critical thinking. To address this research gap, our study seeks to explore the effects of blended learning on university students' critical thinking abilities.
Critical thinking is widely recognized as a vital skill for individuals navigating complex issues and making informed decisions in various contexts (Halpern, 1998; Paul & Elder, 2006). Within the realm of higher education, cultivating critical thinking skills is essential for equipping students with the capacity to analyze information critically, evaluate evidence objectively, and engage in reasoned inquiry (Ennis, 1987).
Drawing upon previous studies demonstrating positive linkages between technology-enhanced instructional approaches and critical thinking development (Chen et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020), our study will employ a systematic review methodology to synthesize existing literature on blended learning interventions and their influence on university students' critical thinking skills.
To ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant studies within our scope, we will conduct an exhaustive search across multiple scholarly databases including PubMed and ERIC. The search terms used will encompass key constructs related to both blended learning methodologies – such as the flex model,

Introduction
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection continues to be a major public health concern worldwide, with approximately 257 million individuals living with chronic HBV infection and around 887,000 deaths occurring annually as a result of its sequelae (1). The burden of HBV infection is particularly high in low- and middle-income countries, including India. India has been identified as an intermediate HBV endemic country, with an estimated prevalence of chronic HBV infection ranging from 2% to 8% (2).
While the prevalence of viral hepatitis in India has been extensively studied, there still remains a gap in our understanding of the specific risk factors associated with HBV transmission within the Indian context. Previous studies have identified various modes of transmission such as vertical transmission from mother to child during childbirth, horizontal transmission through unsafe healthcare practices and procedures, injection drug use, and sexual contact (3). However, there is limited data on the relative contribution of these risk factors to HBV transmission in India.
Given the significant burden of viral hepatitis in India and the paucity of comprehensive studies on risk factors for HBV transmission within this population, it is essential to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis specifically focusing on identifying the epidemiological determinants associated with increased risk of acquiring chronic hepatitis B infection in this setting.
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence rate for chronic HBV infection among different population groups within India by conducting a systematic search and meta-analysis. We will aim to identify both individual-level determinants such as age group and sex as well as contextual determinants such as geographical region that may be associated with increased risk.
To achieve this objective, we will systematically search electronic databases including PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection and Global Health Library for relevant articles published between January 2000 and December 2020. The search strategy will include Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords related to "hepatitis B virus", "prevalence", "epidemiology" and "India". Non-English language articles will be included, provided an English translation is available.
The identified studies will then be screened for eligibility based on predefined inclusion criteria. Studies reporting the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in India, either at a national or regional level, among any population group will be included. Data extraction will include information on study characteristics, participant demographics, sample size, diagnostic methods used for HBV detection, and prevalence rates. Quality assessment of the included studies will be conducted using appropriate tools such as the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
The extracted data from eligible studies will be synthesized using random-effects meta-analysis models to estimate the pooled prevalence rates of chronic HBV infection. Subgroup analyses by age group, sex, geographical region within India, socio-economic status and other relevant factors will also be conducted if sufficient data are available.
This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide a better understanding of the epidemiological determinants associated with chronic HBV infection in India. The findings from this study could inform targeted prevention strategies and allocation of resources for screening programs aimed at reducing the burden of hepatitis B virus infection in this high-prevalence setting.

Nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors are an emerging technology with wide-ranging applications in the field of optical sensing. These sensors have demonstrated excellent sensitivity to even slight changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium, making them highly desirable for various applications such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and food safety.
However, a major challenge in developing highly efficient surface plasmon resonance sensors lies in overcoming the high optical losses inherent to metallic materials. These losses result in broad linewidths of the resonance spectra, which significantly limit the overall performance and sensitivity of these sensors. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore novel strategies that can effectively reduce the linewidths and enhance the performance of surface plasmon resonance sensors.
This paper aims to address this critical issue by investigating approaches to achieve narrow linewidths in nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors. Firstly, it is essential to understand the factors influencing plasmon linewidths in metallic nanostructures. By comprehensively studying these factors, valuable insights can be gained into designing innovative structures that exhibit enhanced sensitivity and spectral selectivity.
Various techniques have been explored for achieving narrow resonance linewidths in nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors. One such approach involves fabricating sensor platforms that support additional resonant effects such as surface lattice resonances or plasmonic Fano resonances. This enables fine-tuning of the sensor response by altering structural parameters or introducing specific coupling conditions.
Another promising avenue is leveraging photonic cavities combined with nanostructured surfaces to achieve enhanced light-matter interactions and narrower spectral features. The preparation of ultra-narrow resonators can also contribute significantly towards reducing linewidths by exploiting unique fabrication techniques that enhance confinement effects at subwavelength scales.
In addition to these strategies, several other methodologies have been developed to optimize sensor performance while addressing spectroscopic limitations associated with broad linewidths. For instance, platform-induced modifications involving topology engineering or material functionalization offer effective means for linewidth reduction. By introducing alternating dielectric layers with tailored refractive indices, additional opportunities for resonant coupling and enhancement arise, leading to narrower resonance spectra.
Furthermore, the coupling of nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors with whispering-gallery-modes has shown promise in achieving narrow linewidths and enhancing sensitivity. Whispering-gallery-modes provide a pathway to achieve strong light confinement within dielectric micro/nanocavities, enabling unprecedented control over the resonant behavior of these systems.
Despite the remarkable progress made in narrowing linewidths and improving sensor performance, challenges still exist concerning material compatibility, fabrication techniques scalability, cost-effectiveness, and long-term stability. Therefore, this paper will discuss these existing challenges and outline potential strategies for overcoming them.
In conclusion, this paper aims to provide comprehensive guidance for researchers working towards the further development of nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors. By examining key factors influencing plasmon linewidths and summarizing various approaches to achieve narrow spectral features through platform design modification or integration with other optical components such as photonic cavities or whispering-gallery-mode resonators, this research seeks to contribute towards advancing the field's understanding and utilization of these sensors in practical applications. Furthermore, this paper will introduce a novel research question and propose potential avenues for future investigation. Specifically, the research question aims to explore the synergistic effect between surface plasmon resonance sensors and advanced nanomaterials. The integration of nanostructured materials with surface plasmon resonance sensors has the potential to revolutionize their performance by exploiting unique optical properties at the nanoscale.
Nanomaterials such as nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanocomposites exhibit fascinating optical properties due to their size, shape, composition, and structure-dependent characteristics. By incorporating these materials into nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors, it is possible to achieve tailored functionalities that surpass those of traditional sensor platforms.
One intriguing avenue for research lies in utilizing metallic nanoparticles as building blocks for assembling complex sensor architectures with improved sensitivity and selectivity. These nanoparticles can be precisely engineered in terms of size distribution, morphology, and surface chemistry to optimize their interaction with incident light waves and enhance measurable signals.
Moreover, recent advances in nanofabrication techniques offer exciting possibilities for designing hierarchical structures that combine multiple nanomaterial components into a single sensor platform. By carefully controlling the arrangement or patterning of various sized nanostructures on a substrate or within cavities or arrays, researchers can exploit synergistic effects arising from collective resonances or localized field enhancements. This approach opens up new opportunities for achieving even narrower linewidths by optimizing plasmonic interactions at different length scales.
Furthermore, emerging two-dimensional materials like graphene have attracted significant attention due to their extraordinary electronic and optical properties. Integration of graphene-based layers into surface plasmon resonance sensors could provide notable benefits such as highly tunable conductivity or wavelength-sensitive absorption characteristics that can be exploited for precise control over sensor performance.
In addition to metallic nanoparticles and two-dimensional materials like graphene, other types of nanomaterials such as quantum dots or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of surface plasmon resonance sensors. Quantum dots offer unique photoemission properties and tunable bandgaps, enabling the development of highly sensitive and wavelength-selective sensor platforms. On the other hand, MOFs exhibit exceptional porosity and large internal surface areas, rendering them suitable for sensing applications involving specific analytes or target molecules.

Title: Exploring the Role of Neuroinflammation in Chronic Primary Orofacial Pain
Abstract: Chronic primary orofacial pain (OFP) conditions, including painful temporomandibular disorders (pTMDs), idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and burning mouth syndrome (BMS), pose significant challenges in pain management due to their complex and multifactorial etiology and pathophysiology. Despite advancements in understanding these conditions through preclinical studies, translating these findings into effective pain care for chronic OFP patients remains elusive. One specific aspect that warrants further investigation is the role of neuroinflammation in driving chronic primary OFP.
Introduction:
Chronic primary orofacial pain encompasses a diverse group of conditions with enigmatic origins, such as pTMDs, TN, and BMS. These debilitating disorders are characterized by persistent pain sensations localized to the orofacial region without an identifiable underlying cause. Although previous research has shed light on certain contributing factors to these conditions, including myofascial pain and arthralgia for pTMDs, dysfunction of the trigeminal nerve for TN, and alterations in somatosensory processing for BMS [1], there is still much to be discovered regarding their pathogenesis.
Emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation could play a critical role in perpetuating chronic primary OFP. Neuroinflammation refers to the activation of glial cells within the central nervous system (CNS), leading to immune responses specifically targeting neurons [2]. This process involves complex interactions between resident glia cells such as microglia and astrocytes along with infiltrating immune cells like macrophages [3]. While neuroinflammation itself can serve as a protective mechanism aimed at resolving tissue damage or infection promptly, it can also become dysregulated under certain circumstances.
In recent years, investigations utilizing preclinical models have highlighted the involvement of neuroinflammatory processes in various chronic pain conditions, including neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain [4]. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic primary OFP might differ from other chronic pain conditions, it is plausible that similar mechanisms contribute to the perpetuation of persistent orofacial pain. To date, however, limited studies have explored the potential role of neuroinflammation in driving chronic primary OFP.
Understanding the precise contributions of neuroinflammation to chronic primary OFP may offer promising insights into novel therapeutic targets for this complex condition. By elucidating specific molecular pathways and cellular interactions involved in neuroinflammation associated with pTMDs, TN, and BMS, we can potentially advance our knowledge regarding disease progression and identify new strategies for delivering targeted treatments. Furthermore, identifying diagnostic biomarkers indicative of neuroinflammatory processes will aid early detection and prompt intervention.
The objective of this research study is to explore the role of neuroinflammation in driving persistent orofacial pain by utilizing preclinical models representing different aspects of pTMDs, TN, and BMS. By employing robust experimental designs incorporating appropriate rodent assays as mentioned in previous studies [5], we aim to simulate etiology/pathophysiology consistent with clinical symptoms observed in patients suffering from these debilitating disorders.
To achieve this goal comprehensively, an innovative approach combining behavioral assessments (e.g., facial grimacing analysis) [6] along with immunohistochemical analyses (e.g., glial activation markers) will be utilized. Additionally, transcriptomic analyses will be performed to identify key gene expression changes associated specifically with neuroinflammatory processes within relevant brain regions implicated in orofacial pain modulation.
Ultimately, a deeper understanding of how neuroinflammation influences chronic primary OFP may assist researchers and clinicians alike by paving the way for targeted therapies aimed at attenuating inflammation-induced nociception within the central or peripheral nervous system. By capitalizing on the knowledge gained from this study, we hope to improve the lives of individuals living with chronic primary OFP by providing more effective pain management strategies.
In conclusion, this research study aims to investigate the role of neuroinflammation in driving chronic primary OFP. The findings from this study are poised to enhance our understanding of the complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pTMDs, TN, and BMS. Furthermore, identifying therapeutic targets associated with neuroinflammatory processes will open up new possibilities for developing novel treatment approaches for patients afflicted with chronic primary OFP. 
1. Introduction
In recent years, RNA editing has emerged as a promising approach for the therapeutic correction of pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNV) in the human transcriptome. Unlike genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas9, RNA editing offers several advantages, including decreased risk of permanent off-target edits in the genome and innovative delivery options. Among the various enzymes involved in RNA editing, adenine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) have been extensively studied for their ability to catalyze posttranscriptional modifications through hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This enzymatic activity has been employed to target and alter pathogenic SNVs on a transcriptional level within the human genome.
Previous studies have predominantly focused on utilizing exogenously delivered ADAR deaminase domain (ADARDD) fused with an RNA-binding protein for achieving optimal target editing rates. While this approach has shown promise, it presents certain limitations such as immune responses against foreign proteins and transcriptome-wide off-target effects. To overcome these challenges, researchers have recently explored harnessing endogenous ADAR enzymes themselves for programmable RNA editing.
Endogenous ADARs offer multiple advantages over exogenously introduced ADARDD-based strategies. Firstly, recruitment of endogenous ADARs to specific target sites requires only an ADAR-recruiting guide RNA (gRNA), thereby eliminating the need for delivering additional protein components into cells or tissues. This not only reduces packaging space but also minimizes the chances of immune responses against foreign proteins.
Despite these advantages, initial attempts at utilizing endogenous ADARs were hindered by low efficiency levels compared to exogenously delivered counterparts. However, recent advancements hold promise for improving target editing efficiency using endogenous ADAR enzymes both in vitro and in vivo settings. One particularly notable development involves circular ADAR-recruiting gRNAs, which have demonstrated enhanced ADAR recruitment and editing efficiency. In addition, the optimization of ADAR-recruiting antisense oligonucleotides has further contributed to improved RNA editing outcomes with endogenous ADAR enzymes.
To evaluate the potential of this emerging approach for therapeutic applications, it is important to assess its efficacy in relevant disease models. Encouragingly, studies utilizing wild-type mouse models and disease mouse models have demonstrated target editing efficiencies comparable to exogenously delivered ADAR in both retinal and non-retinal tissues. Furthermore, investigations in non-human primate (NHP) models have revealed sustained editing efficiency for up to 6 weeks following application.
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) represent a promising field for exploring the therapeutic potential of RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes. While gene replacement therapy has shown safety and efficacy in treating IRDs, challenges remain for genes that surpass the packaging capacity of adeno-associated viruses or are expressed through multiple retinal isoforms. Expanding upon previous work on RNA-editing therapies, exploring the applicability of RNA editing with endogenous ADARs could address these limitations and offer a viable treatment option.
Therefore, this review aims to provide an overview of recent developments regarding RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes and assess its potential applicability within the context of treating inherited retinal diseases. By evaluating advancements such as circular gRNAs and optimizations in oligonucleotide design for recruiting endogenous ADAR enzymes, this paper seeks to establish a foundation for future research endeavors focused on expanding our understanding of programmable RNA editing as a feasible therapeutic option for IRDs. 
Title: Artificial Intelligence in Early Diagnosis and Prognosis Prediction of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Addressing Challenges and Advancing Clinical Practices 
1. Introduction
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a prevalent and devastating malignancy worldwide, particularly in regions with a high incidence of esophageal cancer. As one of the most aggressive cancers affecting the digestive tract, ESCC carries high morbidity and mortality rates due to late-stage presentation. Early detection plays a crucial role in reducing disease burden and improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.
Endoscopic screening has been recognized as the gold standard for early diagnosis and treatment of ESCC. Despite its effectiveness, missed diagnoses remain a significant concern, often resulting from variations in expertise among endoscopists who fail to recognize subtle lesions or inaccurately assess their malignant potential. Therefore, integrating advanced technologies into endoscopy practice holds great promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing therapeutic decision-making.
In recent years, there has been an unprecedented surge in research exploring the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms within medical imaging domains. The rapid development of deep machine learning techniques has paved the way for AI-driven innovations capable of revolutionizing endoscopic diagnosis by providing robust auxiliary tools for identifying early-stage esophageal carcinoma lesions.
Among various AI methodologies, convolution neural networks (CNNs), integrated within deep learning models, have particularly shown tremendous potential in medical image classification tasks. CNNs leverage continuous convolution layers to extract salient features from input image data before employing full-layer connections to classify them accurately. The widespread adoption of CNN-based algorithms has significantly improved the precision and efficiency of endoscopic image classification for diagnosing ESCC at its initial stages.
This comprehensive review aims to delve into the current state of AI-assisted diagnosis for early ESCC lesions while emphasizing prognostic depth prediction under diverse imaging modalities such as white-light endoscopy (WLE), narrow-band imaging (NBI), and magnifying endoscopy with chromoendoscopy (ME-C). Recognizing the outstanding image recognition capabilities of AI, we explore how it can ameliorate missed diagnoses and enable endoscopists to conduct more meticulous examinations.
However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential limitations of AI systems for medical applications. The generalizability of these systems heavily relies on their training datasets, which may exhibit selective biases. As AI algorithms might be trained using datasets disproportionately representing certain populations or lacking diversity in lesion types, careful validation and cross-validation studies are essential before integrating such tools into routine clinical practice.
In this review paper, we critically evaluate the present challenges faced by AI-assisted endoscopic diagnosis of early ESCC while proposing strategies to mitigate bias and improve data inclusivity within training datasets. Moreover, we highlight recent advancements in machine learning methods aimed at bridging gaps in ESCC screening accuracy for resource-limited settings globally.
Overall, this article aims to shed light on emerging developments in leveraging artificial intelligence techniques for early detection and prognosis prediction of ESCC through endoscopic imaging analysis. By exploring avenues for future research collaborations and addressing existing limitations hindering its widespread utility, this review seeks to contribute towards optimizing clinical practices for tackling esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at its earliest stages.

Introduction
The global prevalence of overweight and obesity has reached alarming levels in recent years, posing a significant burden on individuals and healthcare systems worldwide. Obesity is a chronic disease influenced by numerous factors, including genetic predisposition, lifestyle choices, psychological influences, cultural norms, and ethnicity (ABESO—2022). The primary consequences of obesity are multifaceted and can lead to the development of metabolic syndrome and several associated comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancer, and musculoskeletal disorders.
Despite the recognition that multiple factors contribute to the etiology of obesity, lifestyle behaviors remain pivotal in its prevention and management. Unhealthy eating habits characterized by high consumption of ultraprocessed foods with excessive amounts of fats and sugars have been closely linked to weight gain (ABESO—2022). Additionally, larger portion sizes have become increasingly prevalent in society alongside a decrease in the intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains (fiber-rich foods), which are essential for weight maintenance due to their satiating effects. 
The prevalence of fad diets as quick-fix solutions has drawn attention due to their promises for rapid weight loss without evidence-based support from scientific literature (ABESO—2022). Individuals striving to achieve weight loss frequently face challenges associated with adherence to unrealistic dietary regimens that may hinder long-term success. These diets often propagate beliefs regarding "superfoods," dependence on slimming teas or phytotherapeutic interventions while simultaneously advocating restriction or avoidance of entire food groups such as carbohydrates.
Given these complexities surrounding effective nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity management, comprehensive strategies encompassing various aspects must be developed to address this ongoing public health concern successfully. Nutritional interventions should focus not only on caloric restriction but also on improving dietary quality through sustainable modifications that support overall health promotion.
The current body of literature emphasizes the importance of adopting a balanced dietary pattern integrating key components such as whole grains, lean meats, low-fat dairy products, fruits, and vegetables to achieve weight loss goals (ABESO—2022). These dietary recommendations align with international guidelines that highlight the significance of energy deficit while providing essential macronutrients and micronutrients necessary for optimal physiological functioning.
Beyond dietary modifications alone, successful weight management necessitates a multidimensional approach addressing psychological and behavioral factors. Motivational interviewing techniques have been identified as beneficial in promoting behavior change and enhancing long-term adherence to healthy habits (ABESO—2022). Approaches that encourage individuals to develop skills for self-monitoring, goal-setting, problem-solving strategies, stress management, and emotional regulation must be incorporated into comprehensive weight-loss interventions.
However, emerging areas of research have shed light on additional factors impacting obesity development and management. The role of gut microbiota composition in influencing energy metabolism and its potential contribution to weight gain has gained attention. Furthermore, chronic inflammation has been implicated as a modulator of metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity (ABESO—2022). Understanding these novel aspects is crucial in augmenting effective nutrition therapy approaches targeting sustained weight loss along with preventing the commonly observed phenomenon of postintervention weight regain.
In light of these complexities surrounding nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity management alongside the recent advances in understanding gut microbiota influence on metabolism inflammation patterns contribute to obesity development maintenance strategies this comprehensive research aims to investigate the effects examining novel dietary interventions that incorporate considerations from nutritional genomics. By focusing on individual responses based on genetic variations regarding nutrient metabolism will further optimize personalized nutrition therapies directed towards sustainable long-term weight reduction goals.

Consequently, targeting aberrant kinase activities has gained increasing attention as a novel therapeutic approach.
Although current treatments for neurodegenerative diseases offer some symptomatic relief, they fail to modify disease progression or halt neuronal degeneration effectively. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop innovative strategies that can specifically target dysfunctional kinases within affected cells while minimizing off-target effects on healthy tissues.
This review seeks to explore the vast landscape of kinase inhibitors through the lens of targeted drug delivery systems tailored specifically for neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Exciting advancements have demonstrated that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases are involved in crucial pathological processes associated with AD development and progression.
2. Role of Kinase Inhibitors in Neurodegeneration
Recent studies have elucidated diverse mechanisms involving kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and ERK/MAPK (Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) in neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. These kinases are implicated in tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic loss, and impaired neuronal survival pathways.
The design of kinase inhibitors that can specifically target these dysfunctional kinases presents a ripe opportunity for advancing the field of neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Strategies may involve the development of small-molecule inhibitors capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier or designing nanocarrier systems that can selectively deliver kinase inhibitors to affected brain regions.
3. Targeted Drug Delivery Approaches
To achieve precise delivery of kinase inhibitors to site-specific areas within the central nervous system (CNS), innovative drug delivery systems have been explored. Liposomes, nanoparticles, and antibody-based approaches are some examples that allow controlled release and increased targeting efficiency while mitigating off-target effects.
These targeted drug delivery approaches also offer additional advantages such as improved pharmacokinetics with prolonged circulation time in blood plasma, reduced toxicity profiles due to lower effective doses required, enhanced drug stability during systemic circulation, and increased therapeutic index by minimizing adverse effects on healthy tissues. 
4. Conclusion
Kinase inhibitors represent a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. By specifically modulating aberrant signaling pathways associated with disease progression while sparing healthy brain tissue from unintended side effects, these compounds hold potential for disease modification rather than mere symptom alleviation.
Further research should focus on optimizing strategies for enhancing drug selectivity towards specific dysfunctional kinases in affected neural cells while maximizing their efficacy through advanced targeted delivery systems. Integrated efforts among multidisciplinary research teams involving chemists, pharmacologists, biologists, and clinicians are essential to realizing the full potential of kinase inhibitors as transformative tools for neurodegenerative disease management.
In summary, this review aims to deepen our understanding of the role of kinase inhibitors in facilitating targeted drug delivery for neurodegenerative diseases. By focusing on neurodegeneration-associated kinases and exploring innovative delivery approaches, we can pave the way towards personalized treatments that improve therapeutic outcomes, enhance patient well-being, and alleviate the burden imposed by these devastating disorders. 
Title: Investigating the Potential of Stem Cell Therapy in Reducing Brain Injury Following Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia: A Comprehensive Review
Abstract:
Intrapartum hypoxia-ischemia (HI) leading to neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a global health concern, contributing to significant mortality and morbidity among newborns. Although therapeutic hypothermia (HT) has proven effective for reducing brain injury in high-income countries (HIC), its limited safety and efficacy in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) necessitate the exploration of alternative treatment options. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the potential use of stem cell therapy as a neuroprotective agent for reducing brain injury following neonatal HI.
1. Introduction
Neonatal encephalopathy resulting from intrapartum hypoxia-ischemia poses major challenges in clinical management, with over 85% of cases occurring in LMIC where access to therapeutic interventions may be limited [1]. Hypoxic-ischemic injury during this critical period can lead to devastating long-term consequences such as cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments, and motor disabilities [2].
Therapeutic hypothermia currently stands as the gold standard treatment for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in HIC. However, HT's applicability remains questionable due to practical challenges experienced by LMIC healthcare systems, particularly those with limited resources, inadequate infrastructure, and substandard postnatal care [3]. The need for accessible and cost-effective therapies that can attenuate brain injury is pressing for these regions.
Emerging research endeavors have explored various pharmacological agents as potential neuroprotective therapies beyond HT. While several candidate drugs show promise under preclinical settings or small-scale clinical trials, steps toward comprehensive evaluation are essential before widespread implementation within LMIC. In particular, extensive investigation regarding stem cell therapy's potential as a neuroprotective strategy is warranted.
Stem cell therapy represents a promising avenue for mitigating brain injury following hypoxia-ischemia. The regenerative potential of various stem cell populations, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), offers a novel approach to rescuing damaged neurons and promoting neurorepair processes [4]. These cells possess the ability to differentiate into different neural lineages, release trophic factors that foster tissue repair, modulate inflammation, and enhance endogenous repair mechanisms [5].
While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of stem cell therapy in reducing brain injury in animal models of adult stroke or traumatic brain injury, limited information exists regarding its therapeutic potential for neonatal HI-induced encephalopathy. Therefore, there is a critical need for systematic investigations evaluating the neuroprotective effects of various types of stem cells in neonatal animal models to bridge this knowledge gap.
This comprehensive review aims to examine existing literature on the use of different types of stem cells as therapeutic interventions for reducing brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. By critically analyzing preclinical studies using animal models simulating neonatal HI and exploring potential mechanisms underlying the observed protective effects, this review seeks to facilitate informed decision making concerning future clinical trials on human subjects.
Ultimately, through an integrative analysis of available evidence, we strive towards identifying optimal strategies utilizing advanced regenerative therapies that can effectively reduce morbidity and mortality resulting from NE in LMIC settings. This knowledge may pave the way for future translational research leading to timely interventions with superior safety profiles compared with current practices.

Introduction: Analysis of Proteomic and Genomic Biomarkers for Gelatin Source Authentication in the Context of Climate Change and Animal Welfare
The global food industry has undergone significant changes over the past few decades, driven by various factors such as population growth, urbanization, and changing dietary preferences. One key aspect of these changes is the increased demand for gelatin products, which are widely used in diverse industries including food processing, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and photography. Gelatin primarily serves as a hydrocolloid stabilizer due to its unique properties including gelling ability and water retention capacity (1). 
Gelatin is derived from collagen - a major structural protein found in the connective tissues of animals. Traditionally sourced from bovine and porcine origin, gelatin production has faced numerous challenges in recent years. One significant consideration is religious beliefs related to dietary prohibitions that restrict the consumption of certain animal-based products (2). Moreover, there have been mounting ethical concerns regarding animal welfare practices associated with the gelatin industry. Consequently, consumers increasingly seek accurate information about gelatin's origins to align their consumption choices with personal beliefs.
In addition to these socio-cultural considerations surrounding gelatin production processes and sourcing practices regarding bovine or porcine origin (3), there are growing concerns about climate change impacts on global food systems (4). With increasing temperatures leading to altered ecosystems worldwide, promoting sustainable production methods becomes crucially important across all sectors - including gelatins. As such concerns arise within the broader context of climate change adaptation strategies for sustainable food production (5), it is essential to implement robust authentication techniques enabling manufacturers to accurately determine animal species' sources used in their gelatins.
In this regard, biomarker analysis can play a pivotal role in addressing these challenges by providing reliable tools for authenticating animal-based gelatins originating from multiple species such as bovine or porcine sources - but also alternative options like chicken or fish gelatin. A biomarker is defined as a detectable compound that indicates normal or abnormal functioning within biological systems (6). Biomarker analysis offers promising potential for distinguishing between different gelatin sources by identifying specific proteins, peptides, or nucleic acid substances unique to each animal species.
Several studies have explored the use of proteomic and genomic biomarkers to authenticate gelatins' origin. Proteomics focuses on identifying and quantifying proteins within complex biological samples, while genomics aims at analyzing the genetic code stored in nucleic acids like DNA. By combining advances in both fields, researchers can develop innovative techniques to differentiate animal-based gelatins reliably.
Current methods employ various analytical technologies such as chromatography, mass spectrometry, electrophoresis, lateral flow devices, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for chemically analyzing specific proteins/peptides and detecting the presence of nucleic acid substances within gelatin samples (7). These techniques offer robustness and high sensitivity but require sophisticated equipment and reagents. However, their widespread application in the food industry necessitates cost-effectiveness and ease of use without compromising accuracy.
This review paper aims to critically analyze recent advances in developing reliable proteomic and genomic biomarkers for authenticating animal-based gelatins used in food production contexts. By examining current methodologies employed across research studies worldwide alongside their feasibility from an industrial perspective considering both costs involved and technology implementation challenges - we aim to support manufacturers seeking effective methods suitable for large-scale production environments.
In conclusion - this paper serves as a comprehensive guide highlighting various aspects related to using proteomic and genomic biomarkers for authentication purposes specifically within the realm of animal-based gelatins sourced globally with emphases on religious beliefs' impact on dietary preferences along with ethical concerns regarding animal welfare practices; considerations related to climate change adaptation strategies toward more sustainable food production processes; probative biomarker analysis enabling accurate determination of gelatins' sources; and technological advancements shaping future developments in this field. It is essential to recognize the need for further research and collaboration among academia, industry, and regulatory bodies to establish standardized protocols facilitating widespread adoption of these biomarker-based authentication systems in the gelatin industry.

Introduction
Neonatal Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) continues to be a significant healthcare issue among preterm infants, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. NEC is a multifactorial disease characterized by inflammation and ischemic necrosis of the intestine, primarily affecting premature infants. Despite advancements in medical knowledge and technological innovations, diagnosing NEC remains challenging due to its nonspecific clinical presentation. Early detection and timely intervention are imperative for improving prognosis; however, current diagnostic methods lack efficiency and accuracy.
In recent years, there has been growing interest in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques across various domains within the healthcare sector.

Title: Assessing the Effectiveness of Tongue Acupuncture for the Rehabilitation of Swallowing Function in Patients with Neurological Dysphagia
Introduction:
Swallowing impairment, or dysphagia, is a debilitating condition commonly observed after stroke and represents a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. Post-stroke dysphagia arises due to disruptions in the swallowing network comprising the cerebral cortex, subcortical areas, and brainstem structures. These disruptions lead to alterations in neuromuscular control, resulting in weakened muscle strength and impaired movement during swallowing.
Treatment options for post-stroke dysphagia are diverse but largely centred around rehabilitative strategies that aim to improve neurological function and enhance neuromuscular excitability. Traditional acupuncture has been utilized for centuries as a therapeutic modality for various health conditions within traditional Chinese medicine; however, its effectiveness specifically on post-stroke dysphagia remains inconclusive.
While several previous studies have explored different approaches within traditional acupuncture therapy, there is limited research on tongue acupuncture as an intervention technique for post-stroke dysphagia. Tongue acupuncture involves stimulating specific acupoints on or near the tongue surface using fine needles or other interventional tools. This method holds theoretical promise based on its potential ability to modulate cerebral cortical nerve cell excitability and promote neurological recovery.
In this study, we seek to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive meta-analysis focused specifically on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical efficacy of tongue acupuncture therapy in patients with post-stroke dysphagia.
1. Research Question:
Our primary research question is: "Does tongue acupuncture improve swallowing function in patients suffering from post-stroke dysphagia?"
2. Objective:
The objective of this study is twofold:
a) To systematically evaluate the clinical efficacy of tongue acupuncture therapy for neurorehabilitation by investigating its impact on swallowing-related nerves and muscles in patients with post-stroke dysphagia.
b) To analyze the overall effectiveness of tongue acupuncture compared to standard interventions or control groups in reducing swallowing impairment, as assessed by validated clinical scoring systems.
2. Methods:
We will follow a thorough and rigorous approach to gather relevant data for this meta-analysis. The inclusion criteria will consist of RCTs focusing on tongue acupuncture therapy for post-stroke dysphagia that were published in English or Chinese language. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), VPCS (VIP Chinese Science and Technique Periodical Database), Wan fang, and other pertinent electronic databases will be systematically searched.
The methodological quality assessment will be conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Data analysis will be performed utilizing Review Manager software version 5.4 following standardized statistical procedures.
3. Anticipated Outcomes:
We expect that our meta-analysis will provide comprehensive evidence regarding the efficacy of tongue acupuncture as an innovative therapeutic approach for post-stroke dysphagia rehabilitation. Our primary outcome measures assessing swallowing function improvement include changes in swallow-specific assessments (such as Water Swallow Test score) and general functional recovery utilizing validated scales (e.g., Self-Assessment scores). Secondary outcome measures include considering the overall clinical efficacy based on total effective rates reported across studies.
4. Significance:
Addressing the research question and analyzing the effects of tongue acupuncture therapy on swallow function may aid clinicians in decision-making regarding treatment modalities for patients with post-stroke dysphagia who have not adequately responded to conventional therapies alone.
The findings from this study could highlight significant insights into the potential value of incorporating tongue acupuncture within multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs specifically targeting neurorehabilitation outcomes related to swallowing dysfunction after stroke.
In conclusion, investigating alternative treatment modalities such as tongue acupuncture presents a novel avenue for enhancing existing therapeutic strategies employed in managing post-stroke dysphagia. This meta-analysis aims to contribute rigorous evidence to guide clinical practice and stimulate further research in this exciting field of rehabilitation medicine. 
Title: The Impact of Subjective Cognitive Decline in Parkinson's Disease: A Comprehensive Examination of Motor and Non-Motor Symptoms
Abstract: Cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) poses significant challenges, affecting the prognosis of PD, increasing caregivers' burden, and exerting pronounced economic consequences. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), characterized by self-reported cognitive decline without detectable objective cognitive dysfunction, has emerged as an important precursor to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and a prodromal stage for dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, there remains a dearth of literature exploring SCD specifically in the context of PD. Additionally, a lack of consensus persists regarding the definition and assessment tool for SCD.
This comprehensive review aims to investigate the association between PD-related SCD and objective cognitive function while considering other neurobiological changes associated with this condition. Insights gained from such exploration will not only contribute to expanding our understanding of PD-SCD but may also uncover novel avenues for early detection and intervention strategies.
1. Introduction
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. In addition to these hallmark motor deficits, non-motor symptoms have gained increasing recognition for their substantial impact on overall patient morbidity. Among these non-motor symptoms lies the complex realm encompassing various aspects of cognition.
Cognitive impairment is now firmly established as one such non-motor feature that significantly affects patients with Parkinson's disease both individually and within societal contexts. It not only exacerbates existing motor deficits but also contributes independently to poorer functional outcomes across multiple domains including activities of daily living (ADLs), caregiver strain levels, quality of life indices (QoL), hospitalization rates within healthcare systems burdened by limited resources – consequently escalating healthcare expenses exponentially [1-4].
Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has garnered attention as a potentially crucial early marker of neurodegenerative disorders, representing an "at-risk" state for subsequent cognitive impairment. SCD refers to the self-reported experience of cognitive decline without objective evidence of impairment on standard neuropsychological assessments. Studies exploring SCD (mainly in the context of aging) have discovered associations between this phenomenon and both an increased risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and eventual progression to AD dementia [5-7]. The conceptualization of SCD as a prodromal stage further supports its potential value in predicting future cognitive decline.
Despite the recognized importance of studying SCD, literature directly evaluating PD-related subjective cognitive decline remains limited. Previous research efforts have focused primarily on investigating various motor manifestations and certain non-motor symptoms in PD, with diminished emphasis thus far placed on systematically characterizing the trajectory and phenotypic profiles associated with emerging cognitive dysfunction.
A precise definition for PD-SCD is lacking within current scientific discourse. Additionally, consensus regarding appropriate assessment tools to capture this subjective experience has not been reached. Developing a clear definition and standardized evaluation protocol will be fundamental to comprehensively examining this underexplored aspect of Parkinson's disease and its interplay with other clinical markers.
This review aims to examine existing literature pertaining to PD-SCD while focusing on discerning possible associations between subjective reports of cognitive decline and objective measurements linked to neurobiological changes seen in patients with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we will address potential implications for clinical practice by deciphering whether PD-SCD could serve as a robust predictor or precursor for MCI – where earlier interventions enabling improved patient outcomes might be realistically feasible.
 
By expanding knowledge around PD-SCD through rigorous examination and synthesis, we hope that these findings pave the way toward establishing comprehensive guidelines delineating diagnostic criteria as well as facilitating prospective longitudinal investigations aiming at uncovering subtle precursors indicative of subsequent cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.

Title: Unraveling the Role of HDAC Inhibitors in Enhancing Immunotherapeutic Potential for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Comprehensive Review
Introduction:
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a major global health concern, accounting for a significant burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite recent therapeutic advances, such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies, the prognosis for advanced HCC patients remains dismal. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach that harnesses the power of the immune system to target tumor cells selectively.
The efficacy of immunotherapy depends on activating and sustaining antitumor immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, various mechanisms in HCC result in an immunosuppressive milieu within TME, hampering effective antitumor immunity. Therefore, strategies to overcome these barriers are critically needed to improve outcomes for HCC patients.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have garnered considerable attention due to their ability to modulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure and affect several cellular processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that HDACis can enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies across multiple tumor types including HCC.
Considering these findings, this comprehensive review aims to delve into current knowledge regarding HDACi-based approaches in conjunction with immunotherapies as potential strategies for enhancing treatment outcomes in advanced HCC. We will explore the intricate interplay between immunotherapy-induced immune responses and HDAC-mediated epigenetic regulation within HCC TME.
1. The Evolving Landscape of Immunotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma:
Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment by unleashing potent and durable antitumor immune responses against malignancies such as melanoma, lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. In recent years, novel immunotherapeutic agents have emerged including programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis inhibitors, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) blockade, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.
The clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 has demonstrated impressive responses in a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. These agents have shown potential to stimulate immune cell activation and unleash antitumor immunity within the immunosuppressive HCC microenvironment.
2. Challenges in Immunotherapy Resistance:
Despite the growing success of immunotherapies, primary or acquired resistance poses a significant challenge. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to immunotherapy resistance in HCC. These encompass upregulation of inhibitory receptors, altered antigen presentation machinery, dysregulated signaling pathways within immune cells, and the generation of an immunosuppressive network comprised of regulatory T cells (Tregs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and fibroblasts.
The recognition that epigenetic alterations profoundly influence HCC development and progression has brought HDACis into the spotlight as promising therapeutic tools for overcoming immunotherapy resistance. By targeting aberrant histone modification patterns associated with tumor pathogenesis and immune escape mechanisms, HDACis hold tremendous potential as adjuvants for enhancing antitumor immunity mediated by immunotherapeutic agents in advanced HCC.
3. Synergistic Interactions between HDAC Inhibitors and Immunotherapies:
Preclinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with HDACis enhances immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy by promoting tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, augmenting antigen presentation by modulating major histocompatibility complex expression on cancer cells, reversing exhaustion phenotypes on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), reducing suppressive regulatory cell populations, and remodeling the immunosuppressive TME.
Furthermore, HDACis have shown the ability to sensitize HCC cells to CAR T-cell therapy and promote CAR T-cell persistence. These findings underscore the multifaceted roles of HDACis in augmenting various immunotherapeutic strategies by priming or reprogramming immune responses, reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment, and promoting long-term antitumor memory.
4. Incorporating Novel Drug Delivery Systems as Tools for Enhanced HCC Treatment:
In addition to exploring HDACi-based approaches for enhancing immunotherapy responses in HCC, this review delves into the potential utilization of nano-based drug delivery systems (NDDS) as an innovative strategy. NDDS offer several advantages by improving drug stability, solubility, biodistribution, and sustained release kinetics within tumor tissues. Their application in combination with HDACis and immunotherapies could further optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing off-target effects.
Conclusion:
This comprehensive review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of emerging evidence supporting the incorporation of HDAC inhibitors into current immunotherapy strategies for advanced HCC. Understanding the interplay between epigenetic modifications mediated by HDACs and immune signaling pathways will shed light on future synergistic therapeutic approaches that hold promise for overcoming immunotherapy resistance in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Genetic Bases of C7 Deficiency: Systematic Review and Report of a Novel Deletion Determining Functional Hemizygosity
1. Introduction
Primary complement system (C) deficiencies are rare genetic disorders that predispose individuals to an increased risk of infections, autoimmunity, and immune disorders. The terminal pathway C-deficiencies in particular have been strongly associated with a significantly higher susceptibility to Neisseria meningitidis infections. Rapid identification of patients with C-deficiencies is crucial for minimizing the likelihood of recurrent infections and enabling appropriate vaccination strategies.
The study presented here aims to investigate the clinical and genetic patterns of C7 deficiency by conducting a comprehensive systematic review. Through this review, we aim to highlight the importance of understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms contributing to C7 deficiency and its implications for clinical management.
In recent years, advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed for the identification of various pathogenetic variants responsible for primary complement deficiencies. In line with these advancements, our study reports on a case involving a ten-year-old boy infected by Neisseria meningitidis B who displayed clinical presentations indicative of reduced C activity.
This paper first provides an overview of primary complement system deficiencies and their association with increased risks for infections, autoimmunity, or immune disorders. It then focuses specifically on terminal pathway defects leading to vulnerability against Neisseria meningitidis infections.
Furthermore, we present results from functional assays conducted using Wieslab ELISA Kit that confirm reduced total classical (0.6% activity), lectin (0.2% activity), and alternative pathway activities (0.1% activity) in our patient sample's serum samples compared to healthy controls.
To better understand the genetic basis behind this patient's condition, we performed Western blot analysis which revealed complete absence of C7 in serum samples taken from our subject - suggestive evidence supporting a diagnosis related primarily to defective terminal complement function caused by mutations or deletions affecting the C7 gene. Subsequent Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA allowed for the identification of two pathogenetic variants in the C7 gene: a well-characterized missense mutation G379R and a novel heterozygous deletion of three nucleotides located at the 3’ untranslated region (c.*99_*101delTCT). We propose that this novel deletion affects mRNA stability, resulting in selective expression of only the allele with the missense mutation, thereby classifying our proband as a functional hemizygote for the expression of this mutated C7 allele.
Understanding how these genetic alterations contribute to compromised complement activity is pivotal for developing targeted therapies and improving patient care. By examining this unique case alongside an extensive systematic review of existing literature on C7 deficiencies, we aim to provide valuable insights into not only clinical aspects but also genetic underpinnings associated with terminal pathway complement defects.
In summary, our study sheds light on an intriguing case involving a novel deletion determining functional hemizygosity in a patient with reduced terminal pathway complement function. Our findings underscore not only the relevance but also the need for comprehensive genetic analysis when diagnosing primary complement deficiencies, especially those predisposing patients to susceptible infections such as Neisseria meningitidis B.
Understanding these inherited molecular defects will ultimately enable us to personalize treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes by enhancing our ability to identify individuals at high risk and institute appropriate preventive measures like vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis B. 
Title: Exploring the Potential of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Assay for Early Diagnosis and Targeted Treatment of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis
1. Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health threat, affecting approximately one-third of the global population. Despite significant progress made in combating this disease, challenges persist due to factors such as long turnaround time and poor sensitivity associated with conventional diagnostic methods. These impediments often lead to delays in accurate diagnosis, subsequently resulting in treatment delays and the emergence of drug resistance strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need for innovative diagnostic approaches that can expedite the detection of Mycobacterium spp., particularly drug-resistant strains.
In recent years, molecular diagnostics have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional methods for TB diagnosis. These techniques offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity compared to their traditional counterparts but often require sophisticated infrastructure, skilled manpower, and are cost-prohibitive for resource-limited settings.
Amongst these molecular techniques, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has garnered attention as a potential solution owing to its simplicity and efficiency in detecting target DNA sequences without relying on thermocycling procedures commonly employed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Recommended by the World Health Organization in 2016 for TB diagnosis, LAMP assay has been shown to produce visual readouts facilitating its application as a point-of-care test.
The present study aims to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis utilizing PRISMA guidelines systematically evaluating the diagnostic efficacy of LAMP assay specifically targeting a diverse panel of Mycobacterial species. By collating data from existing scientific databases and adhering to robust inclusion criteria, this study seeks to provide evidence-based insights into the scope and limitations of LAMP technology for early detection of TB.
2. Research Objectives:
- Assessing the accuracy rates: This study aims to quantify accuracy rates achieved by LAMP assays across various studies conducted globally. By considering a range of diagnostic settings, including high disease burden nations, such as India, Thailand, and Japan, the objective is to determine the consistency and reliability of LAMP assay in different regional contexts.

- Conducting quality assessment: Finally, a comprehensive quality assessment based on QUADAS-2 framework will be performed. This evaluation will determine potential biases associated with individual studies while assessing their applicability to real-world diagnostic scenarios.
Overall, by synthesizing existing evidence using rigorous methodology and adhering to established guidelines, this study strives to evaluate whether LAMP technology can serve as a feasible alternative for timely diagnostics in resource-limited regions burdened by high TB prevalence rates. The results obtained from this comprehensive analysis could inform policy decisions aiming at implementing novel diagnostic strategies that have the potential to minimize treatment delays and reduce drug resistance emergence within vulnerable populations. 
1. Introduction
The impact of cannabis use on mental health has been a subject of increasing concern in recent years, particularly with the legalization of cannabis for recreational use in many countries. Previous studies have examined the types and numbers of cannabis-associated adverse events, specifically focusing on those presenting in the Emergency Department (ED) with mental health symptoms. However, disentangling these events from adverse events associated with the use of other recreational substances has presented a significant challenge.
With the expansion of recreational cannabis legalization worldwide, there has been a need for clearer information regarding the frequency and nature of adverse events related to cannabis use that are encountered in EDs. This is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies and providing appropriate healthcare interventions to individuals experiencing such adverse events. Therefore, an accurate understanding of the interactions between cannabis use and mental health presentations is essential.
While there have been advancements in our knowledge since previous reviews were published, it is important to critically evaluate and address potential biases that may impact data validity in this field. Both clinician biases and research designs employed in studying these events can significantly influence our ability to accurately assess the relationships between cannabis use and mental health outcomes.
Notably, many studies examining admissions related to cannabis use in EDs have relied on administrative datasets which require front-line clinicians to identify and attribute the association between marijuana consumption and specific clinical presentations. These methods may introduce reporting biases or underestimate associations due to potential underrecognition or reluctance among clinicians to document substance-related causes.
Therefore, this paper aims to provide an extensive overview of what is currently known about mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use within ED settings while also addressing some methodological limitations present within existing literature. In particular, we aim to evaluate whether current findings accurately reflect reality or if they are influenced by various sources of bias.
Additionally, this paper will explore variations observed across genders and sexes concerning how cannabinoids impact mental health outcomes differently. Understanding these gender-specific differences can inform tailored interventions and enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between cannabis use, mental health vulnerabilities, and gender-specific risk factors.
The primary objectives of this paper are as follows:
1. To summarize the most common adverse events related to mental health that have been associated with cannabis use in ED settings.
2. To highlight and analyze rare but concerning events reported in the literature that may provide valuable insights into specific risk patterns or contributing factors.
3. To present a critical evaluation framework for future studies aiming to investigate the relationship between cannabis use and mental health presentations in EDs, including considerations for study design, data collection methods, and potential biases.
By addressing these research objectives, we aim to contribute to an improved understanding of how cannabis use impacts mental health outcomes within ED populations. Ultimately, this knowledge can inform evidence-based practices that prevent adverse outcomes associated with marijuana consumption while ensuring effective interventions tailored toward different populations based on their unique vulnerabilities. 
Introduction
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors derived from the adrenal medulla or extra-adrenal sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, respectively. These tumors are characterized by excessive catecholamine production, resulting in a variety of clinical manifestations including hypertension, palpitations, sweating, and headache (1). While surgery is the cornerstone of treatment for localized disease, the management of metastatic pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas remains challenging due to limited treatment options.
Epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as crucial regulators of gene expression in various malignancies (2). Histone modifications play a pivotal role in the transcriptional regulation by altering chromatin structure and accessibility to transcription factors. Acetylation and deacetylation of histones are key processes that control gene expression through modulation of chromatin dynamics. These modifications are catalyzed by enzymes known as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) respectively.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have shown therapeutic potential across different tumor types by targeting aberrant epigenetic alterations associated with cancer development (3). HDAC inhibitors exhibit pleiotropic effects on cancer cells due to their ability to regulate multiple intracellular pathways involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis induction, differentiation promotion, genomic stability maintenance, angiogenesis suppression among others (4).
Currently approved HDACis such as vorinostat, romidepsin, belinostat extensively used in hematological malignancies like T-cell lymphoma subtypes have prompted interest for utilizing these agents beyond hematological diseases into solid tumors including colorectal cancer, thyroid carcinoma breast carcinoma lung carcinoma pancreatic adenocarcinoma where treatment options remain limited.
Given HDACis' ability to modulate epigenetic modifications underlying tumorigenesis and their clinical efficacy in certain cancers, the potential therapeutic application of HDACis in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas is an area of interest. Although very little is known about the effects of HDACis on these rare neuroendocrine tumors, recent preclinical studies have highlighted their potential as promising therapeutic agents (5).
The emergence of targeted therapies has revolutionized cancer treatment by offering improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to traditional chemotherapy agents. HDACis hold promise as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas by leveraging their unique mechanism of action targeting epigenetic alterations.
In this comprehensive review, we aim to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the antitumor activity of HDACis in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. We will present data from preclinical studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo, as well as clinical trial results evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of these agents in patients with metastatic disease.
Understanding the underlying mechanisms by which HDAC inhibitors exert their antitumor effects on neuroendocrine tumors holds great potential for identifying new therapeutic strategies that can complement or replace existing systemic treatments. Moreover, gaining insights into biomarkers associated with response or resistance to HDAC inhibition may facilitate patient selection for personalized treatment approaches.
Overall, this review aims to consolidate available evidence supporting the clinical implementation of HDAC inhibitors in managing advanced stages of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. By highlighting gaps in knowledge and areas requiring further investigation, this work aims to stimulate future research endeavors aiming at improving outcomes for patients affected by these rare neuroendocrine tumors. 
Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals from an early age and throughout their lives. It is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication skills, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). ASD has a profound impact not only on the affected individuals themselves but also on their families and society as a whole.
Currently, there is no known cure for ASD, and available treatments mainly focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Pharmaceutical interventions are commonly used to target specific symptoms associated with ASD; however, they often come with various adverse effects that may outweigh the potential benefits (Aman et al., 2004). Hence, the exploration of alternative treatment options for individuals with ASD is of great importance.
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies offer potential avenues for addressing the challenges faced by individuals with ASD. Among these therapies, acupuncture has shown promising application potential in improving symptoms related to ASD. Acupuncture, rooted in traditional Chinese medicine principles dating back centuries ago, involves the insertion of thin needles into specific acupoints on the body to stimulate physiological responses (Zhao et al., 2019).
Despite its long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine and mounting anecdotal evidence suggesting its effectiveness in alleviating some symptoms associated with neurological disorders such as autism (Wong et al., 2009), acupuncture has not been widely adopted or recognized as a preferred CAM therapy for ASD within the mainstream Western medical community.
To address this gap in knowledge regarding the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture for treating individuals with ASD, it is essential to undertake comprehensive investigations into existing clinical study reports. In particular, aspects such as study subjects' characteristics, group settings utilized during interventions, intervention modalities employed in treatment protocols including acupoint selection strategies utilized during sessions require thorough examination. Additionally crucial are evaluations assessing outcomes achieved post-acupuncture treatment implementation while ensuring safety at all times. Analyzing and discussing these factors will provide critical insights into the potential benefits and limitations of acupuncture as a therapeutic option for individuals with ASD.
The primary objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review and analysis of the existing clinical studies conducted over the past 15 years that have investigated the role of acupuncture in treating ASD. By consolidating findings from various clinical trials, this study aims to critically evaluate the current evidence supporting or questioning the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture in managing symptoms associated with ASD. Furthermore, this manuscript proposes recommendations on how future research in this area should be designed to optimize investigation outcomes.
To accomplish these objectives, it is vital that research studies adhere to international standards governing rigorous design, methodology, and reporting guidelines for performing interventions such as those established by Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) (MacPherson et al., 2010) and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) (Schulz et al., 2010). By following these guidelines closely, researchers can ensure transparency, replicability, and comparability across different intervention studies focused on evaluating acupuncture's therapeutic potential for individuals with ASD.
By addressing knowledge gaps surrounding acupuncture's efficacy within high-quality scientific trials involving meticulous acupoint selection strategies alongside functional experiments grounded upon both modern medicine principles and traditional Chinese medicine paradigms, evidence supporting or refuting its potential effectiveness can be attained more robustly.
This review article endeavors to serve as a valuable reference guide for researchers seeking to undertake high-quality clinical trials investigating acupuncture's efficacy in treating individuals with ASD. It emphasizes integration between contemporary medical practices developed through systematic empirical research methodologies coupled with traditional Chinese medicine approaches rooted within centuries-old wisdom. 
1. Introduction
The critical role of effective communication and information sharing in healthcare has been extensively studied, drawing attention to the concepts of employee silence and voice. These concepts are essential for understanding organizational dynamics, worker well-being, patient safety, and the overall quality of care provided in healthcare settings.
Research into employee silence and voice in the field of healthcare has primarily focused on speaking up or withholding information. However, investigations into interventions aimed at promoting a culture where employees feel comfortable expressing their opinions have yielded disappointing outcomes. This suggests that there is a significant gap in our understanding of employee voice and silence within healthcare organizations.
Understanding the underlying theoretical frameworks behind employee voice and silence is crucial for developing effective interventions that promote a culture conducive to open communication in healthcare settings. Additionally, examining how withholding information impacts key outcomes such as patient safety, quality of care, and worker well-being is essential for improving overall organizational performance.
While various studies have touched upon these topics individually, no comprehensive examination has addressed how voice and silence are conceptualized and operationalized within the unique context of healthcare organizations. Moreover, there appears to be heterogeneity both in terms of conceptualization as well as measurement tools employed across different studies.
To bridge this gap in knowledge, an integrative systematic review aiming to address two primary questions will be conducted:
1) How is employee voice and silence conceptualized and measured within the context of healthcare?
2) What are the theoretical underpinnings guiding research on employee voice and silence within healthcare?
By exploring these questions systematically across quantitative studies published between 2016-2022 from reputable peer-reviewed journals focusing on measuring either employee voice or employee silence among healthcare staff members using databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Embase among others; this review aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing evidence while identifying gaps for further research.
To ensure transparency throughout this systematic review process adhering to PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) will be followed. A review protocol outlining the research questions, inclusion criteria, search strategy, and data extraction procedure has been registered with the PROSPERO register (CRD42022367138).
This review seeks to enhance our understanding of employee voice and silence within healthcare organizations by critically examining existing literature in terms of conceptualizations, measurement tools utilized, and theoretical frameworks employed. By synthesizing the available evidence from various perspectives, it aims to contribute towards developing a more comprehensive understanding of these concepts within healthcare settings.
However, it is important to acknowledge potential limitations in this review. The current body of research predominantly relies on self-reported data from cross-sectional studies and primarily includes nurses and female staff members as participants. This potential bias may limit the generalizability of findings across diverse healthcare settings or different employee groups within these organizations.
Ultimately, this integrative systematic review will provide valuable insights into the conceptualization and measurement methods used for assessing employee voice and silence in healthcare contexts. It will identify gaps in existing knowledge while highlighting areas that require additional research attention. Such knowledge can inform both theory development regarding voice and silence as well as practical implications aimed at fostering improved communication practices within healthcare organizations for enhanced patient safety outcomes, quality care delivery, worker satisfaction, and overall organizational performance. 
Introduction
The effectiveness of plant-based dietary patterns in improving health outcomes has been widely acknowledged. Plant-based diets emphasize the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds while minimizing the intake of animal products. Several studies have demonstrated the potential benefits of adopting a plant-based diet in reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and certain types of cancer (Satija et al., 2017; Kahleova et al., 2018).
Despite the growing popularity and acceptance of plant-based diets among health professionals and individuals seeking to improve their overall well-being through dietary choices, there is a lack of consensus on how to define and assess the quality of plant-based diets. Diet quality indices have been developed as tools to evaluate adherence to specific dietary patterns or guidelines. These indices provide a systematic approach for quantifying an individual's adherence to recommended food groups and nutrient intakes.
However, due to variations in design and components across different diet quality indices specifically targeting plant-based diets, there is a need for a comprehensive review that synthesizes existing indices in order to identify common features as well as strengths and considerations associated with their development.
Therefore, this paper aims to address this research gap by conducting a scoping review on approaches used to develop plant-based diet quality indices. By examining their basis for development, scoring methodology,and validation approaches,this review will provide valuable insights into existing literature on plant-based diet quality measures.
To achieve this objective,a systematic search will be performed utilizing three major databases: MEDLINE,CINAHL,and Global Health,dating from 1980 onwards.Following pre-defined inclusi
on/exclusion criteria,the articles included will undergo thorough analysis.
The findings from this scoping review will contribute significantly towards enhancing our understanding regarding various aspects related
to developing robust measures for assessing the quality
of plant-based diets.The key areas covered within this analysis include determining whether these indices are derived from epidemiological evidence, whether they have incorporated existing diet quality measures or country-specific dietary guidelines,and whether they are based on traditional dietary patterns. Additionally,this review will focus on identifying the food groups most commonly included in these indices and the scoring methodologies employed to differentiate between healthier and less healthy plant-based foods.Lastly,the validation approaches utilized by these indices will be scrutinized,with a particular emphasis on construct validity,reliability,and criterion validity.
The findings of this review will serve as an essential guide for researchers and practitioners interested in evaluating adherence to plant-based dietary patterns. By understanding the strengths and limitations associated with different approaches used to develop plant-based diet quality indices, healthcare professionals can make informed decisions when selecting appropriate instruments for research contexts or clinical practice. Moreover, through highlighting areas that require further investigation or refinement, this scoping review will provide future research directions aimed at establishing consensus guidelines towards assessing the quality of plant-based diets consistently.
In conclusion,the importance of promoting healthy eating habits is widely recognized,and as more individuals shift towards plant-based diets to improve their health,it becomes crucial to have standardized measures that accurately assess adherence to such dietary patterns.This scoping review aims to fill a critical research gap by providing a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature on approaches used to develop plant-based diet quality indices.With its findings,this study hopes not only to advance knowledge but also facilitate evidence-informed decision-making among researchers,care providers,policy makers,and individuals seeking guidance regarding food selection for optimal health within the realm of plant-based diets. 
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as novel and promising tools in the field of cardiovascular research. These small, lipid bilayer-enclosed structures are released by various cell types and are known to play a critical role in intercellular communication. EVs have been implicated in a wide range of biological processes, including immune regulation, stem cell maintenance, and cancer progression. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in understanding the roles of EVs in atherosclerosis - a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the build-up of plaques within arterial walls.
Atherosclerosis remains one of the leading causes of death globally, with its associated complications such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke causing significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in medical therapies for atherosclerosis, there is still an unmet need for reliable biomarkers that can aid early diagnosis and risk stratification. Additionally, better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis could open up new avenues for therapeutic intervention.
The ability to detect diseases at their earliest stages using non-invasive biomarkers is an important goal for researchers globally. Traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on invasive procedures such as coronary angiography or intravascular ultrasound which carry inherent risks to patients. EVs offer a potential alternative due to their stability in bodily fluids such as blood and urine, easy accessibility through minimally invasive procedures like phlebotomy or urine collection, as well as their ability to carry specific cargo molecules reflective of their cell source.
In recent years, numerous studies have implicated EVs in different stages of atherosclerosis pathogenesis. These vesicles are now recognized to contribute to key processes driving disease progression including endothelial dysfunction - an initial event triggered by factors such as high blood pressure or dyslipidemia that leads to recruitment and activation of immune cells within the arterial wall; inflammation – involving infiltration and activation macrophages; lipid accumulation - leading to the formation of foam cells; and plaque destabilization that can result in acute cardiovascular events. The precise mechanisms through which EVs mediate these actions are multifaceted, with studies demonstrating their ability to transfer bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and microRNAs (miRNAs) between cells.
However, despite significant progress in our understanding of EVs in atherosclerosis, several important gaps remain. For instance, more research is needed to establish the specific types of EVs involved in different stages of atherosclerosis pathogenesis and how their cargo composition might vary at different disease stages. Additionally, there is a need for standardized methods for isolation and characterization of EVs from various biological fluids given their diversity in size, composition and surface markers. Moreover, investigation into how interactions between circulating EVs and components within the arterial wall contribute to disease progression would provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets.
In conclusion, this introduction highlights the emerging role of EVs as diagnostic biomarkers and modulators of atherosclerosis pathogenesis. Understanding the specific contributions made by different types of EVs at various stages of disease progression could lead to the development of novel diagnostic tools and targeted therapies aimed at reducing mortality from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Investigating these aspects will require well-designed studies utilizing relevant animal models coupled with analyses on human samples derived from large prospective cohorts to yield translational data that can be readily translated into clinical practice. 
Introduction
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia worldwide, affecting millions of people and leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Conduction system pacing (CSP) has emerged as a novel delivery method for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT), offering an alternative to conventional biventricular epicardial (BiV) pacing in indicated patients. While there is increasing popularity and widespread use of CSP, its specific role in patients with AF remains poorly understood.
AF is often associated with heart failure (HF), a condition that affects approximately 26 million people globally. The presence of AF in HF patients represents a significant challenge due to its adverse impact on cardiac function and electrical conduction. It has been shown that the loss of atrial contraction during AF contributes to incomplete ventricular filling, leading to compromised hemodynamics and subsequent worsening of HF symptoms.
Traditionally, BiV pacing has been used as an effective therapy for HF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. However, the efficacy of BiV pacing can be limited in the presence of AF since atrial sensing may not be consistently reliable during episodes of irregular rhythm. As a result, there is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches such as CSP for the management of HF patients with concomitant AF.
In this hypothetical research study, we aim to investigate the role and effectiveness of CSP specifically in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. We hypothesize that CSP may offer superior outcomes in terms of electrical resynchronization compared to conventional BiV pacing methods.
To address this research question comprehensively, we will first examine mechanistic evidence supporting the importance of sinus rhythm (SR) during CSP therapy by allowing for adjustment of atrioventricular delays (AVD). By optimizing AVD settings based on SR rather than irregular rhythm patterns associated with AF, it is anticipated that more precise synchronization between atria and ventricles can be achieved, ultimately leading to improved cardiac function.
Furthermore, we will review the existing clinical evidence related to CSP in patients who have undergone atrioventricular nodal ablation (AVNA) for AF. AVNA is performed in selected individuals with drug-refractory AF and aims to control heart rate by removing the atrioventricular node and introducing ventricular pacing as the primary mode of rhythm control. Investigating CSP outcomes in this specific patient population will provide valuable insights into its efficacy when employed as a treatment strategy following an ablative procedure.
To address potential hurdles and gaps in the current literature, we will also discuss how future research studies can be designed to ascertain the efficacy of CSP in patients with AF and HF. This may involve conducting large-scale randomized controlled trials comparing BiV pacing with CSP among AF patients or evaluating long-term outcomes through prospective cohort studies.
In conclusion, understanding the role of CSP specifically in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies for this challenging population. By exploring mechanistic evidence, analyzing clinical data from AVNA recipients, and proposing avenues for further research, this study aims to contribute significant insights into improving cardiac resynchronization therapy approaches tailored to those affected by both HF and AF. 
Introduction:
The intersection of traditional medicine and digitalization has emerged as a new paradigm in healthcare, offering unique opportunities and challenges for the management of acute heart failure. Acute heart failure continues to be a significant global health concern, with high disease-related morbidity and mortality rates. As such, there is an increasing need for novel strategies to address this pressing issue.
Traditional collegiate therapies have played a crucial role in the treatment of acute heart failure. However, recent developments in digital healthcare present promising prospects for further enhancing management strategies through the integration of Western and Chinese medicine. By combining these two distinct medical systems, there is potential to revolutionize the approach towards acute heart failure management.
Acute heart failure encompasses a range of conditions involving the sudden inability of the heart to pump blood effectively. It is characterized by symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, fluid retention, and impaired organ perfusion (1). Despite advancements in conventional medical practices including drug therapy, device interventions like implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), mechanical circulatory support devices (e.g., ventricular assist devices), cardiac transplantation, and invasive procedures like coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), acute heart failure remains difficult to manage effectively.
Digitalization has brought forth new possibilities for improving healthcare outcomes through advanced technological interventions. The incorporation of digital tools into medical practice enables precise monitoring and analysis of patient data pertaining to vital signs such as blood pressure variations, electrocardiogram patterns, body temperature fluctuations among others. This real-time data can provide clinicians with valuable insights into disease progression trends leading up to acute episodes or early warning signs that may predict deterioration or exacerbation.
Furthermore, by fostering seamless communication between patients and healthcare providers through telemedicine platforms or remote monitoring systems enables remote consultation incorporating elements from both Western medicine practiced globally alongside traditional Chinese medicine approaches largely practiced in Eastern countries. This approach to management addresses barriers like geography, accessibility, and availability of healthcare resources.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers a unique perspective on health and disease management. It has been practiced for thousands of years and encompasses a holistic approach to patient care. TCM places significant emphasis on preventive measures, aiming to maintain the balance between Yin and Yang energy forces within the body. In contrast, Western medicine tends to focus more on diagnosis and treatment after symptoms arise.
The combination of Western medicine with TCM in acute heart failure management holds considerable potential as it can leverage the strengths of both systems. By incorporating elements from TCM such as acupuncture, herbal remedies, dietary modifications specific to individual constitution types (e.g., Qi deficiency or blood stasis), alongside Western therapies like pharmacotherapeutics or device interventions based on evidence-based guidelines can introduce an integrative model for comprehensive patient care.
This article aims to review the current status and subdisciplinary impact of digitization in healthcare specifically concerning acute heart failure management using combined Chinese and Western medical therapies. Furthermore, it seeks to explore the future prospects for this novel approach by investigating how digital tools integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine with Western treatment modalities can further support cardiovascular health maintenance in populations affected by acute heart failure globally.
In conclusion, acute heart failure poses significant challenges for global healthcare systems due to its high morbidity and mortality rates. The integration of traditional collegiate therapies with digitalization presents a unique opportunity for addressing these challenges from a combined Chinese-Western medical perspective. By leveraging real-time data monitoring technologies alongside incorporating traditional Chinese medicine practices into Western treatment approaches through advanced technological interventions may facilitate personalized care plans tailored specifically towards holistic improvement in cardiovascular health outcomes across diverse populations affected by acute heart failure worldwide.

Title: The Impact of Gut Microbiota on Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Tumor Development
Abstract:
Metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a hallmark of tumorigenesis, with growing evidence supporting the association between abnormal lipid metabolism and the development and progression of various diseases. Abnormal lipid metabolism is not only linked to numerous pathological conditions but is also increasing in prevalence among individuals. Lipid homeostasis plays a crucial role in regulating oncogenic signaling pathways during tumor initiation, growth, invasion, and metastasis. The specific patterns of lipid metabolism alterations observed among different tumor types are influenced by multiple factors including tumor origin, aberrant regulation of lipid metabolic pathways, and dietary habits. This comprehensive review focuses on elucidating the synthesis and regulatory pathways behind lipids while discussing recent advancements regarding cholesterol, triglycerides, sphingolipids as well as other relevant aspects such as lipid rafts, adipocytes, lipid droplets, and their association with tumors' drug resistance. Furthermore, this review aims to identify current limitations within this field of research while exploring potential molecular targets related to abnormal lipid metabolism for improved cancer management.
1. Introduction
The human gut harbors a diverse ecosystem comprising trillions of microbial cells collectively referred to as the gut microbiota (GM). Over the past decade or so there has been an exponential increase in our understanding about how GM influences various aspects of human physiology and pathology beyond direct involvement in digestion or nutrient absorption alone (1). Mounting evidence suggests that alterations within GM composition can significantly impact host metabolic processes including nutrient utilization (2), energy homeostasis (3), immune responses (4), inflammation regulation (5), neurodevelopmental disorders (6), psychiatric illnesses (7) as well as carcinogenesis itself.
Emerging studies have started highlighting compelling associations between GM composition remodeling with perturbations seen in host systemic metabolic profiles such as those involving carbohydrates/lipids/amino acids (8). Several preclinical studies utilizing germ-free mice, fecal microbiota transplantation experiments, and antibiotic-treated mouse models, collectively imply that gut dysbiosis plays a crucial role in promoting host metabolic disorders (9), including obesity (10), type 2 diabetes mellitus (11), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (12) and cardiovascular diseases (13).
Given the profound implications of abnormal lipid metabolism on tumor development as outlined within the seminal review by Xu et al. titled "Association between abnormal lipid metabolism and tumor" it is therefor reasonable to contemplate how gut dysbiosis-induced lipidome remodeling can influence tumorigenesis. Although significant advances have been made in identifying various genetic mutations leading to aberrant lipid metabolism within tumors, recent investigations hypothesize that microbial metabolites derived from GM could modulate precise cellular pathways responsible for regulating host cholesterol/lipid homeostasis.
Thus, this comprehensive review aims to delve into the intricate interplay between GM-related signaling molecules/metabolites and host lipidomic perturbations during tumorigenesis. Specifically, we will discuss how microbial alterations induce aberrant hepatic/bile acid synthesis or trigger inflammation cascades ultimately influencing systemic levels of lipids involved in cancer pathophysiology. Furthermore, this manuscript will explore bidirectional molecular dialogues existing between GM-changed-fueling-for-abnormal-lipid-metabolism/lipid-induced-tumor-promoting-microenvironment that contribute towards cancer progression.
To achieve these objectives effectively and comprehensively, we will first present an overview illustrating the association between abnormal lipid metabolism with tumorigenicity highlighted by previous studies outlined in Xu's article. Subsequently, we will focus on elucidating the role of gut microbiota as a mediator influencing host systemic levels of lipids implicated in tumorigenesis with specific emphasis on bile acids-mediated regulations or immunomodulatory effects exerted through short-chain fatty acids production such as propionate, butyrate or acetate. Furthermore, this manuscript is aimed at critically evaluating current research limitations and future directions which could potentially unveil new therapeutic targets within the fascinating field of gut microbiota-implicated alterations in host lipid metabolism for more effective tumor management strategies.
In conclusion, unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms involved in GM-driven perturbations to host lipid metabolism may open up novel avenues for improving preventive/treatment strategies against tumor development. Ultimately, targeting dysregulation of lipid homeostasis mediated by GM signaling molecules/metabolites demonstrates promising prospects as part of multifaceted approaches towards enhanced cancer prognosis and survival rates. 
Introduction
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels due to the body's inability to effectively use or produce insulin. The prevalence of T2D has been steadily increasing worldwide, resulting in significant public health burdens and economic costs. It is estimated that around 415 million adults globally have T2D, and this number is expected to rise to 642 million by 2040 (1).
Controlling blood glucose levels is crucial in managing T2D and preventing its associated complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, neuropathy, and retinopathy. While metformin has been widely used as the first-line therapy for T2D due to its effectiveness in lowering blood glucose levels, achieving optimal glycemic control remains a challenge for many patients (2). Furthermore, metformin monotherapy may not adequately address the clinical symptoms experienced by individuals with T2D.
Jinlida granules are a traditional Chinese medicine formulation that has gained attention for its potential therapeutic benefits in managing T2D. Previous studies have shown promising results regarding the ability of Jinlida granules to lower blood glucose levels when used alone or as an adjunct therapy alongside metformin (3). However, there is limited research exploring their impact on the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and improvement of clinical symptoms experienced by patients with T2D.
The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of Jinlida granules combined with metformin in improving both the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and clinical symptoms among patients with type 2 diabetes who experience specific symptoms such as thirst, fatigue, increased eating with rapid hungering, polyuria, dry mouth,
spontaneous sweating, night sweat,
vexing heat in the chest,
palms,
and soles,
and constipation.
Understanding how Jinlida granules may complement conventional therapies like metformin in improving the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and managing clinical symptoms is essential for optimizing treatment outcomes for patients with T2D. The findings from this study may also contribute to expanding the current therapeutic options available to patients, enabling healthcare providers to offer more personalized and comprehensive care.
Based on previous research demonstrating promising results regarding the blood glucose-lowering effects of Jinlida granules in T2D patients, we hypothesized that the combination of Jinlida granules with metformin would lead to a higher standard-reaching rate of blood glucose compared to metformin monotherapy. Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether there were improvements in various clinical symptoms associated with T2D among individuals receiving Jinlida granules as adjuvant therapy.
To address these research questions, data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be analyzed. The primary outcomes of interest include the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and changes in clinical symptoms following intervention with Jinlida granules combined with metformin compared to placebo combined with metformin.
The findings from this study may pave the way for further investigations into alternative or adjunct treatments that can enhance glycemic control and improve clinical symptoms experienced by individuals living with type 2 diabetes. Ultimately, these interventions have great potential to improve patient quality of life and reduce long-term complications associated with inadequately managed diabetes. 
1. Introduction
Pancreatic islet dysfunction is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus (DM), a systemic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia and impaired insulin secretion. Emerging evidence suggests that intercellular and interorgan communication mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) plays a critical role in the regulation of pancreatic islet function, as well as the maintenance of glucose homeostasis under physiological conditions. Furthermore, alterations in EV-mediated communication have been implicated in the pathogenesis of DM, including autoimmune responses, insulin resistance, and β-cell failure.
While significant progress has been made in understanding the role of EVs in various cellular processes, their specific involvement in pancreatic islets remains an area requiring further investigation. This article aims to explore the potential impact of EV-mediated intercellular and interorgan crosstalk on pancreatic islet biology with a particular focus on its implications for DM development, diagnosis, and treatment.
1.1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Global Health Challenge
Diabetes mellitus imposes an enormous burden on global health due to its rising prevalence and associated complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness, and lower limb amputations (International Diabetes Federation [IDF], 2019). It affects over 460 million individuals worldwide and is projected to affect approximately 700 million people by 2045 (IDF Atlas Ninth Edition). Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90% of all cases globally; however, its exact etiology remains multifactorial with complex interactions between genetic susceptibility factors and environmental triggers such as obesity. 
1.2 Pancreatic Islets: Key Players in Glucose Homeostasis
Pancreatic islets or Islets of Langerhans are clusters of endocrine cells scattered throughout the pancreas that regulate glucose homeostasis through coordinated hormone secretion (Morales-Alvarez et al.,2020). These cells include β-cells responsible for insulin secretion, α-cells that produce glucagon, δ-cells that release somatostatin, and other islet cell types contributing to hormonal balance. Insulin secretion by β-cells is essential for maintaining euglycemia as it facilitates glucose uptake in peripheral tissues and suppresses hepatic glucose production. 
1.3 Extracellular Vesicles: Novel Signaling Entities
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-enclosed particles released by various cell types into the extracellular environment (Yáñez-Mó et al., 2015). Due to their ability to encapsulate and transfer proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites between cells, EVs have emerged as potent mediators of intercellular communication in both physiological and pathological contexts.
1.4 EV-Mediated Intercellular Crosstalk of Pancreatic Islets
Recent studies have provided evidence supporting the importance of EV-mediated intercellular communication in the regulation of pancreatic islet function (Chen et al., 2019). EVs released by β-cells exhibit a complex cargo including bioactive molecules such as microRNAs, proteins involved in insulin synthesis and exocytosis machinery components. These cargoes can be transferred to neighboring β-cells or other pancreatic endocrine cells within the islet microenvironment through EV-mediated pathways.
1.5 Interorgan Crosstalk Mediated by Pancreatic Islet-derived EVs
Apart from facilitating local signaling within pancreatic islets themselves, emerging evidence highlights a previously unrecognized role for pancreatic islet-derived EVs in mediating interorgan crosstalk with peripheral tissues crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis (Mahdipour et al., 2020). These circulating EVs can travel via blood circulation or lymphatics to mutually communicate with distant organs including adipose tissue, liver skeletal muscle affected in DM pathogenesis.
In conclusion, understanding the complex interplay between EV-mediated intercellular and interorgan communication in pancreatic islets could provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, unraveling the mechanisms underlying EV cargo packaging, release, targeting processes, and their functional consequences may reveal potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for DM. This review aims to consolidate current knowledge on EVs' involvement in pancreatic islet biology under physiological conditions while unveiling their potential as diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents for DM management.

Title: Exploring the Influence of Concomitant Medications on the Cardiovascular Outcomes of SGLT-2 Inhibitors in Heart Failure Randomized Controlled Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
Abstract: Patients with heart failure (HF) often require multiple medications to manage their condition effectively, including sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that SGLT-2is are effective in reducing the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for HF. However, limited research has been conducted to investigate whether concomitant medication use influences these cardiovascular outcomes. This study aims to systematically assess the potential impact of concomitant medications on the effectiveness of SGLT-2is on primary composite outcomes among patients with HF.
1. Introduction
Heart failure is a chronic progressive condition characterized by impaired cardiac function, resulting in inadequate blood flow to meet the body's metabolic demands. It imposes substantial morbidity and mortality burdens globally, making it a significant public health concern (Ponikowski et al., 2016). Sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), initially developed as antihyperglycemic agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), have recently emerged as effective therapeutic options for patients with HF irrespective of DM status.
Randomized controlled trials investigating SGLT-2i therapy have consistently demonstrated reductions in major cardiovascular adverse events, including hospitalizations for HF and cardiovascular death in patients both with and without underlying DM (McMurray et al., 2019; Zelniker et al., 2019). Nevertheless, while these trials have provided valuable insights into the efficacy and safety profiles of SGLT-2is across diverse patient populations, there remains an important knowledge gap regarding potential variations in treatment response based on concurrent medication therapies.
Concomitant medications frequently prescribed alongside SGLT-2is for heart failure management include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and diuretics. These agents exert their effects via different mechanisms, targeting various pathways involved in the pathophysiology of heart failure. There is evidence to suggest that certain medications may interact synergistically with SGLT-2is, leading to enhanced clinical benefits, while others may attenuate or even abolish their therapeutic effects.
Preliminary data from observational studies have indicated that concomitant use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) and beta-blockers might modify the outcomes associated with SGLT-2i therapy in patients with HF (McMurray et al., 2020; Udell et al., 2018). This suggests potential interactions between these drug classes and SGLT-2is at the molecular level or through shared physiological pathways involved in cardiac remodeling, neurohormonal regulation, and renal function.
However, these studies present conflicting results and methodological limitations due to their non-randomized nature. To date, no comprehensive systematic review or meta-analysis has systematically explored the impact of concurrent medication use on cardiovascular outcomes among patients treated with SGLT-2is for HF through RCTs. Therefore, this current study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs investigating the influence of concomitant medications on primary composite outcomes in HF patients receiving SGLT-2i therapy.
The findings from this study will help elucidate whether specific medication combinations can augment or hinder the therapeutic efficacy of SGLT-2is in HF patients. Such insights are crucial for guiding individualized treatment decisions aimed at optimizing patient outcomes. Moreover, it has implications for developing evidence-based guidelines and clinical practice recommendations to ensure the effective and safe use of SGLT-2is in patients with HF.
In conclusion, this study endeavors to provide valuable insights into the influence of concomitant medication use on cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving SGLT-2i therapy for heart failure. By systematically synthesizing data from RCTs, this research aims to enhance our understanding of how different medication combinations impact the effectiveness of SGLT-2is and guide clinicians in optimizing therapies for individual patients. Ultimately, these findings will contribute towards improving patient outcomes and inform future guidelines regarding the management of heart failure.
