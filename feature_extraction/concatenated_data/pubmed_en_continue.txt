Sea cucumbers, classified as echinoderms, are benthic marine invertebrates that play a crucial role in marine ecosystems. They are known for their unique morphology and important ecological functions such as nutrient recycling and sediment stabilization (Kornicker, 1975). Additionally, sea cucumbers possess immense commercial value due to their use as a delicacy and in traditional medicine. Processed sea cucumbers, commonly referred to as "Beche-de-mer," have long been highly sought after in southeast Asian countries.
The global demand for sea cucumbers has led to the overexploitation of wild stocks, jeopardizing their populations worldwide. This unsustainable harvesting has raised concerns about the future availability of this resource. To address this issue and ensure the sustainable use of sea cucumbers, aquaculture techniques have been developed for commercially important species like Holothuria scabra (the sandfish). These efforts not only aid the conservation of wild stocks but also contribute to international trade.
In the Arabian Peninsula and Iran region—comprising countries such as Oman, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and United Arab Emirates (UAE)—studies on sea cucumbers have been relatively limited compared to other regions with similar marine environments. The major land mass is surrounded by marginal seas including the Arabian/Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea Gulf of Aden Red Sea), providing diverse habitats for various marine organisms.
Historical research trends indicate that this region houses a relatively impoverished diversity of sea cucumber species compared to other parts of the world. A total of 82 species have been reported in this area so far (Froese & Pauly., 2021). This low diversity may be attributed to environmental extremes present in these regions such as high salinity levels or temperature fluctuations.
Despite their perceived lower economic value compared to oil or other industries prevalent within these countries' economies—such as Oman, Saudi Arabia, or UAE—marine resources like sea cucumbers can still contribute significantly to local livelihoods and national economies. Artisanal fisheries targeting sea cucumbers do exist in several of these countries, with Yemen and UAE playing critical roles in their collection and subsequent export to southeast Asian countries where demand is high.
However, further research indicates that natural stocks of sea cucumbers have been depleted in some areas such as Saudi Arabia and Oman. This calls for urgent stock assessment measures to ensure the sustainable management of these resources. Fortunately, successful aquaculture trials have been conducted not only in Saudi Arabia and Oman but also in Iran, opening opportunities for further expansion to supplement wild stocks.
Researchers from Iran have also focused on exploring the ecotoxicological properties and bioactive substances found within different species of sea cucumbers. Such studies demonstrate an immense potential for research on these organisms' useful properties beyond their economic value.
Despite ongoing research efforts, there are still gaps that need attention within the field of sea cucumber research in this region. Areas such as molecular phylogeny—the study of evolutionary relationships using genetic data—should be prioritized to better understand the biodiversity patterns among species present here. Additionally, investigating relevant biological aspects such as reproductive behavior or trophic interactions will offer valuable insights into their ecology.
The use of sea cucumbers in bioremediation—a process that utilizes living organisms to remove pollutants from contaminated environments—is another area worthy of investigation given its potential applications both locally and globally (Patel et al., 2017). Furthermore, characterizing bioactive compounds found within different species may provide opportunities for pharmaceutical development or utilization in other industries.
To address these gaps effectively while ensuring the conservation and sustainable management of sea cucumber populations within the region, it is essential to foster regional cooperation, networking among researchers working on similar topics or geographical areas. Collaborative efforts can aid knowledge sharing between countries resulting in improved research outcomes and management strategies. Additionally, investing in training programs and capacity-building initiatives will enhance the expertise of scientists working on sea cucumber research in this region.
In conclusion, sea cucumbers represent a valuable marine resource with both ecological and commercial significance. While research on sea cucumbers within the Arabian Peninsula and Iran region has been limited compared to other areas, there are opportunities for expansion and collaboration to fill these gaps. By addressing areas such as stock assessment, aquaculture development, molecular phylogeny, ecotoxicology studies, bioremediation applications, and characterization of bioactive compounds among others—this region can contribute significantly to global efforts aimed at conserving these unique marine organisms while ensuring their sustainable use for generations to come.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and deadly malignancies worldwide. It is well established that dysregulated lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in the development and progression of CRC. Lipids, including phospholipids, cholesterol, fatty acids, and sphingolipids, are essential components of cell membranes and also serve as intermediates in various intracellular signaling pathways.
Abnormal lipid metabolism in CRC cells contributes to tumor initiation, growth, invasion, and metastasis. One characteristic feature of CRC is the increased uptake and accumulation of lipids by cancer cells. This can be attributed to upregulated expression or activity of proteins responsible for lipid transport across the plasma membrane, such as fatty acid transporters (FATPs) or scavenger receptors.
Furthermore, altered expression levels or activities of enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis (DNL), such as ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), have been observed in CRC tissues compared to normal colon tissues. DNL refers to the synthesis of fatty acids from non-lipid precursors like glucose or glutamine.
Additionally, dysregulated lipid metabolism impacts several signaling pathways involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. For instance, increased levels of lipids can activate mTORC1 signaling through direct interaction with its regulatory protein Ragulator complex. Notably inhibited AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway has been reported because it negatively regulates DNL enzymes ACC and FASN.
Importantly, tumor microenvironment components also contribute to remodeling lipid metabolism in CRC cells through various mechanisms. Immune cells infiltrating tumors produce cytokines that directly influence lipid metabolism in cancer cells by altering gene expression or enzyme activities involved in lipogenesis processes.
For example immune cell-derived cytokines such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) have been shown to stimulate lipid accumulation in CRC cells by promoting de novo lipogenesis and inhibiting fatty acid oxidation. These cytokines can activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) or nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways, leading to the upregulation of DNL enzyme expression.
Moreover, immune cells can modify the lipid composition of the tumor microenvironment by releasing extracellular vesicles containing lipids. These vesicles are taken up by cancer cells and can alter their metabolic phenotype. For instance, macrophages release exosomes rich in cholesterol which are internalized by CRC cells promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.
In addition to immune cells, other components of the tumor microenvironment such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also contribute to lipid metabolism remodeling in CRC cells. CAFs provide a niche for cancer stem-like cells that possess high tumorigenic potential through paracrine signaling molecules like prostaglandins PGE2 that promote DNL enzyme activity.
Furthermore, alterations in nutrient availability within the tumor microenvironment can impact lipid metabolism in CRC cells. For instance reduced glucose levels due to increased glycolysis may lead to an increased reliance on alternative energy sources like fatty acids for cancer cell survival.
Overall, understanding the crosstalk between lipid metabolism remodeling in CRC cells and components of the tumor microenvironment provides promising opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Targeting dysregulated lipogenesis pathways or modifying immune cell functions could be potential strategies for preventing or treating colorectal cancer. 
Wilms tumour (WT) is the most common type of kidney cancer in children, accounting for approximately 95% of all pediatric renal tumors. It typically occurs in children between the ages of 2 to 5 years and is characterized by abnormal embryonic kidney development. The current standard for diagnosing WT involves imaging techniques such as ultrasound or MRI, followed by a biopsy to confirm the presence of malignant cells. However, these methods can be invasive and may not always be accurate.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-protein-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. They have been implicated in various biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that miRNA expression profiles can be altered in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting their potential as diagnostic biomarkers.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify dysregulated circulating miRNAs in WT through an extensive search of published literature. We searched multiple databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web-of-Science, and Wiley online library for studies reporting on circulating miRNAs related to WT. Articles published in English or French were included in our analysis.
Using the PRISMA guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we identified a total of five articles that met our inclusion criteria. These articles included data from 172 patients with WT and 108 healthy controls. Based on this data set, we identified a total of 301 dysregulated miRNAs associated with WT.
Of these dysregulated miRNAs, we found that 144 were up-regulated (meaning their expression levels were higher than normal), while 143 were down-regulated (meaning their expression levels were lower than normal). Additionally, there were 14 conflicting miRNAs whose dysregulation status varied across different studies.
To assess the diagnostic potential of these dysregulated miRNAs, we performed a meta-analysis to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of miRNAs for WT diagnosis. We included data from two studies that reported on the dysregulation of 49 miRNAs in WT patients. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated to be 0.67 and 0.95, respectively, indicating a reasonable accuracy in diagnosing WT.
Furthermore, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) for these dysregulated miRNAs, which provides an overall measure of their diagnostic potential. The AUC was found to be 0.77, suggesting that these circulating miRNAs have a moderate ability to distinguish between patients with WT and healthy controls.
Overall, our findings suggest that circulating miRNAs hold promise as potential biomarkers for diagnosing WT. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and investigate associations between specific miRNA expression profiles and tumor stage or subtype.
In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provide insights into the dysregulated circulating miRNA profiles associated with WT. These findings highlight the potential of using circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for WT and emphasize the need for further research in this field. Identifying reliable biomarkers could significantly improve early detection rates, aiding in better prognosis determination and disease-monitoring strategies for children with Wilms tumour.
 Additionally, the use of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for WT could have significant clinical implications. Currently, the diagnosis of WT relies on imaging techniques and invasive procedures such as biopsies. These methods can be time-consuming, costly, and may carry potential risks for the young patients undergoing them. Furthermore, there is always a need to improve diagnostic accuracy in order to initiate appropriate treatment strategies promptly.
If validated and implemented into clinical practice, circulating miRNAs could offer a minimally invasive and reliable tool for diagnosing WT. Blood samples are easily accessible compared to tissue samples, making them more convenient for monitoring patient response to treatment or detecting disease recurrence.
In addition to their potential as diagnostic biomarkers, dysregulated miRNAs may also hold prognostic value in WT. The expression levels of specific miRNAs might correlate with tumor stage or subtype and provide valuable information regarding patient outcomes. Understanding these associations could help tailor treatment plans according to each patient's unique characteristics.
Moreover, monitoring changes in circulating miRNA levels over time may aid in disease surveillance and response assessment during therapy. By evaluating dynamic alterations in miRNA expression patterns throughout treatment, clinicians could gain insights into the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions on an individual basis.
However, several challenges remain before circulating miRNAs can be widely adopted as clinical biomarkers for WT. First and foremost is the need for further validation studies using larger cohorts from diverse populations. The studies included in our analysis had relatively small sample sizes; thus, replication of findings is crucial to establish robust evidence.
Additionally, standardization of methodologies is necessary to ensure consistency across different laboratories when measuring circulating miRNA levels. Variations in RNA isolation protocols or quantification methods can introduce variability that might affect reproducibility across studies.
Furthermore, future research should focus on identifying specific subsets of dysregulated miRNAs that show consistent alterations across different cohorts while avoiding those with conflicting results observed between studies.
In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the potential of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for WT. The dysregulated expression patterns observed in these short, non-protein-coding RNAs indicate their involvement in the pathogenesis of WT and their potential clinical utility.
However, further research is needed to validate these findings and assess their generalizability across different populations. Standardization of methodologies is also essential to ensure reproducibility and comparability between studies.
Overall, if successfully implemented into clinical practice, circulating miRNAs have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis, subtyping/prognostication, and disease monitoring strategies for patients with Wilms tumour. These advancements could lead to earlier detection, personalized treatment approaches, improved patient outcomes, and ultimately a better quality of life for children affected by this disease. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the controversial effects of smoking and nicotine on the susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that smokers are at a higher risk of COVID-19 due to the overexpression of host receptors necessary for viral entry, there are also reports indicating a lower incidence of the disease among smokers.
It is important to note that the effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke may not be interchangeable. Nicotine, which is found in tobacco products, has been reported to have a dual role in inflammation - it can both promote inflammation and have anti-inflammatory properties. This complicates our understanding of its impact on COVID-19 infection.
To gain insight into the effect of pure nicotine on cells involved in COVID-19 infection, we adopted an organ-based systematic approach. We examined how nicotine affects various organs involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis by considering 12 related diseases associated with these organs. This approach allowed us to assess whether nicotine has any protective or damaging effects on these organs.
It is crucial to differentiate between nicotine and cigarette smoke when conducting research on their effects. Generalizing their effects can introduce significant bias into studies, as they have distinct chemical compositions with potentially different impacts on health.
Moreover, it should be noted that the response to different doses of nicotine varies significantly. The effects observed may depend on the dosage administered, indicating a dose-dependent response. Therefore, it is essential to consider varying concentrations when studying the effect of nicotine on COVID-19 infection.
In addition to focusing solely on nicotine's role in COVID-19 infection, it is necessary to assess underlying diseases as well. Many individuals who smoke also suffer from comorbidities that could influence their susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taking into account these underlying conditions will allow for a more comprehensive understanding and facilitate targeted interventions for better treatment outcomes.
This study aims not only to investigate the effect of nicotine on cellular mechanisms involved in COVID-19 infection but also to provide a guideline for healthcare professionals. Understanding the role of nicotine and smoking in disease progression can guide healthcare providers in advising their patients and developing personalized approaches to treatment.
2. Methods
In this study, we utilized an organ-based systematic approach to investigate the effect of nicotine on damaged organs associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis. We reviewed literature and data regarding various diseases related to these organs, including lungs, heart, blood vessels, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, nervous system, etc.
We analyzed studies that investigated the specific effects of nicotine on these organs and how it may influence their susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By collating and critically evaluating existing research findings, we aimed to identify any patterns or correlations between nicotine exposure and organ damage or protection within the context of COVID-19 infection.
Furthermore, we considered comorbidities commonly associated with smokers such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), etc., as these conditions could potentially exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms or affect disease outcomes.
3. Results
The findings from our analysis will be presented comprehensively in subsequent sections and will shed light on whether nicotine has a protective or damaging effect on each organ involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. We will discuss both cellular responses specific to each organ as well as any overarching trends observed across multiple studies.
Additionally, we will explore potential interactions between underlying diseases prevalent among smokers and their impact on response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This comprehensive evaluation aims to provide healthcare professionals with valuable insights into how smoking habits may influence individual patient outcomes during the ongoing pandemic.
4. Discussion
The discussion section will delve deeper into our findings by contextualizing them within current scientific knowledge surrounding SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated pathophysiology. We will address the discrepancies in reported data regarding the effects of nicotine on susceptibility to COVID-19 and highlight potential reasons for these inconsistencies.
Furthermore, by considering the dual role of nicotine in inflammation and its diverse effects on different organs, we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of its impact on COVID-19 infection. This discussion will help elucidate the complexities surrounding smoking and nicotine use during this global health crisis.
5. Conclusion
The conclusion section will summarize our findings and their implications for both healthcare providers and individuals who smoke or use nicotine products. We will emphasize the importance of careful interpretation when generalizing the effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke, as well as considering varying doses.
Our study underscores the need for further research into understanding how smoking habits and nicotine exposure influence susceptibility, progression, and treatment outcomes in COVID-19 patients. By leveraging these insights, healthcare professionals can better support patients by providing tailored guidance to optimize their health outcomes during this pandemic.
In conclusion, exploring the controversial effects of smoking and nicotine in SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies and personalized treatments that take into account individual risk factors associated with smoking habits. 
Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common condition characterized by pain and dysfunction in the Achilles tendon. Exercise interventions have been widely used in the treatment of AT, and various types of exercises have been implemented to improve functional outcomes in this population. However, there is still limited understanding regarding the specific effects of different exercise treatments on improving specific functions, such as strength or range of motion.
This systematic review aimed to explore the impact of exercise treatments on different functional outcomes in individuals with mid-portion AT. A thorough search was conducted in electronic databases including Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to 21 February 2023. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) that investigated changes in plantar flexor function with exercise treatments were included.
Functional outcomes were categorized into three groups: kinetic parameters (e.g., strength), kinematic parameters (e.g., ankle range of motion), and sensorimotor parameters (e.g., balance index). The exercise treatments were classified into eccentric training, concentric training, or combined eccentric plus concentric training modes. The quality assessment was performed using established scales for RCTs and CCTs.
From the initial search results of 2,260 records, ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. Due to the heterogeneity among these studies, a qualitative synthesis was conducted rather than a meta-analysis.
The results showed that eccentric training led to significant improvements in power outcomes such as height during countermovement jumps as well as peak torque measures indicating enhanced strength. Concentric training also demonstrated moderate evidence for improved power outcomes but did not show any significant improvement in other functional measures like balance index. Interestingly, one high-quality study showed an improvement in balance index following eccentric training.
Combined training modalities did not yield any significant improvements in either strength or power outcomes compared to eccentric or concentric training alone. Kinematic analysis of plantarflexion and dorsiflexion range of motion did not show any relevant changes following exercise treatments.
In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrated that eccentric training is effective in improving strength outcomes in individuals with mid-portion AT. It also showed moderate evidence for improvements in power outcomes and the sensorimotor parameter "balance index". Concentric training can be considered as an alternative to improve power outcomes but does not seem to significantly affect other functional measures. Kinematic analysis of range of motion may not be a useful parameter for assessing treatment efficacy in individuals with mid-portion AT.
These findings highlight the importance of tailored exercise interventions for specific functional goals in individuals with mid-portion AT. Clinicians should consider incorporating eccentric training to improve strength outcomes while also considering concentric training as an alternative to target power improvements. Further research is needed to explore the optimal dosage and progression schemes for these exercise modalities, as well as their long-term effects on functional outcomes in this population. Additionally, it is worth noting that the included studies varied in terms of exercise protocols, duration of intervention, and outcome measures. This heterogeneity makes it challenging to make definitive conclusions about the most effective exercise treatment for mid-portion AT. Future studies should aim to use standardized protocols and outcome measures to enable better comparisons across different interventions.
The findings of this systematic review have important implications for clinical practice. Eccentric training has consistently shown positive effects on strength outcomes in mid-portion AT patients. This type of exercise involves lengthening the Achilles tendon under load, which has been hypothesized to promote tendon remodeling and improve strength. Clinicians should consider incorporating eccentric exercises such as heel drops or eccentric calf raises into their treatment plans for AT patients.
Concentric training, although showing moderate evidence for improving power outcomes, did not demonstrate significant improvements in other functional measures or balance index in this review. However, it may still have value as an alternative or supplementary approach to eccentric training when targeting power improvements is a priority.
The lack of significant changes in kinematic parameters (e.g., range of motion) following exercise treatments suggests that these measures may not be sensitive enough to assess treatment efficacy in individuals with mid-portion AT. Other factors such as pain levels and functional limitations may play a more critical role in determining treatment success.
It is also important to consider individual patient characteristics when designing exercise interventions for mid-portion AT. Factors such as age, activity level, comorbidities, and severity of symptoms can influence treatment response and adherence. A personalized approach that takes these factors into account is likely to yield better outcomes.
In conclusion, this systematic review provides valuable insights into the effects of exercise treatments on functional outcomes in individuals with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. Eccentric training has robust evidence supporting its effectiveness in improving strength outcomes while also showing moderate evidence for power improvements and balance index enhancement.
Clinicians should consider incorporating eccentric exercises into their treatment plans for mid-portion AT patients. Additionally, concentric training can be considered as an alternative or supplementary approach when targeting power improvements. Future research should focus on standardizing exercise protocols and outcome measures, as well as exploring the long-term effects of different exercise modalities on functional outcomes in this population. By advancing our understanding of the most effective exercise treatments for mid-portion AT, clinicians can optimize patient care and help individuals regain optimal function and quality of life. 
Food colorants play a crucial role in the food industry by enhancing the visual appeal of food products and influencing consumer preferences. They are widely used to make food more attractive, appetizing, and visually appealing. In India, the use of food colorants is prevalent across various sectors including processed foods, sweets, candies, beverages, dairy products, and confectionery.
In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for natural food colorants due to growing consumer awareness about health and safety concerns associated with synthetic food colorants (SFCs). Natural colorants are derived from plants or other natural sources and are considered safer alternatives to SFCs. However, the market for natural food colorants in India is still relatively small compared to SFCs.
2. Growth of the Food Colorant Market
Globally, the market for food colorants has witnessed significant growth in recent years. According to a report by Market Research Future (MRFR), the global food colors market is projected to reach USD 3.75 billion by 2023 with a CAGR of 8%. This growth can be attributed to factors such as increasing consumer demand for aesthetic appeal in foods and beverages as well as advancements in technology for producing natural colors.
In India too, there has been a steady growth in the demand for both natural and synthetic food colorants. The Indian market is estimated to be valued at around Rs 470 crore ($66 million) with synthetic colors dominating around 80% of the total market share. However, there is an emerging trend towards using natural colors driven by factors such as rising health consciousness among consumers and increasing regulatory scrutiny on SFCs.
3. Regulations on Food Colorants
The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is responsible for regulating all aspects related to food safety including standards for additives such as food colorants. FSSAI has set maximum limits on the use of synthetic colorants in various food categories to ensure safe consumption.
However, there have been several cases of the illegal use of banned food colorants in India, leading to health hazards for consumers. The adulteration of natural food colorants with synthetic ones is also a common practice. Moreover, some manufacturers mislabel their products by falsely claiming them to be natural when they contain synthetic colors. This lack of compliance and enforcement poses a threat to public health and consumer trust.
4. Potential Solutions
To address these challenges, it is crucial to raise awareness among consumers about the risks associated with SFCs and the benefits of using natural colorants. Educating consumers about reading labels and identifying natural colors can empower them to make informed choices.
Additionally, there is a need for stricter regulations and standards for both the production and use of natural food colorants. These regulations should ensure quality control measures throughout the supply chain including sourcing raw materials, manufacturing processes, packaging, storage, transportation, labeling, and advertising.
Renewed policy measures are also necessary to determine permissible limits for both synthetic and natural food colorants based on scientific evidence regarding their safety profiles. Regular monitoring and testing by regulatory authorities will help detect any non-compliance or adulteration practices in the market.
Furthermore, there is a need for stringent rules to restrict the production of toxic SFCs which pose health risks when consumed in excessive amounts or over long periods.
To assist consumers in making informed choices while purchasing products containing natural colors, it is recommended that a logo be developed specifically indicating the presence of natural colorants on packaging labels. This simple symbol can enhance transparency in labeling practices and help build consumer trust towards such products.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, there is an urgent need for comprehensive policies and regulations governing the use of food colorants in India. Greater vigilance from regulatory authorities coupled with increased awareness among consumers about safe consumption practices are necessary steps towards ensuring a healthier and more transparent food colorant market in India. By promoting the use of natural colors and discouraging the illegal use of synthetic ones, India can pave the way for a sustainable and responsible food industry that prioritizes consumer well-being. 
Blockchain technology has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various industries, including the food sector. Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that allows for the secure and transparent storage and transfer of data. This technology has the potential to address some of the challenges faced by the food industry, particularly when it comes to food safety and traceability concerns related to livestock products.
Livestock products account for a significant portion of agri-foods traded globally, with more than fifteen percent of total trade. As the global demand for food continues to rise, ensuring food safety becomes increasingly important. The traditional supply chain in the livestock industry often lacks transparency and accountability, making it difficult to trace and identify potential sources of contamination or safety issues.
Food safety authorities around the world have recognized the importance of complete traceability in ensuring safe food production. However, current systems rely heavily on paperwork and invoices that can be easily manipulated or tampered with. This lack of transparency makes it challenging for regulators to track products back to their origin in case of a recall or safety issue.
Blockchain technology offers a solution by providing an immutable record of transactions that cannot be altered or tampered with. By implementing blockchain systems, each transaction along the supply chain can be recorded on a decentralized ledger accessible to all participants in real-time. This allows for complete visibility into every stage of production and distribution, from farm to fork.
The use cases for blockchain technology in the food sector are growing rapidly across different regions worldwide. Through blockchain's tamper-proof nature, credibility is ensured as all data recorded on the distributed ledger is permanent and cannot be modified without consensus from all participants involved. In addition, efficiency is improved as transactions can be processed faster using smart contracts - self-executing contracts coded into blockchain platforms.
Implementing blockchain technology for food traceability does pose some challenges that need addressing before widespread adoption can occur. One major challenge is related to education and training surrounding blockchain technology. Many participants in the food industry, especially at the ground level, may not be familiar with blockchain and its practical applications. It is crucial to develop training platforms and provide relevant education to ensure that all stakeholders can understand and effectively operate this technology.
Another challenge lies in the legal and regulatory framework surrounding blockchain implementation. As blockchain enables new business models and processes, existing regulations may need to be adapted or reformed to accommodate this disruptive technology accurately. Regulatory bodies must work closely with industry stakeholders to establish guidelines for implementing blockchain in a way that ensures compliance while still leveraging the benefits it offers.
In conclusion, blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize food traceability in the livestock sector by providing transparency, accountability, and efficiency. However, there are challenges that need addressing before widespread adoption can occur. Education and training programs are necessary to enable participants at all levels of the supply chain to understand and use this technology effectively. Additionally, regulatory frameworks must be adjusted to accommodate blockchain's unique characteristics while ensuring compliance with existing laws. With proper planning and collaboration between industry players, blockchain can play a significant role in enhancing food safety in livestock products globally. 
Amphibian metamorphosis is a unique developmental process that involves the transformation of aquatic larvae into terrestrial adults. During this process, various organs undergo significant changes and mature into their adult forms. It is at this stage when plasma thyroid hormone (T3) concentration reaches its peak, and T3 has been found to play a crucial role in driving amphibian metamorphosis.
Unlike mammals, amphibians experience postembryonic development where they transition from their larval to adult stages. This allows for the study of organ development independent of maternal influences. One model organism widely used in studying metamorphosis is the pseudo-tetraploid Xenopus laevis and its diploid counterpart Xenopus tropicalis.
Intestinal remodeling is one aspect of metamorphosis that has received considerable attention due to its relevance and importance in understanding T3 regulation during development. This process involves the degeneration of larval epithelium through apoptosis, followed by the formation of new adult stem cells which then proliferate and differentiate to form the adult intestinal epithelium.
Several studies have provided valuable insights into how T3 regulates cell fate during intestinal remodeling. One notable discovery is the correlation between T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program and larval epithelial cell death. Activation of specific genes involved in cell cycle regulation has been observed upon T3 treatment, indicating that these genes help facilitate apoptosis-induced tissue reorganization.
Furthermore, it has been suggested that T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program is also essential for de novo formation of adult intestinal stem cells. These stem cells emerge from pools of undifferentiated cells after larval epithelial degeneration occurs. Studies have shown that certain factors necessary for cell proliferation are upregulated by T3 treatment during metamorphosis.
One such factor identified as being critical for adult stem cell formation is retinoblastoma protein-related p130 (p130). Activated p130 promotes quiescence in undifferentiated cells, allowing them to transition into adult intestinal stem cells. This suggests an interplay between the cell cycle regulation and stem cell development processes that is orchestrated by T3.
Overall, these findings highlight the significance of T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program during amphibian metamorphosis and its role in both larval epithelial cell death and the subsequent formation of adult stem cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these processes is crucial for unraveling how T3 regulates organ development during postembryonic stages.
In conclusion, studies on intestinal remodeling provide valuable insights into T3 regulation of cell fate during amphibian metamorphosis. The activation of the cell cycle program appears to be important for both larval epithelial apoptosis and the generation of adult intestinal stem cells. Further research in this area will deepen our understanding of how T3 influences organ maturation and provide potential avenues for investigating human postnatal development and tissue regeneration. 2. T3-mediated Apoptosis in Intestinal Remodeling
During intestinal remodeling, the larval epithelial cells undergo programmed cell death or apoptosis to make way for the formation of adult tissues. This process is tightly regulated by T3 levels and involves the activation of various apoptotic signaling pathways.
One crucial regulator of apoptosis during metamorphosis is the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRβ), which is highly expressed in the intestines of amphibians. TRβ activates target genes involved in apoptosis, leading to cell death in the larval epithelium.
T3 acts through TRβ to initiate a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway, resulting in the activation of several caspases involved in cell death. These caspases cleave cellular proteins and promote DNA fragmentation, ultimately leading to the dismantling of larval epithelial tissue.
Furthermore, it has been suggested that T3-induced apoptosis serves additional functions beyond tissue elimination. Studies have shown that T3-mediated apoptosis also promotes cell cycle exit and prevents proliferation in adult stem cells during their formation. This ensures that newly generated stem cells remain quiescent until they receive signals for proliferation and differentiation.
3. Role of Cell Cycle Activation in Stem Cell Development
Following larval epithelial degeneration, new adult intestinal stem cells need to be generated for tissue regeneration. The process involves activating quiescent undifferentiated cells present within the intestinal folds or crypts.
Recent studies have highlighted a critical role for T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program in driving this transition from undifferentiated cells to proliferating adult stem cells.
One key finding is that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are central regulators of cell cycle progression, are upregulated by T3 during metamorphosis. CDKs interact with specific cyclins and phosphorylate key proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, enabling progression through different phases such as G1/S or G2/M.
T3 treatment has been shown to upregulate cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression, promoting G1/S transition in undifferentiated cells. This allows them to enter the cell cycle and proliferate as adult intestinal stem cells. In contrast, inhibition of CDK4 blocks T3-induced stem cell proliferation, emphasizing the importance of the cell cycle program in this process.
Additionally, T3-induced activation of p130 has been associated with adult intestinal stem cell formation. Studies have shown that p130 promotes exit from the cell cycle and induces quiescence in undifferentiated cells. Activation of p130 by T3 maintains quiescence in newly formed stem cells until they receive appropriate signals for proliferation and differentiation.
Furthermore, studies have also indicated a potential role for other factors such as c-Myc, E2F transcription factors, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in T3-mediated regulation of stem cell development during intestinal remodeling.
4. Future Perspectives
Intestinal remodeling during amphibian metamorphosis provides a valuable model to study the complex interplay between thyroid hormone-induced apoptosis and stem cell development. Understanding these processes at a molecular level holds significant implications not only for developmental biology but also for regenerative medicine.
Future research should focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms by which T3 regulates apoptosis during intestinal remodeling and how it coordinates with other signaling pathways involved in tissue regeneration. Investigating additional factors related to cytoskeletal organization, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune responses may provide further insights into this intricate process.
Furthermore, exploring whether similar mechanisms operate during postnatal development of mammalian organs or tissue regeneration after injury will help bridge our understanding between amphibians' metamorphosis and human biology.
In conclusion, research on amphibian metamorphosis has shed light on how thyroid hormone-induced activation of the cell cycle program plays a crucial role both in apoptotic tissue degeneration as well as in the generation and proliferation of adult stem cells during intestinal remodeling. This work not only furthers our knowledge of amphibian development but also provides a foundation for studying organ maturation and regeneration in other species, including humans. 
Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental illnesses, affecting millions of people worldwide. They are characterized by excessive and persistent worry, fear, and unease that can significantly impair daily functioning and quality of life. Despite the availability of various treatment options, such as psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, not all individuals respond well to these interventions or experience significant side effects.
Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that has been used for centuries to treat a range of psychological disorders, including anxiety. It consists of several herbal ingredients, including Bupleurum chinense (Chaihu), Paeonia lactiflora (Baishao), Atractylodes macrocephala (Baizhu), Angelica sinensis (Danggui), Poria cocos (Fuling), Gardenia jasminoides (Zhizi), Mentha haplocalyx (Bohe), and Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Gancao). JWXYS has shown excellent clinical efficacy in treating anxiety disorder but has not received widespread attention in Western medicine.
To evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of JWXYS in anxiety disorder treatment, this review conducted an analysis of animal experiments, clinical trials, and mechanism studies. PubMed and CNKI were utilized to search for relevant literature written in English or with English abstracts.
In clinical trials exploring JWXYS for anxiety disorder treatment alone or in combination with other drugs, it was found that JWXYS effectively reduced the symptoms associated with anxiety disorders. Additionally, when used as an adjunctive therapy alongside other medications commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or benzodiazepines,
JWXYS reduced their adverse reactions while maintaining its own therapeutic effects. This suggests that JWXYS may provide a safer alternative for long-term use compared to some conventional medications. 
Preclinical studies using animal models have also demonstrated the anxiolytic effects of JWXYS. These studies showed that JWXYS can reduce anxiety-like behavior in mice and rats. It is worth noting that the mechanisms underlying these effects are complex and involve multiple systems within the central nervous system.
One proposed mechanism of action for JWXYS in anxiety disorder treatment involves its ability to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Chronic stress and dysregulation of the HPA axis have been implicated in anxiety disorders, and JWXYS has been shown to normalize HPA axis activity in animal models.
Furthermore, JWXYS has shown efficacy in modulating neurotransmitter levels implicated in anxiety disorders, such as serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA). By restoring balance to these neurotransmitters, JWXYS may help alleviate symptoms associated with anxiety.
Moreover, studies have shown that JWXYS promotes neurogenesis – the growth and development of new neurons – which is believed to play a crucial role in mood regulation. This neurogenic effect may contribute to the anxiolytic properties observed with this prescription.
These studies also suggest that JWXYS regulates enzyme synthesis involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signal transmission pathways related to anxiety disorders. By regulating these processes at a molecular level, it may further contribute to its therapeutic effects on anxiety symptoms.
In conclusion, this review provides substantial evidence for the effectiveness of Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS) as a treatment for anxiety disorders. Its favourable clinical results coupled with preclinical studies showing anxiolytic effects demonstrate its potential as an alternative or adjunctive therapy for individuals struggling with excessive worry and fear. Furthermore, by elucidating some underlying mechanisms involving HPA axis normalization, neurotransmitter modulation including GABA-ergic signaling enhancement along with increased neurogenesis and enzyme synthesis regulation; this review offers insights into potential targets for developing new anxiolytic drugs based on JWXYS. With further research and collaboration, it is possible to unlock the full potential of this traditional Chinese medicine prescription and improve treatment outcomes for individuals with anxiety disorders. 
Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease, characterized by genetic diversity within tumors as well as variations between different tumors. This heterogeneity in breast cancer contributes to differences in tumor growth, metastasis, and response to treatment. In addition to the genetic factors that govern tumor heterogeneity, the surrounding microenvironment of the tumor plays a critical role in shaping its characteristics.
The tumor microenvironment is comprised of various cell types such as immune cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and other stromal components. These interacting cells contribute to the physical and biological surroundings of the tumor and influence its behavior. The activity of these cells can be influenced by signals from cancer cells or from other components present in the microenvironment.
One key aspect of breast cancer heterogeneity influenced by the tumor microenvironment is drug resistance. The interactions between different cell types within the microenvironment can lead to changes in drug sensitivity or acquisition of resistance mechanisms. For instance, immune cells such as T lymphocytes or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can secrete various factors that promote resistance to chemotherapy drugs. Endothelial cells can also contribute to drug resistance by forming blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen necessary for tumor growth.
Deciphering these intricate interactions within the tumor microenvironment is essential for understanding how it affects drug response and developing strategies for personalized treatment. Advances in preclinical models have made it possible to study these interactions more accurately than ever before. Models that incorporate both cancer cells and various components of the microenvironment have provided insights into how different cell types interact spatially within tumors.
Emerging technologies are also playing a crucial role in unraveling breast cancer heterogeneity driven by the microenvironment's impact on drug resistance. Single-cell analysis techniques enable researchers to examine individual cell populations within heterogeneous tumors at high resolution, identifying distinct subpopulations with potential roles in driving drug resistance.
Additionally, spatial transcriptomics allows researchers to assess the gene expression patterns within tumor tissue and map it to its precise location. This technology aids in characterizing the spatial organization of cell types within tumors, helping to understand their functional contributions to drug sensitivity or resistance.
Furthermore, advanced imaging techniques such as multiplex immunohistochemistry and mass cytometry enable simultaneous visualization of multiple markers on individual cells. These methods enhance our understanding of cell-to-cell interactions and how different cell populations influence each other within the tumor microenvironment.
By employing these emerging technologies alongside preclinical models, researchers can gain a better understanding of how different components of the microenvironment contribute to breast cancer heterogeneity and drug resistance. This knowledge can be translated into improved treatment strategies that target both cancer cells and their supporting microenvironment.
In conclusion, the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in breast cancer heterogeneity through its influence on drug response. Understanding how various cell types interact within tumors and deciphering their specific contributions is essential for developing personalized treatment approaches. Emerging technologies offer new opportunities to unravel these complexities by providing detailed insights into intra-tumor heterogeneity at single-cell resolution or spatial organization levels. Integrating these technological advances with preclinical models will greatly enhance our ability to combat drug resistance in breast cancer patients effectively. 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global concern that poses a significant threat to human health and healthcare systems. It occurs when microbes, such as bacteria, become resistant to the drugs used to treat them, rendering these medications ineffective. AMR leads to prolonged and severe infections, increased mortality rates, and higher medical costs.
Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of AMR due to factors such as limited access to healthcare services, inadequate infrastructure, and socioeconomic challenges. In addition to these challenges, inappropriate antibiotic use plays a major role in driving the rise of AMR in LMICs.
1.1 Weak Regulatory Frameworks: One of the primary drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs is the lack of robust regulatory frameworks for antimicrobial stewardship. Regulations regarding antibiotic prescription practices are often lacking or poorly enforced in many LMICs. This can lead to overuse or misuse of antibiotics by healthcare providers who may prescribe them without proper diagnostic testing or patient assessment.
1.2 Limited Access to Effective Diagnostic Tools: Inadequate access to rapid diagnostic technologies contributes significantly to inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs. Without proper diagnostic tools, healthcare providers may resort to empirical prescribing – administering antibiotics based on clinical judgment rather than solid evidence of bacterial infection or susceptibility patterns.
1.3 Patient Demand for Antibiotics: Patients' expectations and demands play a role in driving inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs as well. Due to various reasons including cultural beliefs and lack of understanding about proper indications for antibiotics, patients often pressure healthcare providers into prescribing antibiotics even when they may not be necessary.
1 4 Self-medication Practices: Over-the-counter availability of antibiotics contributes greatly towards inappropriate use since patients can easily access these medications without any professional medical guidance or prescription by a qualified practitioner.
1 5 Lack of Education on Appropriate Antibiotic Use : A lack of awareness among both healthcare providers and the general public regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics is prevalent in LMICs. This lack of education contributes to inappropriate prescribing practices by healthcare providers and leads to self-medication and misuse by patients.
1 6 Limited Availability of Alternative Treatments : In some LMICs, access to alternative treatments, such as vaccines or newer antibiotics, may be limited. This scarcity may lead healthcare providers to rely heavily on broad-spectrum antibiotics as a first-line approach to treatment due to a lack of viable alternatives.
1 7 Weak Surveillance Systems: Inadequate surveillance systems for monitoring antibiotic use and resistance patterns in many LMICs hinder effective control measures. Without accurate data on antimicrobial consumption and resistance rates, it becomes challenging for policymakers to develop evidence-based strategies for tackling inappropriate antibiotic use.
Given these drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use within LMICs, it is crucial that interventions target these specific factors. Strategies should aim at strengthening regulatory frameworks for antimicrobial stewardship, improving access to rapid diagnostic tools, educating both healthcare providers and the public about appropriate antibiotic use, developing sustainable alternatives or treatment options when available treatments are scarce while also implementing robust surveillance systems that track both antimicrobial consumption and resistance patterns.
In conclusion AMR is a pressing global issue that disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries due to various socioeconomic challenges. Inappropriate antibiotic use plays a significant role in driving this problem further in these countries. Addressing the drivers mentioned earlier can guide policies aimed at curbing inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs effectively ultimately mitigating the rise of AMR thus preserving these valuable medical resources for future generations 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health concern that threatens the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals have contributed to the development and spread of resistant bacteria. Livestock and poultry farms are important reservoirs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as these animals are often exposed to high levels of antibiotics for disease prevention and growth promotion.
Bangladesh is a country heavily reliant on livestock and poultry farming for food production. The use of antibiotics in this sector is widespread, leading to concerns about the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the prevalence patterns of antibiotic resistance in Salmonella strains isolated from livestock- and poultry-derived foods in Bangladesh from 2000 to 2022.
Our analysis included 12 studies that provided data on the prevalence rates of Salmonella as well as its resistance to various antibiotics. We used statistical methods such as random-effect or fixed-effect models, stratified analyses, meta-regression approach, sensitivity analysis, univariate meta-analysis, correlation analysis to examine the data.
The pooled prevalence of Salmonella in livestock- and poultry-derived foods was found to be 37% (95% CI: 23%–52%). This high prevalence indicates a significant risk of contamination with Salmonella bacteria among these food sources. Furthermore, we found significant variations in antibiotic resistance patterns among different classes of antibiotics. Neomycin had the lowest prevalence of resistance at 4%, while tetracycline had the highest at 81%.
We also observed an increasing trend in Salmonella prevalence over time. There was a positive relationship between study period and Salmonella prevalence (β = 0.0179; P = 0.0034). This suggests that over the years, there has been an escalation in salmonellosis cases associated with livestock- and poultry-derived foods.
The rise in antibiotic resistance poses a severe threat to public health in Bangladesh. To mitigate this issue, it is crucial to monitor antibiotic sensitivity trends and develop effective antibiotic regimens. This requires comprehensive surveillance systems and data collection mechanisms to identify emerging resistance patterns.
Additionally, there is a need for stricter regulations on the use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry farming. Measures such as limiting the use of antibiotics for growth promotion and implementing proper hygiene practices can help reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food sources. Policymakers should prioritize food safety and adopt measures that promote responsible use of antibiotics in agriculture.
Furthermore, healthcare professionals play a vital role in combating AMR by prescribing antibiotics judiciously. Over-prescription or inappropriate use of antibiotics can contribute to the development of resistance. Therefore, doctors should be aware of local resistance patterns and choose appropriate antibiotics when treating bacterial infections.
In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the high prevalence of Salmonella contamination and antibiotic resistance in livestock- and poultry-derived foods in Bangladesh. Urgent interventions are required to address this problem effectively at both policy level (regulations) as well as healthcare provider level (prescribing guidelines). By implementing appropriate strategies, we can safeguard public health from the threats posed by antimicrobial resistance. 
Cervical cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers affecting women worldwide. With an annual incidence of about 0.5 million cases and resulting in over 0.3 million fatalities, it is imperative to develop accurate and efficient methods for its detection.
Traditionally, the diagnosis of cervical cancer has been carried out manually using Pap smear tests. However, this approach carries the risk of false positive or false negative results, leading to misdiagnosis and delay in treatment. Therefore, there is a pressing need for automatic detection methods that can effectively analyze Pap smear images.
In this paper, we aim to address this need by reviewing several existing detection methods from previous studies. We focus on three main aspects: pre-processing techniques, framework for nucleus detection, and performance analysis of the selected method.
Firstly, we review various pre-processing techniques that are commonly applied to enhance the quality of Pap smear images before further analysis. These techniques include image normalization, noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and segmentation. By improving image quality through these pre-processing steps, we can facilitate more accurate nucleus detection.
Next, we explore different frameworks for nucleus detection in cervical cancer cells. This involves identifying cell nuclei within the Pap smear images as they serve as important indicators for diagnosing cervical cancer. Several approaches have been proposed in previous research studies such as thresholding-based methods or advanced machine learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We evaluate each method based on its accuracy in detecting nuclei within a given dataset.
To determine which method performs best among those reviewed earlier on our selected dataset - Herlev Dataset - we experiment with four different approaches using Matlab software platform famous known for extensive image processing capabilities; then evaluate their performance according to various assessment metrics such as precision (how well it correctly identifies positive samples), sensitivity (how well it detects all true positive samples), specificity (how well it correctly classifies negative samples) overall accuracy (combination precision & specificity) and PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio).
Based on our experimental results, we found that Method 1, which utilizes thresholding and trace region boundaries in a binary image, outperformed the other methods. It achieved a precision value of 1.0, sensitivity of 98.77%, specificity of 98.76%, accuracy of 98.77%, and PSNR value of 25.74% for a single type of cell in our dataset. The average values for these metrics across all cell types were also high: precision (0.99), sensitivity (90.71%), specificity (96.55%), accuracy (92.91%), and PSNR value (16.
22%). These performance assessment values indicate that our proposed improvement method is more effective in detecting the nucleus of cervical cancer cells compared to existing methods from previous studies.
Furthermore, we compare our results with those obtained from the literature to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing approaches for nucleus detection in cervical cancer cells.
In conclusion, this paper presents an improvement method for cervical cancer detection by reviewing various pre-processing techniques, framework options for nucleus detection, and evaluating their performance using Matlab software platform with Herlev Dataset as input data source.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed improvement method achieves higher performance assessment values compared to existing methods from previous studies.
This study contributes valuable insights into existing detection techniques for cervical cancer and can serve as a strong foundation for future research efforts towards developing more accurate and efficient solutions in this critical area of healthcare management 
Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is a phenomenon that occurs when signals of different frequencies interact and influence each other. This nonlinear interaction has been found to be crucial in various aspects of neuronal computation, interregional communication, and the pathophysiology of diseases. In this review, we will explore the methodological advancements and challenges in computing CFC, with a particular focus on potential solutions to address spurious coupling, infer intrinsic rhythms within specific frequency bands, and identify causal interferences.
The study of CFC has provided valuable insights into cognitive processes and memory tasks. By analyzing the interactions between different frequency bands in the brain during these tasks, researchers have been able to gain deeper understanding of how neural networks support these functions. For example, studies have shown that increased phase synchronization between low-frequency theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) and high-frequency gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) is related to successful memory encoding or retrieval processes.
Similarly, investigations into CFC during sleep have shed light on the mechanisms underlying memory consolidation. It has been observed that slow-wave sleep is associated with enhanced coupling between slow oscillations (<1 Hz) and spindle oscillations (10-16 Hz). This coupling is believed to facilitate synaptic plasticity processes necessary for storing memories.
Moreover, examining CFC in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease has yielded valuable insights into their pathophysiology. For instance, aberrant CFC patterns have been identified in patients with Alzheimer's disease both at rest and during cognitive tasks. These findings suggest that disrupted interactions between different frequency bands may contribute to cognitive impairments observed in this condition.
Furthermore, understanding CFC can inform the development of neuromodulation techniques for therapeutic interventions. Invasive methods such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) or noninvasive approaches like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be optimized by targeting specific frequency bands or disrupting aberrant CFC patterns. Closed-loop brain stimulation, which adjusts the stimulation parameters based on ongoing neural activity, can particularly benefit from considering CFC as a biomarker for disease symptoms.
While CFC holds great promise as a tool in neuroscience research and therapeutic interventions, there are several methodological challenges that need to be addressed. One of these challenges is the potential presence of spurious coupling, where artifacts or confounding factors may mimic genuine underlying interactions. Methodological advancements should aim to develop reliable techniques that can distinguish between true and spurious CFC.
Another challenge lies in accurately inferring intrinsic rhythms within specific frequency bands. The decomposition methods used to extract oscillatory components from neural data should be carefully chosen and validated for accurate identification of relevant frequencies.
Finally, establishing causal interferences between different frequency bands remains a complex task. Techniques such as phase resetting or perturbation studies are needed to decipher the directionality and causality of CFC interactions.
In conclusion, studying CFC provides valuable insights into cognition, memory processes, sleep physiology, and neurological disorders. Furthermore, it has implications for optimizing invasive and noninvasive neuromodulation techniques. However, further methodological improvements are required to enhance the practical use of CFC in cyborg and bionic systems. Overcoming the challenges associated with spurious coupling detection, accurate inference of intrinsic rhythms within frequency bands, and elucidation of causal interferences will advance our understanding of brain function and facilitate its translation into clinical applications.
 
Health and human rights are inherently interconnected, as access to good health is a fundamental human right. However, achieving global health equity is a complex task due to various intersecting challenges such as economic inequality, climate change, mass migration, racialized violence, and global pandemics. In order to address these challenges effectively and promote health equity worldwide, it is necessary to develop an integrated framework that brings together different disciplines and approaches.
Three key fields that have emerged in the pursuit of health equity are social medicine, collective health, and structural competency. Each of these fields has its own unique history and theoretical foundation but shares a common goal of addressing the social determinants of health and promoting equitable access to healthcare.
Social medicine has its roots in the early 19th century when physicians began recognizing the impact of social conditions on individuals' health outcomes. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the broader socio-political context in which disease occurs. Social medicine highlights how factors such as poverty, discrimination, education level, housing conditions influence individuals' well-being.
Collective health takes a collective approach to improving population-level wellbeing by focusing on community participation and empowerment. This field recognizes that individual's health is shaped by social norms, cultural practices, and community dynamics. Collective Health aims at creating inclusive policies that address social disparities through collaborative efforts between healthcare providers and communities.
Structural competency moves beyond traditional biomedical approaches by examining how societal structures shape individual experiences of illness. It examines how power relations produce inequities in healthcare systems based on race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status . Structural competency underscores the need for healthcare providers to be aware not only with their patient's medical histories but also with broader contexts like poverty or discrimination which perpetuate ill-health
While each field offers distinct perspectives on addressing heath inequities , they share common ground: recognition that population-level disparities arise from complex interplay between macro-level factors like political economy ,distributions pf power , institutionalized racism and micro-level issues like individual behaviours, health literacy. Given the overlap in their theoretical foundations and goals, we believe that intentional dialogue between these fields can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the social determinants of health and promote collective action.
To facilitate this dialogue, it is important to develop pedagogical tools grounded within critical and transformative pedagogies. Critical pedagogy challenges dominant power structures and encourages students to question existing inequities in health systems. Transformative pedagogies focus on empowering students by providing them with tools for structural change. Integrating these approaches into health and human rights education can help cultivate a new generation of healthcare professionals who are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary for promoting health equity.
In conclusion,Toward an Integrated Framework in Health and Human Rights Education is critical for addressing the complex challenges that impede global health equity today. By fostering dialogue between social medicine, collective health,and structural competency further it significant contributions towards achieving equitable access to good-quality healthcare globally . Through intentional collaboration faculty members from various disciplines including medicine , public will have space work together create curriculum materials integrating insights from three intersecting but not limited fields as they bring together different perspectives rooted historical backgrounds,theoretical foundations Finally incorporating critical transformative methodologies enable us develop innovative educational strategies address diverse range issues impeding progress towards realizing right 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis, a global health threat responsible for millions of deaths each year. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant Mtb strains, including multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) strains, have made the treatment of this infection even more challenging. As conventional antibiotics become less effective against these resistant strains, there is an urgent need to explore alternative therapeutic options.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also known as host defense peptides, are small cationic molecules that play a crucial role in innate immunity. These peptides exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by targeting bacterial cell membranes or intracellular components. AMPs have shown tremendous potential as novel therapeutic agents due to their rapid bactericidal action and low propensity for inducing resistance.
However, the effectiveness of AMPs against Mtb has been a matter of debate due to the unique features of its cell wall architecture. The mycobacterial cell wall comprises three distinct layers: an outer lipid-rich layer called mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex (mAGP), a middle layer consisting primarily of arabinogalactan polysaccharides linked to peptidoglycan via β-(1→5)-glycosidic bonds, and an inner phospholipid bilayer. This complex cell wall structure provides Mtb with characteristics such as impermeability to hydrophilic compounds and resistance to immune-mediated killing.
The presence of lipids such as mycolic acids in the mAGP layer offers increased protection against hydrophobic substances like AMPs that primarily interact with bacterial membranes composed mainly of phospholipids. Moreover, certain modifications in lipid constituents further contribute to Mtb's ability to evade immune responses and drug therapy. For example, trehalose-6-mycolate, a mycolic acid derivative in the cell wall, has been demonstrated to inhibit phagosome maturation and impede antimicrobial peptide activity.
Despite these challenges posed by the Mtb cell wall, several studies have shown promising results regarding AMPs' ability to kill Mtb or reduce its viability. Numerous naturally occurring AMPs and their synthetic derivatives have exhibited potent activity against Mtb both in vitro and in animal models. These include cathelicidin LL-37, defensins, histatins, lactoferrin-derived peptides, and various synthetic peptides designed based on AMP characteristics.
To enhance the efficacy of AMPs against Mtb, researchers are also exploring combination therapies alongside conventional antibiotics. Synergistic interactions between specific antibiotics like rifampicin or isoniazid and certain AMPs have been reported to enhance bactericidal activity against drug-resistant strains. This approach holds promise for mitigating the development of resistance while improving treatment outcomes.
Additionally, innovative strategies are being pursued to overcome the barriers imposed by the mycobacterial cell wall. One approach involves modifying existing AMPs or designing novel molecules with enhanced membrane-penetrating abilities or intrinsic resistance to degradation by host enzymes present in infected individuals. Another strategy focuses on utilizing nanotechnology-based delivery systems that could improve the drug's stability and enable efficient penetration of difficult-to-reach intracellular niches where Mtb resides.
In conclusion, although Mycobacterium tuberculosis presents formidable challenges with its unique cell wall structure, antimicrobial peptides hold great potential as an alternative therapeutic option for combating this global health threat. The ongoing research efforts aimed at exploring synergistic combinations with conventional antibiotics and developing innovative delivery systems augur well for future advancements in this field. Further investigation is warranted to uncover novel strategies that can effectively target Mycobacterium tuberculosis while minimizing side effects on host cells during treatment regimens involving antimicrobial peptides. 
Obesity has emerged as a significant risk factor for the development of various types of cancer. The underlying mechanisms linking obesity and cancer are complex and multifaceted, but it is believed that alterations in both gut microbiota composition and metabolism contribute to this association.
Patients with obesity often exhibit dysbiosis, characterized by an imbalance in gut microbial communities. This dysbiosis leads to changes in microbial metabolite production, which can have a profound impact on immune system function. These altered microbial metabolites may impair the body's natural ability to mount an effective antitumor immune response.
Bariatric surgery has gained recognition as an effective treatment for long-term weight loss in patients with obesity. Interestingly, bariatric surgery has also been found to induce favorable changes in the gut microbiota composition. Studies have shown that after bariatric surgery, there is an increase in beneficial microbes such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroidetes species, while the abundance of potentially harmful bacteria like Firmicutes decreases.
One major consequence of these changes in gut microbial communities is the alteration of microbial metabolite production. Bariatric surgery has been found to promote the production of certain microbial metabolites that have potential anticancer properties.
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are one class of microbially modified metabolites that have attracted significant attention due to their beneficial effects on health. SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate are produced through fermentation processes by specific bacteria within the gut microbiota. These SCFAs play crucial roles not only in regulating energy metabolism but also modulating host immunity. They have been shown to enhance antitumor immunity by promoting T cell differentiation into effector cells and increasing their cytotoxicity against tumor cells.
Inosine is another microbially derived metabolite that has recently gained attention due to its potential anticancer effects. Inosine is produced through the metabolism of purine nucleotides by gut bacteria. It has been shown to enhance antitumor immunity by stimulating the activation and expansion of cytotoxic T cells. In addition, inosine has been found to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis through its ability to modulate immune responses.
Bile acids are another class of microbial metabolites that have emerged as important regulators of host physiology and metabolism. Bariatric surgery-induced alterations in gut microbiota composition have been shown to impact bile acid metabolism, leading to changes in bile acid profiles. These altered bile acids can modulate multiple signaling pathways involved in tumor development and progression.
Spermidine is a polyamine that is also affected by bariatric surgery-induced changes in gut microbiota composition. Spermidine has recently gained attention for its potential anticancer properties. Studies have demonstrated that spermidine intake can lead to autophagy induction, which plays a crucial role in suppressing tumorigenesis.
Understanding the impact of microbially modified metabolites on antitumor immunity is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies for cancer patients who have not undergone bariatric surgery. One approach involves identifying specific microbial metabolites that mimic the effects of bariatric surgery on anticancer immunity. This could involve dietary interventions or targeted supplementation with these metabolites.
In conclusion, obesity-associated dysbiosis leads to alterations in microbial metabolite production that can impair antitumor immunity and promote cancer development and progression. Bariatric surgery-induced changes in gut microbiota composition may counteract these effects by promoting the production of microbially modified metabolites with potential anticancer properties such as SCFAs, inosine, bile acids, and spermidine.
Further research into understanding the mechanisms underlying these effects is necessary to develop novel therapeutic strategies aimed at improving outcomes for obese cancer patients who have not received bariatric surgery. Ultimately, this knowledge could lead to the development of microbial metabolite-based interventions that mimic the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery and enhance anticancer immune responses. 
Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a complex neurologic disorder that affects the sleep-wake cycle and emotional regulation. It is often characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden loss of muscle tone, triggered by strong emotions such as laughter or excitement. The exact cause of narcolepsy with cataplexy remains unclear, but recent studies have pointed to the involvement of the amygdala, an emotion-processing center in the brain.
The amygdala is a collection of nuclei located deep within the temporal lobe of the brain. It plays a crucial role in processing emotions, particularly fear and pleasure responses. Studies in both humans and animal models have shown that lesions or dysfunction in specific regions of the amygdala can result in various behavioral abnormalities related to emotional processing.
In narcolepsy with cataplexy, there is evidence to suggest that disruptions in orexin signaling may lead to dysfunction within the amygdala circuitry. Orexin neurons are primarily located within a region called the lateral hypothalamus and project widely throughout the brain, including areas involved in regulating sleep as well as emotional responses.
Studies using functional neuroimaging techniques in humans have provided insight into how emotional stimuli can modulate activity within distinct subregions of the amygdala. For example, exposure to emotionally arousing stimuli such as fearful faces has been found to increase activation specifically within regions like basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). These findings suggest that these subregions may be involved in orchestrating emotional responses.
In addition to human studies, animal models have also provided valuable insights into how disrupted orexin signaling impacts emotion-related behaviors. Mice lacking functional orexin receptors exhibit deficits in fear conditioning tasks mediated by BLA function. Similarly, inhibition of CeA activity has been shown to suppress arousal during social play behavior mediated by disrupted orexin function.
These findings collectively suggest that the amygdala, particularly the BLA and CeA, may be critical components of a neurocircuitry that bridges emotional regulation and narcolepsy with cataplexy. Dysfunction within this circuitry could potentially explain the link between strong emotions and cataplectic episodes observed in individuals with narcolepsy.
Understanding the precise mechanisms by which amygdala circuitry contributes to narcolepsy with cataplexy can pave the way for more targeted treatment approaches. For instance, modulating activity within specific amygdala subregions could potentially be used to regulate emotional responses and minimize cataplectic episodes. Furthermore, investigating how orexin signaling interacts with amygdala circuitry may provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies for managing narcolepsy symptoms.
In conclusion, while our understanding of the role of the amygdala in narcolepsy with cataplexy is still limited, evidence from human studies and animal models suggests that this region plays a crucial role in linking emotional regulation to disease pathology. Further research focusing on detailed examination of amygdala neurocircuitry controlling transitions between emotional arousal states holds great promise in unraveling the underlying mechanisms of narcolepsy with cataplexy and developing effective treatments. 2. Amygdala Neurocircuitry and Emotional Regulation
The amygdala is known for its involvement in emotional processing, but its specific role in narcolepsy with cataplexy has yet to be fully elucidated. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are two key subregions that have been implicated in emotional regulation and may play a critical role in the manifestation of cataplexy.
The BLA receives sensory inputs from various cortical regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, and is responsible for integrating these sensory signals with emotional significance. It has been suggested that abnormalities within this region could lead to an imbalance between emotions and behavioral responses, potentially contributing to triggers for cataplectic episodes. Studies using rodent models have shown that lesions or dysfunction within the BLA can lead to alterations in emotional behaviors, including exaggerated fear responses.
On the other hand, the CeA acts as an output hub for amygdala-related emotions, sending signals to relevant brain regions involved in physiological and behavioral responses. Dysregulation within this region may disrupt the coordination between emotions and motor control systems, leading to abnormal muscle tone regulation seen during cataplectic episodes. Animal studies have shown that stimulation or inhibition of CeA activity can modulate sleep-wake states as well as affective behaviors.
In addition to these core subregions, other components of the extended amygdala are worthy of investigation regarding their potential contributions to narcolepsy with cataplexy. The bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), part of the extended amygdala network involved in stress response modulation, might be implicated due to its integration with both BLA and CeA outputs.
3. Potential Mechanisms Linking Amygdala Dysfunction with Narcolepsy
Several mechanisms have been proposed through which dysfunction within amygdala neurocircuitry might contribute to the development and manifestation of narcolepsy with cataplexy. One possibility is that disruptions in orexin signaling, a hallmark of narcolepsy with cataplexy, could lead to alterations within amygdala circuits involved in emotion regulation.
Orexin neurons project extensively to regions including the amygdala, suggesting a direct modulatory role. Orexinergic innervation of the amygdala may influence emotional responses by regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity within these circuits.
Additionally, it has been hypothesized that dysregulation of GABAergic inhibitory systems within the amygdala might play a role in narcolepsy with cataplexy. A reduction in GABAergic tone could result in overactivation or hyperexcitability of various amygdala subregions implicated in emotional regulation and motor control.
Furthermore, interactions between the amygdala and other sleep/wake regulatory centers might contribute to sleep abnormalities observed in individuals with narcolepsy. The reciprocal connections between the amygdala and hypothalamic regions involved in sleep-wake control could mediate bidirectional modulation between emotional arousal states and sleep-wake transitions.
4. Future Directions for Research
Further investigations into the specific functional connectivity patterns involving distinct subregions within the amygdala are necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of their contributions to emotional dysregulation and cataplexy.
Using advanced techniques such as optogenetics and chemogenetics can facilitate precise manipulation of neural activity within targeted subregions or specific neuronal populations, shedding light on causal relationships between altered activity patterns and disease phenotypes seen in narcolepsy with cataplexy models.
Moreover, translational research involving human studies should aim at characterizing structural alterations or functional connectivity changes related specifically to narcolepsy with cataplexy within relevant amygdalar circuitry using neuroimaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
By combining both animal models and human studies, researchers can ensure a more comprehensive understanding of the amygdala's involvement in emotional dysregulation and narcolepsy with cataplexy. Such knowledge will contribute to the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting specific amygdala circuits and potentially improve the management and treatment of this complex sleep disorder.
In conclusion, emerging evidence suggests that the amygdala neurocircuitry plays a significant role in narcolepsy with cataplexy by integrating emotional responses with motor control systems. Further research is needed to unravel the precise mechanisms through which dysfunction within specific amygdala subregions contributes to this sleep disorder. Understanding these mechanisms could offer insights into novel therapeutic targets for managing symptoms and improving overall quality of life for individuals affected by narcolepsy with cataplexy. 
The global challenge of achieving high COVID-19 vaccine booster coverage requires the identification of effective communication interventions to improve acceptance and uptake. This study aimed to test the effects of persuasive messages about COVID-19 vaccine booster doses on the intention to vaccinate among eligible adults in Australia.
In this online randomized controlled trial, adult participants were randomly assigned to receive one of four intervention messages or a control message. The control message provided information about booster dose eligibility, while intervention messages added different persuasive strategies. These strategies included emphasizing personal health benefits, community health benefits, non-health benefits, and personal agency in choosing vaccination.
After the intervention, participants were asked about their intention to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccine and their beliefs surrounding vaccination. The intervention groups were compared to the control group using tests of proportions, with differences of ≥5 percentage points considered clinically significant. A subgroup analysis was also conducted among hesitant participants who expressed uncertainty or resistance towards getting vaccinated.
Out of 487 consenting and randomized participants, 442 (90.8%) completed the experiment and were included in the analysis. Among all participants, those who viewed messages emphasizing non-health benefits had the highest intention to get vaccinated compared to those who viewed the control message (percentage point difference: 9.0%, 95% CI -0.8%, 18.8%, p = 0.071). Moreover, when looking specifically at hesitant individuals within this intervention group compared to hesitant individuals in the control group, there was an even higher increase in intention (percentage point difference: 15.6%, 95% CI -6.o%, 37.%3,p = 0.l50).
Conversely, for hesitant individuals who viewed messages emphasizing personal agency in choosing vaccination compared to those in the control group, there was a lower intention observed (percentage point difference: -10.S%,95%CI -33.OX1l4,P=O.l30). However, it is important to note that the evidence supporting these findings is weak.
Based on these results, health authorities should consider highlighting non-health benefits in their communication efforts to encourage COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake. However, messaging emphasizing personal agency should be used cautiously. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of communication messages and strategies aimed at improving COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake.
This study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and can be found on their trial webpage (ACTRN12622001404718). By conducting this randomized controlled trial and evaluating different persuasive message strategies, the study offers important evidence for public health authorities and policymakers in Australia as they continue to address the challenges of achieving high COVID-19 vaccine booster coverage. 2. Background:
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and new variants emerge, it is crucial to prioritize population-wide vaccination efforts. Vaccination provides protection against severe illness and hospitalization, reduces the spread of the virus, and helps us move towards achieving herd immunity. In many countries, including Australia, booster doses are now recommended for certain populations to enhance immune response and provide long-term protection.
However, achieving high coverage of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses presents its own challenges. Vaccine hesitancy remains a significant barrier in some populations, with concerns ranging from safety and efficacy to misinformation circulating on social media platforms. Effective communication strategies that address these concerns and promote confidence in vaccination are essential.
Persuasive messaging plays a critical role in shaping individuals' attitudes and behaviors towards vaccination. By employing various strategies tailored to different target audiences, health authorities can increase acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccine boosters amongst eligible adults.
3. Methods:
To investigate the effects of persuasive messages on intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 with booster doses, this study employed an online randomized controlled trial design. Adult participants were recruited through various channels such as social media advertisements or email invitations from healthcare providers.
After obtaining informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups or a control group. The intervention groups received messages emphasizing personal health benefits, community health benefits, non-health benefits (e.g., improved travel opportunities), or personal agency in vaccination decision-making. The control group received standard information about booster dose eligibility without any additional persuasive content.
Following exposure to their assigned messages, participants completed a survey assessing their intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose as well as their beliefs regarding vaccination more broadly. Intention was measured using Likert scale items ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree," while belief measures included items assessing perceived vaccine safety and effectiveness.
Data analysis involved comparing proportions between intervention groups (including sub-group analysis among hesitant participants) and the control group using appropriate statistical tests. Differences of 5 percentage points or more were considered clinically significant.
4. Results:
Of the 487 participants who consented and were randomized, 442 completed the experiment and were included in the analysis. Among all participants, those who viewed messages emphasizing non-health benefits had significantly higher intention to vaccinate compared to the control group (percentage point difference: 9.0%, 95% CI -0.8%, 18.8%, p = 0.071).
Interestingly, among hesitant individuals, this intervention group showed an even larger increase in intention compared to hesitant individuals in the control group (percentage point difference: 15.6%, 95% CI -6.o%,37.%3,p=O.l50). Conversely, hesitant individuals who viewed messages emphasizing personal agency had lower intention compared to those in the control group (percentage point difference: -10.S%,95%CI-33.OX1l4,P=O.l30). However, as previously noted, evidence supporting these findings is weak.
5. Discussion:
These findings contribute valuable insights into persuasive messaging strategies for promoting COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake among eligible adults in Australia. The emphasis on non-health benefits appears promising as it positively influenced both overall intention and intentions among hesitant individuals.
However, caution is warranted when utilizing messages focusing on personal agency since they resulted in lower intentions among hesistant individuals—an important subgroup where high vaccination rates are crucial for achieving population protection.
Overall, these results can inform public health authorities about effective communication interventions that may improve acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses in Australia's adult population.These findings highlight key considerations for message development and strategic planning aimed at enhancing engagement with vaccination campaigns.
Moving forward, further research should continue exploring innovative approaches to address vaccine hesitancy while continuously adapting strategies based on emerging evidence about new variants or changing circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
6. Conclusion:
Achieving high vaccine booster coverage is an ongoing global challenge, and effective communication interventions play a vital role in improving acceptance and uptake. This study's findings suggest that highlighting non-health benefits to encourage COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake among eligible adults in Australia is promising.
However, messages emphasizing personal agency should be used with caution due to their potential negative impact on hesitant individuals' intention to vaccinate. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring persuasive communication strategies based on specific target audiences and their information needs.
By implementing evidence-based messaging approaches informed by empirical research, health authorities can contribute to increasing vaccine acceptance, combating hesitancy, and ultimately protecting individuals and communities from the detrimental effects of COVID-19. 
Frailty is a common condition among older adults, characterized by decreased physiological reserve, increased vulnerability to stressors, and diminished ability to recover from illness or injury. In the field of oncology, frailty has gained increasing attention due to its impact on treatment outcomes and overall patient well-being. The frailty index (FI) is one way in which frailty can be quantified and measured.
The FI is a comprehensive tool that assesses various domains of physical function and health status in older adults. It includes a checklist of deficits or impairments across different domains such as mobility, cognition, nutrition, comorbidities, and social support. Each deficit is given a score based on its presence or absence in the individual being assessed. The scores are then summed up and divided by the total number of deficits assessed to obtain the FI score which ranges from 0 to 1.
Despite being measured as a continuous variable, researchers have used different cut-off points to categorize individuals as either frail or non-frail. These cut-off points have mainly been validated in acute care or community settings for older adults without cancer. However, it remains unclear whether these same cut-off points are applicable to older adults with cancer.
In order to explore this further, a scoping review was conducted searching various databases for studies that measured and categorized an FI in adults with cancer. Out of the initial 1994 studies screened, only 41 met the inclusion criteria for this review.
The findings of this review revealed significant variability in how studies have categorized the FI in older adults with cancer. The most frequently used cut-off point was an FI score ≥0.35 followed by ≥0.25 and ≥0.20 However; it is important to note that an FI score within this range has often represented at least moderate to severe frailty in other highly-cited studies conducted outside the oncology setting.
Interestingly, few studies sought out determine or validate the optimum FI categories in older adults with cancer. The rationale for the chosen FI categories was provided in most studies, although it was not always relevant or supported by robust evidence. Furthermore, some studies referenced previous research that used a cut-off point of an FI >0.35 to define frailty without providing clear rationale for this categorization.
The variability in how the FI has been categorized and how older adults have been labeled as "frail" hinders our ability to synthesize results and understand the impact of frailty on cancer care. It is crucial to establish valid and reliable cut-off points that accurately reflect frailty in this specific population.
Moving forward, it is recommended to maintain the FI as a continuous variable until further validation studies are conducted to determine the optimum cut-off points for categorizing frailty in older adults with cancer. This would enable better comparability between studies and facilitate a more accurate understanding of the role that frailty plays in cancer treatment outcomes.
In conclusion, there is significant variability in how studies have categorized frailty using the FI among older adults with cancer. Establishing valid and reliable cut-off points specific to this population is essential for advancing research on frailty and its impact on oncology care outcomes. 
Preschool age is a critical time for the establishment of healthy eating habits, including the consumption of fruits and vegetables (FV). Unfortunately, FV intake in preschool children in the United States (US) is often inadequate, which can have detrimental effects on their overall development. As most preschool-aged children attend childcare or preschool, these settings present an ideal opportunity to implement interventions aimed at improving FV intake.
To assess the effectiveness of such interventions and explore the behavior change techniques (BCTs) used, a systematic review was conducted. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2012 and 2022. The studies focused specifically on interventions targeting diet or FV intake in preschoolers aged 2-5 years within US childcare or preschool settings.
A comprehensive search of four databases yielded six studies reporting on nine different interventions. The included studies were analyzed based on intervention type, measured effect on FV intake, and utilization of theoretical frameworks and BCTs.
Out of the nine interventions assessed, six were found to effectively increase FV consumption among preschoolers. Five of these successful interventions utilized nutrition education as their primary approach, providing information about the benefits of consuming FVs and strategies for incorporating them into meals and snacks. One intervention focused instead on manipulating the feeding environment to make healthy food options more easily accessible to children.
On the other hand, three interventions showed no significant effect on increasing FV intake among preschoolers. Two of these unsuccessful approaches involved manipulating aspects of the feeding environment in an attempt to influence food choices indirectly. One intervention employed peer modeling as a means to encourage children's acceptance and consumption of FVs.
Interestingly, there was no consistent pattern observed regarding use theory-based frameworks or BCTs across effective or ineffective interventions. While effective studies typically incorporated at least three BCTs into their approach, it is unclear which specific techniques were most influential in promoting FV intake.
Despite some promising findings, this systematic review underscores several key gaps in the existing research. First, there is a need for more studies conducted within US childcare settings that utilize objective measures of FV intake. Objective measures, such as skin carotenoid levels, provide more reliable data on actual consumption compared to self-reported dietary assessments.
Secondly, there is a need for studies directly comparing intervention components and BCTs to identify which strategies are most effective in promoting FV intake among preschoolers. By conducting head-to-head comparisons, researchers can gain valuable insights into the relative effectiveness of different intervention approaches.
Moreover, it is crucial for future interventions to be theory-based and incorporate theoretical frameworks that explain why certain behavior change techniques are expected to yield positive results. This will enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving successful interventions and contribute to the development of evidence-based strategies.
Lastly, long-term follow-up assessments are necessary to evaluate whether any changes in FV intake among preschoolers persist over time or if they fade away once the intervention concludes. Longitudinal studies will help determine whether behavior change achieved during preschool years extends into later stages of childhood and adulthood.
In conclusion, while some interventions have shown promise in increasing FV consumption among US preschool-aged children attending childcare or preschool settings, there remains a need for more rigorous research utilizing objective measures of FV intake. Future studies should also compare different components and techniques used within interventions while incorporating theoretical frameworks and assessing long-term behavior change outcomes. These efforts will contribute toward developing effective strategies to improve dietary habits from an early age and promote lifelong health and well-being. 
Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a commonly performed surgical procedure for the treatment of various cervical spine pathologies, such as degenerative disc disease, herniated discs, and spinal stenosis. The main goal of ACDF is to relieve symptoms by decompressing neural structures and restoring stability to the affected segment.
Traditionally, ACDF has been performed using cage-plate constructs (CPC), which involve the placement of a cage between two adjacent vertebral bodies along with an anterior plate for stabilization. However, in recent years, a new technique using self-locking stand-alone cages (SSC) has gained popularity. These cages are designed to eliminate the need for additional plates or screws by incorporating locking mechanism within the cage itself.
The use of SSC in ACDF offers several potential advantages over CPC. First, it eliminates the need for additional hardware placement, thereby reducing operative time and surgical trauma. Second, it allows for better preservation of cervical lordosis due to its small footprint design. Third, it minimizes the risk of implant-related complications such as screw loosening or plate fracture.
Despite these potential benefits, there remains controversy regarding the long-term effectiveness of SSC compared to CPC in monosegmental ACDF. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare the long-term outcomes between SSC and CPC in terms of clinical outcomes and radiological parameters.
Ten studies involving 979 patients were included in this analysis. The results showed that SSC significantly reduced operative time, intraoperative blood loss, duration of hospitalization compared to CPC. Additionally, at final follow-up, SSC was associated with a significant reduction in cervical Cobb angle (indicating better preservation of lordosis), lower rates of postoperative dysphagia and adjacent segment degeneration (ASD).
Importantly though both devices demonstrated similar efficacy in terms of clinical outcomes measured by JOA scores and Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of fusion rate and cage subsidence between the two groups.
Although SSC demonstrated advantages over CPC in terms of certain perioperative parameters and the incidence of dysphagia and ASD, it was found to be inferior to CPC in maintaining cervical curvature at long-term follow-up. It is unclear whether these radiological changes have an impact on clinical symptoms. Therefore, further studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings.
In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that SSC is a better option than CPC in monosegmental ACDF, as it offers several advantages including shorter operative time, reduced blood loss, shorter hospitalization duration, lower rates of dysphagia and ASD. However, it is important to consider that SSC may be associated with compromised maintenance of cervical curvature compared to CPC. Future studies should investigate whether these radiological changes translate into clinically significant outcomes.
This study provides valuable insights for spine surgeons when choosing between SSC or CPC for monosegmental ACDF procedures. The decision should be made based on patient-specific characteristics as well as surgeon experience and preference. ACDF is a widely accepted surgical technique for the management of cervical spine disorders, and the choice between SSC and CPC should be carefully considered based on individual patient factors. The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that SSC may be preferable in cases where reducing operative time, blood loss, hospital stay, and the risk of dysphagia and ASD are important considerations.
One potential explanation for the advantages associated with SSC is its simplified surgical approach. By eliminating the need for additional hardware such as plates or screws, SSC reduces surgical steps and overall complexity. This can contribute to shorter operative times and decreased surgical trauma, ultimately leading to faster recovery and reduced hospitalization duration.
Furthermore, SSC's ability to maintain cervical lordosis is an important consideration in ACDF procedures. Preserving the natural curvature of the spine helps distribute forces evenly across adjacent segments, reducing the risk of adjacent segment degeneration over time. The reduction in Cobb angle observed with SSC compared to CPC at final follow-up may suggest a potential advantage in terms of long-term spinal alignment.
On the other hand, it is worth noting that while there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between SSC and CPC groups in terms of JOA scores or NDI scores at long-term follow-up, there was also no significant difference in fusion rate or cage subsidence. This suggests that both approaches are equally effective in achieving solid bony fusion and maintaining stability.
However, it is crucial to interpret these results with caution due to certain limitations inherent within this study. One limitation is the relatively short follow-up period (minimum 2 years) evaluated across all trials included. Long-term radiological changes after ACDF may take several years to manifest clinically; thus further investigations with longer follow-up periods are necessary.
Additionally, it must be acknowledged that different studies might have employed variations on techniques or implants used for both CCC and CPC procedures which might affect their comparative outcomes significantly; standardizing these variables across future studies would prove beneficial in analyzing the efficacy of each technique more accurately.
In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence to support the use of SSC over CPC in monosegmental ACDF procedures. SSC offers advantages in terms of reduced operative time, blood loss, duration of hospitalization, dysphagia rates, and ASD. However, its impact on long-term cervical curvature maintenance requires further investigation. Surgeons should carefully consider individual patient factors and surgical expertise when choosing between SSC and CPC for monosegmental ACDF procedures. Additional well-designed prospective studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to validate these findings and provide more comprehensive evidence for optimal treatment decision-making in ACDF surgeries. 
Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections have revolutionized the treatment of various macular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). These therapies work by inhibiting the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, thereby reducing vision loss and improving visual outcomes. However, the effectiveness of these treatments is heavily dependent on patients' adherence and persistence to their prescribed treatment regimens.
Adherence refers to the extent to which a patient takes their medications as per agreed recommendations from their healthcare provider. Non-adherence occurs when patients do not follow these recommendations, such as missing or skipping doses. On the other hand, persistence refers to continuing with the treatment for the prescribed duration without discontinuing prematurely. Both non-adherence and non-persistence can have detrimental effects on treatment outcomes.
The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate existing literature on patient-led non-adherence and non-persistence to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, highlighting its prevalence and identifying factors contributing to this behavior. A comprehensive search was conducted in several databases including Google Scholar, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, and The Cochrane Library.
A total of 409,215 patients across 52 studies were included in this analysis. The studies encompassed different treatment regimens such as pro re nata (PRN), monthly injection protocols, and treat-and-extend protocols with varied durations ranging from 4 months to 8 years. Out of these 52 studies, 22 provided insights into reasons for patient non-adherence or non-persistence.
The results showed that patient-led non-adherence varied between 17.5% and 35%, depending on how it was defined in each study. Overall pooled prevalence of patient-led non-persistence was found to be at a significant level of 30%. The reasons for non-adherence or non-persistence were diverse and included dissatisfaction with treatment results, financial burden, older age and comorbidities, difficulty booking appointments, travel distance and social isolation, lack of time, satisfaction with perceived improvement in their condition, fear of injections, loss of motivation or apathy towards eyesight. Other factors contributing to non-adherence or non-persistence were dissatisfaction with the facilities provided and discomfort or pain associated with the injections.
Interestingly, three studies highlighted higher rates of non-adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was attributed to patients' fear of exposure to COVID-19 as well as difficulties in traveling and visiting healthcare facilities during lockdowns.
Overall, these findings emphasize the need for further research into patient-led non-adherence and non-persistence in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Understanding the prevalence and factors contributing to these behaviors can help identify at-risk individuals who may benefit from targeted interventions to improve treatment outcomes in real-world settings.
To enhance future research in this area, it is crucial to establish uniform definitions and standard timescales for what constitutes non-adherence/non-persistence. This will facilitate more accurate comparisons across studies and enable a better understanding of the impact on visual outcomes.
In conclusion, this systematic review highlights high levels of patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence to anti-VEGF therapy for macular diseases. Dissatisfaction with treatment results emerged as a key factor contributing to this behavior along with financial burden and other practical barriers such as travel distance. These findings provide valuable insights into improving clinical practice by identifying individuals at risk of poor adherence/persistence and developing targeted interventions to enhance real-world visual outcomes in patients undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. 
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a complex network of cells and tight junctions that separates the bloodstream from the brain parenchyma. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS) by regulating the transport of molecules, ions, and cells between the blood and the brain.
Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive forms of primary brain tumors. It arises from glial cells and has a high infiltrative capacity into adjacent brain tissues. The development and progression of GBM are accompanied by pathological changes in BBB integrity, leading to increased permeability and decreased selectivity.
The breakdown of BBB in GBM is mainly attributed to several mechanisms, including angiogenesis, disruption of tight junction proteins, enzymatic degradation, and altered expression of transporters. These alterations result in increased vascular permeability within tumor tissue, allowing for enhanced extravasation of plasma components into the interstitial space surrounding tumor cells.
However, despite this pathological disruption, current therapeutic strategies for GBM still face significant obstacles. The dysfunctional BBB limits effective drug delivery to tumor sites and often leads to suboptimal treatment outcomes. Additionally, repeated administrations of chemotherapy agents can paradoxically induce functional restoration of BBB integrity through various signaling pathways mediated by glioma-derived factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). This restoration exacerbates drug resistance by preventing subsequent drug transport across BBB during additional treatment cycles.
To overcome these challenges, there have been efforts toward developing strategies that regulate pathological BBB fenestration while minimizing systemic toxicity. One approach involves utilizing nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems that target specific receptors on disrupted endothelial cells or exploit transcytosis pathways across altered tight junctions.
Various drugs have been explored for enhancing intracranial delivery through modulating BBB integrity. For example, bradykinin analogs such as RMP-7 (dazoxiben analog) can selectively bind to bradykinin receptor B1 and upregulate tight junction proteins, leading to improved BBB integrity and decreased permeability. Similarly, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors have been targeted using VIP-paclitaxel conjugates to enhance drug transport across the BBB.
In addition to pharmacological interventions, physical methods such as focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles have shown promise in transiently opening the BBB for therapeutic agents' enhanced delivery. FUS-induced sonoporation disrupts tight junction proteins temporarily and enables increased drug penetration into brain tissue.
Furthermore, recent advancements in gene therapy have shown potential for regulating BBB function. For instance, manipulating key genes involved in BBB integrity maintenance like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) or various growth factors can alter BBB permeability and allow for improved drug delivery.
In conclusion, developing strategies to regulate pathological blood-brain barrier fenestration holds great promise for enhancing intracranial drug delivery and improving the efficacy of anti-glioblastoma therapeutics. By understanding the mechanisms underlying the breakdown of BBB in GBM and exploiting targeted interventions, novel approaches may overcome the limitations posed by dysfunctional BBB during GBM treatment. These advancements could provide new opportunities for effective and safe therapies against this devastating disease while minimizing systemic toxicity and improving patient outcomes.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can differentiate into various cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. They have been extensively studied for their regenerative and reparative properties, making them highly promising for cell-based therapies in various clinical settings. Despite the potential of MSCs, there are challenges that hinder their translation into regular clinical use.
One significant challenge is related to the pre-administration labelling of MSCs for tracking purposes. Traditional labelling methods involve the use of fluorescent dyes or radioactive tracers, which can have limitations such as photobleaching or radiation exposure. Additionally, these methods often require invasive procedures for cell collection and labelling.
To overcome these challenges and enable non-invasive detection of transplanted MSCs, alternative approaches using iron-related genes and proteins have been explored. Iron is an essential mineral involved in various metabolic processes in the body. It plays a critical role in oxygen transport and storage as well as cellular metabolism.
Interestingly, iron-related proteins such as ferritin (an iron-storage protein), transferrin receptor-1 (a membrane protein involved in iron uptake), and MagA (a bacterial magnetosome protein) have shown potential utility in enhancing MSC detection in vivo when overexpressed genetically. These proteins can serve as reporter genes that allow non-invasive imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track transplanted MSCs over time.
In addition to improving detection methods, iron-related proteins have also been investigated for their therapeutic effects on MSC function. The iron chelator deferoxamine has been shown to enhance the therapeutic potential of MSCs by reducing oxidative stress and promoting tissue repair. Deferoxamine removes excess iron from cells and acts as an antioxidant.
Other iron-related proteins like haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), lipocalin-2 (LCN2), lactoferrin, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and hepcidin have also been studied for their effects on MSCs. HO-1, an enzyme involved in heme degradation, has been shown to improve MSC survival and function. LCN2 has been implicated in regulating iron homeostasis and can modulate the migration and differentiation of MSCs.
Lactoferrin, a multifunctional glycoprotein with iron-binding properties, can enhance the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs. BMP-2 is a growth factor that plays a crucial role in bone formation and has shown potential for enhancing osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Hepcidin is a regulator of iron metabolism and could potentially be used to optimize the therapeutic potential of MSCs.
Overall, integrating the fields of iron metabolism and MSC biology offers exciting possibilities for improving both detection methods and therapeutic potential. By utilizing iron-related genes as reporter genes or employing iron-related proteins to enhance therapeutic effects, researchers can overcome some of the challenges associated with translating MSC-based therapies into clinical practice.
This comprehensive review aims to inform both regenerative medicine researchers and clinicians involved in translational medicine. By providing insights into the utility of iron-related genes and proteins in facilitating MSC detection and therapy, this article can help guide the development of better methodological approaches for pre-transplantation labelling procedures as well as post-transplantation monitoring techniques. Ultimately, these advancements could contribute to improving patient outcomes by maximizing the potential benefits offered by MSC-based therapies.
 
Chronic neck pain is a prevalent condition that can have a significant impact on individuals' daily lives, leading to decreased function and decreased quality of life. There are various treatment options available for chronic neck pain, including manual therapy techniques such as instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) and myofascial release therapy (MRT). Both techniques aim to address soft tissue dysfunction and improve pain and function in individuals with chronic neck pain.
IASTM involves the use of specialized instruments to provide targeted pressure and movement over the affected soft tissues. These instruments are designed to break down scar tissue, adhesions, and fascial restrictions, promoting the healing process. MRT, on the other hand, focuses on releasing tensions within the fascia by applying sustained pressure or stretching techniques.
While both IASTM and MRT have been shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving function in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal conditions such as shoulder impingement syndrome or plantar fasciitis, there is limited evidence comparing their effectiveness specifically in treating chronic neck pain.
Therefore, this randomized clinical trial aimed to explore whether there were any differences between IASTM and MRT in treating college students with chronic mechanical neck pain (CMNP) who were engaged in distance learning due to COVID-19 restrictions. A total of thirty-three participants were randomly assigned to either receive IASTM or MRT for eight therapy sessions over four weeks.
The primary outcomes measured for each participant included pain intensity assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), functional status evaluated using the Neck Disability Index (NDI), and pressure sensitivity measured using a pressure algometer.
After analyzing the data obtained from these outcome measures pre- and post-intervention, no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups regarding improvements in pain intensity levels, functional status, or pressure sensitivity thresholds.
It is important to note that this study did not include a control group. Therefore, it is challenging to establish a direct causal relationship between the interventions (IASTM or MRT) and the observed improvements in pain and function. Other factors, such as natural recovery over time or concurrent therapies received by participants outside of the study, could have influenced the outcomes.
Despite this limitation, this study contributes to the existing literature by comparing the effectiveness of IASTM and MRT specifically in individuals with CMNP. Further research with larger sample sizes, including control groups, is necessary to investigate whether these manual therapy techniques have any significant advantages over one another or if they are equally effective in managing chronic neck pain.
In conclusion, while both IASTM and MRT were found to be comparable in their effects on pain intensity levels, functional status, and pressure sensitivity thresholds for college students with CMNP engaged in distance learning due to COVID-19 restrictions; further research is warranted to confirm these findings and explore potential differences between these manual therapy techniques. The findings of this study suggest that both IASTM and MRT can be considered as viable treatment options for individuals with chronic neck pain. However, it is important for healthcare professionals to consider the individual needs and preferences of their patients when determining which technique to use.
One advantage of IASTM is its ability to target specific areas of soft tissue dysfunction with the use of specialized instruments. This may be beneficial for individuals with localized trigger points or tightness in specific muscles, such as the upper trapezius or levator scapulae muscles, which were the focus areas in this study. The targeted pressure and movement provided by IASTM instruments can help break down scar tissue and adhesions, promoting improved range of motion and reducing pain.
On the other hand, MRT focuses on releasing tensions within the fascia by applying sustained pressure or stretching techniques. This technique can be particularly effective for individuals with more widespread myofascial restrictions or tension throughout their neck musculature. MRT aims to restore balance within the fascial system, improving overall mobility and reducing discomfort.
It is worth noting that while this study focused specifically on college students engaged in distance learning due to COVID-19 restrictions, these findings could potentially apply to a broader population experiencing chronic neck pain. Future studies should aim to replicate these results across different age groups and occupations to enhance generalizability.
In addition, future research should consider incorporating a control group into their study design. Having a control group would allow researchers to compare the effects of IASTM and MRT against no intervention or a placebo intervention. This would provide clearer evidence regarding the true effectiveness of these manual therapy techniques in managing chronic neck pain.
Furthermore, long-term follow-up assessments would be valuable for evaluating whether any observed improvements are sustainable over time. Chronic neck pain often requires ongoing management strategies beyond short-term interventions; therefore, understanding the long-term effects of IASTM and MRT is crucial.
In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the effects of IASTM and MRT in treating chronic neck pain among college students engaged in distance learning. Both techniques were found to be comparable in terms of pain reduction, functional improvement, and pressure sensitivity. However, further research is warranted to strengthen these findings and determine any potential differences between the two manual therapy approaches. Healthcare professionals should consider individual patient needs and preferences when selecting a treatment approach for chronic neck pain. 
The global incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has become a significant public health concern over the past decade, with more than one million curable STIs being acquired daily (World Health Organization, 2021). Sub-Saharan Africa bears a disproportionately high burden of both curable STIs and HIV, particularly among young women (World Health Organization, 2021; UNAIDS, 2020). Efforts to prevent these infections have included the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for STIs.
Recent studies have shown promising results in using doxycycline as a prophylactic measure to reduce the incidence of bacterial STIs among men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income settings (Marcus et al., 2017; Molina et al., 2015). However, there is limited evidence on the efficacy of doxycycline PEP among women in sub-Saharan Africa.
This study aims to determine the efficacy of doxycycline PEP in reducing incident bacterial STIs – specifically Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Treponema pallidum – among Kenyan women aged ≥18 and ≤30 years who are also using daily oral HIV PrEP. We describe here the baseline characteristics of participants enrolled in this trial as well as their prevalence of STIs and their perception of risk.
Between February 2020 and November 2021, a total of 449 women were enrolled. The median age was found to be around25 years old. A majority were never married(around two-thirds), whereas approximately one-third reported having had sexual intercourse with new partners within three months prior to enrollment. A significant number used condoms for protection consistently while around one-third reported engaging ins transactional sex activities. Moreover, around half of the participants were recently concerned about being exposed to an STI.
The prevalence of STIs among the participants was 17.9%, with Chlamydia trachomatis accounting for the majority of infections. It is noteworthy that perceived risk of STIs was not found to be significantly associated with the detection of an actual STI.
These findings suggest that young cisgender women using HIV PrEP in Kenya and enrolled in a trial of doxycycline PEP exhibit a high prevalence of curable STIs, indicating that they represent a population group at significant risk for these infections. This highlights the urgent need for effective interventions aimed at preventing STIs in this vulnerable population.
There are several implications arising from this study. First, it provides important evidence on the efficacy of doxycycline PEP in reducing incident bacterial STIs among women using HIV PrEP, which has previously been understudied. Second, it emphasizes the need for targeted interventions specifically designed for young cisgender women in sub-Saharan Africa who are at high risk for both curable STIs and HIV.
This research has limitations worth noting. First, there is a potential selection bias as participants were recruited from specific clinical settings and may not be representative of all Kenyan women using HIV PrEP or at risk for bacterial STIs. Second, self-reported data may be subject to social desirability bias or recall bias, leading to potential inaccuracies regarding sexual behaviors and risk perception.
In summary, this study demonstrates that young Kenyan women enrolled in a trial on doxycycline PEP have a high prevalence of curable STIs and are therefore prime candidates for targeted interventions aimed at reducing these infections. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy and feasibility of integrating doxycycline PEP into existing strategies such as quarterly screening and treatment programs within sub-Saharan Africa's healthcare systems.
 
Citizen science, a collaborative approach to scientific research involving members of the public, has emerged as a powerful tool for biodiversity conservation. By engaging ordinary people in data collection or analysis, citizen science projects can gather information on a scale that would be impossible for researchers alone. This democratization of scientific research not only helps in monitoring biodiversity but also creates awareness and understanding among participants.
To enhance the skills of citizen scientists, online training programs have become increasingly prevalent. These platforms provide participants with interactive tools and resources to improve their knowledge and abilities. One popular format is quiz-style online training, which offers a fun and engaging way to learn new concepts or identify species.
However, the effectiveness of quiz-style online training for species identification in citizen science projects has not been thoroughly evaluated. This gap in knowledge led us to develop TORI-TORE, an innovative quiz-style online training tool specifically designed to teach birdsong identification.
Birdsong identification is an important skill in bird monitoring and conservation efforts as it provides valuable insights into avian populations and their habitats. TORI-TORE incorporates memory mechanisms from adaptive learning theory to optimize learning outcomes by focusing on both accuracy and retention.
To assess the effectiveness of TORI-TORE, we conducted a randomized control trial in Fukushima, Japan. Participants were randomly assigned either to receive traditional classroom-based bird identification training or use the TORI-TORE platform. We evaluated their performance through test scores as well as questionnaires gauging attitudes towards birds before and after the training sessions.
Our findings revealed several key results: Firstly, participants who used TORI-TORE showed significant improvement in test scores compared to those who underwent traditional classroom-based training alone. This indicates that our quiz-style online tool was effective at enhancing birdsong identification skills.
In addition to improvements in test scores, survey responses indicated positive shifts in trainees' attitudes towards birds after using TORI-TORE. Participants reported increased interest and appreciation for birds and natural environments, demonstrating that our training tool has the potential to not only enhance expertise but also foster a deeper connection with nature.
Surprisingly, we found that adaptive training, which tailored questions to focus on unmastered bird species based on individuals' answer history, had unexpected effects. Trainees in this group achieved lower scores and expressed less satisfaction than those who received non-adaptive training. This suggests that a more balanced approach to question selection may be needed in future iterations of TORI-TORE.
Furthermore, we identified several factors that positively influenced test scores. Focusing on species that are relatively easy to remember increased participants' performance. Additionally, shorter lag times between training and testing sessions as well as longer question intervals were associated with higher scores. These insights will inform future improvements of the TORI-TORE platform.
While there is still room for refinement and optimization, our study demonstrates the potential of TORI-TORE as an online capacity-building tool for learning birdsong identification. By providing an accessible and engaging platform for citizen scientists to develop their skills in bird monitoring, TORI-TORE can contribute significantly to biodiversity conservation efforts.
In conclusion, the use of quiz-style online training tools has shown promise in improving species identification skills among citizen scientists involved in biodiversity monitoring projects. Our findings from studying the effectiveness of TORI-TORE provide valuable insights into how adaptive learning principles can be leveraged within such platforms for enhanced outcomes. We believe that the continued development and utilization of online training tools like TORI-TORE will not only support citizen science but also promote interest in natural environments among individuals worldwide 
Proteinopathies refer to a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the aggregation and accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain. These aggregates, known as protein inclusions, are toxic to neurons and can lead to neuronal dysfunction and death. The onset and progression of these diseases are often associated with genetic mutations, but they can also occur sporadically.
Autophagy is a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by degrading damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, and other cellular debris. It is particularly crucial for clearing protein aggregates that cannot be effectively degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Dysregulation of autophagy has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including those induced by proteinopathies.
To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy dysfunction in these diseases and identify potential therapeutic targets, numerous studies have utilized Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) models. Despite differences between flies and humans regarding brain physiology and morphology, the signaling pathways governing protein homeostasis are highly conserved between these two species.
In this review article, we aim to provide an overview of several common neurodegenerative proteinopathies: Huntington's disease (HD), Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2, and 3 (SCA1-3), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in C9orf72 or encoding superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), TAR DNA-binding Protein 43 (TDP-43), or Fused In Sarcoma/Translocated In Liposarcoma (FUS); Alzheimer's disease involving Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) or Tau; Parkinson's disease linked to alpha-synuclein (a-syn), parkin/PARK2 or PINK1/PARK6 genes; as well as prion diseases. We will discuss the contributions made by Drosophila models to understand the conserved mechanisms underlying these diseases and to elucidate the role of autophagy in their pathogenesis.
Drosophila models have provided significant insights into the pathogenic processes involved in proteinopathies. For instance, studies using fly models of HD revealed that impaired autophagy contributes to aggregate formation and neurodegeneration. Genetic manipulations targeting autophagy-related genes in flies demonstrated that enhanced or impaired autophagy can modulate disease progression, suggesting a therapeutic potential for manipulating this pathway.
Similar findings have been obtained using Drosophila models of other proteinopathies such as ALS, Parkinson's disease, and prion diseases. These studies have uncovered conserved molecular pathways regulating autophagy, including key regulatory proteins like Atg1/ULK complex and Atg8/LC3 family members. They have also highlighted the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as contributing factors in several neurodegenerative diseases.
Furthermore, Drosophila models offer valuable tools for screening potential therapeutics targeting autophagy pathways. High-throughput screening methods can be employed to identify small molecules or genetic modifiers that enhance or restore proper autophagic function in disease models.
In conclusion, Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a powerful model organism for studying the role of autophagy in neurodegenerative proteinopathies. The conservation of molecular mechanisms governing protein homeostasis between flies and humans allows researchers to uncover fundamental insights into disease pathogenesis and develop innovative therapeutic strategies. Continued research utilizing Drosophilamodels will undoubtedly contribute further to our understanding of these devastating disorders and pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions aimed at preserving neuronal function through modulation of autophagic processes. 2. PolyQ diseases, such as Huntington's disease and Spinocerebellar ataxia 1, 2, and 3, are characterized by the expansion of a polyglutamine (PolyQ) repeat in specific proteins. These expanded PolyQ tracts confer a toxic gain-of-function to the proteins, leading to protein misfolding and aggregation. Drosophila models of PolyQ diseases have provided valuable insights into the role of autophagy in clearing these aggregates. Researchers have found that enhancing autophagic activity can reduce aggregate formation and alleviate neurotoxicity in fly models of PolyQ diseases.
3. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective degeneration of motor neurons. Mutations in genes such as C9orf72, SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS have been associated with familial ALS cases. Drosophila models expressing mutant forms of these ALS-associated genes recapitulate key pathological features observed in ALS patients. Studies using these fly models have revealed that autophagy plays a crucial role in ALS pathogenesis by promoting clearance of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria.
4. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by two hallmark neuropathological lesions: extracellular amyloid-beta plaques composed mainly of amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragments and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Drosophila models expressing mutant forms of APP or tau have been instrumental in elucidating the role of autophagy in AD pathology. They have shown that disrupted autophagy leads to increased accumulation and reduced clearance of toxic protein aggregates.
5.Parkinson's disease (PD), another prevalent neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting dopaminergic neurons, has been extensively studied using Drosophila models. Mutations in genes such as alpha-synuclein (a-syn), parkin, PINK1, and LRRK2 are associated with familial forms of PD. Studies in flies have demonstrated that aberrant autophagy contributes to the accumulation of a-syn aggregates and mitochondrial dysfunction observed in PD. Additionally, Drosophila models have been instrumental in identifying potential therapeutic targets within the autophagy pathway for treating PD.
6. Prion diseases are characterized by the conversion of a normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) into an abnormal isoform (PrPSc) that can act as a template to further convert more PrPC molecules. This conversion results in the accumulation of insoluble PrPSc aggregates, leading to neuronal death and neurodegeneration. Drosophila models expressing various forms of prion proteins have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying prion disease pathogenesis, including the involvement of autophagy machinery in promoting clearance or propagation of prion aggregates.
In conclusion, Drosophila models have played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of neurodegenerative proteinopathies induced by protein misfolding and aggregation. By exploiting the conservation of key molecular pathways between flies and humans, researchers have made significant progress in elucidating how dysregulated autophagy contributes to disease pathogenesis. These fly models not only allow for the identification and validation of new therapeutic targets but also serve as powerful tools for screening potential drugs that modulate autophagic processes. Continued research using Drosophila will undoubtedly contribute further to our understanding of these devastating disorders and facilitate the development of effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases associated with proteinopathy-induced autophagy dysfunction. 
Brain cancer is a devastating disease with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. The Olig gene family, which consists of Olig1, Olig2, and Olig3, has emerged as an important player in both the development of the central nervous system (CNS) and the progression of brain cancers. These genes encode transcription factors belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family.
Olig1 and Olig2 are expressed in various cell types during CNS development and play critical roles in cellular specification and differentiation. They are involved in oligodendrocyte development - a type of glial cell that produces myelin, insulation for neuronal axons. In addition to their role in normal development, aberrant expression of Olig genes has been implicated in brain tumorigenesis.
Multiple studies have shown that overexpression of Olig2 is associated with glioma progression - the most common form of brain cancer. Gliomas are characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, invasion into surrounding healthy tissue, resistance to standard treatments like radiation therapy and chemotherapy, leading to poor patient outcomes. High levels of Olig2 have been detected in glioma cells compared to normal glial cells or other brain tumor types.
Mechanistically, studies have demonstrated that increased levels of Olig2 promote glioma proliferation by regulating key target genes involved in cell cycle control and DNA replication. Furthermore, elevated expression of this transcription factor confers resistance to radiation therapy by enhancing DNA repair mechanisms within tumor cells.
Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that targeting specific vulnerabilities conferred by deregulated expression or function of members from the olig gene family may offer novel therapeutic strategies for combating gliomas. For example, inhibiting olig2-mediated signaling pathways using small molecule inhibitors has shown promising results both preclinically and clinically.
Inhibition or knockdown experiments targeting olig genes have led to reduced proliferation rates and induction of apoptosis specifically within glioma cells, while sparing normal glial cells. This selectivity highlights the potential therapeutic window for targeting Olig genes in brain cancer treatment.
In addition to their roles in glioma progression, Olig genes have also been implicated in cancer stem cell (CSC) maintenance and self-renewal. CSCs are a small population of tumor cells that possess stem cell-like properties, including the ability to initiate tumor formation and drive therapy resistance. Targeting CSCs is vital for achieving long-term remission and preventing tumor recurrence.
Recent studies have shown that Olig2 expression is enriched in glioma stem-like cells and is required for their maintenance. Depletion of Olig2 not only impairs self-renewal capabilities but also sensitizes CSCs to standard therapies, suggesting that targeting Olig genes could potentially eradicate this highly resistant subpopulation of cancer cells.
Overall, understanding the biological functions of the Olig gene family in brain cancer has opened up new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Inhibiting or modulating these transcription factors holds promise as a targeted therapy approach with potentially fewer side effects compared to conventional treatments.
However, several challenges need to be addressed before translating these findings into clinical applications. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which Olig genes promote glioma progression and resistance. Additionally, strategies for selectively targeting Olig-expressing cancer cells while sparing normal glial cells require further optimization.
In conclusion, exploiting the role of members from the olig gene family offers exciting possibilities for developing effective treatments against brain cancers such as gliomas. Continued research efforts focusing on unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying olig gene function will enable us to devise novel therapeutic strategies that can improve patient outcomes and ultimately lead to a cure for this devastating disease. 
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive and infiltrative primary brain tumor that carries a dismal prognosis. Despite advancements in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the survival rate for GBM patients remains poor, with a median overall survival of less than two years. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment by harnessing the power of the immune system to target and destroy tumor cells. However, GBM poses unique challenges that limit the effectiveness of immunotherapies.
1.1 Immunological Tolerance: One major barrier to successful immunotherapy in GBM is its ability to create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that evades immune surveillance. The tumor cells release immunosuppressive molecules such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) that dampen immune responses and promote tolerance towards the tumor.
1.2 Blood-Brain Barrier: Another significant challenge in treating GBM with immunotherapies is overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB prevents large molecules including most antibodies from entering the brain parenchyma where tumors reside. This restricts the delivery of therapeutic agents to target tumor cells effectively.
1.3 Heterogeneity and Antigen Escape: GBM exhibits considerable intratumoral heterogeneity both phenotypically and genotypically. This heterogeneity makes it difficult for immune cells to recognize all tumor antigens adequately, leading to antigen escape or loss variants within tumors over time.
These barriers have necessitated innovative approaches to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve outcomes for GBM patients receiving immunotherapy treatment.
2. Engineered Treatments:
2.1 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T): CAR-T cell therapy involves engineering T cells with receptors targeting specific antigens expressed on GBM cells. This approach has shown promise in preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials, demonstrating tumor regression and improved survival in some patients.
2.2 Bispecific T-cell Engagers (BiTEs): BiTEs are bispecific antibodies that engage both T cells and tumor cells to promote T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. By bridging the interaction between immune cells and tumors, BiTEs have shown potential for improving immunotherapy outcomes.
3. Non-Engineered Treatments:
3.1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) target inhibitory receptors on immune cells or ligands on tumor cells to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. While ICIs have revolutionized treatment in several cancer types, their success in GBM has been limited due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment within the brain.
3.2 Combination Therapies: Combinatorial approaches involving various immunotherapeutic agents combined with traditional treatments like surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy hold promise for overcoming resistance mechanisms in GBM. For example, combining ICIs with vaccines or oncolytic viruses can stimulate a more robust anti-tumor immune response.
4. Future Perspectives:
4.1 Personalized Medicine: Understanding the genomic landscape of each patient's tumor can guide personalized treatment strategies that target specific molecular alterations driving glioblastoma growth while simultaneously overcoming resistance mechanisms.
4.2 Nanotechnology-Enabled Drug Delivery: Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems show promise in overcoming BBB restrictions by encapsulating immunotherapeutic agents to enhance their penetration into the brain parenchyma while minimizing off-target effects.
In conclusion, Glioblastoma poses unique challenges that limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy approaches already successful in other cancer types. Overcoming these barriers requires innovative strategies targeting diverse aspects of GBM's complex biology while considering individual patient characteristics such as intratumoral heterogeneity and genetic alterations underlying resistance mechanisms. Although significant progress has been made, continued research efforts are needed to improve immunotherapy outcomes and ultimately provide better treatment options for GBM patients. 
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a critical mediator of pyroptosis, a type of programmed cell death that plays a vital role in host defense against infections and other stimuli. Pyroptosis functions by triggering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inducing cell lysis, thereby eliminating intracellular pathogens. However, dysregulated GSDMD activation has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases, highlighting its dual nature as both a protective mechanism and a potential contributor to pathology.
1.1 Pyroptosis and GSDMD Activation
Pyroptosis is distinguished from other forms of cell death such as apoptosis by its distinct morphological features, including plasma membrane rupture and cellular swelling. These characteristics are largely attributed to the formation of large pores in the plasma membrane by GSDMD, leading to osmotic imbalance and eventual cell lysis.
GSDMD activation is tightly regulated through proteolytic cleavage events mediated by inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, -4, -5, or -11. Upon sensing specific danger signals or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), these caspases are activated within multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes. The active caspases subsequently cleave GSDMD at its N-terminal domain, releasing an N-terminal fragment that contains an oligomerization domain.
1.2 Structure of GSDMD Pores
The N-terminal fragment generated after caspase-mediated cleavage integrates into the plasma membrane to form large pores known as gasdermin-N domains (G-N domains). Cryo-electron microscopy studies have revealed that these pores consist of symmetric heptameric rings with hydrophilic interiors surrounded by hydrophobic residues facing lipid bilayers.
Upon pore formation, cytosolic contents are released into the extracellular space along with robust pro-inflammatory signaling cascades induced by danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and cytokines. This release of pro-inflammatory molecules contributes to the recruitment and activation of immune cells, further amplifying the inflammatory response.
2. GSDMD-Mediated Diseases
Dysregulated GSDMD activation has been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its role in contributing to disease development. For instance, sepsis is characterized by an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response, and studies have shown that excessive pyroptosis mediated by GSDMD contributes to septic shock.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has also shed light on GSDMD-mediated pathology. It has been observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis through GSDMD activation, leading to lung injury.
Additionally, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease have been associated with elevated levels of activated caspases and subsequent GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in neuronal cells. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and cancer are other examples where aberrant GSDMD activity contributes to tissue damage or tumor progression.
3. Development of GSDMD Inhibitors
Given the detrimental effects of dysregulated pyroptosis mediated by GSDMD activation in various diseases, developing effective inhibitors targeting this pathway represents a promising therapeutic strategy.
Recent studies revealing the structures of caspase-GSDMD complexes have provided crucial insights into potential targets for intervention. These insights include identifying key residues involved in proteolytic cleavage events or oligomerization processes that could be targeted for drug development.
Furthermore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying how inflammasomes activate caspases offers opportunities for developing inhibitors that can interfere with inflammasome formation or downstream signaling events leading to cleavage of GSDMD.
4. Conclusion
Gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis is a complex and tightly regulated process that serves as a crucial defense mechanism against infections and other stimuli. However, dysregulated GSDMD activation has emerged as a common factor in various inflammatory diseases. The study of GSDMD structure, membrane pore formation, activation pathways, and the development of inhibitors provides insights into potential therapeutic strategies for controlling these diseases.
Efforts to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning GSDMD regulation and developing inhibitors targeting this pathway hold promise for the treatment of inflammatory diseases associated with aberrant pyroptosis. Further research in this field will advance our understanding of GSDMD-mediated pathology and contribute to the development of effective therapeutics with improved outcomes for patients. 
Metformin, a widely used drug for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus, has shown promising applications in dentistry beyond its primary role as an anti-hyperglycemic medication. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the various potential uses of metformin in the field of dentistry.
2. Periodontal Disease:
Recent clinical trials have investigated the adjunct topical application of metformin in patients with diabetes and periodontitis. These studies have reported improvements in periodontal parameters such as probing depth, clinical attachment level, and gingival inflammation following the use of metformin gel or mouthwash. The anti-inflammatory properties of metformin are believed to contribute to its positive effects on periodontal health.
Furthermore, research has suggested that metformin can stimulate odontogenic differentiation and mineral synthesis in stem cells derived from tooth pulp. This indicates its potential role in promoting tooth regeneration and repair.
3. Periodontal Regeneration:
Metformin has also demonstrated regenerative effects on periodontal bone by stimulating osteoblast proliferation while reducing osteoclast activity. These properties make it a promising candidate for periodontal regeneration therapies aimed at restoring lost bone tissue caused by periodontitis.
4. Implant Dentistry:
Studies have shown that metformin monotherapy can enhance osseointegration (the process by which implants fuse with surrounding bone) of endosseous implants placed within the jawbone. Improved osseointegration leads to greater stability and longevity of dental implants.
5. Oral Cancer:
Emerging evidence suggests that metformin may exert anti-cancer effects on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). It is believed to impede tumor progression by inhibiting various cellular processes involved in cancer growth and metastasis.
6. Orthodontics:
Animal studies have indicated that metformin can improve orthodontic tooth movement (the repositioning of teeth with braces) and resist corrosion of orthodontic appliances. These findings suggest that metformin may have applications in enhancing orthodontic treatment outcomes and reducing appliance-related complications.
7. Potential Mechanisms:
The exact mechanisms underlying metformin's various effects in dentistry are not yet fully understood. However, it is thought to involve modulation of cellular signaling pathways involved in inflammation, stem cell differentiation, mineral synthesis, bone remodeling, and cancer development.
8. Conclusion:
Metformin has shown great potential as a versatile drug in dentistry beyond its well-established role in diabetes management. From improving periodontal health to promoting tooth regeneration and supporting implant integration, metformin offers a wide range of prospective uses in oral healthcare.
Although further research is needed to better understand the specific mechanisms behind these effects and optimize dosing regimens for dental applications, the growing body of evidence supports the exploration of metformin's potential use as an adjunct therapy or even as a standalone treatment option within various branches of dentistry. Given the promising results from clinical trials and animal studies, future research should focus on conducting well-designed randomized controlled trials to further investigate the efficacy and safety of metformin in various dental applications. Moreover, it would be valuable to explore the optimal concentration, dosage form, and delivery method of metformin for each specific condition or procedure.
In addition to its potential therapeutic uses, metformin may also have preventive properties in dentistry. Considering its ability to reduce inflammation and stimulate bone regeneration, it could be explored as a preventive measure for individuals at risk of developing periodontal disease or osteoporosis-related bone loss.
It should be noted that although metformin has shown significant promise in various dental applications, it is essential for dental practitioners to carefully evaluate each patient's medical history and overall health status before considering the use of this drug. Like any medication, metformin has potential side effects and contraindications that need to be taken into account.
Furthermore, interdisciplinary collaboration between dentists and physicians is crucial when incorporating metformin into dental treatment protocols. Close communication between healthcare professionals can ensure comprehensive patient care and minimize any potential interactions or adverse effects when combining medications.
In summary, metformin shows great potential as a versatile drug with numerous prospective uses in dentistry. Its positive impact on managing periodontal parameters such as reducing inflammation and promoting bone regeneration make it an intriguing candidate for various oral conditions. Further research is needed to determine optimal dosing regimens, delivery methods, and long-term safety profiles specific to each application within dentistry. Nevertheless, given its widespread availability and established safety profile as an anti-diabetic medication globally recognized by regulatory authorities such as the US Food Drug Administration (FDA) as safe for long-term use in diabetes management; exploring its full range of benefits in dentistry holds considerable promise for improving oral health outcomes.
As researchers continue investigating the multitude of potential applications for this drug within dentistry, it is expected that metformin will emerge as a valuable tool in the preventive, therapeutic, and regenerative aspects of oral healthcare. Dentistry stands to gain significant benefit from incorporating metformin into its treatment armamentarium, ultimately improving patient outcomes and expanding the scope of dental practice. 
Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is a sleep disorder characterized by a delay in the timing of one's sleep and wakefulness. This delay often results in difficulties falling asleep at a desired time and waking up at the desired time, leading to fatigue, impaired concentration, and other related symptoms. DSWPD is most commonly observed during adolescence and young adulthood.
Estimates of the prevalence of DSWPD vary, but it is believed to affect around 3% of the population with little racial differences between Caucasians and Asians. The causes of DSWPD are multifactorial, involving physiological, genetic, psychological, and behavioral factors. In addition to these factors, social influences also play a role in the development of this disorder.
Recent reports have highlighted an increase in delayed sleep phase and prolonged sleep duration among young individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions. These changes raise concerns about potential mismatches between individuals' sleep-wake patterns and their social lives once these restrictions are lifted. If not addressed appropriately, this mismatch could contribute to an increased risk for developing DSWPD.
While a delay in circadian rhythms is typically seen as a key characteristic of DSWPD, recent research has revealed that approximately 40% of cases do not exhibit misalignment with objectively measured circadian rhythm markers. Instead, psychological and behavioral factors such as truancy or academic/social difficulties appear to be more strongly implicated in these cases.
Interestingly, there is also a high comorbidity between DSWPD and psychiatric disorders such as mood disorders or neurodevelopmental disorders. The relationship between these conditions appears bidirectional – they both influence each other's pathophysiology.
Individuals with DSWPD often display traits associated with high neuroticism and anxiety levels. These characteristics can exacerbate insomnia symptoms experienced by patients with this disorder.
Currently available treatment options for DSWPD are limited, primarily consisting of chronobiological approaches such as light therapy or melatonin administration. However, given the involvement of behavioral factors in this disorder, future research should explore the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral approaches as a complementary treatment option.
In conclusion, DSWPD is a sleep disorder characterized by delayed sleep and wakefulness patterns. It is prevalent during adolescence and young adulthood and can be caused by physiological, genetic, psychological, and behavioral factors. Social influences also play a role in its development. The COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions have raised concerns about potential mismatches between individuals' sleep-wake patterns and their social lives, potentially increasing the risk for developing DSWPD once these restrictions are lifted. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral approaches in addition to chronobiological interventions for treating DSWPD. 2. Physiological, Genetic, and Psychological Factors Contributing to DSWPD
The underlying physiology of DSWPD involves a delay in the circadian rhythm, the natural internal clock that regulates sleep-wake cycles. This delay can be attributed to several factors, including alterations in melatonin secretion and delayed production of the sleep-promoting hormone adenosine. Genetic factors also play a significant role in predisposing individuals to DSWPD. Studies have identified specific genetic mutations associated with circadian rhythm disturbances that contribute to the development of this disorder.
Psychological factors such as high levels of stress or anxiety can further disrupt sleep-wake patterns and exacerbate symptoms of DSWPD. The bidirectional relationship between mood disorders and DSWPD suggests that these conditions may share common underlying mechanisms contributing to their co-occurrence.
3. Social Factors Influencing Circadian Rhythm Misalignment
Social influences have a profound impact on an individual's sleep-wake patterns, particularly during adolescence and young adulthood when social activities are prioritized over maintaining regular sleep schedules. Late-night social engagements, school-related stressors, increased screen time before bed, and irregular work schedules can all contribute to circadian rhythm misalignment seen in individuals with DSWPD.
4. COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Sleep Changes among Young Individuals
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant changes in daily routines for many individuals worldwide. Remote working or studying arrangements, reduced social interactions due to lockdown measures, and increased anxiety levels have resulted in alterations in sleep behaviors among young people.
Studies conducted during this period have reported delays in sleep onset times (e.g., later bedtime) as well as prolonged sleep durations among younger populations compared to pre-pandemic norms. These changes may be partially attributed to relaxed schedules since many individuals no longer need to adhere strictly to early morning obligations like commuting or attending physical classes.
However beneficial these temporary changes might seem for some individuals, there is concern about the potential long-term consequences. Once the pandemic-related behavioral restrictions are lifted, individuals who have adjusted their sleep schedules to match their social lives may encounter significant challenges in readjusting to a conventional sleep pattern. This shift could potentially lead to an increased risk of DSWPD development.
5. Comorbidity with Mood and Neurodevelopmental Disorders
DSWPD frequently co-occurs with mood disorders, such as depression or bipolar disorder, suggesting shared underlying mechanisms between these conditions. The disruption in sleep-wake patterns seen in individuals with DSWPD can influence mood regulation and contribute to the onset or exacerbation of mood symptoms.
Furthermore, neurodevelopmental disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often present with comorbid sleep disturbances including DSWPD. The relationship between these conditions is complex and likely involves intertwined neurological pathways responsible for regulating both circadian rhythms and neurobehavioral functioning.
6. Treatment Approaches for DSWPD
The management of DSWPD requires a multidimensional approach that addresses both physiological as well as psychological and behavioral factors contributing to the disorder(s). Chronobiological interventions such as light therapy or melatonin administration can help realign circadian rhythms and improve sleep quality.
However, given the significant impact of psychological and behavioral factors on DSWPD development, cognitive-behavioral approaches have gained importance in recent research efforts. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which combines sleep hygiene education, stimulus control techniques, relaxation strategies, and cognitive restructuring methods has shown promise in improving overall sleep quality among individuals with various sleep disorders; however its specific efficacy for DSWPD needs further investigation.
In conclusion, Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder is a complex condition influenced by physiological dysregulation of circadian rhythms along with genetic predisposition as well as psychological and social factors that lead to disruptions in sleep-wake patterns. The COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in sleep behaviors among young people highlight the importance of maintaining a balanced sleep-wake schedule and the potential risks associated with long-term circadian rhythm misalignment. Treatment approaches should encompass both chronobiological interventions and cognitive-behavioral strategies to address DSWPD comprehensively. Further research is needed to enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for this debilitating disorder. 
Inquiry-based learning (IBL) has become a prominent approach in health professions education, aiming to promote higher-level thinking and student engagement. In open IBL curricula, students are encouraged to generate their own questions and actively explore topics of interest. This approach empowers students to take ownership of their learning process and develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and information synthesis.
The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the range of metrics used in evaluating health professions trainees in open IBL initiatives. The study aimed to identify the outcomes associated with this educational approach and shed light on its effectiveness in fostering desired competencies.
To conduct the review, five databases were searched for relevant publications detailing trainee outcomes in open IBL initiatives within health professions education. Only studies that described interventions consisting of five phases of IBL (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, and discussion) were included.
After the initial search yielded 3030 records, a two-stage screening process was conducted on abstracts and full texts by two independent reviewers. Finally, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria for data extraction. Of these studies, nine involved physician trainees while twelve focused on nursing trainees.
The findings highlight some key themes regarding the evaluation of trainee outcomes in open IBL curricula. Firstly, there was a notable lack of validated data collection tools used across studies. Only three studies employed validated measures to assess student inquiry behavior during the curriculum. One study utilized a single validated tool to assess critical thinking abilities.
Interestingly, most studies (n = 11) relied heavily on self-reported satisfaction or perceived gain of skills as their primary outcome measure. While subjective measures can provide valuable insights into learners' perceptions and experiences with IBL initiatives; they may not fully capture changes or improvements in competencies objectively.
Amongst the four included studies that utilized validated tools assessing inquiry behaviors at the completion of an IBL curriculum, results showed high scores in inquiry behaviors. However, findings regarding critical thinking abilities were mixed. This suggests that while open IBL may have a positive impact on fostering inquiry-oriented skills, its effect on broader cognitive abilities such as critical thinking may vary.
Moreover, the majority of included studies collected pre-post or post-only data. Only one study employed a longitudinal design to collect serial data throughout the duration of the curriculum. Longitudinal studies have the potential to provide more robust evidence regarding changes in trainee outcomes over time and help identify any sustained effects of IBL initiatives.
In conclusion, this scoping review highlights the potential of open IBL to cultivate curiosity and active engagement among health professions learners. However, it also underscores the need for more rigorous evaluation efforts in this area. Curriculum innovations utilizing IBL should consider incorporating validated tools to assess student inquiry behavior and critical thinking objectively. Additionally, future research should aim to employ longitudinal designs to better understand the long-term impact of open IBL in health professions education and its contribution towards developing competent professionals able to navigate complex healthcare challenges effectively.
 2. Discussion
In recent years, inquiry-based learning (IBL) has gained recognition as an effective approach to health professions education. It emphasizes student-centered learning and encourages active exploration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. This scoping review aimed to summarize the metrics used to evaluate health professions trainees in open IBL curricula.
The findings of this review reveal several interesting trends and gaps in the evaluation of trainee outcomes in open IBL initiatives. Firstly, there is a lack of standardized and validated tools used across studies for assessing student inquiry behavior and critical thinking abilities. This is problematic as it makes it difficult to compare results across different studies or draw robust conclusions about the impact of open IBL on these outcomes.
However, among the few studies that did utilize validated tools for assessing inquiry behavior, positive results were reported at the end of the curriculum. This suggests that open IBL may indeed be effective in promoting inquiry-oriented skills among health professions learners. It encourages students to ask questions, seek information independently, and develop a curiosity-driven mindset.
On the other hand, findings regarding critical thinking abilities were more varied. Some studies reported improvements in critical thinking skills following participation in an open IBL curriculum while others did not find significant changes. These mixed results may be attributed to variations in curriculum design or differences in how critical thinking was measured across studies.
Another important finding from this review is that most included studies relied heavily on self-reported satisfaction or perceived gain of skills as their primary outcome measure. While subjective measures can provide valuable insights into learners' perspectives and attitudes towards open IBL initiatives; they may not fully capture objective changes or improvements in competencies.
This highlights a need for more rigorous evaluation efforts using standardized measures such as validated questionnaires or performance assessments that can provide objective data on student outcomes related to inquiry behavior and critical thinking abilities.
Furthermore, most included studies collected pre-post or post-only data without employing longitudinal designs. Longitudinal studies are essential in assessing the long-term impact of open IBL on trainee outcomes and determining if any effects are sustained over time. They can provide valuable insights into whether the skills developed through open IBL initiatives persist beyond the immediate curriculum and translate into real-world practice.
Overall, this scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on trainee outcomes in open IBL curricula within health professions education. It highlights both the potential benefits of this educational approach, such as cultivating curiosity and inquiry-oriented skills, as well as areas that require further investigation.
Future research should aim to incorporate validated tools for assessing inquiry behavior and critical thinking abilities to ensure more standardized evaluation across studies. Longitudinal designs should also be employed to assess the long-term impact of open IBL on trainee outcomes. Additionally, exploring other objective measures such as performance assessments or observed behavior can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of open IBL on health professions learners.
In conclusion, while there is promising evidence regarding positive trainee outcomes associated with open IBL in health professions education, more robust research is needed. By incorporating rigorous evaluation methods and standardized measures into future studies, we can better understand how this pedagogical approach contributes to developing competent professionals who excel in critical thinking, problem-solving, and independent inquiry-based learning skills. 
Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms and is a significant public health issue, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. It affects over 240 million people globally, with the majority of cases occurring in this region. To combat this disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the regular mass administration of praziquantel (PZQ) drugs, accompanied by social mobilization and health education programs.
In endemic communities along Lake Albert in Western Uganda, where schistosomiasis prevalence is high, mass drug administration (MDA) programs are crucial for the control and prevention of the disease. However, there are times when MDA activities may be delayed or not implemented due to various reasons such as resource constraints or logistical challenges.
The aim of this study was to explore the health-seeking behaviors of individuals within these communities regarding schistosomiasis treatment in the absence of MDA programs. By understanding where individuals seek treatment during these gaps in MDA coverage, policymakers can better address gaps in healthcare access and ensure effective implementation strategies for achieving WHO's target of 75% coverage and uptake by 2030.
A qualitative study was conducted in January and February 2020 in Kagadi and Ntoroko - two endemic communities along Lake Albert. Twelve key informants including local leaders, village health teams (VHTs), and health workers were interviewed. Additionally, 28 focus group discussions were held involving 251 community members who were purposively selected.
The data collected from interviews and focus group discussions were transcribed and analyzed using a thematic analysis model. The findings revealed that individuals rarely sought medication for schistosomiasis-related signs or symptoms from government hospitals or primary healthcare facilities like health centers II, III or IV. Instead, they relied on community volunteers like VHTs or sought treatment from private facilities such as clinics or drug shops nearby. Some even turned to traditional sources such as witch doctors or herbalists.
Several factors were found to influence this preference for seeking treatment outside of the government healthcare system. These included the unavailability of PZQ drugs in government health facilities, negative attitudes from health workers towards patients, long distances and poor road conditions leading to government hospitals or health facilities, high costs associated with obtaining medication, and negative perceptions surrounding the effectiveness and safety of PZQ.
One significant challenge highlighted by the study was the limited availability and accessibility of PZQ. To address this issue and improve uptake within these communities, it is crucial to bring schistosomiasis treatment and services closer to endemic areas. This can be achieved by stocking nearby healthcare facilities with an adequate supply of PZQ medication so that individuals can easily access treatment. Moreover, it is vital to conduct contextualized awareness campaigns that debunk myths and misconceptions surrounding PZQ in order to increase acceptability within these communities.
In conclusion, understanding health-seeking behaviors during gaps in MDA programs is crucial for refining implementation strategies for schistosomiasis control efforts. By addressing challenges related to drug availability/accessibility and improving community awareness through targeted education initiatives, policymakers can work towards achieving WHO's vision of reducing schistosomiasis prevalence significantly by 2030. 
The concept of the demographic dividend refers to the potential economic benefits that can be achieved when a country experiences a shift in its age structure, resulting in a larger proportion of working-age individuals relative to dependents. This shift can create a favorable policy environment for economic growth and development if countries adopt appropriate policies and investments to harness the potential of their youthful population.
In this study, we focused on two pre-dividend African nations: Nigeria and Tanzania. These countries were identified by the World Bank as having significant potential for reaping the benefits of the demographic dividend in the coming years. Our aim was to review national policies in these countries and assess their readiness to capitalize on changing demographics and maximize the demographic dividend.
We conducted an extensive review of 18 national policy documents across five key sectors: Family Planning, Maternal and Child Health, Education, Women’s Empowerment, and Labor Market. These sectors were identified based on the Gates Institute Demographic Dividend Framework, which provides guidance on targeted policies for accelerating the demographic dividend based on a country's specific demographic structure.
Our findings revealed persistent gaps in policies targeting family planning in both Nigeria and Tanzania. While some efforts have been made to address maternal and child health, education, women’s empowerment, and labor market issues, there is still room for improvement in terms of specificity and measurability of these policies.
Specifically, we recommend that both Nigeria and Tanzania consider implementing policy amendments that prioritize accessible family planning services and information. This would help ensure that individuals are able to make informed decisions about their reproductive health while also reducing fertility rates to align with changing demographics.
Additionally, there is a need for more comprehensive policies addressing maternal health outcomes such as reducing maternal mortality rates through improved access to skilled healthcare providers during pregnancy or childbirth. Both countries could also benefit from increasing investments in education systems that provide quality education opportunities for all children regardless of gender or socioeconomic background.
Furthermore,the empowerment of women should be prioritized through policies that aim to promote gender equality, increase women's access to economic opportunities, and ensure their representation in decision-making processes.
Lastly, we emphasize the importance of designing measurable policy initiatives across all sectors. This would allow for better monitoring and evaluation of policy effectiveness and enable policymakers to make informed decisions based on evidence.
In conclusion, as Nigeria, Tanzania, and other pre-dividend nations continue to experience rapid demographic changes, it is crucial for them to review and strengthen their national policies across the five key sectors identified in this study. By doing so, these countries can fully harness the potential of their youthful population and maximize the socioeconomic benefits associated with the demographic dividend. Routine policy reviews should be implemented to ensure that policies remain relevant and responsive to changing demographics. It is our hope that this study provides valuable insights for policymakers in Nigeria,Tanzania,and beyond as they navigate the path towards achieving sustainable development through effective policy interventions. 2. Methodology
To conduct this study, we collaborated with local partners in Nigeria and Tanzania to gather and review national policy documents across the five key sectors mentioned earlier. Our review focused on the policies and strategies outlined in these documents, assessing their alignment with the objectives of maximizing the demographic dividend.
We used a comprehensive list of indicators for each sector, which were defined through a systematic literature review. These indicators helped us assess the specificity and measurability of national policies in each country. We also considered the extent to which these policies addressed the unique challenges and opportunities presented by changing demographic structures.
The identified indicators allowed us to examine various dimensions within each sector. For example, under family planning, we looked at indicators such as accessibility of contraceptives, availability of information on contraceptive methods, and integration of family planning services into other healthcare systems.
Similarly, within maternal and child health, our assessment included indicators like antenatal care coverage rates, skilled birth attendance rates, immunization coverage rates for children under 1 year old,and neonatal mortality rates.These multidimensional assessments helped us gain a comprehensive understanding of the policy landscape in both Nigeria and Tanzania.
3.Results
In our analysis of national policies across both countries,nearly all policy documents acknowledged the importanceof harnessing their growing youth population for economic development.However,the level ofsensitivityand specificity towardsleveragingthedemographicdividendvariedacrosssectors.Forinstance,intheareafamilyplanningpolicieswere often general aspirational statements that lacked concrete strategies or measurable targets.Itwas apparentrthatt herewassignificant roomforenhancing policy interventionsinthisfieldwithadirectfocusonimprovingaccessibil ityoftamilyplanningservices,increasingawarenessaboutcontraceptiveoptions,andempowering individualsbyprovidingthemwithnecessarinformationlcounsellingtoguidetheirmahedeFWecommendthat policymakersreviewexistingfamilyplanningpoliciesandamendthemtospecificallytargetthesegoalsinordertoachievebetteroutcomesandanacceleratedemographicdividend.
Similarly, in the area of maternal and child health,policies were found to be more comprehensive, but there were still areas for improvement. While policies acknowledged the importance of reducing maternal and child mortality rates, some lacked specific strategies or measurable targets for achieving these objectives.Therefore,it is importantthat governmentsofNigeriaandTanzaniatake stepstointegrate policy initiatives aimed at increasing antenatal care coverage, ensuring skilled birth attendance,and improvingaccess to immunizationservices across the population.In addition,focussingonimprovingthequality and availability of healthcare facilities,parental education,andcommunityengagementcanhelpaddress theunderlyingchal engesofmaternalandchildhealthcaretobenefitallmembersofsociety.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare, immune-mediated neuropathy characterized by the progressive paralysis of muscles and peripheral nerves. Its exact cause is not completely understood, but both cellular and humoral immunity play a crucial role in its development. Molecular mimicry, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells due to similarities with pathogens, is considered to be the leading theory explaining the pathogenesis of GBS.
Currently, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE) are the most effective treatments for GBS in improving patient prognosis. IVIg works by modulating the immune response and reducing inflammation, while PE removes harmful antibodies from the blood. Despite these treatments being beneficial for many patients, there has been limited progress in developing new treatment strategies or improving overall outcomes.
In recent years, there has been a growing focus on developing novel immunotherapies that specifically target various aspects of immune response involved in GBS pathogenesis. These approaches aim to either block or modulate specific components of immune system activation associated with disease progression.
One promising strategy is targeting antibodies responsible for initiating and perpetuating nerve damage in GBS. High-dose anti-ganglioside antibody therapies have shown potential by specifically neutralizing pathogenic antibodies that contribute to nerve damage. Additionally, monoclonal antibody therapies directed against specific targets in immune cells such as B-cells or T-cells show promise due to their ability to selectively suppress harmful immune responses.
Another line of investigation involves blocking complement pathways that are activated during GBS onset. Complement inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy at preventing pathological inflammatory responses seen in GBS models and may provide an alternative therapeutic approach for future clinical trials.
Furthermore, modulation of cytokines involved in inflammation can also be seen as a potential avenue for treatment development. For instance, interferon-beta therapy has shown promise by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which are involved in GBS pathogenesis. By reducing cytokine levels, interferon-beta treatment aims to mitigate the damaging effects of inflammation on peripheral nerves.
While many of these new immunotherapies hold promise, it is important to note that they are still undergoing clinical trials and have yet to receive approval for GBS treatment. Success in these trials will hinge on demonstrating safety, efficacy, and potential benefits over current standard therapies like IVIg and PE.
In conclusion, there has been a growing interest in developing new immunotherapies for the treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome. These novel strategies target various components of the immune system involved in disease pathogenesis and aim to improve patient outcomes beyond existing therapies. Although still experimental, the progress being made in understanding the underlying mechanisms of GBS and developing targeted treatments offers hope for improved management of this debilitating condition in the future.
 2. Current therapies for GBS
Currently, the mainstay treatments for Guillain-Barré syndrome include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE). IVIg therapy involves administering a high dose of human immunoglobulin, which helps to suppress the destructive immune response and reduce inflammation in the peripheral nerves. PE, on the other hand, involves removing the patient's blood plasma and replacing it with a substitute solution, effectively eliminating harmful antibodies from circulation.
Both IVIg and PE have been proven to be effective in improving outcomes for patients with GBS. However, they are not without limitations. The cost of these treatments can be substantial, making them inaccessible to some patients. Additionally, access to specialized treatment centers equipped to provide PE may be limited in certain regions. Therefore, there is a need for alternative therapeutic options that are more readily available and cost-effective.
3. Treatment strategies based on pathogenesis
Given the complexity of Guillain-Barré syndrome's pathogenesis involving both cellular and humoral immunity through molecular mimicry mechanisms, researchers have been exploring novel treatment strategies that target specific components of this immune response.
One approach involves targeting autoantibodies responsible for initiating nerve damage by employing selective adsorption techniques like protein A or protein G columns or using extracorporeal immunoadsorption devices. These methods aim to specifically remove pathogenic autoantibodies associated with GBS while preserving beneficial antibodies involved in normal immune function.
Another area of investigation focuses on modulating immune cells involved in the progression of GBS. This can be achieved through targeted therapy against B-cells or T-cells using monoclonal antibodies or small molecule inhibitors that prevent their activation or migration into peripheral nerves.
Furthermore, complement pathways represent an attractive target for intervention since they play a significant role in amplifying inflammation during GBS onset. Inhibitors against specific components within these pathways have shown promise in preclinical studies and suggest potential benefits for future clinical trials.
The modulation of cytokines, particularly those involved in immune response regulation and inflammation, is another avenue for therapy development. The use of monoclonal antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokines or the introduction of anti-inflammatory mediators aims to restore immune homeostasis and attenuate the damaging effects on peripheral nerves.
4. Conclusion
In recent years, there has been significant progress in understanding the pathogenesis of Guillain-Barré syndrome and developing novel therapeutic strategies for its management. While IVIg and PE remain the standard treatments with proven efficacy, exploring alternative immunotherapies that target specific components of the immune response offers hope for improved outcomes.
By targeting autoantibodies, complement pathways, immune cells, or cytokines involved in GBS pathogenesis, researchers aim to develop more targeted interventions that can be tailored to individual patients. However, it is important to note that these therapies are still under investigation and have yet to receive approval as standard treatments.
Moving forward, it will be crucial to conduct well-designed clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these new approaches thoroughly. Additionally, access to these innovative therapies should be considered alongside cost-effectiveness measures to ensure their widespread availability.
Overall, progress in immunotherapy strategies for Guillain-Barré syndrome provides optimism for advancements in GBS treatment options. By continuing research efforts focused on understanding disease mechanisms at a molecular level and conducting robust clinical trials evaluating innovative therapeutics targeting specific components of immune response pathways involved in GBS pathogenesis; we aim towards improving patient outcomes and enhancing their quality of life affected by this debilitating condition.
 
Microneedles have emerged as a promising technology for transdermal biomedical applications. Traditional methods of drug delivery and biosensing often involve invasive techniques such as injections and blood draws, which can be painful and uncomfortable for patients. Microneedles offer a less invasive alternative by penetrating the outermost layer of skin painlessly, allowing for precise drug delivery or sample collection.
The key challenge in the development of microneedles lies in the choice of materials and fabrication methods that enable the desired shape, configuration, and function to be achieved. Different applications may require different material properties such as hardness, Young's modulus, biocompatibility, degradability, and processability. Therefore, it is important to carefully select materials that meet these requirements.
Several types of materials have been explored for microneedle fabrication. Silicon is commonly used due to its well-established processing techniques and biocompatibility. However, silicon microneedles are typically brittle and prone to breakage. Polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) offer flexibility but may not be suitable for certain applications due to their low Young's modulus.
To overcome these limitations and optimize material selection for specific applications, various composite materials have been developed. For example, combining polymers with metals or ceramics can enhance mechanical strength while maintaining flexibility or conductivity. The choice of material also affects the manufacturing process used to fabricate the microneedles.
Fabrication methods play a crucial role in determining the shape and structure of microneedles. Solid microneedles can be fabricated through processes such as photolithography or etching techniques on silicon wafers followed by molding or casting with polymers or metals. Hollow microneedles can be created using similar techniques but with an additional step to create microchannels within the needles.
Several advantages and disadvantages accompany each fabrication method depending on factors such as scalability, cost-effectiveness, complexity, and the desired geometric properties. Consequently, it is necessary to carefully consider these factors when selecting fabrication methods.
Once fabricated, microneedles can be used in various biomedical applications. Biosensing involves using microneedle-based sensors to detect biomarkers or analytes in the interstitial fluid or blood. This technology has the potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics by providing real-time measurements without conventional needle-based techniques.
On the other hand, drug delivery applications focus on efficient and controlled release of therapeutic agents through microneedles into specific skin layers or directly into systemic circulation. Microneedle drug delivery systems offer great promise for improving drug administration efficiency and patient compliance compared to traditional methods.
Body fluid extraction using microneedles allows for painless sample collection with less invasiveness compared to conventional venipuncture procedures. The collected samples can be analyzed for diagnostic purposes such as disease detection or monitoring.
Finally, nerve stimulation via microneedles has shown potential for targeted neural interfaces capable of controlling sensory perception or motor functions through electrical stimulation at specific nerve locations.
In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of material selection and fabrication methods in creating functional microneedles for various biomedical applications. By carefully considering these factors, researchers can develop innovative devices with improved performance characteristics and unlock new possibilities in a wide range of healthcare fields.
 
Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide, with an estimated 382,069 new cases and 89,929 deaths in 2018 alone (Ferlay et al., 2019). This type of cancer arises from the lining of the uterus, known as the endometrium. Various risk factors have been identified for endometrial cancer, including age, obesity, hormonal imbalances, and genetic predisposition. In recent years, sedentary behavior has emerged as a potential modifiable risk factor for several chronic diseases including cancer.
Sedentary behavior refers to any waking behavior characterized by low energy expenditure while sitting or lying down. It includes activities such as working at a desk job for long periods without breaks or engaging in excessive screen time. Multiple studies have reported an association between sedentary behavior and increased risk of various types of cancers such as colon, lung, breast and endometrial cancer (Schmid et al., 2014; Lynch et al., 2016).
To further investigate the association between sedentary behavior and endometrial cancer risk specifically, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. The aim was to assess whether there is a significant relationship between domain-specific sedentary behavior (occupational domains versus leisure-time domains) and total sedentary behavior with endometrial cancer risk.
A comprehensive search strategy was implemented across multiple databases to identify relevant observational human studies evaluating the association between sedentary behavior and endometrial cancer. A total of sixteen studies were included in this review. Fourteen studies comprising a large sample size involving 882 ,686 participants were included in the meta-analysis.
The findings demonstrated that higher levels of overall sedentary behavior were associated with a significantly increased risk of developing endometrial cancer (pooled RR:1.28). Furthermore,detailed analysis revealed that occupational domain-specific sedetary behaviour had significant association with increased risk of endometrial cancer (pooled RR:1.22), while leisure-time domain-specific sedentary behavior showed a slightly increased but non-significant risk (pooled RR:1.34). Interestingly, total sedentary behavior was also linked with a significantly higher risk of developing endometrial cancer (pooled RR:1.55).
Moreover, the meta-analysis also evaluated the role of adjustment for potential confounding factors such as physical activity and body mass index (BMI). It was observed that studies which accounted for these factors showed larger pooled relative risks compared to those without adjustment. This suggests that the relationship between sedentary behavior and endometrial cancer may be influenced by these confounding factors.
However, there are several limitations in this systematic review and meta-analysis that should be considered. Firstly, all included studies were observational in nature, thus causality cannot be established. Secondly,the measurement and assessment of sedentary behavior varied across studies, leading to potential heterogeneity in the results.Furthermore,in most studies,self-reported measures of sedentary behaviour were used which could introduce recall bias and may not accurately reflect actual levels of activity.Finally,the majority of included studies were conducted among Western populations,wereas no data was available from other regions such as South America or Asia.
In conclusion,this systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence suggesting that higher levels of overall sedentary behavior,epecially occupational domain-specificsedetary behaviours are associated with an increased risk pf develping endomentrailcancer.More research is needed to confirm these findings,based on objective quantification methods,and further exploration into potential interactions between physical activiry,bodily adiposity,and specific domains of sedenatry behaviors.However,given the modifiable natureof sefemtayrbeaviour,reducing its impact on enmendmetial cancer risik through encouraging changes at population level is warranted.o 
Calcaneal apophysitis, also known as Sever's disease, is a common condition that affects the growth plate in the heel bone of children and adolescents. Despite its prevalence, there is still a lack of consensus on the risk factors and associated factors for developing calcaneal apophysitis. Therefore, it is important to conduct a systematic review to identify and analyze these factors.
The aim of this review was to identify both intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors (RFs), associated factors (AFs), and consequences of developing calcaneal apophysitis. A comprehensive search was conducted in various databases including Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science, and Evidence from inception to April 2021.
From the initial search results, 736 studies were identified. After screening titles and abstracts for eligibility criteria, 11 observational studies fully met the inclusion criteria. These studies included a total of 1265 participants with an average age of 10.72 years.
Of the included studies, four identified extrinsic factors related to calcaneal apophysitis while ten identified intrinsic factors. Three studies identified both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributing to calcaneal apophysitis development. The findings suggest that various RFs play a role in this condition.
In terms of extrinsic RFs for calcaneal apophysitis development, limitations in ankle dorsiflexion were frequently reported among the included studies. This suggests that reduced range of motion in ankle movement may contribute to increased stress on the heel bone during physical activities.
Additionally, foot alignment was found to be associated with an increased risk for calcaneal apophysitis development. Studies showed that foot malalignments such as pronation or supination can lead to abnormal loading patterns on the heel bone during weight-bearing activities.
Furthermore, intrinsic RFs such as stiffness and mobility of midfoot joints were also found to be associated with calcaneal apophysitis. Reduced mobility and increased stiffness in these joints can affect the distribution of forces during activities, potentially leading to excessive stress on the growth plate.
Other identified RFs and AFs include plantar pressures and ground reaction force, body mass index (BMI), age, gender, presence of other osteochondroses (abnormalities in bone growth), and participation in sports. These factors may contribute to alterations in mechanical loading on the heel bone or impact skeletal development.
Despite some consensus among studies regarding certain factors, there were disagreements and lack of unanimity between different investigations. This highlights the need for further research to establish a clearer understanding of the role each factor plays in calcaneal apophysitis development.
Overall, this systematic review provides insights into both intrinsic and extrinsic RFs, AFs, and consequences associated with calcaneal apophysitis. Limitations in ankle dorsiflexion, foot malalignment, stiffness of midfoot joints, plantar pressures and ground reaction force are among the factors identified. However, further studies are needed to determine the precise relationship between these factors and calcaneal apophysitis development.
In conclusion, understanding the risk factors associated with calcaneal apophysitis is crucial for prevention strategies as well as identifying individuals at higher risk for this condition. By addressing modifiable risk factors such as foot alignment or ankle range of motion limitations early on through appropriate interventions or modifications to activity levels or footwear choices may help reduce the incidence or severity of calcaneal apophysitis.
 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major global health issue, ranking as the third most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of death among different populations. It is estimated that CRC accounts for approximately 10% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases with high mortality rates. Despite significant advancements in early detection and treatment approaches, the complex nature of colorectal tumorigenesis necessitates further research to better understand its underlying mechanisms.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as promising molecules linked to various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, protein production, and cellular signaling pathways. An increasing body of evidence has implicated lncRNAs in contributing to aberrant gene expression patterns under pathological conditions such as cancer.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism – processes that are deregulated in cancers, including CRC. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling has been shown to be associated with tumor initiation and progression. Therefore, investigating the interactions between lncRNAs and mTOR may provide valuable insights into molecular mechanisms driving CRC development.
To comprehensively evaluate existing knowledge on the role of lncRNA-mediated modulation of mTOR in CRC tumorigenesis, we conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched seven databases for relevant articles related to lncRNA-mTOR interactions in CRC.
After screening 200 entries against our inclusion criteria based on title/abstract review followed by full-text assessment, 24 studies were deemed eligible for subsequent analysis. These studies collectively identified 23 specific lncRNAs that were associated with dysregulated mTOR signaling in CRC samples.
Interestingly, these identified lncRNAs exhibited differential expression patterns: 79.16% were up-regulated while 20.84% showed down-regulation in CRC tissues. This suggests that lncRNAs can act as both positive and negative regulators of the mTOR pathway during CRC tumorigenesis.
The potential mechanistic roles of the differentially expressed lncRNAs in modulating mTOR signaling include direct interaction with mTOR, influencing its upstream or downstream effectors, or targeting other proteins involved in the regulation of this pathway. These findings highlight the importance of considering lncRNA-mTOR interactions as potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers for CRC.
Understanding the dynamic nature of mTOR activity and its correlation with specific lncRNAs can have significant implications for developing novel molecular therapeutics and personalized treatment strategies. Targeting dysregulated lncRNA-mTOR interactions might offer new opportunities to restore normal cell functions, inhibit tumor growth, and sensitize cancer cells to existing therapies.
In conclusion, this systematic review sheds light on the growing body of evidence supporting a link between dysregulated lncRNA expression and mTOR signaling in CRC tumorigenesis. The identification of specific lncRNAs associated with abnormal mTOR activity provides valuable insights into potential areas for further investigation. Harnessing this knowledge may ultimately lead to the development of innovative diagnostic tools, prognostic markers, and targeted therapies to improve outcomes for patients with colorectal cancer. Furthermore, this systematic review highlights the need for further studies to elucidate the functional roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of the identified lncRNAs in CRC. Several studies have provided evidence suggesting that specific lncRNAs can modulate mTOR signaling by interacting with key components of the pathway.
For example, one study identified a lncRNA called ROR (Regulator of Reprogramming), which was found to be up-regulated in CRC tissues. ROR was shown to interact directly with mTOR and enhance its activation, leading to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth. Conversely, another study demonstrated that a lncRNA known as TUG1 (Taurine Upregulated Gene 1) acted as a negative regulator of mTOR signaling in CRC cells. TUG1 suppressed mTOR activation by sequestering an upstream activator of mTOR.
Moreover, some studies highlighted the influence of dysregulated lncRNAs on other signaling pathways known to intersect with the mTOR pathway. For instance, HOTAIR (HOX transcript antisense RNA), an oncogenic lncRNA up-regulated in CRC, was found to promote tumor growth through activation of both the mTOR pathway and Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs may contribute to chemotherapy resistance by affecting mTOR-related cellular processes such as autophagy. Several studies have reported altered expression levels of specific lncRNAs associated with autophagy regulation in drug-resistant CRC cells.
Although this systematic review provides valuable insights into the association between dysregulated lncRNAs and abnormal mT 
Tobacco use is a major public health issue worldwide, causing significant morbidity and mortality. In recent years, there has been increased recognition of the need for comprehensive tobacco control policies to tackle this problem. Beijing, as one of the largest and most populous cities in the world, launched a comprehensive tobacco control program that aligns with the guidelines provided by the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). 
Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a valuable tool for evaluating the potential health effects of policies and interventions before their implementation. It helps decision-makers understand the potential consequences, both positive and negative, on population health. To conduct an HIA on Beijing's tobacco control policy, it is essential to identify relevant indicators that can capture its impact comprehensively.
In this study, we aimed to develop a set of indicators for scoping an HIA of Beijing's tobacco control policy. We used a modified Delphi process to achieve this objective. The Delphi process allows experts to provide their opinions independently while enabling group consensus through iterations of feedback.
Firstly, we proposed a conceptual framework for assessing the health impacts of tobacco control policies based on two existing models: Driving forces- Pressure- State- Exposure- Effect- Action (DPSEEA) model and Determinants of Health Theory. This framework provided an overall structure within which indicators could be identified.
Next, we reviewed existing surveillance systems and literature related to tobacco control in Beijing. This step helped us identify potential indicators that have been previously used or recommended in similar studies or programs globally.
A working group consisting of 13 experts from various disciplines was established for formulating evaluation criteria for these indicators and carrying out indicator scoring. The experts had expertise in fields such as epidemiology, public health policy analysis, economics, sociology, and environmental sciences.
Each expert independently scored each indicator according to four evaluation criteria: relevance (to assess whether it captures key aspects related to tobacco control), feasibility (to determine whether data is readily available or can be collected easily), reliability (to ascertain the consistency and accuracy of the data source), and sensitivity (to gauge the indicator's ability to detect changes over time).
Indicators that obtained a total score above 80% and had a standard error less than 5 were selected as the final set of indicators. This scoring process ensures that indicators with high relevance, feasibility, reliability, and sensitivity are included in the set.
Overall, out of 36 potential indicators, 23 were selected as part of the final set. The top five indicators based on their scores were smoking prevalence, mortality rate related to smoking-related diseases, hospital admission rate for such diseases, tobacco consumption levels, and hospital admission fees associated with smoking-related diseases.
Furthermore, Kendall's coefficient of concordance was calculated to assess the level of agreement among experts regarding each indicator. The coefficient indicated statistically significant consistency for all model compositions.
In conclusion, this study successfully identified a set of 23 indicators for scoping an HIA on Beijing's comprehensive tobacco control policy. The selected indicators achieved high scores for relevance, feasibility, reliability, and sensitivity. These indicators have great potential in facilitating evaluations of tobacco control policies in similar urban settings globally.
Future research should focus on utilizing these indicators in empirical data analysis to further evaluate Beijing's tobacco control program effectively. Additionally,
HIA studies using these indicator sets can serve as informative resources for decision-makers when formulating or assessing tobacco control policies worldwide. 
Stem cells play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of living organisms. These unique cells have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into various cell types, making them important in organ development, tissue repair, and regeneration. The fate and function of stem cells are tightly regulated by various molecular mechanisms, including RNA editing.
RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification process that alters the nucleotide sequence of RNA molecules. One key enzyme involved in this process is adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). ADAR1 catalyzes the conversion of adenosine to inosine within double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates. Inosine is read as guanosine by cellular machinery, resulting in altered protein coding potential or regulation of gene expression.
ADAR1 is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in numerous physiological processes such as embryonic development, cell differentiation, immune regulation, and even gene editing technologies. The diverse functions of ADAR1 highlight its importance as a regulator of stem cell fate and function.
Studies have revealed that ADAR1-mediated RNA editing plays a critical role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency and facilitating their differentiation into distinct lineages. For example, during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, ADAR1 regulates the switch between pluripotency-associated factors and lineage-specific genes by modulating mRNA stability or alternative splicing events through its editing activity.
Furthermore, ADAR1 has been shown to mediate lineage commitment decisions during hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. It promotes myeloid lineage specification while suppressing lymphoid lineage markers through targeted RNA editing events. This suggests an essential role for ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in dictating hematopoietic stem cell fate decisions.
In addition to normal tissue homeostasis and development-related functions, dysregulated ADAR-mediated RNA editing has been implicated in cancer stem cell biology. Cancer stem cells are a subset of tumor cells with self-renewal capacity and the ability to initiate tumor growth and metastasis. ADAR1 has been shown to be upregulated in various cancers, including glioblastoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.
The aberrant expression of ADAR1 in cancer stem cells leads to perturbed RNA editing patterns and altered gene expression profiles critical for tumorigenesis, drug resistance, and metastasis. Targeting ADAR1 using specific inhibitors or genetic knockdown approaches has shown promise as a potential therapeutic strategy to selectively eliminate cancer stem cells or sensitize them to conventional therapies.
ADAR1 not only influences stem cell fate decisions through its editing activity but also plays crucial roles through non-editing functions. For instance, it interacts with various RNA binding proteins that regulate alternative splicing events or mRNA stability during development and differentiation processes. Further understanding of these non-editing functions will provide more insight into the mechanisms by which ADAR1 controls stem cell fate choices.
In conclusion, the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 plays a vital role in regulating stem cell fate and function by mediating both editing-dependent and non-editing-dependent mechanisms. Its multifunctionality makes it an essential player in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis maintenance, immune response regulation as well as malignant transformation processes such as cancer initiation and progression.
Given its emerging significance in normal and dysregulated stem cell contexts, targeting ADAR1 holds great therapeutic potential for a variety of diseases ranging from developmental disorders to various types of cancers where modulating or eliminating specific subsets of stem cells is desired. Further research into the intricacies of ADAR1-mediated functions within different cellular contexts will undoubtedly uncover additional insights into this fascinating field. 
Educational videos have become an increasingly popular tool for healthcare professionals, including nurses, to disseminate information and promote learning. These videos provide an engaging and easily accessible platform for individuals to acquire knowledge on various health-related topics. However, in order to ensure the effectiveness and quality of these educational videos, it is crucial that nursing professionals follow a methodological framework in their production.
The purpose of this integrative review was to evaluate the methodologies used by nursing professionals in the production of educational videos. A thorough search was conducted in databases such as CINAHL, LILACS, and MEDLINE/PubMed to identify primary studies relevant to the topic. After screening through numerous articles, a sample of 19 research studies was selected for inclusion in this review.
To assess the methodological quality of these studies, a tool proposed by Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice was utilized. The results were analyzed descriptively to identify common themes and patterns in the methodologies employed by nursing professionals during different stages of video production.
The three main methodological stages identified were pre-production, production, and post-production. Pre-production involved planning and preparing for video creation such as determining objectives, identifying target audience needs, scripting content, storyboarding visuals or animations if necessary. Production encompassed actually filming or creating visual elements while adhering to a predetermined plan or script outlined during pre-production phases. Post-production included editing footage or animations with audio elements like voiceovers; adding captions subtitles where needed; ensuring accessibility compliance standards are met; etcetera.
Overall findings revealed that most of the included studies adequately addressed these stages during video development and implementation.The authors appropriately described each stage's methodology employed while also considering selected methods on how best they believed each stage should be undertaken based on goals established throughout project(s). However,rigorously following established frameworks/methods/interventions (formal declared structure)was only evident/confirmed/apparent from at least twelve (12-13) studies presented.such a framework provided clear guidelines and objectives for each stage, ensuring the overall efficacy of the video as an educational tool.
Another important aspect assessed was the validation of these videos by the target audience. Validation is crucial in ensuring that the educational videos resonate with and effectively educate their intended viewers. Astonishingly, only eleven (11) of the included studies reported validating their videos with target audiences.This highlights a significant gap in current practice, as validation allows for identification of potential content issues, improvement opportunities identified through feedback (with "validating" an iterative process), AND confirmation if viewer learning objectives are indeed met or surpassed which demonstrates how well content resonated/connected to end-users' knowledge base /real-life experiences,relevance/usefulness.  Validations not only increase confidence in video quality but also ensure that they provide accurate information and are well-received by viewers.
In conclusion, this integrative review demonstrated that there is a need for attention regarding methodological frameworks to be employed during the production of educational nursing videos.It clearly emphasized such concerns relevant to overall rigor since many studies did not use established frameworks.To encourage high-quality teaching materials,it's important that nursing professionals prioritize rigorous execution in adhering to standardized methodological procedures throughout all stages of video production. Additionally, validation by target populations should be undertaken to ensure effectiveness and relevance within specific contexts.Validating/viewer-feedback enhances viewers' experience accessing this invaluable information resource while developing critical healthcare competencies/skills needed for high-quality care delivery/future practices.Thus,future research in this area should focus on refining methodologies and incorporating validated frameworks into nursing education practice pertaining to video production so as both prepare/provide students/novices; patients;clinicians more effectively/strengthened healthcare services provision globally.
 
Malnutrition is a significant problem affecting children worldwide, particularly in developing countries where limited access to food is prevalent. While there have been numerous studies conducted on malnutrition and its impact on growth, there is a lack of research specifically addressing disease-related malnutrition in pediatric patients with chronic conditions. This gap in knowledge poses a significant challenge in identifying and managing the nutritional status of these vulnerable populations.
The objective of this study was to review existing literature on the measurement of malnutrition in pediatric chronic disease, with a particular focus on developing countries. Given the resource limitations that often exist in these settings, it was crucial to identify effective strategies for assessing nutritional status.
A comprehensive literature search was conducted using two databases, resulting in 31 relevant articles published between 1990 and 2021. These articles provided valuable insights into the current understanding of disease-related malnutrition and its assessment methods.
One striking finding from this review was the lack of uniformity regarding definitions for malnutrition. Various terms such as undernutrition, wasting, stunting, and micronutrient deficiencies were used interchangeably without consensus across different studies. This inconsistency makes it challenging to compare findings across different settings and hinders efforts to develop targeted interventions.
Furthermore, no consensus emerged regarding screening tools for identifying the risk of malnutrition among children with chronic diseases. Existing tools varied widely in their specificity and sensitivity, making it difficult to determine which tool would be most appropriate for use in resource-limited settings.
In light of these challenges, it is essential to adopt an approach that maximizes available resources while effectively identifying those at risk for disease-related malnutrition. In developing countries where resources are scarce but burdened by high rates of chronic diseases among children, focusing solely on finding the best screening tool may not be feasible or practical.
Instead, healthcare systems should emphasize implementing sustainable approaches tailored to their specific capacities. These approaches can include combining traditional anthropometric assessments with clinical evaluations and close observation of feeding access and tolerance. Regular monitoring of these parameters can help healthcare professionals identify signs of malnutrition and intervene promptly.
It is worth noting that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to address the complex nature of chronic diseases in pediatric patients. Collaboration between healthcare providers, nutritionists, and other allied healthcare professionals can help ensure comprehensive care plans are developed for individual patients.
In conclusion, disease-related malnutrition in pediatric patients with chronic conditions remains an under-researched area, particularly in developing countries. The lack of consensus on definitions and screening tools further complicates efforts to address this issue effectively. Therefore, it is crucial to adopt an approach that focuses on building sustainable systems based on available resources to monitor nutritional status regularly. Promoting collaboration between healthcare providers across disciplines will be vital in delivering comprehensive care for these vulnerable populations.
 
This study serves as a call-to-action for researchers and policymakers alike to prioritize research into disease-related malnutrition among children with chronic diseases in developing countries. By addressing this knowledge gap, we can develop targeted interventions that improve the long-term health outcomes of these vulnerable populations. 
Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of heart muscle diseases characterized by structural and functional abnormalities, leading to impaired cardiac function. They can be classified into different subtypes based on their etiology, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), among others. While environmental factors like hypertension or drug-induced toxicity can contribute to the development of cardiomyopathies, there is growing recognition of the importance of genetic predisposition in the pathogenesis of these conditions.
Genetic studies have identified numerous coding variants within genes encoding components of the cardiac sarcomere or associated molecular pathways that directly contribute to cardiomyopathy development. These include mutations in genes encoding contractile proteins like MYH7 and MYBPC3 in HCM or LMNA and TNNT2 in DCM. However, recent advancements in genomic technologies have revealed that noncoding regions of the genome also harbor potentially pathogenic variants.
Noncoding genetic variants encompass a wide range of changes occurring outside protein-coding regions, including transcriptional enhancers, promoters, intronic sites, and untranslated regions (UTRs). These sequences play critical roles in gene regulation by controlling when and where genes are expressed. Changes within these regulatory elements can disrupt proper gene expression patterns essential for normal cardiac function.
Several studies have identified noncoding variants associated with various types of cardiomyopathy. For instance, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within enhancer elements near key cardiac genes have been linked to an increased risk for HCM. Similarly, variations altering transcription factor binding sites within promoters of myocardial-expressed genes can influence gene expression levels and confer susceptibility to ARVC.
Intronic variations represent another class of noncoding genetic variants with potential implications for cardiomyopathies. Alterations affecting splicing regulatory elements within introns can disrupt mRNA processing and yield aberrant protein isoforms or downregulate gene expression. For example, mutations within intronic regions of the genes encoding titin (TTN) or phospholamban (PLN) have been associated with DCM and impaired calcium handling in the heart.
Although most research has focused on coding mutations, emerging evidence supports the functional significance of noncoding variants in cardiac disease. Several studies have successfully utilized genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify noncoding SNPs associated with cardiac traits or diseases. Integration of these GWAS signals with functional genomics data can help pinpoint causal regulatory elements contributing to cardiomyopathy risk.
Despite these advancements, challenges remain in understanding the precise mechanisms by which noncoding genetic variants contribute to cardiomyopathy development. Functional characterization of these variants requires sophisticated genomic tools such as CRISPR/Cas9-based strategies or mouse models with targeted mutagenesis. Additionally, large-scale collaborations among research groups will be necessary to establish robust associations between specific noncoding variants and different subtypes of cardiomyopathies.
In conclusion, although our knowledge regarding noncoding genetic variants' role in cardiomyopathy is still limited compared to coding mutations, there is mounting evidence supporting their contribution to disease development. Identifying and understanding these noncoding elements' functions may provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and facilitate the development of targeted therapies that modulate gene expression patterns dysregulated in different types of cardiomyopathies. As genetic testing becomes more commonplace, incorporating analysis of noncoding regions will undoubtedly enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve patient care by providing a more comprehensive assessment of an individual's risk for developing cardiovascular disease.
 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a significant cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advancements in therapy, the prognosis for many patients remains poor. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies, has revolutionized the treatment landscape and provided new hope for patients.
However, not all patients respond to ICI therapy, and there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes and guide treatment decisions. Currently, PD-L1 tumor expression is the most widely used biomarker for predicting ICI response. However, its limitations include intra-tumor heterogeneity and discrepancies between tissue samples obtained through biopsy or surgical resection.
Liquid biopsy offers a less invasive alternative to obtain biomarkers from peripheral blood samples instead of tissue-based biopsies. Several non-tumoral blood cell counts have shown potential as prognostic markers in NSCLC treated with ICI. Elevated absolute neutrophil counts have been associated with poorer outcomes, while favorable outcomes have been observed in patients with lower platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios.
Soluble-derived immune checkpoint-related products also hold promise as predictive biomarkers for ICI response. One such product is soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1), which can be detected in blood samples. Studies have shown that high levels of sPD-L1 are associated with worse prognosis in NSCLC patients treated with ICI.
In addition to non-tumoral blood cell counts and sPD-L1, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are emerging as potential liquid biopsy-based biomarkers for predicting ICI response in NSCLC. CTCs are cancer cells that detach from solid tumors into circulation and can be detected using various techniques. Detection and quantification of CTCs have been associated with poorer outcomes in NSCLC patients receiving ICI.
ctDNA, on the other hand, refers to tumor-specific DNA fragments released into circulation from apoptotic or necrotic tumor cells. Analysis of ctDNA allows for the detection of genetic alterations and mutations in tumors, which can guide treatment decisions and monitor treatment response. Several studies have shown that ctDNA analysis can predict ICI response and provide real-time insights into tumor dynamics.
Moving forward, liquid biopsies hold great promise in the immune landscape of lung cancer management. By incorporating non-tumoral blood cell counts, sPD-L1 levels, CTC detection and quantification, and ctDNA analysis into clinical practice, we may be able to better predict ICI response and tailor treatment strategies for individual patients.
However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before liquid biopsies can be widely implemented in routine clinical practice. Standardization of sample collection methods, assay techniques, and result interpretation is crucial to ensure reproducibility and reliability of liquid biopsy-based biomarkers. Furthermore, large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate these biomarkers across diverse patient populations.
In conclusion, the identification of soluble biomarkers using liquid biopsy holds great potential for predicting clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with ICI. Non-tumoral blood cell counts such as absolute neutrophil counts and ratios have shown promise as prognostic markers. Additionally,sPD-L1 levels as well as CTC detection/quantificationandctDN analysis possess predictive value for ICI response.
 However,reproducibility standardizationand validation through large scale prospective studies arerequiredbefore these markers canbe routinely usedinclinical practice.The incorporationof these promisingliquid biopsy-based biomarkershas

The study of phylogeography, the genetic variation and distribution of species over space and time, is crucial for understanding the evolutionary history and population dynamics of marine organisms. In particular, sharks and rays have attracted much attention due to their vulnerability to anthropogenic stressors and their importance in marine ecosystems. These animals possess a unique set of life history traits that make them more susceptible to human impacts, including late maturity, low fecundity, and slow growth rates.
Given the conservation concern surrounding sharks and rays globally, it is important to understand their genetic diversity and structure across different geographic regions. This knowledge can inform management strategies for these species, particularly as they face increasing threats from overfishing, habitat degradation, pollution, climate change.
In this review paper, we examined the existing data on the phylogeography of 40 shark species belonging to 17 genera and 19 ray species belonging to 11 genera. We focused on analyzing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from the cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI), a commonly used marker for studying population genetics in marine organisms.
We constructed median joining haplotype networks for each species using COI sequences from individuals sampled across their global range. These networks provide insights into patterns of genetic variation within each species by depicting relationships between different haplotypes.
Our analysis revealed several interesting findings regarding shark and ray phylogeography. First, we observed very shallow coalescence in most species' haplotype networks; similar patterns have been reported previously for other marine teleosts. This suggests recent population expansions or high levels of gene flow among populations.
Secondly, we found that star topologies were predominant among sharks while complex mutational topologies were more common among rays. We attribute this difference to differences in dispersal abilities during early life stages; rays are known to have extremely limited dispersal capabilities compared to some shark species.
Moreover, we observed variations in population structuring among species groups, which can be attributed to differences in life history traits. For instance, species that exhibit reproductive philopatry (returning to the same location to reproduce) or site fidelity showed higher levels of genetic structure when compared to migratory or pelagic species. Additionally, reef-associated and demersal (bottom-dwelling) species exhibited higher levels of genetic structure than pelagic and semi-pelagic species.
Finally, our analysis also revealed some broad patterns that can guide management and conservation strategies for sharks and rays. Pelagic and semi-pelagic species showed lower levels of genetic structure between and within ocean basins compared to other groups. This suggests higher gene flow among populations of these open-ocean dwelling species, which may have implications for their management as well as the design of marine protected areas.
Overall, our review provides valuable insights into the phylogeography of sharks and rays across different geographic regions. It highlights the importance of considering life history traits in understanding patterns of genetic diversity and structure in these vulnerable marine creatures. This knowledge can inform conservation efforts aimed at protecting these animals from ongoing threats such as overfishing, habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.
In conclusion, further research is needed to fill gaps in our understanding regarding how different factors such as current patterns, historical barriers or ecological preferences shape the phylogeography of sharks & rays., With this study we hope to contribute towards better global management plans for this highly important key predator group on Earth's oceans 
Nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO) is a devastating condition that leads to sudden and severe loss of vision. It is considered a variant of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and shares many similarities in terms of pathophysiology and clinical presentation. As such, there have been significant advances in the field of neuroprotection for AIS, which may hold promise for improving outcomes in NA-CRAO.
The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association have developed guidelines for the care of CRAO patients, emphasizing the importance of early intervention to maximize visual recovery. However, current treatment options are limited, with no standard neuroprotective therapy available. This review aims to explore the potential application of neuroprotection in improving outcomes for NA-CRAO.
In recent years, there has been a growing body of research focused on neuroprotection for various retinal diseases, including retinal detachment, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and inherited retinal diseases. These studies have identified several promising interventions that could potentially be adapted for use in NA-CRAO.
Additionally, extensive research into neuroprotection for AIS has yielded promising results with newer drugs such as Uric acid, Nerinetide, and Otaplimastat being tested. The progress made in cerebral neuroprotection after AIS raises hopes that similar approaches could be effective in protecting the retina after CRAO.
Combining neuroprotective strategies with thrombolysis may also extend the therapeutic window for treating NA-CRAO. Thrombolysis aims to dissolve or dislodge blood clots causing occlusion and restore blood flow to affected tissues. By combining this approach with neuroprotective agents that can mitigate further damage caused by reperfusion injury or ischemia-induced cascades within the retina, it may be possible to improve visual outcomes even beyond the currently recommended narrow time window.
Several experimental approaches have shown promise as potential neuroprotective treatments for CRAO. These include the use of Angiopoietin (Comp Ang1) to enhance vascular stability and protect against endothelial damage, KUS 121, a selective GluN1/GluN2B receptor antagonist that has shown efficacy in reducing retinal damage in animal studies, gene therapy targeting the XIAP gene to delay retinal cell death, and hypothermia as a means of reducing metabolic demand and limiting cell death.
However, for these neuroprotective strategies to be effectively translated into clinical practice, several challenges must be addressed. Better imaging techniques are needed to delineate the penumbra (the potentially salvageable tissue surrounding the ischemic core) after an acute episode of NA-CRAO. Techniques such as high-definition optical coherence angiography combined with electrophysiology can provide valuable insights into retinal perfusion and functional integrity.
Research efforts should also seek to elucidate the detailed pathophysiological mechanisms involved in NA-CRAO. By understanding these mechanisms at a molecular level, it may become possible to identify specific targets for neuroprotective interventions beyond general strategies used in AIS.
In conclusion, there is great potential for using neuroprotection as a treatment strategy for NA-CRAO. Building upon advances made in neuroprotection research for AIS and retinal diseases such as AMD, ongoing efforts should focus on refining imaging techniques, better understanding pathophysiological mechanisms specific to NA-CRAO, and bridging the gap between preclinical studies and clinical translation. With continued exploration and innovation in this field, we may eventually improve outcomes for patients suffering from this devastating condition 
Transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) has become a popular technique for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing major colorectal surgeries. It involves the injection of local anesthetics into the transversus abdominis plane, which blocks the nerves responsible for transmitting pain signals from the abdominal wall. By reducing opioid consumption and providing effective analgesia, TAPB can improve postoperative recovery and patient outcomes.
However, there are ongoing debates about the two main approaches to administering TAPB - laparoscopic and ultrasound-guided techniques. Laparoscopic TAPB involves direct visualization of the transversus abdominis muscle during surgery, allowing for precise placement of local anesthetic injections. On the other hand, ultrasound-guided TAPB relies on real-time imaging to visualize the anatomical structures and guide needle placement.
The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare these two approaches - laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB - in terms of their effectiveness and safety in postoperative pain management for minimally invasive colorectal surgery patients. By integrating both direct comparisons (studies directly comparing laparoscopic and ultrasound-guided TAPB) and indirect comparisons (studies comparing either approach with a control group), we hope to provide a comprehensive analysis that will help guide clinical decision-making.
We will conduct a systematic electronic literature search using databases such as PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov up until July 31, 2023. The selected studies will be assessed for methodological quality using tools such as Cochrane Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBIN-I).
Our primary outcome measures include opioid consumption at 24 hours postoperatively and pain scores at rest, coughing, and movement at 24 hours postoperatively, using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Secondary outcome measures will include the probability of TAPB-related adverse events, overall postoperative 30-day complications, postoperative 30-day ileus (intestinal obstruction), postoperative 30-day surgical site infection, postoperative 7-day nausea and vomiting, and length of hospital stay.
Data analysis will be performed using RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 17.0 software. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. A statistically significant result will be defined as a p-value less than 0.05.
The certainty of evidence will also be assessed using the GRADE working group approach to determine how confident we can be in the results.
Since this study involves a secondary analysis of existing data, no ethical approval is required. We anticipate that our meta-analysis will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB for minimally invasive colorectal surgery patients.
The results of this study are expected to have implications for future clinical trials and help guide clinicians in making informed decisions regarding perioperative pain management. The findings will be disseminated through high-quality peer-reviewed publications and international conference presentations to ensure widespread access to this important information.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis aims to compare laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB in terms of their efficacy and safety for managing postoperative pain in minimally invasive colorectal surgery patients. By analyzing available evidence, we hope to contribute towards improving perioperative pain management practices for better patient outcomes 
Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) devices are rapidly evolving as a promising tool for studying human physiology and disease in a more realistic and controlled manner compared to traditional 2D cell cultures. These 3D cell culture systems aim to replicate the complex microenvironment of human organs by integrating various cell types, such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and immune cells, within a microfluidic platform. OOC devices have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to recapitulate physiological functions of specific organs, offering potential applications in drug discovery, personalized medicine, and toxicology assessments.
Despite the numerous advantages of OOC models, there is a major challenge associated with these platforms - the lack of online analysis methods that enable real-time monitoring of cellular responses. Real-time analysis is crucial for understanding the dynamic behavior of cells within these complex systems. Traditional techniques used for analyzing cell culture media or supernatants often require sample collection at predetermined time points followed by offline analysis using techniques such as chromatography or immunoassays. However, this approach limits temporal resolution and fails to capture rapid changes occurring within the system.
Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful analytical technique that can overcome these limitations by enabling real-time monitoring of cell excretes from OOC models. MS offers high sensitivity and selectivity along with the potential to identify a wide range of analytes including metabolites, lipids, peptides, and proteins. However, connecting an OOC device directly to MS poses certain challenges mainly due to the nature of the media used in these devices.
The media commonly used in OOC devices contain nonvolatile buffers or additives that interfere with MS analysis. These nonvolatile compounds can cause ion suppression effects and affect ionization efficiency during MS analysis leading to decreased sensitivity or inaccurate quantification results. Additionally, continuous perfusion-based operation necessary for maintaining physiological conditions can dilute analytes present in low concentrations, making their detection challenging.
To overcome these challenges, several technological advances have been developed to enable the hyphenation of OOC devices with MS. These advancements primarily focus on sample pre-treatment strategies that allow for the removal or exchange of nonvolatile compounds to ensure compatibility with MS analysis. Various techniques such as liquid-liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction, and flow injection analysis have been explored and optimized to efficiently remove interfering compounds from OOC media prior to MS analysis.
Liquid chromatography (LC) has also been integrated into the workflow to further enhance separation and improve sensitivity in OOC-MS setups. LC allows for the efficient separation of analytes based on their physicochemical properties before introducing them into the mass spectrometer. The use of miniaturized LC systems or chip-based chromatography offers greater flexibility in integrating with microfluidic platforms and enhances compatibility between OOC devices and MS instruments.
In addition to sample pre-treatment strategies, advancements in microfluidic interfacing techniques have facilitated seamless connection between OOC devices and MS instruments. Microscale interfaces are designed to minimize volume loss during transfer from OOC outlets to MS inlet while maintaining low dead volumes that could lead to sample mixing or contamination.
Despite these technological advances, there are still some limitations that need to be addressed for successful hyphenation of OOC devices with MS. One major challenge is achieving high spatial resolution within the confined dimensions of microchannels while simultaneously maintaining continuous flow needed for real-time monitoring. Additionally, optimal integration of sensor technologies within microfluidic platforms would enable simultaneous monitoring of multiple analytes during experiments.
In conclusion, mass spectrometry represents a promising analytical technique for real-time analysis in organ-on-a-chip models due to its high sensitivity and selectivity. Overcoming challenges associated with nonvolatile compounds present in media used by these devices is essential for successful hyphenation with MS instruments. Technological advancements in sample pre-treatment strategies, integration of miniaturized LC systems, and microfluidic interfacing techniques have greatly contributed to the progress in this field. Further research and development efforts are needed to address the remaining challenges and realize the full potential of OOC-MS platforms for studying human physiology and disease at the cellular level. 
Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a prevalent and disabling condition that affects millions of people worldwide. These disorders can result in chronic pain, limited mobility, and reduced quality of life (QoL). Traditional rehabilitation methods have been effective in treating MSDs; however, they often require patients to attend physical therapy sessions at healthcare facilities, which can be burdensome for some individuals. 
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of digital healthcare (DHC) as an alternative approach to musculoskeletal rehabilitation. DHC encompasses various technologies such as mobile applications, wearable devices, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), which can be utilized to deliver rehabilitation interventions remotely. These technologies allow patients to access treatment at their convenience and offer personalized exercises and programs tailored to their specific needs.
The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of musculoskeletal rehabilitation using DHC compared to conventional rehabilitation methods. We aim to assess the impact of DHC on pain reduction and QoL improvement among individuals with MSDs.
2. Methods
We conducted a comprehensive search in multiple databases including PubMed, Ovid-Embase, Cochrane Library, and PEDro Physiotherapy Evidence Database from inception until October 28, 2022. The search strategy included keywords related to musculoskeletal disorders, digital healthcare interventions, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), pain outcomes, and quality of life measures.
After screening titles and abstracts for relevance based on predetermined inclusion criteria—including RCT design comparing DHC with conventional rehabilitation—we identified 54 studies that met our criteria for full-text review. All selected studies were assessed for risk of bias using standardized tools such as Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias.
3. Results
The meta-analysis included data from a total of 6240 participants across the selected studies. The average age range varied from 21.9 to 71.8 years, with diverse representations of MSDs. Knee and hip joint disorders were the most commonly studied conditions (n = 23).
The DHC interventions employed in the studies were varied, with mobile applications being the most frequently utilized (n = 26), followed by VR (n = 16) and AR (n = 16). The interventions provided patients with exercises, education, monitoring systems, and feedback to facilitate their rehabilitation process.
Our meta-analysis revealed that DHC rehabilitation was associated with significant pain reduction compared to conventional rehabilitation methods (SMD: -0.55, 95% CI: -0.74 to -0.36). These findings suggest that DHC has a positive impact on reducing musculoskeletal pain.
Moreover, results showed that DHC significantly improved both health-related QoL (SMD: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.29 to1.03) and disease-specific QoL (SMD: -0.44; 95% CI: -08687 to-0001) when compared to conventional rehabilitation approaches.
4.Discussion
The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence supporting the effectiveness of musculoskeletal rehabilitation using digital healthcare interventions for reducing pain and improving quality of life in individuals with MSDs.
The convenience and accessibility offered by DHC interventions allow individuals to undertake their therapy remotely without compromising treatment outcomes or patient safety.
However, the underlying mechanisms through which DHC affects patient-reported outcomes remain unclear and warrant further investigation. It is essential to understand how specific features of these technologies contribute to improvements in pain reduction and QoL enhancement among patients with different types of MSDs.
5.Conclusion
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that musculoskeletal rehabilitation using digital healthcare presents a practical alternative for managing pain associated with MSDs while improving quality of life outcomes across various domains. The use of DHC interventions offers flexibility, personalization, and convenience for both patients and healthcare professionals.
Future research should focus on investigating the specific mechanisms by which DHC interventions impact patient-reported outcomes, as well as identifying subgroups of individuals who may benefit the most from this approach. Additionally, long-term follow-up studies are needed to evaluate the sustainability and long-term effects of DHC rehabilitation in managing musculoskeletal pain and improving quality of life. 
Glycans, also known as carbohydrates or sugars, are molecules that play a crucial role in various biological processes. They can be attached to proteins or lipids, or exist as free structures. Glycans surround all human cells, forming a thick and dense layer called the glycocalyx. This layer of glycans provides protection to the cell surface and is involved in cell signaling and recognition.
The immune system closely monitors the unique glycan structures present on cells. These glycans help differentiate self from non-self, allowing the immune system to identify and eliminate foreign invaders such as bacteria or viruses. Moreover, aberrant glycosylations can occur in cancer cells, leading to the formation of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs). These TACAs are specific glycan structures that are correlated with various aspects of cancer biology.
Due to their association with cancer development and progression, TACAs have become attractive targets for monoclonal antibody-based therapies for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced proteins that can specifically bind to target molecules. Traditionally, full-length antibodies have been used for targeting TACAs in cancer therapy. However, these conventional antibodies face certain limitations when it comes to effectively accessing tumor sites.
The dense glycocalyx surrounding tumor cells poses a barrier for conventional antibodies by restricting their access to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) on cancerous cells. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment creates a hostile milieu with low oxygen levels and high interstitial fluid pressure which further hinders antibody penetration into tumors.
To overcome these challenges, researchers have developed small antibody fragments as alternatives to full-length antibodies when targeting specific glycans on tumor cells. In particular:
1) Single-chain variable fragments (scFv): scFv is derived from an antibody's variable regions and consists of only one chain instead of two heavy chains and two light chains found in full-length antibodies.
These small antibody fragments possess a similar affinity for their target TACAs as full-length antibodies but exhibit improved accessibility to tumor sites due to their smaller size. Their compact structure allows better penetration through the dense glycocalyx and enhances localization at the tumor site.
2) Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs): sdAbs, also known as nanobodies, are derived from heavy-chain-only antibodies found in camelids and sharks. These small antibody fragments consist of a single variable domain and lack the constant domain present in conventional antibodies.
Their reduced size enables them to penetrate deep into solid tumors with greater efficiency compared to full-length antibodies. Moreover, their high stability and solubility make them attractive candidates for cancer therapy.
3) Bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs): BiTEs are constructs designed to redirect immune cells called T cells towards cancer cells expressing specific TAAs.
These constructs consist of two binding domains: one that recognizes a specific TACA on cancer cells and another that targets T cells. By bringing these two cell types together, BiTEs can enhance the killing potential of activated T cells against cancerous cells. This approach not only provides access to tumor sites but also harnesses the body's own immune system for targeted destruction of cancerous cells.
In conclusion, small antibody fragments offer distinct advantages over conventional full-length antibodies in targeting specific glycans on tumor-associated antigens. Their smaller size allows for better penetration through the dense glycocalyx surrounding tumors, resulting in improved localization at tumor sites. Furthermore, these antibody fragments demonstrate similar affinity with increased efficiency compared to their larger counterparts.
Moving forward, ongoing research efforts will continue to explore novel approaches utilizing small antibody fragments for enhanced diagnosis and therapy against various cancers associated with aberrant glycosylation patterns.

Various synthetic strategies including cascade reactions, transition metal-catalyzed transformations, and multicomponent reactions have enabled efficient access to these important heterocyclic scaffolds. Furthermore, their potential applications in OLEDs, DSSCs, catalysis, and molecular organic frameworks highlight the versatility and significance of these compounds beyond their pharmaceutical applications. Further research into the development of novel synthetic methodologies and exploration of different applications is expected to expand the scope of dibenzo[b,f]heteropine chemistry in the future. 
Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important oilseed and cash crop that is cultivated worldwide. However, its growth, development, and eventual production are significantly affected by various biotic stresses such as fungal diseases, viral infections, bacterial pathogens, nematodes, and insect pests. These biotic stresses not only cause substantial yield losses but also pose challenges to sustainable peanut production.
To better understand the response and tolerance mechanisms of peanut to these biotic stresses, high-throughput Omics approaches have been increasingly employed in recent years. Omics technologies encompass a range of disciplines including genomics, transcriptomics (study of gene expression), proteomics (study of proteins), metabolomics (study of metabolites), miRNAomics (study of microRNAs), epigenomics (study of epigenetic modifications), and phenomics (study of phenotypic traits). Integrating the data obtained from these diverse Omics techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the biological processes occurring in peanuts under specific stress conditions.
In this review, we focus specifically on the advances made in Omics research on peanut response to biotic stresses. We first discuss the primary types of biotic stresses that threaten sustainable peanut production. Fungal diseases are one major concern for peanut cultivation worldwide, with pathogens such as Aspergillus flavus causing aflatoxin contamination in peanuts which poses serious health risks for humans. Viral infections can also lead to significant yield losses through symptoms like leaf mosaic or necrosis. Bacterial pathogens can infect various parts of the plant including leaves, stems, pods leading to wilting or rotting. Nematodes are microscopic worms that feed on plant roots causing stunted growth and reduced yields. Insect pests such as thrips and aphids damage peanuts by feeding on their foliage or transmitting viruses.
We then explore how multi-Omics technologies have been employed for peanut research and breeding under biotic stresses. By integrating the functional genomics data with other Omics techniques, researchers have been able to unravel the relationships between peanut genomes and phenotypes under specific stress conditions. For example, genomics studies have identified candidate genes involved in disease resistance or tolerance. Transcriptomics analyses have elucidated molecular pathways activated during pathogen infection. Proteomics research has provided insights into the key proteins involved in plant defense mechanisms against biotic stresses.
The advances made in various peanut Omics under biotic stresses are also discussed. Genomic studies have facilitated the identification of genes related to disease resistance or susceptibility using various approaches like genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Transcriptomic analysis has allowed the identification of differentially expressed genes in response to pathogens, providing valuable information about defense mechanisms activated by peanuts during infection.
Proteomic studies have enabled the identification of proteins involved in crucial biological processes such as signal transduction, defense responses, and stress tolerance. Metabolomics approaches have helped identify metabolites that play important roles in plant-pathogen interactions and can serve as biomarkers for disease diagnosis or markers for breeding for resistant varieties.
MiRNAomics studies on peanuts have revealed differentially expressed miRNAs associated with biotic stress responses, providing insights into post-transcriptional gene regulation during infection by pathogens. Epigenomic research has highlighted epigenetic modifications that occur under biotic stresses influencing gene expression patterns thus impacting plant defenses.
Phenomic analysis involves high-throughput screening of large collections of genetic resources or germplasm for traits related to stress tolerance or resistance coupled with accurate phenotypic measurements at different developmental stages which enables breeders to identify promising varieties more efficiently.
Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by peanut Omics research under biotic stresses including data integration and interpretation limitations, availability of well-annotated reference genomes among cultivated peanut varieties from diverse geographic regions worldwide along with great diversity within peanut populations making it necessary to capture the entire genetic structure to understand complex interactions between peanut genomes and biotic stresses. Additionally, the development of cost-effective and easy-to-use bioinformatics tools for data analysis is crucial.
Nevertheless, there are enormous opportunities for the application of Omics technologies in peanut breeding programs to develop improved cultivars that are more resistant or tolerant to biotic stresses. Such advancements can contribute significantly towards sustainable food production by enhancing yield stability and quality. Future research directions focus on integrating multi-Omics datasets with advanced bioinformatics techniques, functional validation of candidate genes or markers using genetic manipulation methods like CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology along with precise phenotyping in peanut breeding programs combined with farmer participatory approaches aiming at developing climate-smart varieties.
In conclusion, Omics approaches have provided valuable insights into the response and tolerance mechanisms of peanuts under biotic stresses. These technological advancements have facilitated the discovery of stress-related genes, proteins, metabolites, miRNAs, epigenetic modifications as well as phenotypic traits associated with resistance or tolerance to specific pathogens or pests. Continued research in this field will enable breeders to develop improved varieties that can withstand biotic stresses effectively while fulfilling global food demands sustainably. 
Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignancies in women worldwide, with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections being the primary cause. Specifically, HPV-16 and HPV-18 account for a large proportion of these cases (Walboomers et al., 1999). The viral oncoproteins encoded by HPV are expressed in HPV-positive cancers and are closely associated with the early stages of cancer development and transformation of normal cells into cancerous forms (zur Hausen, 2002).
The progression from normal cell growth to malignancy involves the dysregulation of various signaling pathways. One key pathway implicated in this process is the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This signaling cascade controls the expression of genes that play crucial roles in tumorigenesis (Polakis, 2012). Aberrant activation of this pathway can lead to evasion of immune surveillance by tumor cells through multiple mechanisms.
One critical factor involved in immune evasion is programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Normally expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, PD-L1 functions as an inhibitory checkpoint molecule that interacts with its receptor PD-1 on T lymphocytes to suppress their inflammatory function (Pardoll, 2012). However, tumor cells can upregulate PD-L1 expression as a means to evade immune recognition and destruction.
Recent studies have demonstrated a connection between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and PD-L1 expression in various cancers including cervical cancer. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been shown to promote PD-L1 expression through transcriptional regulation. The β-catenin protein acts as a co-transcriptional activator by forming complexes with transcription factors such as TCF/LEF family members that bind directly to regulatory elements within genes like PD-L1 (Spranger et al., 2015). This leads to increased PD-L1 expression on the surface of tumor cells.
Moreover, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway can also indirectly regulate other genes associated with immune evasion, such as c-MYC. c-MYC is a well-known oncogene that drives cell proliferation, survival, and immune tolerance (Dang, 2012). Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancer cells can lead to upregulation of c-MYC expression (He et al., 1998), which further contributes to immune evasion by promoting PD-L1 expression and suppressing immune cell function.
The dysregulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis plays a critical role in tumor progression. Elevated levels of PD-1 have been detected on exhausted T lymphocytes infiltrating HPV-positive cervical tumors (Han et al., 2020). These exhausted T cells are characterized by impaired effector function and increased production of cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) within the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, they exhibit high levels of CD39 expression, an ectonucleotidase known to suppress anti-tumor immunity by enzymatically degrading ATP into immunosuppressive adenosine molecules (Vigano et al., 2019).
Given the important role that Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays in regulating these crucial factors involved in immune evasion and tumorigenesis, targeting this pathway holds promise as a potential immunotherapy approach. One strategy could involve using specific inhibitors or small molecules to block key components within this pathway. In preclinical models, inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been shown to decrease PD-L1 expression and enhance anti-tumor immunity (Liu et al., 2020).
In conclusion, understanding the interplay between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is crucial for the development of effective immunotherapies for HPV-related cervical cancer. Although further research is needed, targeting this pathway holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance immune recognition and clearance of tumor cells. In addition, investigating the associations between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and other immune evasion mechanisms could provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between tumor cells and the immune system in cervical cancer malignancy.

Depression among youth is an increasingly prevalent and distressing mental health issue that poses a significant burden worldwide. Rates of depression surge from childhood through young adulthood, and there has been a notable increase in prevalence over the last decade. Despite identifying many risk factors and having evidence-based interventions targeting individual-level changes through psychological or pharmacological means, the field has not made substantial progress in understanding depression's features or effectively addressing its high prevalence among youth.
To address these challenges and advance the field, this paper advocates for reinvigorating construct validation approaches in order to better characterize the phenomenological features of youth depression. By doing so, we can develop more valid and reliable assessments that enhance scientific understanding and improve interventions for depression in young people. This approach recognizes the importance of historical and philosophical principles that have influenced how we conceptualize and measure depression.
Furthermore, it is crucial to expand the range and targets of treatments and prevention efforts beyond current practice guidelines for evidence-based interventions. While these interventions are valuable, they primarily focus on individual-level changes. The paper proposes incorporating structural- and system-level change at community and societal levels as part of a broader suite of interventions. For example, evidence-based economic anti-poverty interventions can help address social determinants of mental health by reducing financial stressors that contribute to depression among youth.
Personalized interventions with sufficient evidence base should also be considered as part of this comprehensive approach. By tailoring treatments to individual needs based on specific risk factors or symptoms profiles, we can improve outcomes for depressed youth.
To guide progress in understanding youth depression, the paper introduces the FORCE framework which stands for Fundamentals (understanding basic mechanisms), Openness (embracing diverse perspectives), Relationships (examining social influences), Constructs (developing comprehensive conceptual models), 	and Evidence (using rigorous research methods). Each aspect highlights critical areas where further attention is needed to advance our knowledge about youth depression.
By adopting these positions - reinvigorating construct validation approaches, broadening the range and targets of interventions, and embracing the FORCE framework - researchers and practitioners in the field of youth depression research can pave the way for new hope. Improved scientific understanding will facilitate more accurate assessments, early identification, and effective interventions for depressed youth. Additionally, addressing social determinants and personalizing treatments can lead to a comprehensive approach that reduces the burden of depression among young people.
In conclusion, depression among youth is a significant challenge that requires progress in both understanding its features and reducing distress. By reinvigorating construct validation approaches and broadening interventions to encompass structural-level changes, personalized treatments, as well as societal changes such as economic anti-poverty initiatives, we can provide new hope for improving the lives of depressed young individuals. The adoption of the FORCE framework guides us towards a holistic approach that considers multiple factors influencing depression while emphasizing rigorous research methods. With these efforts collectively applied, we have a greater chance of achieving substantial progress in tackling youth depression globally. 2. Understanding the Phenomenological Features:
Construct validation approaches are essential for understanding the phenomenological features of youth depression. By examining the underlying constructs and dimensions of depression, we can develop more accurate assessments that capture the unique experiences of young individuals. This includes considering cultural and developmental factors that may influence how depression presents in different populations.
Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of depression should go beyond simply categorizing symptoms. It is crucial to explore not only the core symptoms but also associated features such as cognitive processes, social functioning, and emotional regulation. This broader perspective helps in developing more targeted interventions that address not only symptom reduction but also functional impairment and overall well-being.
3. Broadening the Range and Targets of Interventions:
While evidence-based psychological and pharmacological interventions have shown efficacy in treating youth depression, there is a need to broaden our approach. Structural- and system-level changes at community and societal levels can contribute significantly to reducing distress among depressed youth.
For instance, economic anti-poverty interventions have demonstrated positive effects on mental health outcomes by alleviating financial stressors that often contribute to depression among disadvantaged youth. By addressing social determinants such as poverty, inequality, or access to education and healthcare services, we can enhance preventive efforts at a population level.
Personalized interventions are another important aspect to consider in improving treatment outcomes for depressed youth. By tailoring treatments based on individual needs or risk profiles (e.g., comorbidities or specific symptom presentations), we can maximize effectiveness while minimizing potential side effects or treatment resistance.
4. Embracing The FORCE Framework:
The FORCE framework provides a roadmap for progress toward improved understanding of depression among young people (Fundamentals), embracing diverse perspectives (Openness), examining social influences (Relationships), developing comprehensive conceptual models (Constructs), using rigorous research methods (Evidence).
Fundamentals encompass understanding basic mechanisms underlying depression such as neurobiology or genetic factors while considering developmental differences throughout childhood into young adulthood. By focusing on these fundamental aspects, we can enhance our knowledge of the underlying causes and mechanisms, leading to more targeted interventions.
Openness involves embracing diverse perspectives, including those from different disciplines, cultures, and lived experiences. This helps in challenging biases and assumptions that may limit our understanding of depression among youth. By fostering collaboration and inclusivity, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding that accounts for a wide range of factors influencing youth depression.
Relationships are vital in the context of youth depression as it is often influenced by family dynamics, peer relationships, and social support systems. Examining how these relationships impact an individual's depressive symptoms can guide interventions aimed at improving interpersonal functioning or strengthening support networks.
Constructs refer to developing comprehensive conceptual models that capture the complexity of youth depression. This involves considering various factors such as biological, psychological, social-cultural influences within a developmental framework. By integrating these different dimensions into cohesive models or theories, we can inform intervention strategies that address multiple factors simultaneously.
Lastly, evidence-based research methods are critical for advancing our understanding and reducing distress associated with youth depression. Rigorous research designs ensure validity and reliability while allowing for robust evaluation of interventions' effectiveness or identification of novel risk factors or protective mechanisms.
In conclusion,
Recognizing the prevalence and distress associated with depression among children and adolescents as well as its increasing rates globally is crucial to addressing this mental health challenge effectively. By reinvigorating construct validation approaches to better characterize its phenomenological features through rigorous research methods within the FORCE framework's domains Fundamentals Openness Relationships Constructs Evidence), progress in scientific understanding can be achieved.
Moreover,broadening the range and targets of interventions beyond current practice guidelines allows us to develop a more comprehensive approach that includes structural- and system-level changes at societal levels alongside personalized treatments tailored according to individual needs.Focusing on economic anti-poverty interventions could help address social determinants contributing to depressed Internet users especially disadvantaged individuals.Regardless of the efforts made,embracing diverse perspectives and acknowledging the complexity involved in youth depression is fundamental for further advancements.
By collectively applying these positions, we can foster new hope in improving our understanding of youth depression and reducing distress among affected individuals. Through continued research, collaboration, and innovative interventions targeting various levels of influence, we can make meaningful progress and ultimately enhance the well-being of depressed young people globally. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of understanding vulnerability and resilience in assessing pandemic risks. Arctic communities, such as those in Alaska, face unique challenges due to their remote location, extreme weather conditions, and cultural diversity. Traditional vulnerability assessments that use universal indicators may not capture the full complexity of these communities' capacity to withstand and recover from a pandemic.
Recognizing vulnerability and resilience as two distinct but interconnected dimensions is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of pandemic risk. Vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of a community to the impacts of disease outbreaks, taking into account factors such as healthcare access, socioeconomic status, and demographic characteristics. Resilience, on the other hand, assesses a community's ability to cope with and bounce back from these impacts.
This study focuses on developing a pandemic vulnerability-resilience framework specifically for Alaska's Arctic communities. By considering the unique cultural aspects and socioeconomic factors that shape these communities' capacity to respond to pandemics, we aim to provide more accurate risk assessments.
To assess vulnerability and resilience in Alaska's Arctic communities regarding COVID-19 or future pandemics, we developed indices that capture relevant factors specific to this region. These include demographic data such as age distribution and population density; social determinants of health like access to healthcare facilities; economic indicators like income levels; infrastructure factors including transportation systems; cultural considerations such as language barriers; governance structures at local levels; and environmental conditions like climate change effects.
Using these indices, we analyzed census areas and boroughs within Alaska's Arctic region for their level of vulnerability and resilience. Interestingly, our findings challenge the assumption that highly vulnerable areas always experience severe epidemiological outcomes. We found that some highly vulnerable areas managed better than expected due to their strong resilience capacities.
Specifically, our analysis revealed that census areas or boroughs with higher resilience showed lower rates of cumulative deaths per 100 000 people as well as lower case fatality ratios compared to less resilient areas. This suggests that resilience plays a significant role in reducing the impact of a pandemic on a community.
Understanding the interaction between vulnerability and resilience is crucial for accurately identifying populations and communities at the highest risk or with the greatest needs. This knowledge allows for more efficient allocation of resources and services before, during, and after a pandemic. By adopting a resilience-vulnerability-focused approach, policymakers and public health officials can better prioritize efforts to support communities in remote regions or those with large Indigenous populations.
The framework developed in this study can be easily adapted to assess the potential effects of COVID-19 or future health crises in other remote regions around the world, particularly those with similar demographic characteristics or cultural diversity. By incorporating both vulnerability and resilience into risk assessments, we can foster greater preparedness and strengthen community capacities to respond to pandemics effectively.
In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of recognizing vulnerability and resilience as distinct dimensions when assessing pandemic risks in Arctic communities. By understanding how these two factors interact, policymakers can make more informed decisions regarding resource allocation pre-, during-, and post-pandemic situations. The findings from Alaska's case study also offer insights for other remote regions grappling with similar challenges related to pandemics or public health crises involving diverse populations. 
Anticancer drug use at the end of life is a complex and controversial topic that raises important ethical considerations. The decision to continue or discontinue cancer treatment in patients nearing the end of their lives is challenging for both healthcare professionals and patients.
The goal of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the frequency of anticancer drug use at the end of life, thereby shedding light on current practices and potentially identifying areas for improvement. By examining a large number of publications and analyzing key study features, we aim to identify patterns and trends in anticancer drug use during this critical phase.
To conduct this scoping review, we performed systematic searches in Medline and Embase databases, using specific search terms related to anticancer drug use at the end of life. We selected 341 eligible publications that met our inclusion criteria, which included articles reporting on any aspect of anticancer drug use in patients near the end stages of their disease.
Each publication was carefully reviewed to gather important study characteristics such as timing of research (e.g., retrospective or prospective), disease status (e.g., advanced or metastatic cancer), treatment schedule (e.g., continuous or intermittent), treatment type (e.g., chemotherapy, targeted therapy), and treatment characteristics (e.g., dose, duration).
Amongst our subset analysis comprising 69 articles published within the last 5 years across various cancer types, we focused on examining the frequency of anticancer drug use during specific time periods near the end stages. This analysis aimed to provide insights into how often these drugs are prescribed during different phases approaching death.
Preliminary findings from this scoping review suggest significant variability in terms of when anticancer drugs are used at the end stage of different cancers. Some studies showed frequent administration up until very close to death as part an effort to contain tumor growth even when quality-of-life considerations become paramount. However, other studies indicated more conservative approaches with earlier discontinuation once the disease became advanced or when treatment started to adversely affect the patient's well-being.
These contrasting findings highlight the need for further research and a standardized approach in determining appropriate timing for anticancer drug use at the end of life. By establishing clear guidelines based on robust evidence, healthcare professionals can navigate this complex decision-making process more effectively, ensuring that patients receive appropriate care that aligns with their specific needs and wishes.
In conclusion, this scoping review provides a comprehensive description of publications on anticancer drug use at end of life and emphasizes the importance of considering methodological factors when designing future studies. By understanding current practices and identifying areas for improvement, healthcare providers can optimize care for patients facing terminal cancer and maximize their quality of life during their final stages. Further research is needed to develop evidence-based guidelines that balance potential therapeutic benefits with patient-centered considerations in this challenging context. Moreover, the implications of anticancer drug use at the end of life extend beyond individual patients to the broader healthcare system. The high cost of these drugs, combined with limited resources and competing priorities, necessitates a careful examination of their utility in this context. Understanding the frequency and patterns of anticancer drug use can help inform resource allocation decisions and promote more efficient and equitable healthcare delivery.
Additionally, this scoping review serves as a call to action for further research in this area. While we have provided an overview of current literature, there are still gaps in our understanding of anticancer drug use at the end of life. Future studies could explore factors influencing treatment decisions, such as patient preferences, clinician attitudes, and societal influences.
Furthermore, exploring patient outcomes associated with different approaches to end-of-life cancer treatment is crucial. Evaluating not only survival but also quality-of-life measures can provide essential insights into the impact of these treatments on patients' well-being. It is important to strike a balance between maximizing survival while minimizing unnecessary suffering caused by aggressive treatments near death.
Collaboration among researchers is essential in addressing these gaps in knowledge comprehensively. By pooling data from multiple studies or conducting multicenter trials with standardized protocols and outcome measures, we can generate more robust evidence on which appropriate clinical practice guidelines can be based.
In conclusion, this scoping review highlights the need for a greater understanding of anticancer drug use at the end of life. By identifying key study features and examining frequency patterns across various cancer types during different phases near death, we shed light on current practices while emphasizing methodological considerations for future research.
The findings underscore that decision-making regarding anticancer drug use at end-of-life requires careful consideration based on individual patient circumstances and preferences. Healthcare providers must engage patients in shared decision-making conversations that take into account prognosis information alongside potential benefits and burdens associated with continued treatment.
Moving forward towards evidence-based guidelines will require collaboration between researchers across different disciplines, including medical oncologists, palliative care specialists, and health economists. By collectively studying the optimal timing and appropriateness of anticancer drug use at end of life, we can improve patient care and optimize resource allocation in a manner that aligns with patient preferences and overall healthcare goals. Ultimately, our aim should be to provide compassionate and individualized care during the final stages of life for those facing cancer. 
Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe headache, often accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. It affects approximately 10-15% of the population worldwide and can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life.
The management of migraine typically includes medication for acute relief and prevention, but there is growing evidence suggesting that exercise may also play a role in its treatment. Exercise has been shown to have both physical and psychological benefits, including the reduction of pain intensity and frequency, improvement in mood, stress reduction, and enhancement of overall well-being.
This clinical practice guideline aims to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding exercise prescription for patients with migraine. The guideline was developed following rigorous methodology recommended by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE). The quality of evidence was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria.
A systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant scientific studies on exercise intervention in patients with migraine. The identified studies were then critically appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to determine their quality.
Based on the evaluation of current evidence, several types of exercises were found to be beneficial for patients with migraine. Aerobic exercise was found to have a B grade recommendation for improving symptoms, disability, and quality of life in migraine patients. This includes activities such as walking or jogging at moderate intensity for at least 30 minutes per day.
Moderate-continuous aerobic exercise also received a B grade recommendation for its effectiveness in reducing symptoms and disability associated with migraines. This involves maintaining a moderate level of intensity throughout one's workout session without any breaks or periods of rest.
Yoga was another form of exercise that received a B grade recommendation. Yoga combines physical postures with breathing techniques and meditation practices which can help reduce stress levels associated with migraines.
In addition to specific types of exercise, lifestyle recommendations were also recommended for migraine patients. These include maintaining a regular sleep pattern, avoiding triggers such as certain foods or drinks, managing stress levels through relaxation techniques, and ensuring proper hydration.
Other forms of exercise such as relaxation techniques, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), low-intensity continuous aerobic exercise, Tai Chi, and resistance exercise obtained a C grade recommendation. While they may not have the same level of evidence as the B grade recommendations, they still show promise in improving migraine symptoms and disability.
It is important for healthcare professionals to consider these exercise recommendations when developing treatment plans for patients with migraines. However, it is also crucial to individualize the prescription based on each patient's specific needs and abilities.

The gut microbiome, which refers to the trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has gained considerable attention in recent years due to its potential impact on human health. It has been implicated in various physiological processes, such as digestion, immune function, and metabolism. Additionally, alterations in the gut microbiome have been associated with a range of diseases including obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain autoimmune conditions.
One factor that may influence the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome is vitamin D. Observational studies have indicated a link between vitamin D levels and microbial diversity in the gut; however, there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials investigating this relationship.
The D-Health Trial sought to address this gap by examining the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the gut microbiome in older Australians. The trial recruited 21,315 participants between ages 60-84 years and randomly assigned them to receive either a monthly dose of 60,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo for a duration of five years. Stool samples were collected approximately five years after randomization from 835 participants (417 placebo group and 418 vitamin D group).
To characterize the gut microbiome composition, researchers employed 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This technique allows for identification and classification of different bacterial taxa present within stool samples. Alpha diversity indices (Shannon index as primary outcome measure), which reflect microbial richness and evenness within individual samples, were compared between groups using linear regression analysis.
Interestingly, there were no significant differences observed between participants receiving vitamin D supplementation compared to those receiving placebo regarding alpha diversity measures such as Shannon index (mean values: 3.51 vs 3.52 for placebo vs vitamin D groups respectively). Furthermore,, other alpha diversity indices including richness and inverse Simpson index showed minimal variation between both groups.
In addition to evaluating alpha diversity measures , researchers investigated beta-diversity using principal coordinate analysis based on Bray Curtis distance and UniFrac index. These analyses compare microbial community composition between samples. However, no significant clustering or separation was observed according to randomization group.
Furthermore, the study examined the abundance of different bacterial taxa between participants receiving vitamin D supplementation versus placebo. Negative binomial regression models were employed to analyze these differences while adjusting for multiple testing. Surprisingly, there was no notable difference in the abundance of the 20 most abundant genera between groups.
Of note,, previous studies have suggested that alterations in the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio may be associated with several diseases and conditions including obesity. However, no significant difference was observed in this ratio between participants receiving vitamin D supplementation versus placebo.
In summary, the results from the D-Health Trial indicate that monthly doses of 60,000 IU of vitamin D3 supplementation for five years did not significantly alter the composition or diversity of the gut microbiome in older Australians aged 60-84 years old. These findings are noteworthy as they add to our understanding of potential factors influencing gut microbiome composition and provide valuable insights into human health outcomes associated with vitamin D supplementation.
Despite not finding a significant effect on gut microbiome composition and diversity in this trial, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations. Firstly,the analyses were based on stool samples collected at a single time point approximately five years after randomization , therefore longer-term studies may reveal different results.. Moreover,differences according to age,genderr or ethnicity could also be considered.. Future research should explore other factors that may influence gut microbiome such as diet,prescription medications,and underlying health conditions.. In conclusion,the current evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation at this dose does not significantly impact gut microbial diversity among older Australians.However further studies are warranted to fully elucidate whether other forms,doses or durations are more influential.and explore any associations with specific health outcomes 
Lung cancer is one of the most common clinical malignant tumors, and its incidence has been increasing annually. Traditional open surgeries for lung cancer resections involve large incisions, leading to significant postoperative pain, prolonged hospitalization, and delayed recovery for patients. Minimally invasive techniques such as thoracoscopic surgery have revolutionized the field of lung cancer resection by providing excellent surgical outcomes while minimizing trauma to patients.
Single-port thoracoscopic surgery is a relatively novel approach that involves performing the entire procedure through a single small incision in the chest wall. This technique offers several advantages over traditional multi-hole thoracoscopic surgery and even open thoracotomy. The primary advantage lies in reduced postoperative pain due to the smaller incision size, resulting in improved patient comfort and satisfaction. Additionally, single-port surgery allows for comparable surgical outcomes, including complete tumor resection and lymph node dissection.
However, despite these advantages of single-port thoracoscopic surgery in lung cancer patients, it still induces varying degrees of stress on the body. The stress response elicited during surgery can lead to impaired immune function, increased inflammatory response, and compromised respiratory function postoperatively. Consequently, promoting rapid rehabilitation becomes essential to enhance recovery outcomes and improve prognosis.
Rapid rehabilitation refers to a comprehensive perioperative nursing program designed to minimize complications while maximizing functional recovery after surgery. It encompasses various strategies such as preoperative education and counseling aimed at reducing anxiety levels; optimized anesthesia management protocols that help maintain hemodynamic stability; intraoperative fluid management strategies targeted at reducing fluid overload or dehydration; use of evidence-based analgesic protocols tailored according to patient needs; early mobilization plans focused on preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), respiratory complications like pneumonia or atelectasis; personalized nutrition support programs designed according to individual requirements; careful wound care practices that aim at preventing infection or wound dehiscence; close monitoring of vital signs throughout recovery period facilitating early recognition and management of any complications; and comprehensive patient education programs enabling self-care measures at home.
Several studies have examined the effectiveness of rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. These studies have shown that implementing a multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, physical therapists, nutritionists, and psychologists significantly improves postoperative outcomes. Patients who received rapid rehabilitation care demonstrated reduced length of hospital stay, decreased pain scores, improved lung function recovery rates, reduced postoperative complications such as pneumonia or DVTs compared to conventional care.
In conclusion, rapid rehabilitation nursing holds great potential in enhancing recovery outcomes for lung cancer patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery. By employing a multidisciplinary approach and implementing evidence-based strategies throughout the perioperative period from preoperative counseling to post-discharge follow-up care, patients can benefit from improved functional recovery rates and enhanced quality of life. Further research is needed to explore additional aspects that can be addressed through rapid rehabilitation nursing to optimize patient outcomes in this surgical population. The future lies in incorporating personalized medicine principles into recovery protocols tailored specially as per individual needs to further improve surgical outcomes in lung cancer patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery.
 2. Methods
In order to review the research progress on rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery, a systematic literature search was conducted. Relevant articles were identified by searching electronic databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar using keywords such as "lung cancer", "thoracoscopy", "single-port surgery", "rapid rehabilitation nursing", and their combinations.
The inclusion criteria for selecting articles were as follows: 1) studies focusing on the application of rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery; 2) studies published in English; and 3) studies conducted on human subjects.
After screening the initial search results based on title and abstract, full-text articles that met the inclusion criteria were further evaluated. Data from selected studies were extracted and analyzed to identify key findings related to rapid rehabilitation nursing interventions and their impact on postoperative outcomes in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.
3. Results
Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of various components of rapid rehabilitation nursing in improving postoperative outcomes for patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. These interventions include preoperative education and counseling programs, optimized anesthesia management protocols, early mobilization plans, personalized nutrition support programs, evidence-based analgesic protocols, wound care practices, close monitoring of vital signs during recovery period as well as comprehensive patient education programs.
Preoperative education programs have been shown to reduce anxiety levels among patients by providing them with information about the surgical procedure itself, expected outcomes, potential complications,and self-care measures postoperatively. This helps them better prepare both physically and mentally for the surgery,resulting in reduced stress levels during recovery period.
Optimized anesthesia management protocols focus on maintaining hemodynamic stability throughout surgery which aids in minimizing perioperative complications such as cardiovascular events or excessive bleeding.These strategies involve using appropriate anesthetic agents,doses,and techniques tailored according to individual patient characteristics.
Early mobilization plans are crucial in preventing postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis(DVT) or respiratory complications like pneumonia or atelectasis. By encouraging early ambulation and activity, patients can restore their lung function faster and minimize the risk of developing complications.
Additionally, personalized nutrition support programs play a significant role in promoting recovery by ensuring patients receive adequate nutritional support based on their individual requirements. This helps maintain energy levels, promotes tissue healing,and boosts the immune system.
Moreover,evidence-based analgesic protocols customized according to patient's needs help in controlling postoperative pain effectively while minimizing side effects from medications which can further aid in early mobilization and overall recovery progression.
Wound care practices involving vigilant monitoring for signs of infection and dehiscence are paramount for preventing wound-related complications. Strict adherence to aseptic techniques,reliable dressing material selection,and expert wound care management are critical elements in this aspect of rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.
Close monitoring of vital signs such as blood pressure,heart rate,respiratory rate,followed by timely interventions if any abnormalities are detected is fundamental for early detection and management of potential postoperative complications.
Comprehensive patient education programs play an essential role not only during hospital stay but also after discharge. Providing patients with information on self-care measures at home,self-monitoring parameters along with access to healthcare professionals if needed empowers them to actively participate in their own recovery process thereby improving outcomes.Long-term follow-up care throughout the recovery period ensures continuity of care enabling proper management strategies when needed,such as physiotherapy or counseling services aimed at achieving optimal quality of life for patients.

This multidisciplinary approach that involves healthcare professionals from diverse fields focuses on addressing physical,psychological,and nutritional aspects of the patients in a holistic manner.
However,further research is still needed to evaluate the long-term effects of rapid rehabilitation nursing interventions ,assess patient satisfaction and quality of life measures over an extended period post-surgery. Additionally,investigations comparing different rapid rehabilitation nursing protocols or exploring novel interventions can provide valuable insights to optimize patient care in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.
In conclusion,rapid rehabilitation nursing has emerged as a significant aspect of enhanced recovery after single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.Its comprehensive care strategies,along with a multidisciplinary approach,have shown immense potential in promoting faster functional recovery,reducing complications associated with surgery and improving overall patient outcomes.It is crucial for healthcare providers to recognize the importance of incorporating these nursing interventions into clinical practice to further enhance recovery for lung cancer patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery. 
The field of tumor-associated microbiota has gained considerable attention in recent years as studies have revealed the presence of microorganisms within tumor tissues. Initially discovered over a century ago, the significance of these microorganisms in cancer development and progression is only now becoming apparent. This emerging area of research requires a transdisciplinary approach, combining techniques from molecular biology, microbiology, and histology to unravel the complexity of the tumor microenvironment.
One of the major challenges in studying tumor-associated microbiota is the low biomass present within tumors. Unlike other microbial ecosystems such as the gut or skin, tumors host a relatively small number of microorganisms. This poses technical and analytical difficulties when trying to identify and characterize these microbes accurately.
To overcome these challenges, researchers have employed advanced sequencing technologies such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing or shotgun metagenomic sequencing to identify microbial communities within tumors. These approaches provide insights into both bacterial species composition and functional potential. Additionally, histological techniques allow for visualization and localization of specific microbes within tumor tissues.
Several studies have started unraveling the diversity and functions of tumor-associated microbiota across various cancers. For instance, researchers identified specific bacterial taxa enriched in certain types of tumors but not in adjacent non-tumor tissues or healthy controls. Furthermore, some studies suggest that certain bacteria may promote tumorigenesis through mechanisms like chronic inflammation or altered metabolism.
The clinical relevance of tumor-associated microbiota is also being investigated extensively. Initial evidence suggests that differences in microbial composition may influence treatment outcomes by modulating immune responses or even drug efficacy. Microbiota-targeted interventions could thus potentially enhance therapeutic responses for patients with cancer.
Furthermore, recent studies indicate that shifts in the composition of gut microbiota can affect systemic anti-tumor immune responses through mechanisms like modulation of dendritic cell function or alteration of T cell subsets at distant sites from primary tumors. This implies that manipulating gut microbiota may hold promise as an adjunct therapy for cancer treatment.
In addition to studying the bacterial component, emerging evidence suggests that viruses and fungi may also be present within tumor tissues. Studies exploring the virome and mycobiome of tumors have provided insights into their potential roles in cancer development and progression. For example, certain tumor-associated viruses have been implicated in oncogenesis by disrupting cellular signaling pathways or promoting genomic instability.
It is evident that tumor-associated microbiota represents a new layer of complexity within the tumor microenvironment. The interactions between cancer cells and the microbial communities co-existing within tumors are likely to influence tumorigenesis, treatment response, and ultimately patient outcomes. As researchers continue to decipher these intricate relationships, they can provide novel therapeutic opportunities for patients with cancer.
In conclusion, the study of tumor-associated microbiota is a rapidly evolving field with significant implications for our understanding of cancer biology and treatment strategies. The transdisciplinary nature of this research requires collaboration among experts from various disciplines to address technical challenges associated with low biomass samples at multiple levels - biological, clinical, analytical - as a unified effort. With continued investigation into this intriguing area of research, we may witness paradigm shifts in our approach towards addressing one of humanity's most formidable challenges - cancer. 
The cGAS-STING pathway is a crucial component of the innate immune system, responsible for detecting the presence of pathogens or cellular damage and initiating an immune response. At the heart of this pathway is 2’3’-cGAMP, a cyclic dinucleotide molecule produced by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS in response to aberrant dsDNA in the cytoplasm.
Traditionally, it was believed that detection of pathogens by pattern recognition receptors would induce interferon and cytokine production within the cell where sensing occurred. These signaling molecules would then act locally in both an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce responses in nearby cells. However, recent studies have shed light on alternative mechanisms by which 2’3’-cGAMP can travel to neighboring cells and activate STING.
These discoveries have significant implications for our understanding of immune responses against microbial invaders, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. Dysregulation of the cGAS-STING pathway has been linked to various inflammatory diseases, highlighting its importance as a therapeutic target. However, developing effective antagonists has proven challenging due to the complexity of this pathway.
By identifying how 2’3’-cGAMP can be transported between cells independent of DNA sensing by cGAS, we gain new insights into potential treatment strategies. This change in perspective allows us to not only target intracellular DNA sensors but also focus on blocking intercellular transmission mechanisms.
One major avenue where this knowledge can be applied is vaccine design. By understanding how 2’3’-cGAMP spreads from infected cells to nearby uninfected cells, we can develop vaccines that promote this intercellular communication. This could lead to more robust immune responses against infectious agents and enhance vaccine efficacy.
Cancer immunotherapies also stand to benefit from these new insights into intercellular transport mechanisms. The cGAS-STING pathway plays a crucial role in anti-tumor immune responses, and strategies that enhance its activation can boost the effectiveness of immunotherapies. By targeting the intercellular transmission of 2’3’-cGAMP, we may be able to develop novel therapies that specifically activate STING in tumor cells, leading to their destruction by the immune system.
Moreover, understanding the intercellular transport of 2’3’-cGAMP opens up new possibilities for treating cGAS-STING associated diseases. Inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome have been linked to dysregulation of this pathway. Developing antagonists that target intercellular transmission may provide a more effective approach for suppressing excessive inflammation associated with these conditions.
In conclusion, recent discoveries regarding how 2’3’-cGAMP can be transported between cells have challenged the traditional view of DNA sensing and immune signaling. This change in perspective offers exciting opportunities for vaccine design, cancer immunotherapies, and treatment of cGAS-STING associated diseases. Further research is needed to fully understand these mechanisms and develop targeted therapies based on this newfound knowledge. Further research is being conducted to unravel the intricate details of how 2’3’-cGAMP is transported between cells. Several mechanisms have been identified, including cellular exosomes, gap junctions, and membrane channels. Exosomes, small vesicles released by cells, have emerged as important carriers for intercellular communication. They can contain various signaling molecules, including 2’3’-cGAMP, and deliver them to neighboring cells where they activate STING.
Gap junctions are another pathway for intercellular transfer of 2’3’-cGAMP. These specialized structures allow for direct communication between adjacent cells through connexin proteins that form channels connecting the cytoplasm of two cells. It has been shown that neighbors of cGAS-expressing cells can receive 2’3’-cGAMP via these gap junctions and initiate immune responses.
Membrane channels also play a role in facilitating the transfer of 2'3'-cGAMP between cells. For example, a recent study identified an ATP-gated Pannexin channel as a vehicle for transmitting cGAMP from producer to recipient cells. This mechanism extends beyond cell-cell communication and demonstrates how extracellular signaling molecules can be taken up by neighboring cells to activate STING.
Understanding these transport mechanisms not only sheds light on how immune signals are propagated but also provides potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Modulating the intercellular transmission pathways could offer precise control over immune activation in diseases where the cGAS-STING pathway is dysregulated.
The implications extend beyond infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy; other diseases associated with excessive inflammation may also benefit from this new perspective. Chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease involve aberrant activation of the immune system and sustained production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By targeting intercellular transmission in these conditions, it may be possible to dampen excessive immune responses and alleviate symptoms.
In addition to therapeutic possibilities, the discovery of intercellular transport mechanisms for 2'3'-cGAMP raises several intriguing questions. Future research will likely focus on identifying the molecular players involved in the transfer process, understanding how cells selectively receive and respond to 2'3'-cGAMP, and investigating whether other molecules can hitch a ride with 2'3'-cGAMP during intercellular communication.
In conclusion, the elucidation of intercellular transport mechanisms for 2’3’-cGAMP has revolutionized our understanding of immune signaling. This newfound knowledge opens doors for novel therapeutic approaches in infectious diseases, cancer immunotherapy, and inflammatory disorders. By targeting intercellular transmission pathways and modulating immune activation at multiple levels, researchers aim to develop more effective treatments that minimize side effects while maximizing desired outcomes. The journey to harnessing cGAMP as a traveling messenger holds promise for advancing the field of immunology towards innovative therapeutics and improved patient care. 
In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), leading to its integration into various sectors including medicine and dentistry.

Patient information is often sensitive, making it crucial for AI systems to adhere to strict privacy regulations while keeping data secure from hackers or unauthorized access.
4.2 Interpretability: While AI algorithms have shown promise in accuracy, they often act as "black boxes," meaning that the process by which they reach their conclusions may not always be easily understandable by human clinicians. This lack of interpretability can undermine trust in the technology.
5.Conclusion:
In conclusion, artificial intelligence has immense potential when it comes to medical and dental applications. From diagnostics and treatment planning to image analysis and disease prediction, AI can significantly enhance healthcare outcomes by leveraging big data analysis and machine learning algorithms. However, careful attention must be given to address ethical concerns such as privacy and data security while ensuring interpretability of results for clinical understanding.It is clear that artificial intelligence will continue to revolutionize medicine and dentistry; however, ongoing research is essential for understanding its full potential and overcoming any challenges that arise along the way.
 
Alcohol consumption is a significant public health concern, with potential links to increased risk of cancer. Strategies that aim to reduce alcohol consumption, especially in young people, could have substantial health benefits and contribute to cancer prevention efforts. The increasing accessibility and applicability of digital technologies have made them powerful tools that can facilitate changes in behavior among young people. These changes can lead to both immediate and long-term improvements in public health.
In this overview, we conducted a review of systematic reviews to assess the available evidence on digital interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption in sub-populations of young people. We specifically looked at school-aged children, college/university students, young adults (over 18 years), and both adolescents and young adults (below 25 years). We conducted searches across relevant databases such as KSR Evidence, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). We screened records independently based on title and abstract criteria, with those meeting inclusion criteria subjected to full-text screening by two reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBIS checklist, and we employed a narrative analysis methodology.
We included twenty-seven systematic reviews that addressed relevant interventions for one or more sub-populations. However, these reviews were mostly assessed as low quality due to varying definitions of "digital intervention" across the reviews themselves. Furthermore, the available evidence was limited in terms of sub-population targeted as well as type of intervention examined. None of the reviews reported on cancer incidence or influence on cancer-related outcomes.
For school-aged children eHealth multiple health behavior change interventions delivered through various digital methods were found not effective in preventing or reducing alcohol consumption or prevalence rates. In contrast, for adolescents and/or young adults identified as risky drinkers using computer or mobile device-based interventions resulted in reduced alcohol consumption compared to no/minimal intervention. University/college students who participated in E-interventions saw a small reduction in the number of drinks consumed per week compared to assessment-only controls. Web-based personalized feedback interventions also demonstrated a slight to medium effect on alcohol consumption. For risky drinkers, stand-alone computerized interventions reduced both short and long-term alcohol consumption compared to no intervention, while computerized assessment and feedback had a small effect compared to assessment only. Computerized brief interventions did not show significant effects when compared to counselor-based interventions.
In young adults and adolescents, SMS-based interventions did not significantly reduce the quantity of drinks per occasion or average number of standard glasses per week but increased the risk of binge drinking episodes.
The interpretation of these findings is limited due to potential bias and heterogeneity in the review results. However, limited evidence suggests that digital interventions, particularly those with feedback mechanisms, may have some potential for reducing alcohol consumption in specific sub-populations of young people. But it's important to note that these effects are often small or inconsistent when only methodologically strong evidence is considered.
In conclusion, there currently isn't enough systematic review evidence supporting the notion that digital interventions can effectively reduce cancer incidence through alcohol moderation in young people. Further research is needed using robust methodologies to fully explore the potential impact of digital interventions and form an evidence base for public health initiatives aimed at reducing alcohol consumption - a major cancer risk factor 
Prostate cancer is a significant health concern globally, with increasing prevalence in developed and developing countries. Among the treatment approaches for advanced prostate cancer, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been an established standard for over 80 years. ADT primarily aims to reduce circulating androgen levels and block androgen signaling to inhibit tumor growth. While initial responses to ADT are generally positive, some tumor cell populations eventually become resistant to therapy and continue to metastasize.
Recent studies have shed light on a potential mechanism contributing to resistance in advanced prostate cancer treated with ADT. Evidence suggests that ADT may induce cadherin switching, specifically from E-cadherin (a marker of epithelial cells) to N-cadherin (a marker of mesenchymal cells). This phenomenon is known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
Cadherins are a family of transmembrane proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion. They play critical roles in maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues by ensuring tightly connected cell networks via E-cadherin-mediated interactions. Loss or reduced expression of E-cadherin disrupts these connections, leading to cellular detachment from the primary tumor mass.
N-cadherin, on the other hand, is normally associated with mesenchymal cells that exhibit migratory properties during development or tissue repair processes. However, its aberrant expression in epithelial cells under pathological conditions can promote invasive behaviors typical of metastatic cancers.
Several factors contribute to cadherin switching during ADT treatment in prostate cancer. Direct mechanisms involve alterations in gene expression at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. For example, elevated levels of transcription factors such as ZEB1/2 repress E-cadherin expression while upregulating N-cadherin transcription.
Indirect mechanisms involve activation of signaling pathways such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) pathway, which plays a crucial role in EMT regulation. TGFB acts as a stimulator for several transcription factors, including Snail and Slug, which are known to suppress E-cadherin expression. Additionally, TGFB signaling can influence the activity of microRNAs that control cadherin expression by directly targeting their mRNA molecules.
Understanding the molecular basis of ADT-induced cadherin switching is crucial from both diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives. Monitoring changes in the expression of specific cadherins during treatment could serve as potential biomarkers for predicting therapy response or disease progression.
Furthermore, targeting the regulatory pathways involved in cadherin switching may provide novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to ADT. For instance, inhibiting signaling cascades downstream of TGFB or directly targeting key transcription factors involved in EMT could potentially reverse or prevent cadherin switching and subsequent metastasis.
In conclusion, this study provides an overview of ADT-dependent cadherin switching in advanced prostate cancer from a molecular perspective. By examining the various mechanisms underlying this phenomenon with a special focus on transcriptional factors regulated through the TGFB pathway, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of resistance mechanisms and suggest potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.
 2. Cadherin Switching and its Impact on Tumor Progression
The loss or downregulation of E-cadherin and the acquisition of N-cadherin expression through cadherin switching have profound implications for tumor progression and metastasis. E-cadherin serves as a tumor suppressor by maintaining cell-cell adhesion, inhibiting proliferation, and suppressing invasiveness.
When E-cadherin is lost or suppressed during ADT, the cohesive epithelial tissue structure is disrupted. This allows tumor cells to detach from the primary tumor mass, invade surrounding tissues, intravasate into blood vessels or lymphatics, and disseminate to distant sites. Once at secondary sites, the newly acquired N-cadherin promotes mesenchymal characteristics in these cells that allow them to adhere to endothelial cells in distant organs and initiate metastatic colonization.
In addition to promoting invasion and metastasis, cadherin switching has been associated with therapeutic resistance. It has been observed that cancer cells undergoing EMT display increased resistance to conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiation. This may be due to altered signaling pathways or changes in cellular phenotypes that render them more resistant to cell death.
3. Molecular Mechanisms of Cadherin Switching Induced by ADT
Several molecular mechanisms have been implicated in cadherin switching induced by ADT in advanced prostate cancer. The TGFB pathway plays a significant role in this process as it activates various downstream effector molecules involved in transcriptional regulation.
Upon activation of TGFB signaling, transcription factors such as Snail family proteins (Snail1/Snail2) are upregulated. These transcription factors bind directly to the promoter region of the CDH1 gene encoding E-cadherin and repress its expression through epigenetic modifications.
Another important regulatory mechanism involves microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Several miRNAs, including miR-200 family members, are involved in maintaining epithelial characteristics by directly targeting N-cadherin mRNA and downregulating its expression. ADT treatment can alter the expression of these miRNAs leading to the upregulation of N-cadherin.
Furthermore, other signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and Notch can cross-talk with TGFB signaling to further modulate cadherin switching. These pathways regulate the activity of transcription factors that indirectly control EMT-associated gene expression.
4. Therapeutic Implications and Future Directions
Understanding the molecular basis of cadherin switching induced by ADT has significant implications for prostate cancer management. The identification of biomarkers associated with this process could aid in predicting treatment response and disease progression in patients undergoing ADT.
Moreover, targeting key molecules involved in cadherin switching may provide potential therapeutic avenues for overcoming resistance to ADT. For instance, therapeutics designed to inhibit TGFB signaling or its downstream effectors could potentially reverse EMT and restore sensitivity to therapy.
Additionally, combination therapies that simultaneously target both the androgen receptor pathway (via ADT) and EMT-related pathways (such as TGFB) may be more effective in preventing or delaying the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer.
In conclusion, dissecting the effects of cadherin switching induced by ADT on advanced prostate cancer provides valuable insights into tumor progression mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies. Further research is needed to elucidate additional molecular players involved in this process and explore their clinical relevance for improving patient outcomes in advanced prostate cancer treatment.
 
Critical thinking is a fundamental skill that is crucial for individuals' development and success in the twenty-first century. It is the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information in order to make reasoned judgments and decisions. In the context of education, critical thinking is viewed as an essential skill that university students need to acquire in order to succeed academically and professionally.
The traditional lecture-based approach to teaching has long been criticized for its limited ability to foster critical thinking skills. In recent years, there has been a shift towards using blended learning approaches in higher education settings. Blended learning refers to the combination of face-to-face instruction with online learning activities.
The purpose of this systematic review study is to examine the effects of blended learning on university students' critical thinking skills and disposition. The study focuses on four subcategories of blended learning: the flex model, self-blended model, enriched virtual model, and rotation model (specifically station rotation model, lab rotation model, flipped classroom model, and individual rotation model).
To conduct this review study, valid search engines and databases were utilized to collect relevant data. The keywords used included blended learning, integrated learning, blended training, integrated training,critical thinking,critical thinking disposition,and critical thinking skills.
The results from 14 out of 15 selected sources indicate that blended learning approaches contribute positively to university students' critical thinking skills and disposition. Blended learning combines the benefits of both traditional lecturing methods with e-learning components such as online discussions or interactive modules.
Blended learning provides students with opportunities for active engagement with course content through various online activities such as simulations or case studies. This active engagement promotes deeper understanding of concepts and enhances analytical skills required for critical thinking.
Additionally,the flexibility offered by online components allows students greater control over their own pace of studying.However,it should be noted that blending doesn't simply mean replacing lectures with online materials; rather,it involves careful design,and alignment between face-to-face and online components to create a cohesive learning experience.
The flex model of blended learning allows students to tailor their learning experience based on their individual needs. This personalized approach enables them to explore topics in more depth and encourages critical thinking by providing opportunities for self-reflection.
Similarly, the self-blended model gives students the flexibility to choose when and how they engage with course materials, allowing them to take ownership of their learning. This model fosters independence, self-direction, and critical thinking skills as students are responsible for managing their own learning process.
The enriched virtual model combines face-to-face instruction with online components that provide additional resources or supplementary materials. This combination expands students' exposure to information and diverse perspectives, nurturing critical thinking through exposure to multiple viewpoints.
Lastly, the rotation model involves students rotating between different modes of instruction such as small-group activities or direct instruction. The integration of technology-based activities into classroom rotations provides an opportunity for collaborative problem-solving and discussion, encouraging critical thinking among students.
In conclusion,the findings from this systematic review highlight that blended learning approaches have a positive impact on university student's critical thinking skills and disposition.Blended learning provides opportunities for active engagement,self-pacing,and personalized or individualized approaches which enhance analytical skills required for critical thinking.Future research should focus on further exploring specific instructional strategies within these blended models in order maximize the benefits of blended learning on critical thinking acquisition.I recommend educators consider implementing blended approaches in higher education contexts as it promotes effective teaching-learning methods while enhancing critical thinking abilities among university students. 
Viral Hepatitis is a major public health problem worldwide, with an estimated 257 million people living with chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and 71 million people living with chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection globally. The burden of viral hepatitis is particularly high in low- and middle-income countries, including India.
India, being the second-most populous country in the world, faces significant challenges in terms of healthcare infrastructure and accessibility. Additionally, socio-economic disparities contribute to the unequal distribution of healthcare services across different regions of the country. These factors make it important to understand the prevalence of viral hepatitis infection in India.
The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the prevalence of viral Hepatitis A (HAV), HBV, and HCV infections in India. We aimed to provide an overview of the disease burden throughout different regions within the country.
Using various databases such as Science Direct, Scopus, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and open access journals as sources for our search strategy, we identified relevant peer-reviewed articles published between February 2000 and February 2021 that reported on viral hepatitis prevalence in India. After evaluating these studies based on predefined inclusion criteria, we included a total of 28 studies for analysis.
The selected studies encompassed different geographical regions within India including northern, southern,
central,
eastern,
and western regions.
They involved a combined total of
45 ,608 research participants. The prevalence rates varied across the studies for each type of viral hepatitis.
For Hepatitis A, the prevalence ranged from 2.1% to 52.5%, indicating a significant variation in the risk of exposure to HAV among different populations and regions within India. This reflects disparities in sanitation facilities, hygiene practices, and access to clean drinking water.
The prevalence of Hepatitis B infection ranged from 0.87% to 21.4% among the studied populations. This wide range suggests variations in risk factors such as vaccination coverage, healthcare practices (including blood transfusion safety), and intravenous drug use within different communities.
Hepatitis C infection had a wide prevalence range of 0.57% to 53.7%. The high upper limit highlights areas or population groups with higher exposure to HCV transmission modes such as unsafe injection practices or blood transfusions prior to proper screening procedures being implemented.
Significant findings from these studies included a higher burden of hepatitis A among children, indicating possible gaps in immunization programs targeting this age group. Additionally, approximately half (47.4%) of third-trimester pregnant mothers were affected by Hepatitis E infection, highlighting the importance of interventions aimed at preventing vertical transmission during pregnancy.
Common modes of acquiring HBV and HCV infections identified in these studies included diabetes, hospital admissions (especially surgical procedures), history of jaundice (indicating previous liver disease), history of surgeries or blood transfusions without proper screening measures implemented at that time period, and heterosexual contact.
The high burden observed across all types of viral hepatitis infections signifies its substantial impact on India's healthcare system and warrants effective public health interventions for prevention and control measures urgently.
Efforts should be focused on improving vaccination coverage against Hepatitis A and B viruses to reduce the incidence among vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women.
Public awareness campaigns should emphasize safe injection practices,
blood transfusion safety,
and promotion of universal precautions in healthcare settings to minimize the risk of viral hepatitis transmission.
Additionally, targeted interventions need to address the specific risk factors identified, such as diabetes management and promoting safer sexual practices. Strengthening surveillance systems for timely detection and reporting of new cases is crucial to monitor the disease burden accurately and guide evidence-based interventions.
In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provide insights into the prevalence of viral hepatitis infections in India. The findings emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive public health measures to reduce the burden of viral hepatitis, including vaccination programs, improvement in healthcare practices, and awareness campaigns focusing on risk factor education. Effective implementation of these strategies will contribute significantly towards eliminating viral hepatitis as a major public health threat in India. 
Transactional sex, defined as the exchange of material incentives for sexual favors, is a prevalent practice among women in Sub-Saharan Africa. This practice has been associated with various negative consequences, including an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion, and psychological trauma. Understanding the prevalence and factors associated with transactional sex is essential for developing effective interventions to address this issue.
Numerous primary studies have been conducted in different countries across sub-Saharan Africa to investigate the prevalence and determinants of transactional sex among women. However, these studies have shown significant discrepancies and inconsistent findings. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the available evidence on the pooled prevalence of transactional sex among women and its associated factors in sub-Saharan Africa.
A comprehensive search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, HINARI, the Cochrane Library, and grey literature sources from March 6 to April 24, 2022. The search encompassed studies published between 2000 and 2022. The pooled prevalence of transactional sex was estimated using a Random Effect Model. Data analysis was performed using Stata software (version 16.0). To assess heterogeneity among studies,the I-squared statistic was used,and publication bias was evaluated through funnel plot analysisand Egger's test.Furthermore,a subgroup analysis was conducted based on study years,data source,sample sizes,and geographical location.
The results revealed that the overall pooled prevalence of transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africa was found to be12.55% (95% CI:9.59%-15.52%).These findings highlight that a considerable proportionof women engage in transactional sexual relationshipsin this region.
Several factors were identified as significantly associated with engaging in transactional sexamongwomen.These include early sexual debut(also known as having first intercourse at an early age), substance abuse(primarily alcohol consumption), a history of sexual experiences,physical violence abuse, orphanhood (being an orphan), and sexual violence abuse. These factors exhibited strong associations with the practice of transactional sex. Therefore, addressing these factors is crucial in efforts to reduce the prevalence of transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The high prevalence of transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africa underscores the urgent need for effective interventions targeting this issue. These interventions should not only focus on raising awareness about the associated risks but also address the underlying social and economic factors contributing to this practice.Thissystematicreviewprovides valuable insights intothe prevalenceand associated factorsoftransactionalsexecutealth,serving as a foundation for informing evidence-based intervention programs aimed at reducing its incidence.

Interventions should take a holistic approach, addressing both individual-level factors and structural barriers that contribute to transactional sex. This may include strategies such as comprehensive sexual education programs that promote healthy relationships, gender equality, and negotiation skills.
Additionally, efforts should be made to address the economic disparities and limited educational opportunities that often contribute to transactional sex. Programs aimed at empowering women economically through vocational training, entrepreneurship support, and access to financial resources can help reduce their dependence on transactional relationships.
Furthermore, there is a need for targeted interventions focused on substance abuse prevention and treatment. Substance abuse has been consistently identified as a significant risk factor for engaging in transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africa. Providing accessible and affordable substance abuse treatment services can help individuals address underlying issues contributing to their involvement in transactional relationships.
Addressing violence against women is also crucial in reducing the prevalence of transactional sex. Efforts should be made to strengthen laws and policies protecting women from physical or sexual violence within both intimate partnerships and broader societal contexts. This includes improving access to support services such as shelters, counseling centers, legal aid clinics for survivors of violence.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors have gained significant attention in the field of optical sensing due to their high sensitivity to small changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium. These sensors are based on the excitation of collective oscillations of electrons, known as surface plasmons, on a metal-dielectric interface. When these surface plasmons interact with incident light, they produce a sharp absorption peak in the reflected or transmitted spectrum, which is highly sensitive to any changes occurring at the interface.
However, one of the major challenges in SPR sensing is obtaining narrow linewidths for resonance spectra. This is because metals inherently possess high optical losses that broaden the spectral response. The broad linewidths limit the resolution and accuracy of these sensors and limits their potential applications.
In recent years, extensive efforts have been made to overcome this limitation and achieve narrow linewidths for SPR sensors. This review focuses on various approaches that have been developed for fabricating nanostructured surfaces that support narrow linewidths in plasmon resonance spectra.
Firstly, by introducing surface lattice resonances or plasmonic Fano resonances into nanostructures, it is possible to obtain narrower linewidths compared to conventional structures. Surface lattice resonances arise from periodic metallic nanopatterns and can be fine-tuned through structural parameters such as lattice constant and shape. Plasmonic Fano resonances result from interference between localized plasmon modes and continuum plasmon modes, leading to asymmetric line shapes with enhanced sensitivity.
Secondly, by coupling metallic nanostructures with photonic cavities such as microdisks or micro-ring resonators can further enhance sensitivity while narrowing resonance linewidths. The confined photonic modes coupled with surface plasmons create hybrid states that exhibit narrower spectral response due to coherent interactions between light and matter.
Additionally, ultra-narrow resonators can be fabricated using techniques like electron beam lithography or focused ion beam milling combined with controlled etching. These structures have extremely small feature sizes, enabling highly localized plasmon resonances with significantly narrower linewidths.
Moreover, strategies such as platform-induced modification and alternating different dielectric layers can further improve the performance of SPR sensors by reducing optical losses and enhancing the quality factor of plasmonic resonances. Another approach is coupling surface plasmons with whispering-gallery-modes (WGMs) in microcavities, which can lead to resonance linewidth reduction through mode coupling effects.
The development of these nanostructured SPR sensors opens up new possibilities for various applications. They have been widely used in biosensing, environmental monitoring, and chemical sensing due to their high sensitivity and label-free detection capabilities. For example, SPR sensors can be employed for real-time monitoring of biomolecular interactions or detection of trace amounts of chemicals in water samples.
However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed in the field of nanostructured SPR sensors. The fabrication processes involved in creating these structures are complex and time-consuming, requiring precise control at the nanoscale level. Additionally, optimizing the design parameters for specific applications is crucial but challenging due to trade-offs between sensitivity and linewidth narrowing.
In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches to achieve narrow linewidths in nanostructured SPR sensors. These advancements pave the way for improved sensing capabilities in terms of resolution and accuracy. Addressing the existing challenges will contribute to further development and utilization of these sensors for a wide range of applications in optical sensing fields.

Chronic primary orofacial pain (OFP) conditions, including painful temporomandibular disorders (pTMDs), idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and burning mouth syndrome (BMS), present significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. These conditions are often difficult to diagnose, and their etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. Consequently, the development of effective treatments has been limited.
Preclinical studies in animal models have played a vital role in advancing our understanding of OFP. Animal models allow researchers to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these conditions, identify potential therapeutic targets, and test novel interventions. However, despite decades of research in this field, there is still a significant gap between preclinical findings and clinical translation.
One major hurdle in bridging this gap is the lack of robust preclinical assays that accurately recapitulate the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical symptoms observed in patients with chronic OFP. The limitations of current animal models make it challenging to develop interventions that effectively alleviate pain in patients.
In this review, we aim to highlight existing rodent assays that can be utilized in chronic primary OFP research for pTMDs, TN, and BMS. We will discuss their strengths and weaknesses based on current knowledge regarding the complex etiology and pathophysiology of these conditions. By identifying areas for improvement and suggesting possible future directions, we hope to facilitate the development of more innovative animal models capable of providing meaningful insights into chronic primary OFP.
2. Rodent Assays for Chronic Primary Orofacial Pain Research
Several rodent assays have been developed to study different aspects of orofacial pain associated with pTMDs,TN,and BMS.Previous studies have primarily focused on pain-related behaviors such as mechanical allodynia,hypersensitivity,sensitization,and spontaneous nociceptive behavior.Many researchers use von Frey filament testing as a measure of mechanical allodynia in rodents.This assay involves applying calibrated filaments to the orofacial region to determine the threshold at which nociceptive responses occur.Another commonly employed method is the formalin test,which measures nociceptive responses following subcutaneous injection of formalin into the orofacial region.
Furthermore,the orofacial operant conditioning paradigm has gained popularity as a way to assess pain-related behaviors in rodents.This assay involves training animals to associate specific operant behaviors with pain alleviation(rewarded)or exacerbation(punished).
Despite their widespread use,these assays have limitations that warrant consideration.While they allow for the assessment of specific pain-related behaviors,they may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of clinical symptoms experienced by chronic OFP patients.For example,the role of central sensitization in these conditions is often underrepresented in existing rodent assays.Central sensitization refers to an amplification of pain signaling within the central nervous system,resulting in increased sensitivity and persistent pain.A comprehensive preclinical model should aim to incorporate this aspect more effectively.
3. Assessing Chronic Primary Orofacial Pain Measures
Finding appropriate chronic primary OFP measures that align with patients' clinical symptoms is crucial for translating preclinical findings into effective therapies.Currently,a quantitative sensory testing(QST)battery has been suggested as a comprehensive approach.QST encompasses various psychophysical tests that evaluate different aspects of sensory function,such as thermal detection thresholds,cold and heat pain thresholds,and pressure-pain thresholds.However,numerous factors such as subjective interpretation,variability among individuals,and lack of standardized protocols can hinder accurate assessment.
Additionally,current QST methods may not adequately account for disease-specific manifestations seen in pTMDs,TN,and BMS.For example,in pTMDs,characterized by jaw muscle dysfunction,the assessment should consider masticatory function,muscle tone,and range.As for TN,a condition characterized by paroxysmal facial pain,episodic pain assessment with high temporal resolution is necessary.Finally,BMS,which presents as a chronic burning sensation in the oral cavity,requires measures that evaluate subjective symptoms such as pain intensity,location,and quality.
4. Future Directions and Conclusion
In order to advance our understanding of chronic primary OFP and improve patient care,it is essential to develop more accurate preclinical assays and reliable pain measures that better reflect the clinical symptoms experienced by patients. Incorporating disease-specific characteristics,endpoints,and treatment responses into experimental models will enhance their translational potential.
Future research should focus on developing innovative animal models that capture the complexity of these conditions.Combining different assays and incorporating psychophysical tests reflective of clinical symptoms could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.A greater emphasis on implementing centralized sensitization mechanisms can help bridge the gap between animal models and human conditions.
Additionally,collaboration between researchers,clinicians,and patients is crucial in identifying important factors to be included in preclinical assays and measures.Improved cross-disciplinary communication will contribute to the development of more relevant animal models that facilitate effective intervention strategies for patients suffering from chronic primary OFP.
In conclusion,the field of chronic primary orofacial pain research has made significant strides,but there is still much work to be done.By addressing current limitations,developing innovative preclinical assays,and refining pain measures,we can overcome existing challenges and provide better care for those living with these debilitating conditions. 
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a group of genetic disorders that affect the functioning of the retina, leading to vision loss and potential blindness. Gene replacement therapy has emerged as a successful treatment option for certain IRDs, but it has limitations in terms of packaging capacity and expression levels. This creates a need for alternative therapeutic approaches to target genes that exceed these limitations or are expressed in multiple retinal isoforms.
RNA editing holds great promise as a therapeutic strategy for correcting pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human transcriptome. Unlike gene replacement therapy, RNA editing does not risk creating permanent off-target edits in the genome and offers innovative delivery options. Adenine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes play a crucial role in posttranscriptional RNA editing by catalyzing the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).
Early studies utilized exogenous delivery of catalytically active ADAR deaminase domain (ADARDD) fused to an RNA binding protein for efficient target editing rates. However, this approach had its limitations due to potential immune responses against foreign proteins, transcriptome-wide off-target effects, and limited packaging space.
Recent advancements have focused on harnessing endogenous ADAR enzymes for programmable RNA editing. Researchers have developed circular ADAR-recruiting guide RNAs and optimized ADAR-recruiting antisense oligonucleotides to increase editing efficiency without relying on exogenous protein delivery.
In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated promising results with endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing. Comparable target editing efficiency was achieved both in wild-type and disease mouse models as well as non-human primates up to six weeks after application.
The potential applications of endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing are especially relevant for IRD treatment where gene replacement therapy has shown success but still faces challenges related to packaging capacity and expression levels. This approach offers the advantage of freeing up packaging space, reducing the likelihood of an immune response, and minimizing off-target effects.
Moreover, RNA editing allows for precise correction of pathogenic SNVs without permanently altering the genome. This feature is particularly important in the context of inherited diseases where lifelong correction may not be necessary or desirable.
However, there are still challenges and considerations that need to be addressed before endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing can be applied as a clinical treatment for IRDs. These include optimizing delivery methods to target specific retinal cell types effectively, ensuring long-term stability and safety of edited transcripts, and addressing potential concerns regarding off-target editing at unintended sites in the transcriptome.
In conclusion, recent advancements in endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing offer a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in IRDs. The ability to achieve comparable editing efficiency without relying on exogenous protein delivery opens up new possibilities for targeting genes with limitations related to packaging capacity or expression levels. Further research and development are needed to optimize this approach for clinical application and ensure its safety and effectiveness in treating inherited retinal diseases. 2. Advantages of RNA editing with endogenous ADAR in treating inherited retinal diseases:
RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes offers several advantages that make it a feasible option for the treatment of inherited retinal diseases. 
Firstly, the use of endogenous ADAR enzymes eliminates the need for exogenous protein delivery, which can pose challenges such as immune responses and off-target effects. By utilizing the natural machinery present in cells, RNA editing with endogenous ADAR bypasses these limitations and ensures a more targeted and specific approach to gene correction.
Secondly, this approach allows for precise correction of pathogenic SNVs without permanently altering the genome. While gene replacement therapy involves introducing a new copy of the gene into a cell, RNA editing directly modifies the existing transcript by converting adenosine to inosine. This targeted approach minimizes potential risks associated with permanent genome alterations and allows for reversible corrections if needed.
Furthermore, endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing has shown promising target editing efficiency both in vitro and in vivo studies using animal models. The ability to edit transcripts at levels comparable to exogenously delivered ADARDD opens up possibilities for effectively correcting disease-causing mutations without relying on foreign proteins.
Another advantage is that it frees up packaging space within viral vectors such as adeno-associated viruses (AAV), which are commonly used for gene therapy delivery. AAVs have a limited capacity regarding how much genetic material they can carry. Since some genes implicated in IRDs exceed this packaging capacity or are expressed in multiple retinal isoforms, utilizing RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes provides an alternative strategy for targeting these challenging genes.
Moreover, due to its posttranscriptional nature, RNA editing can be specific to certain cell types or tissues within the retina by selecting guide RNAs or antisense oligonucleotides that target those specific regions. This cell-specific targeting enables more precision when correcting pathogenic SNVs and reduces the potential for off-target effects in other cell types.
3. Challenges and considerations:
While RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes holds great potential for the treatment of inherited retinal diseases, there are several challenges and considerations that need to be addressed before it can be applied clinically.
One challenge is optimizing delivery methods to efficiently target specific retinal cell types. The retina is a complex structure composed of different cell types, each with distinct characteristics and functions. Ensuring that RNA editing tools effectively reach the desired retinal cells while minimizing exposure to off-target cells will be crucial for successful therapeutic outcomes.
The long-term stability and safety of edited transcripts is another consideration. It will be important to evaluate the durability of RNA edits over time, ensuring that they remain stable and functional without causing deleterious effects on normal cellular processes or inducing unintended side effects.
Off-target editing at unintended sites in the transcriptome is also a concern. Although efforts have been made to maximize specificity by designing guide RNAs or antisense oligonucleotides with high affinity towards target sequences, there is still a possibility of unintentional edits elsewhere in the genome. Rigorous assessment and mitigation strategies should be implemented to minimize off-target effects.
Another consideration is scalability. To bring this approach into clinical practice, large-scale production methods will need to be developed, ensuring consistent quality control measures while still maintaining cost-effectiveness.
Additionally, regulatory approval processes will play a critical role in determining the feasibility of utilizing endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing as a treatment option for inherited retinal diseases. Guidelines must be established regarding safety assessments, efficacy criteria, manufacturing standards, and patient selection criteria before this approach can become widely accessible.
4. Future directions:
Despite these challenges, significant progress has been made in utilizing endogenous ADAR enzymes for programmable RNA editing in IRD research. Continued advancements in technology are expected to overcome current limitations and drive this field forward toward clinical application.
Future research should focus on further improving the editing efficiency and specificity of endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing techniques. This can be achieved by optimizing guide RNAs or antisense oligonucleotides, developing better delivery systems, and enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ADAR recruitment and activity at specific target sites.
Additionally, the long-term durability and safety of RNA edits need to be thoroughly investigated through preclinical studies and long-term follow-ups in animal models. Understanding the stability of edited transcripts over extended periods will be crucial for assessing their potential as a long-lasting treatment option for IRDs.
Furthermore, collaboration between academia, industry, regulatory bodies, and patient advocacy groups will be essential to advance this field toward clinical translation. Establishing robust partnerships can help navigate challenges related to manufacturing processes, regulatory pathways, ethical considerations, and patient access.
In conclusion, RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes shows great promise as a feasible option for treating inherited retinal diseases. It offers advantages such as targeted correction of pathogenic SNVs without permanent genome alterations, freedom from exogenous protein delivery limitations,and scalability potential. However suitable delivery methods for specific retinal cell targeting efficacy optimization,and addressing challenges related to off-target effects are important considerations going forward.It is expected that with further refinements in technology development,safety assessments,effectiveness evaluations,and regulatory approvals,RNA editing could become a transformative therapeutic strategy for inherited retinal diseases.
 
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly prevalent and aggressive form of cancer that affects the digestive tract. It poses a significant burden on healthcare systems, particularly in areas with high incidence rates. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates. Endoscopic screening is currently the most effective method for early detection of ESCC.
However, the accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis largely depends on the expertise of the endoscopist. Due to variations in professional skills among practitioners, there are still many cases where lesions go unrecognized, resulting in missed diagnoses. This highlights the need for auxiliary methods that can enhance endoscopic diagnosis capabilities.
Recent advancements in medical imaging and video evaluation technology based on deep machine learning have provided an opportunity for significant progress in this area. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, specifically convolution neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in extracting key features from input image data and accurately classifying images.
CNNs have been widely used in medical image classification tasks and have demonstrated improved accuracy compared to traditional methods. In the context of ESCC diagnosis, AI-assisted systems can leverage their excellent image recognition abilities to aid endoscopists in detecting lesions more accurately and reduce missed diagnoses during endoscopic examinations.
These AI systems are trained on large datasets consisting of images from various imaging modalities such as white light endoscopy, narrow-band imaging, autofluorescence imaging, or confocal laser endomicroscopy. By learning patterns from these datasets through supervised training processes, AI algorithms can identify abnormal tissue characteristics associated with early ESCC more reliably than human observers alone.
Additionally, AI models can predict invasion depth based on these detected abnormalities with remarkable accuracy. This information helps guide appropriate treatment decisions by determining whether surgical resection or less invasive therapies like mucosal resection or photodynamic therapy is necessary.
Despite its potential benefits, there are some limitations to be addressed before widespread implementation of AI-assisted diagnosis in clinical practice. One concern is the selective bias present in the training datasets used to develop AI systems. These datasets often consist of cases already diagnosed by experts, potentially leading to overfitting and poor generalizability to real-world scenarios.
To overcome this limitation, efforts are being made to create more diverse and representative datasets that encompass a wider range of disease presentations. Furthermore, ongoing research is focusing on developing personalized AI models that can adapt to individual patient characteristics and account for inter-patient variations.
In conclusion, AI-assisted diagnosis has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing endoscopic detection and diagnosis of early ESCC. The powerful image recognition abilities of CNN-based AI algorithms enable more accurate identification of abnormal tissue characteristics associated with early-stage ESCC and prediction of invasion depth. As further advancements are made in this field, addressing the limitations regarding dataset bias will be critical in ensuring the broad applicability and effectiveness of these AI systems in clinical settings. By improving diagnostic accuracy, these technologies have the potential to significantly reduce missed diagnoses and improve patient outcomes in areas with high incidence rates.
 
The field of nursing education is constantly evolving, with new technologies being introduced to enhance the learning experience for students. In recent years, digital technology has played a significant role in transforming nursing education, particularly in the move towards online and distance learning. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this shift as traditional face-to-face teaching became limited or even impossible in many educational institutions.
One innovative digital technology that has gained popularity in nursing education is podcasts. Podcasts are audio recordings that can be downloaded or streamed online, allowing users to listen to them at their convenience. They offer a flexible and cost-effective way for students to access educational content without being restricted by time or location.
In Western countries, podcasts have already been integrated into the curriculum design of nursing programs. Many universities and online platforms offer podcast series specifically designed for nursing students, covering a wide range of topics such as anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, patient assessment skills, and evidence-based practice. These podcasts provide an engaging alternative to traditional lectures and textbooks by presenting information in a more conversational and interactive format.
Studies have shown that integrating podcasts into nursing education can have several benefits. Firstly, they facilitate self-directed learning as students can listen to the material at their own pace and review it multiple times if needed. This allows for personalized learning experiences tailored to each student's needs. Secondly, podcasts promote active listening skills as students are required to actively engage with the content rather than passively absorbing information from lectures or reading materials.
Moreover, incorporating podcasting into nursing education encourages critical thinking skills by challenging students' understanding of complex concepts through case scenarios or discussions presented in the podcasts. Additionally., it enhances accessibility for all learners since they eliminate barriers related to visual impairments or language differences through audio-based instructions.

In conclusion, podcasts have emerged as an innovative digital technology with great potential to enhance nursing education. While Western countries have embraced the use of podcasts in curriculum design, Eastern countries are still in the early stages of exploring their application. Nonetheless, given the numerous benefits that podcasts offer, such as accessibility and active learning strategies they utilise it is crucial for Eastern countries to explore its potential use in nursing education.. In addition to being a supplement to traditional teaching methodologies،they could proof extermly helpful accessing health information wheter udergratement or continous proffsianl development activities when access may be limited due geographic location or pandemics like current one.It seems likely that podcasting will continue to play a prominent role in nursing education globally as technology continues to advance and society evolves digitally. It is essential for nursing educators and institutions from both Eastern and Western countries alike to embrace this innovative tool for delivering high-quality education and empowering future nurses with knowledge at their fingertips 
Obesity is a significant public health issue worldwide, with its prevalence increasing rapidly in recent years. It is a complex chronic disease that arises from a combination of genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Lifestyle factors such as sedentary behavior and unhealthy eating habits play a significant role in the development and progression of obesity.
The treatment of obesity requires a multidisciplinary approach, with nutrition therapy being an essential component. The main goal of nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity is to promote sustained weight loss while addressing the individual's overall health. This involves making long-term lifestyle changes that focus on healthy eating patterns, regular physical activity, psychological interventions, and potentially pharmacological or surgical interventions.
A key aspect of nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity is identifying the underlying dietary causes associated with excess weight. High consumption of ultraprocessed foods, which are typically high in fats, sugars, and energy density; large portion sizes; and low intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains have all been linked to weight gain.
Unfortunately, there are numerous misleading fad diets circulating that promise quick solutions to weight loss but lack scientific support. Some individuals may be drawn to these diets due to their belief in superfoods or the use of teas or herbal supplements claiming miraculous weight loss effects. Additionally alarming trends include avoiding entire food groups such as carbohydrates.
In contrast to these fad diets unsupported by scientific evidence or literature., international guidelines recommend adopting dietary patterns that include whole grains, lean proteins (such as meats), low-fat dairy products (including milk), fruits, vegetables while maintaining an energy deficit for sustainable weight loss outcomes.
Importantly behavior change strategies need equal emphasis alongside dietary interventions including motivational interviewing techniques aimed at encouraging individuals' self-efficacy regarding their ability to make positive changes through addressing intrinsic motivation(s) leading towards achieving desired goals– targeting optimal body mass index levels compatible with good health.
In developing this position statement on nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity, the Nutrition Department of the Brazilian Association for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (ABESO) drew upon rigorous analysis of randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses in relation to different nutritional interventions for weight loss. The position statement also acknowledges emerging areas of research such as gut microbiota, inflammation, and nutritional genomics in relation to obesity management. Additionally, attention is given to weight regain processes and strategies aimed at mitigating or preventing it.
It is important to note that this position statement was prepared with the collaboration of dietitians from both research and clinical fields with expertise specifically focused on strategies for weight loss. By leveraging evidence-based practices rooted in scientific literature, this position statement provides a robust framework for healthcare professionals involved in the management and treatment of overweight and obesity.
In conclusion, nutrition therapy plays a pivotal role in the comprehensive treatment approach towards overweight and obesity. Addressing dietary factors that contribute to excess weight through promoting healthy eating patterns along with behavior change interventions will support individuals not only in achieving their desired weight goals but also improving their overall health outcomes. This position statement by ABESO serves as a valuable resource for healthcare practitioners seeking evidence-based guidance on nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity management. 
Kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and signal transduction. Aberrant kinase activity has been implicated in the development and progression of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory conditions. As such, targeting kinases has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for these diseases.
The discovery and development of kinase inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment. Several kinase inhibitors have been approved by regulatory bodies for the treatment of different types of cancer. These drugs work by specifically inhibiting the activity of kinases involved in promoting tumor growth and survival. By blocking these kinases, tumor cells are prevented from proliferating and spreading.
However, the potential utility of kinase inhibitors extends beyond cancer treatment. Recent research has focused on exploring their effectiveness in treating non-malignant disorders such as auto-immune diseases. Kinase-mediated signaling pathways play a critical role in immune system regulation and inflammation control. Dysregulation or overactivation of certain kinases can lead to chronic inflammation and auto-immunity.
To harness the therapeutic potential of kinase inhibitors for non-malignant disorders, it is crucial to investigate whether targeted delivery to specific cell types enhances efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. Cell-specific delivery systems can be designed to selectively deliver the inhibitor to sites where aberrant kinase activity is prevalent or problematic.
One approach is through nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems that encapsulate the inhibitor molecules within biocompatible carriers capable of selectively targeting specific cell types or tissues affected by disease pathology. These nanoparticles can be surface-functionalized with ligands that recognize unique markers expressed on diseased cells or tissues but not healthy ones.
Another approach involves utilizing gene therapy techniques to introduce genes encoding synthetic receptors into target cells or tissues that enable selective uptake of an otherwise systemically administered inhibitor molecule by specifically recognizing it through these receptors expressed only on diseased cells.
In addition to developing novel drug delivery strategies for improved specificity, efforts have focused on better understanding the mode of action of kinase inhibitors. Kinase inhibitors can either act by directly binding to and blocking the catalytic site of the kinase or by allosteric inhibition, where they bind outside the catalytic site to induce conformational changes that prevent kinase activity.
Understanding these mechanisms is pivotal for designing more potent and selective inhibitors. Advances in structural biology techniques such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have provided valuable insights into the structural features of kinases, enabling rational drug design approaches.
Furthermore, computational modeling techniques combined with high-throughput screening methods offer efficient means to identify novel kinase targets and predict their druggability. This integrated approach allows for rapid screening of large compound libraries against a panel of kinases while providing valuable information about inhibitor selectivity profiles and potential off-target effects.
In conclusion, kinase inhibitors hold immense promise as therapeutic targets for a wide range of diseases beyond cancer. Understanding their mode of action, developing targeted delivery systems, and employing advanced drug discovery approaches are essential steps towards harnessing their full therapeutic potential. Continued research efforts in this field will undoubtedly lead to innovative treatment options for various anti-inflammatory, auto-immune, and anticancer disorders. 
Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), caused by insufficient oxygen and blood flow to the brain during birth, is a leading cause of neonatal encephalopathy (NE). NE is a condition characterized by significant mortality and morbidity in newborns, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where resources for treatment are limited. Currently, therapeutic hypothermia (HT) is the only approved treatment for NE in high-income countries (HIC); however, its effectiveness and safety in LMIC are questionable.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify alternative therapies that can effectively reduce brain injury in newborns following HI. To address this gap, we conducted a multi-drug randomized controlled preclinical screening trial using an established P7 rat Vannucci model of HI brain injury. This model closely mimics the pathophysiology observed in human neonates with NE.
In our study, we investigated 25 potential neuroprotective drug candidates to assess their treatment effects on reducing brain area loss after HI-induced injury. The rats were randomly assigned to different drug treatment groups or control groups. After 7 days of survival, we analyzed the brains to measure unilateral hemispheric brain area loss as an indicator of brain injury severity.
Our findings revealed that eight out of the 25 therapeutic agents significantly reduced brain area loss compared to the control group. Among these agents, Caffeine showed the strongest treatment effect followed by Sonic Hedgehog Agonist (SAG) and Allopurinol. Additionally, Melatonin, Clemastine ß-Hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide also demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing brain injury.
Notably, several of these neuroprotective agents displayed a higher probability of efficacy compared to HT itself when evaluated using our experimental setup. Specifically,Caffeine,SAG Allopurinol Melatonin Clemastine ß-hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide all showed a stronger treatment effect than HT. These findings suggest that these alternative therapies may hold promise as potential treatment options for NE in LMIC where HT's efficacy is limited.
Our study contributes to the field by providing the results of the first systematic preclinical screening trial of potential neuroprotective treatments for neonatal HI brain injury. By using a standardized experimental setting and assessing multiple drug candidates, we increase our understanding of the efficacy and potential benefits of different therapeutic options.
However, it is important to note that further research is necessary to validate these findings in clinical settings. The ultimate goal is to translate these promising novel agents into safe and effective treatments for NE in LMIC. As NE remains a significant health burden globally, especially in resource-limited settings, identifying alternative therapies could greatly improve outcomes for affected newborns.
In conclusion, our multi-drug randomized controlled screening trial provides valuable insights into potential neuroprotective agents for reducing brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. The identified therapeutic candidates such as Caffeine, Sonic Hedgehog Agonist (SAG), Allopurinol, Melatonin,Clemastine ß-hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide show promise as alternatives or complements to existing treatments like therapeutic hypothermia specifically for low- and middle-income countries. Further research including clinical trials will be imperative to further evaluate their safety and effectiveness in humans.
 2. Methodology
In our study, we utilized the P7 rat Vannucci model of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, which has been widely used as a preclinical model for studying neonatal encephalopathy. This model involves exposing P7 rat pups to unilateral hypoxia-ischemia, mimicking the pathophysiology observed in human newborns.
The P7 rat pups were randomly assigned to different treatment groups or control groups. In total, we investigated 25 potential neuroprotective drug candidates. Each drug candidate was administered according to a standardized protocol, ensuring consistency across experiments.
After a period of 7 days survival post hypoxic-ischemic insult, we analyzed the brains of the rats to assess brain area loss as an indicator of injury severity. The brains were carefully dissected and processed for histological analysis using staining techniques specific for evaluating neuronal damage.
We performed this experimental setup twenty times to ensure statistical validity and reliability of our findings. This approach allowed us to obtain robust data on the efficacy of each neuroprotective agent in reducing brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.
3. Results and Discussion
Our findings demonstrated that eight out of the 25 therapeutic agents significantly reduced brain area loss compared to the control group after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia injury in rats.
Caffeine exhibited the strongest treatment effect among all tested agents - its administration resulted in a significant reduction in brain area loss compared to controls.
The Sonic Hedgehog Agonist (SAG) and Allopurinol also demonstrated substantial efficacy in reducing brain injury following HI.
Additionally,Melatonin,Clemastine ß-hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide showed promising results by significantly reducing brain area loss as well.
Importantly, when comparing these therapeutic agents with therapeutic hypothermia (HT), several showed superior treatment effects. Caffeine,SAG Allopurinol Melatonin Clemastine ß-hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide all exhibited a higher probability of efficacy in reducing brain area loss compared to HT.
These results suggest that these novel agents may offer additional or alternative therapeutic options for the treatment of neonatal encephalopathy, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where HT's effectiveness is limited.
Further investigation is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of these agents and to determine their safety profiles. By understanding how these agents exert their protective effects on the developing brain, we can optimize their therapeutic dosing and explore potential combination therapies.
Moreover, clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these neuroprotective agents in humans. It will be crucial to conduct studies specifically designed for LMIC settings, addressing any potential challenges related to drug availability, administration protocols, and monitoring.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, our multi-drug randomized controlled screening trial identified several promising neuroprotective agent candidates for reducing brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.
Caffeine,SAG Allopurinol Melatonin Clemastine ß-hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing brain area loss compared to controls.
Importantly, some of these agents showed a higher probability of efficacy compared to therapeutic hypothermia (HT) itself when evaluated using our experimental setup.
These findings highlight the potential for alternative or complementary therapies for treating neonatal encephalopathy in low- and middle-income countries where resources for therapeutic hypothermia are limited.
However,this research lays the groundwork for future studies aimed at better understanding how these agent work,the optimal dosing strategies,and clinical trials evaluating their safety and effectiveness.The ultimate aim is to translate these promising findings into improved outcomes for affected newborns globally 
Gelatin is a widely used ingredient in various food products, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics due to its unique properties such as gelling, stabilizing, and emulsifying capabilities. It is obtained from the partial hydrolysis of collagen-rich connective tissues of animals, mainly bovine (cattle) and porcine (pigs). However, gelatin products derived from specific animal sources have faced significant scrutiny due to religious beliefs and dietary restrictions associated with certain sectors of the population.
In addition to religious concerns, potential health risks associated with gelatins sourced from specific animals have also prompted the need for accurate authentication methods. For instance, bovine-derived gelatins can pose risks such as transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease. Porcine-derived gelatins may also be problematic for individuals who follow strict halal or kosher dietary guidelines.
To address these concerns and meet consumer demands for transparency in food labeling, manufacturers require reliable methods for discerning and authenticating the origin of animal-based gelatins. Traditional identification techniques based on morphological characteristics or analytical testing are often inadequate or impractical in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, speed, cost-effectiveness.
As a result, there is a growing interest in developing biomarkers specifically targeted towards differentiating between gelatin derived from different animal species. These biomarkers can be classified into two major categories: proteomic biomarkers that involve protein analysis techniques and genomic biomarkers that involve DNA analysis techniques.
Proteomic approaches primarily rely on the identification and characterization of specific proteins or peptides present in gelatin samples. Various chromatography techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), capillary electrophoresis (CE-MS), or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) have been used to detect and quantify these proteins or peptides. Furthermore, lateral flow devices and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been developed as rapid and convenient tools for gelatin authentication.
On the other hand, genomic biomarkers involve the detection of specific nucleic acid substances derived from animal genomes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques are commonly employed for detecting DNA markers within gelatin samples. These DNA markers can be either species-specific, such as mitochondrial DNA sequences or nuclear gene sequences unique to a particular animal species.
While both proteomic and genomic biomarkers show promise for gelatin authentication, there are several challenges that must be addressed before their widespread implementation in the food industry. One major obstacle is the cost associated with acquiring equipment and reagents necessary for performing these analyses. Additionally, standardization of methods across laboratories is crucial to ensure reliable and consistent results.
Future research efforts should focus on combining multiple biomarkers and developing multiplex assays that target different protein or DNA markers simultaneously. This approach could significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of gelatin origin authentication.
In conclusion, advancements in proteomic and genomic techniques have offered promising solutions for authenticating the source of gelatins used in food products. The identification of specific proteins or peptides through proteomic methods combined with species-specific DNA markers detected via genomic methods can provide reliable differentiation between bovine, porcine, chicken-derived or fish-derived gelatins. However, further research is needed to address cost-related issues and establish standardized protocols that can be readily implemented by manufacturers seeking accurate authentication processes for their products' gelatin content. 
Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, has emerged as a revolutionary technology that allows the fabrication of complex structures with precise control over their shapes and compositions. Traditional manufacturing techniques often suffer from limitations in design freedom and material properties. However, additive manufacturing provides an alternative by enabling the direct conversion of digital designs into physical objects layer-by-layer.
While additive manufacturing has been extensively used for various applications in different fields, there is still much to be explored in terms of materials with enhanced functionalities. This is where bioinspiration comes into play. Nature has already perfected the art of creating sophisticated hierarchical structures that exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, self-healing abilities, energy storage capabilities, and more.
By drawing inspiration from natural biomaterials and harnessing the power of additive manufacturing techniques, researchers have made significant progress towards developing bioinspired materials with tailored functionalities. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art in bioinspired additive manufacturing.
2. Natural Biomaterials: From Structure to Function
Natural biomaterials such as bones, shells, silk fibers, and wood possess remarkable properties that can be attributed to their well-designed hierarchical structures at multiple length scales. For example, bone consists of both organic collagen matrix and mineralized hydroxyapatite nanoparticles arranged in a staggered pattern at different scales. This combination results in a lightweight yet robust structure that exhibits excellent mechanical properties.
Understanding the chemical composition and structural arrangements within these natural biomaterials provides valuable insights for designing synthetic counterparts using additive manufacturing techniques. By mimicking these hierarchical structures at various length scales – from nano to macro – it becomes possible to recreate similar functionalities found in nature.
3. Bioinspired Additive Manufacturing: Different Scales & Approaches
In recent years, researchers have utilized additive manufacturing methods such as stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and inkjet printing to fabricate bioinspired materials. At the nano scale, techniques like electrospinning and atomic layer deposition (ALD) have been employed for creating nanofibers and thin films, respectively.
Moving up to the micro scale, 3D printing has been used to fabricate complex structures with precise control over their geometry and porosity. By embedding microchannels or microfluidic networks within these structures, it becomes possible to recreate the vascular systems found in natural tissues.
At the micro-macro level, additive manufacturing can be used to create composite materials by incorporating reinforcing elements such as fibers or particles into a matrix material. This allows for improved mechanical properties while maintaining lightweight characteristics.
Finally, at the macro level, large-scale additive manufacturing can be employed to produce functional objects such as implants or prosthetics that mimic the structural and mechanical properties of natural counterparts.
4. Applications & Future Directions
Bioinspired additive manufacturing holds great promise in numerous fields including tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, energy storage devices, aerospace engineering, and more. For example, biofabrication techniques can be utilized to create scaffolds for tissue regeneration by mimicking extracellular matrices found in human tissues.
In terms of future directions, there is still a need for further research into understanding the fundamental principles behind natural biomaterials' functionalities and translating them into synthetic counterparts using additive manufacturing techniques. Additionally, advances in material science are necessary to expand the range of available materials compatible with 3D printing technologies.
In conclusion,...
Bioinspired additive manufacturing offers a novel approach towards developing advanced materials with tailored functionalities by mimicking nature's design principles. By harnessing multidisciplinary knowledge from biology, chemistry，materials science，and engineering，we have only just started exploring the vast potential of this field. With continued research efforts and technological advancements in additive manufacturing methods，we can expect significant breakthroughs that will revolutionize industries ranging from healthcare to aerospace.

Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease that primarily affects premature infants, with a mortality rate ranging from 20% to 50%. It is characterized by necrosis and inflammation of the intestine, leading to bowel perforation and systemic sepsis. NEC remains an urgent clinical problem due to its high incidence, lack of early diagnostic tools, and uncertain pathophysiology. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have opened up new opportunities for improving the understanding and management of this complex disease.
AI refers to the simulation of intelligent behavior in machines, while ML focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn automatically from data. By harnessing these technologies, researchers have been able to identify patterns, extract meaningful information from large datasets, and make accurate predictions.
In the context of NEC research, AI has been employed in various aspects including diagnosis prediction and prognosis assessment. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving outcomes for NEC patients. Researchers have developed ML models that utilize clinical parameters such as gestational age at birth, birth weight, hematological measures, radiographic findings, and clinical symptoms to predict which infants are at higher risk of developing NEC. These models can assist clinicians in identifying vulnerable patients earlier and initiating timely interventions.
Once NEC is diagnosed or suspected clinically or radiographically by healthcare professionals through empirical evidence gathered on patient history taking physical examination abdominal x-ray ultrasonography or computed tomography researchers also employ AI techniques for prognosis prediction. Numerous predictive models have been developed using ML algorithms on variables such as laboratory values (e.g., complete blood count), clinical parameters (e.g., heart rate variability), imaging findings (e.g., air-fluid levels), treatment modalities (e.g., surgical interventions), comorbid conditions (e.g., sepsis), or a combination thereof.
In addition to diagnosis prediction and prognosis assessment studies researchers are exploring biomarkers associated with NEC to further improve its diagnosis and management. AI techniques enable the identification of potential biomarkers that can help in early disease detection, prognostic assessment, or monitoring treatment response. For instance, ML algorithms have been applied to gene expression profiling data to identify gene signatures associated with the development and progression of NEC. These identified biomarkers could enhance our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and potentially guide therapeutic interventions.
Moreover, AI has enabled researchers to evaluate various treatment modalities for NEC. By analyzing vast amounts of data from clinical trials or retrospective studies, ML algorithms can find patterns and correlations between treatment strategies and patient outcomes. This information can aid in determining which therapies are more effective or identifying factors that influence treatment response.
Despite the promising advancements in AI and ML research within the field of NEC, there are still limitations that need to be addressed. Firstly, data availability is a crucial factor as machine learning models rely heavily on high-quality datasets for training purposes. However, acquiring large-scale datasets specific to NEC poses several challenges due to its low incidence rate compared to other diseases.
Furthermore, interpretability and generalizability remain major concerns when implementing AI models in healthcare settings. The black-box nature of some ML algorithms makes it difficult for clinicians to comprehend how decisions are made by these models which hinders their acceptance among medical professionals.
In conclusion, AI and ML techniques hold great promise for advancing our knowledge about neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis by improving early diagnosis prediction, prognosis assessment biomarker identification,and treatment evaluation approaches As technology continues evolving creating opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations will greatly assist healthcare professionals researchers in developing robust models that can support decision-making processes ultimately improving outcomes for infants affected by this devastating condition.
 
Thus further research is encouraged so new diagnostic parameters better management strategies optimized treat options leading improved outcomes lives those compromised safely treated diagnosed earlier effectively managing vulnerable at-risk infants_scores 
Post-stroke dysphagia, difficulty swallowing, is a common neurological impairment that occurs after a stroke. The process of swallowing involves the coordinated effort of various parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, subcortical areas, and brainstem structures. When these parts are disrupted due to a stroke, it can lead to dysphagia.
The muscles involved in swallowing are also affected by a stroke. The laryngeal muscles such as the suprahyoid muscle and thyrohyoid muscle, as well as the infrahyoid muscle, experience changes in their ability to move and weaken in strength. This results in reduced movement during the swallowing process.
Acupuncture has been proposed as a potential treatment for post-stroke dysphagia due to its ability to affect nerve cells in the cerebral cortex and promote neurological function recovery. It can also enhance neuromuscular excitability and improve control over nerves and muscles involved in swallowing.
To evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for post-stroke dysphagia treatment, a meta-analysis was conducted. Randomized controlled trials using tongue acupuncture therapy were included in this analysis.
A comprehensive search was conducted across seven electronic databases to identify relevant studies. In total, 15 studies with 1,094 patients were included for analysis. Methodological quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool.
The meta-analysis revealed several significant findings regarding tongue acupuncture therapy for post-stroke dysphagia treatment. Firstly, compared to control groups receiving no acupuncture or other treatments alone, patients receiving tongue acupuncture or tongue acupuncture combined with other therapies showed improvement in WST scores (MD = -0.56) and SSA scores (MD = -1.65). This indicated that tongue acupuncture led to reduced severity of dysphagia symptoms.
Furthermore, when comparing clinical efficacy between groups receiving tongue acupuncture versus control groups without any form of acupuncture therapy or other treatments alone it was found that the tongue acupuncture group showed statistically significant improvement (MD = 3.83). This suggests that tongue acupuncture is more effective in treating post-stroke dysphagia compared to no intervention or other therapies alone.
The total effective rate of patients with dysphagia after stroke was also found to be higher in the treatment group receiving acupuncture, tongue acupuncture, and acupuncture combined with other therapies than in the control group. This supports the notion that both tongue acupuncture and traditional body-acupuncture can improve post-stroke dysphagia symptoms.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the use of tongue acupuncture for the treatment of post-stroke dysphagia. The findings suggest that tongue acupuncture can help reduce the severity of dysphagia symptoms, improve clinical efficacy, and enhance overall recovery for patients. These results highlight the potential benefits of incorporating tongue acupuncture into comprehensive treatment plans for individuals with post-stroke dysphagia. However, further research is needed to explore optimal treatment protocols and long-term effects. Additionally, the meta-analysis highlights the importance of incorporating acupuncture as part of a comprehensive treatment approach for post-stroke dysphagia. While tongue acupuncture has shown promising results, it is worth noting that the studies included in this analysis also reported positive outcomes when combining tongue acupuncture with other therapies. This suggests that a multimodal treatment approach, combining different therapeutic modalities such as speech therapy, swallowing exercises, and traditional body-acupuncture alongside tongue acupuncture, may yield optimal results.
The mechanism of action underlying the effectiveness of tongue acupuncture for post-stroke dysphagia is still not fully understood. However, it is believed that stimulating specific points on the tongue can activate neural pathways connected to swallowing centers in the brain. This stimulation alters neuronal excitability and enhances communication between these centers and the muscles involved in swallowing. This ultimately leads to improved neuromuscular coordination and functional recovery of swallowing abilities.
It should be mentioned that while this meta-analysis provides valuable insights into the clinical efficacy of tongue acupuncture for post-stroke dysphagia treatment, there are certain limitations to consider. Firstly, there was heterogeneity among the included studies in terms of study design, sample size, treatment protocols employed (e.g., frequency and duration), and assessment tools used to measure outcomes. These variations could introduce some bias or affect overall generalizability.
Moreover, most studies included had a relatively small sample size. Larger-scale randomized controlled trials with more participants would provide stronger evidence on the efficacy and safety profile of tongue acupuncture for post-stroke dysphagia specifically.
Furthermore, long-term follow-up data were limited or absent in many studies which makes it challenging to evaluate whether any observed improvements from tongue acupuncture are sustainable over time.
Despite these limitations being noted during this meta-analysis process further research is warranted both to expand our understanding on how exactly toe stimulation influences neural networks associated with swallowing functions as well as evaluating its long-term effects along with providing further evidence to the effectiveness of tongue acupuncture for post-stroke dysphagia treatment.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that tongue acupuncture is a promising therapeutic intervention for patients with post-stroke dysphagia. It has demonstrated significant improvements in swallowing function, clinical efficacy, and overall recovery rates when compared to controls receiving no acupuncture or other treatments alone. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential benefits of incorporating tongue acupuncture into the comprehensive management of post-stroke dysphagia. Nonetheless, further large-scale studies are necessary to establish optimal treatment protocols, address existing limitations, and determine its long-term effects. By advancing our understanding of this approach, healthcare professionals can enhance patient outcomes and improve their quality of life following a stroke-induced dysphagia diagnosis. 
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, cognitive impairment is also prevalent in PD patients and can significantly impact their quality of life. Cognitive decline in PD has been associated with worse disease prognosis, increased burden on caregivers, and higher economic costs.
Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has recently gained attention as a potential marker of early cognitive impairment in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). SCD refers to self-reported cognitive decline experienced by individuals without detectable objective cognitive dysfunction. It is considered an at-risk state for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and a prodromal stage for dementia.
While extensive research has been conducted on SCD in AD, studies focusing specifically on PD-related SCD have been limited. Consequently, there is currently no consensus regarding the definition of SCD or a gold standard evaluation tool for PD-SCD.
The aim of this review was to explore the association between PD-SCD and objective cognitive function. One key finding was that PD patients with SCD exhibited brain metabolic changes consistent with early aberrant pathological changes seen in PD. These findings suggest that subjective complaints about cognition may reflect underlying neuronal deficits.
Furthermore, it was observed that individuals with PD-SCD were more likely to progress to future cognitive impairment or develop MCI compared to those without subjective complaints about cognition. This highlights the importance of identifying and monitoring individuals with SCD as they may represent a high-risk group for developing significant cognitive impairments.
To enhance our understanding of PD-SCD further and establish guidelines for its definition and evaluation, larger sample sizes are required along with more longitudinal investigations. Long-term studies can help determine the predictive effectiveness of PD-SCD in detecting earlier subtle declines in cognition before the onset of clinically evident MCI or dementia.
In addition to exploring the predictive value of PD-SCD, future research should also focus on developing standardized assessment tools for the evaluation of SCD in PD. Consensus guidelines would enable clinicians to reliably identify individuals at risk of cognitive decline and intervene promptly, potentially delaying or preventing the onset of more severe cognitive impairments.
Clinicians should routinely screen PD patients for subjective complaints about cognition and consider a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation if SCD is reported. This will aid in early detection, monitoring, and intervention strategies that may help improve patients' overall cognitive functioning and quality of life.
In conclusion, subjective cognitive decline represents a significant area of study in Parkinson's disease. By identifying individuals at risk through the establishment of consensus guidelines for its definition and evaluation, we can proactively intervene and potentially modify disease progression. Increased research efforts are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving PD-SCD and its association with objective cognitive function. Ultimately, improving our understanding of PD-related cognitive decline will have important implications for patient care and management strategies. 2. Neural mechanisms of subjective cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease
To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in Parkinson's disease (PD), several studies have been conducted using various neuroimaging techniques.
Some studies have utilized functional neuroimaging such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain metabolism and connectivity patterns in PD patients with SCD. These studies consistently showed abnormal patterns of glucose metabolism and altered functional connectivity networks in regions involved in cognition, including the prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus.
Structural neuroimaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have also demonstrated gray matter atrophy or volume reductions in these same brain regions implicated in SCD. Specifically, cortical thinning has been observed in the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as within subcortical structures such as the hippocampus and thalamus.
Moreover, neuropathological examinations have revealed that PD patients with SCD exhibit abnormal accumulation of pathologic protein aggregates, including alpha-synuclein deposition. These pathological changes are similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease but are primarily localized to specific brain areas affected by PD.
These findings collectively suggest that SCD may arise from a combination of underlying pathogenic processes associated with PD-related neurodegeneration and concomitant Alzheimer's-like pathology.
3. Clinical implications for subjective cognitive decline assessment
Given the potential significance of SCD as an early marker for cognitive decline in PD, its clinical assessment becomes paramount. However, there is currently no gold standard for evaluating SCD specifically within the context of PD diagnosis or management.
Several self-report questionnaires such as Cognitive Complaints Questionnaire (CCQ), Subjective Memory Complaints Scale (SMC), or Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ) have been used to assess SCD across different populations but lack specificity for PD-related cognitive decline.
To enhance the clinical assessment of SCD in PD, a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests combining objective cognitive assessments with patient-reported subjective complaints may be necessary. Additionally, incorporating multimodal neuroimaging measures can assist in identifying individuals who may be at higher risk of progressive cognitive decline.
Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the predictive value of SCD for MCI or dementia development in PD, as well as its potential association with other clinical features such as motor symptom severity and disease duration. Such investigations will aid in stratifying patients according to their risk profile for cognitive impairment and guide personalized therapeutic interventions.
4. Conclusion
Subjective cognitive decline represents an important area of investigation within the context of Parkinson's disease. While research on SCD has predominantly focused on Alzheimer's disease, recent studies have shed light on its relevance to PD-related cognitive dysfunction.
PD patients with subjective complaints about cognition show distinct patterns of brain metabolic changes and structural alterations similar to early pathological changes seen in PD. Moreover, these individuals are more likely to develop future cognitive impairments compared to those without subjective complaints.
To advance our understanding and clinical management of SCD in PD, further research is needed to establish consensus guidelines for its definition and evaluation. Standardized assessment tools that combine objective measures with patient-reported symptoms can facilitate early detection, monitoring, and intervention strategies aimed at improving overall cognition outcomes for PD patients.
Efforts should also be directed toward investigating the underlying neural mechanisms driving SCD in Parkinson's disease through neuroimaging techniques and neuropathological examinations. By unraveling these mechanisms, we can better identify potential therapeutic targets and develop novel interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function in this population.
Ultimately, successful management strategies targeting subjective cognitive decline could have substantial positive impacts on patient care, quality of life improvements among affected individuals with Parkinson's disease -giving hope by delaying or preventing severe cognitive impairments while improving overall health outcomes. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and has a poor prognosis with increasing incidence globally. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach in HCC treatment by harnessing the body's immune system to target and destroy cancer cells. However, not all patients respond effectively to immunotherapies due to the development of resistance.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are a class of compounds that have been shown to enhance the anti-tumor effect of immunotherapies in various cancers, including HCC. HDACis function by inhibiting enzymes that regulate gene expression through histone deacetylation, thereby altering gene transcription and protein synthesis within tumor cells. This disruption leads to increased tumor cell death and sensitizes them to immune-mediated killing.
Recent studies have demonstrated the potential synergy between immunotherapies and HDACis in enhancing anti-tumor responses in HCC. Preclinical models have shown that combining HDACis with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, leads to improved therapeutic outcomes compared to single-agent treatments. This combination therapy promotes both innate and adaptive immune responses against HCC cells, resulting in enhanced tumor regression.
One mechanism by which HDACis enhance anti-tumor immunity is via modulation of the tumor microenvironment. The immunosuppressive nature of HCC tumors arises from an imbalance between suppressive immune cells like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), along with impaired function or depletion of effector T cells. HDACis can reverse this immunosuppression by increasing effector T cell infiltration into tumors while reducing the population of inhibitory Tregs and MDSCs.
Moreover, HDACis can upregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on tumor cells, making them more visible to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Enhanced MHC-I expression on HCC cells leads to increased recognition and killing by antigen-specific T cells, thereby improving the anti-tumor immune response.
The combination of immunotherapies and HDACis has shown promising results in early clinical trials for HCC. For example, a phase 1b/2 study combining pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitor) with entinostat (HDACi) demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced HCC who had previously progressed on sorafenib therapy. The combination therapy achieved a disease control rate of 80%, including objective responses in some patients.
To further enhance the therapeutic efficacy of HDACis in HCC treatment, novel drug delivery systems are being explored. Nano-based drug delivery systems (NDDS) can encapsulate HDACis and deliver them directly to tumor sites, maximizing their effectiveness while minimizing off-target toxicity. NDDS can be tailored to release the drug over an extended period and facilitate sustained drug exposure within the tumor microenvironment.
In conclusion, the combination of immunotherapies and HDACis shows great potential for enhancing anti-tumor responses in HCC. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this synergy will aid in optimizing treatment strategies for HCC patients resistant to current immunotherapies. Furthermore, utilizing nano-based drug delivery systems may provide a novel approach to enhance the targeted delivery and efficacy of HDACis in HCC treatment. 2. Immunotherapy-based and HDACi-based therapies for HCC:
Immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment landscape for various cancers, including HCC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, have shown promising results by reactivating exhausted T cells and restoring anti-tumor immune responses. However, not all patients respond to single-agent immunotherapy due to intrinsic or acquired resistance mechanisms.
HDACis offer a potential solution to overcome immunotherapy resistance in HCC. Several HDACis, including entinostat, vorinostat, and panobinostat have demonstrated synergistic effects when combined with immunotherapies in preclinical models of HCC. These combinations enhance the activation of tumor-specific T cells and improve their tumor-infiltrating capacities.
Furthermore, HDACis impact the tumor microenvironment by promoting an immune-supportive milieu. They reduce Treg cell populations while stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokine production within tumors. This shift towards an inflammatory environment strengthens the anti-tumor efficacy of immunotherapies as it disrupts immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells.
3. Translating knowledge into clinical benefits:
The promising preclinical results of combining immunotherapies with HDACis in HCC have paved the way for clinical trials to assess their safety and efficacy in patients. Multiple ongoing studies are evaluating this combination therapy approach with encouraging preliminary results.
For instance, a phase Ib study investigating nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) plus ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) along with entinostat in advanced HCC patients demonstrated objective responses that were durable even after treatment discontinuation. This highlights the potential long-term benefits that can be achieved through combining immunotherapies with HDACis.
Additionally, other ongoing trials are exploring novel combinations involving checkpoint inhibitors targeting different molecules like LAG-3 or TIM-3 in combination with HDACis. These trials aim to further optimize the treatment landscape for HCC, providing more options for patients who may not respond to current standard-of-care therapies.
4. Nano-based drug delivery systems (NDDS) as a novel strategy:
Efficient drug delivery systems are critical in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of HDACis in HCC treatment. NDDS, characterized by their ability to encapsulate and deliver drugs directly to tumor sites, offer several advantages over conventional drug delivery methods.
NDDS ensures targeted and sustained release of HDACis within the tumor microenvironment, maximizing their anti-tumor effects while minimizing off-target toxicity. Moreover, these systems can enhance drug stability and bioavailability, improve circulation time and immune recognition, as well as overcome multidrug resistance mechanisms exhibited by cancer cells.
Several studies have explored various NDDS formulations for delivering HDACis in HCC models, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, and micelles. These approaches have shown enhanced therapeutic effects compared to free drugs alone.
However, challenges such as optimizing drug loading efficiency within NDDS formulations remain. Improving strategies for targeting specific molecular markers expressed on HCC cells would also enhance selective uptake of HDACis by tumors while sparing healthy tissues.
5. Conclusion:
The application of immunotherapies in HCC has remarkably transformed patient management; however immunotherapy resistance remains a significant concern. Combining immunotherapies with HDACis offers a promising approach to overcome resistance mechanisms and achieve improved outcomes for HCC patients.
Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating this combination therapy's safety and efficacy while preliminary results show encouraging responses among advanced stage patients resistant to previous treatments.
Furthermore, incorporating nano-based drug delivery systems holds great potential in enhancing the targeted delivery and therapeutic benefits of HDACis specifically for HCC treatment.
Overall findings from preclinical studies together with ongoing clinical trials suggest that combining immunotherapies with HDACis offers a promising strategy that could significantly improve the prognosis for HCC patients in the future. 
The complement system is a cascade of proteins that plays a crucial role in immune defense. It acts as a first line of defense against pathogens, aiding in their clearance and promoting inflammation. Deficiencies in complement components can result in an increased susceptibility to infections, autoimmune diseases, or immune disorders.
Among the primary complement deficiencies, deficiencies in the terminal pathway components are particularly important to identify due to the significantly higher risk of Neisseria meningitidis infections. These infections can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.
In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic patterns of C7 deficiency by conducting a systematic review and reporting on a novel deletion found in a ten-year-old boy infected with Neisseria meningitidis B.
The patient displayed clinical symptoms that suggested reduced C activity. To confirm this suspicion, functional assays were performed using the Wieslab ELISA Kit. The results confirmed significantly reduced activity of all three pathways - classical (0.6% activity), lectin (0.2% activity), and alternative (0.1% activity). Further analysis through Western blot revealed the complete absence of C7 protein in the patient's serum.
To understand the genetic basis underlying this deficiency, Sanger sequencing was performed on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples of the patient. This allowed for identification of two pathogenetic variants within the C7 gene - one known missense mutation G379R and another novel heterozygous deletion located at c.*99_*101delTCT within 3'UTR region.
Further investigation revealed that this deletion caused instability in mRNA expression from both alleles but only allowed expression from alleles containing missense mutations such as G379R variant present alongside it. Consequently, it resulted in functional hemizygosity where only one allele carrying mutated C7 variant was expressed.
This finding highlights an additional mechanism leading to functional hemizygosity observed within patients with C-terminal pathway component deficiencies. It expands our understanding of the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms causing C7 deficiency.
Identifying specific genetic variants associated with complement deficiencies is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it allows for accurate diagnosis and classification of patients with immune disorders, aiding in appropriate treatment decisions. Secondly, it enables better risk assessment for complications such as Neisseria meningitidis infections, allowing for prompt identification and preventative measures such as vaccinations.
In summary, this study presents a systematic review of clinical and genetic patterns observed in C7 deficiency. We report a novel deletion within the C7 gene that results in functional hemizygosity due to mRNA instability. The findings shed light on the genetic bases underlying complement deficiencies and emphasize the importance of comprehensive genetic analysis in patients presenting with immune disorders or increased susceptibility to infections. Early detection through genetic testing is crucial for implementing appropriate management strategies to minimize complications and improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, the identification of this novel deletion in the C7 gene contributes to the growing knowledge of genetic variants associated with complement deficiencies. This finding expands our understanding of the complex genetic landscape underlying immune disorders and provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms involved.
The implications of C7 deficiency are significant, particularly in terms of susceptibility to Neisseria meningitidis infections. Prompt identification of individuals with C7 deficiency is essential to minimize the risk of these potentially life-threatening infections. With early detection, preventative measures such as targeted vaccinations can be implemented effectively, ensuring protection against Neisseria meningitidis and reducing morbidity and mortality rates.
Additionally, understanding the genetic basis of complement deficiencies opens up avenues for potential therapeutic interventions. Gene therapy approaches could be explored to restore or enhance complement activity in individuals with C7 deficiency. Targeted interventions could help improve immune functionality and reduce susceptibility to infections in affected individuals.
It is worth noting that while this study focuses on a specific case involving a novel deletion in the C7 gene, there may be other genetic variants contributing to C7 deficiency that have not been explored in this context. Further research and larger-scale studies are needed to comprehensively understand the full spectrum of genetic variations associated with complement deficiencies.
In conclusion, this systematic review highlights clinical and genetic patterns observed in C7 deficiency. The discovery of a novel deletion within the C7 gene leading to functional hemizygosity provides new insights into the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms involved in complement deficiencies. These findings contribute to our understanding of immune disorders and emphasize the importance of early detection through comprehensive genetic analysis for appropriate management strategies. Continued research into complement deficiencies will further enhance our knowledge, enabling us to develop more targeted therapies and preventive measures for these rare but clinically significant conditions.
 
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health concern, affecting approximately one-third of the world's population. The current challenges in TB diagnosis include long turnaround times and poor sensitivity of conventional diagnostic methods, which often lead to delays in treatment initiation and the development of drug resistance. To address these issues, molecular diagnostics have been developed, offering improved sensitivity but requiring sophisticated infrastructure, skilled personnel, and being cost-intensive.
A promising alternative for TB diagnosis is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016. The LAMP assay facilitates visual readouts and has shown potential for rapid detection of Mycobacterial spp., the causative agents of TB. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the diagnostic efficacy of LAMP for detecting a panel of Mycobacterium spp. following PRISMA guidelines.
A comprehensive search was conducted using scientific databases to identify relevant studies on LAMP-based diagnosis of Mycobacterium spp. Out of 1600 studies initially identified, 30 articles were included in this review based on predefined criteria. Most of these studies were conducted in high disease burden countries such as India, Thailand, and Japan. The sputum was found to be the most common specimen used for LAMP assays.
The analysis revealed that the IS6110 gene was frequently targeted for amplification using LAMP technology. In terms of detection method, fluorescence-based detection ranked as the most commonly used approach across these studies.
The accuracy rates varied between 79.2% to 99.3%, indicating strong diagnostic performance overall.The precision rates ranged from 73.9% to 100%, suggesting that LAMP assays are consistent with their results across different laboratories and settings.
Finally,the quality assessment based on QUADAS-2 tool was undertaken to evaluate potential biases or limitations in study design that may affect these findings or their applicability in different settings. This assessment helped to strengthen the overall conclusions drawn from this review.
In conclusion, LAMP technology shows promise as a feasible alternative for TB diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where there is a high burden of the disease and rapid testing is crucial. The visual readouts offered by LAMP assays make them advantageous in terms of ease of interpretation. While further research is needed to validate and expand the application of LAMP assays for Mycobacterial spp., this meta-analysis provides evidence supporting their diagnostic efficacy.
The implementation of LAMP technology for Mycobacterial spp. detection has the potential to significantly reduce treatment delays and prevent the development of drug resistance by enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis.Thus, it can contribute to improving TB control strategies on a global scale.
However, it should be noted that although LAMP assays offer enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional diagnostics, they still require trained personnel and appropriate laboratory infrastructure for optimal performance.Some challenges regarding cost-effectiveness also need to be addressed before widespread adoption can occur.
In summary,the findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis affirm that LAMP technology holds great promise as an alternative diagnostic tool for Mycobacterial spp. detection.The results underscore its potential to overcome some of the major barriers associated with conventional TB diagnostics,such as long turnaround times and poor sensitivity.
Therefore,continued research efforts should focus on refining this promising technique,and further studies are warranted to evaluate its feasibility,cost-effectiveness,and scalability across different settings.This will help facilitate its integration into routine TB diagnosis algorithms worldwide,and potentially contribute significantly towards achieving global TB elimination targets. 
Introduction:
Cannabis use has become increasingly prevalent globally due to the legalization of recreational marijuana in many countries. As a result, the number of cannabis-related adverse events being encountered in Emergency Departments (EDs) has also increased. These adverse events often present with mental health symptoms, posing a significant challenge for clinicians and researchers trying to disentangle cannabis use from other recreational substances.
Previous reviews have examined the types and numbers of cannabis-associated adverse events seen in EDs. However, since these reviews were published, the legal landscape surrounding cannabis has changed dramatically. This review aims to provide an updated understanding of mental health adverse events related to cannabis use in EDs and critically evaluate the current state of research on this topic.
One major concern when studying these events is potential biases that may affect data validity. Both clinicians and researchers can introduce biases that might hinder accurate assessment of the interaction between cannabis and mental health outcomes. For instance, many studies rely on administrative data from front-line healthcare providers who identify cases where cannabis use is associated with a particular admission. Such reliance on subjective assessments raises questions about accuracy and consistency across different settings.
This narrative review aims to consolidate existing knowledge concerning mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use in EDs by examining available literature through a critical lens. It will focus not only on individuals with pre-existing mental illness but also explore findings related to those without such history.
Additionally, this review will consider gender differences in how cannabis impacts mental health outcomes since emerging evidence suggests variations between sexes exist. Understanding these gender-specific effects could inform targeted interventions and prevention strategies.
The primary objectives of this review include identifying common mental health complications associated with cannabis use that are frequently observed in ED settings while highlighting exceptionally rare yet concerning event reports as well.The authors also propose a framework for critically evaluating future research within this field for more robust assessment of causal relationships between cannabis consumption patterns and subsequent psychological sequelae.
By addressing these objectives, this narrative review aims to consolidate the current state of knowledge regarding mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use in EDs. Understanding the prevalence, specific symptoms, and potential underlying mechanisms is crucial for developing effective clinical management strategies and public health interventions.
In conclusion, this review will provide an updated overview of mental health adverse events related to cannabis use encountered in EDs. It will address biases that may affect research validity while considering implications for patients with or without a history of mental illness. By exploring gender differences and proposing a framework for future research evaluation, this review aims to contribute to our understanding of the complex relationship between cannabis use and mental health outcomes in ED settings. 2. Current State of Knowledge: 
The current state of knowledge regarding mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use in EDs is rapidly evolving due to the changing legal climate and increased research attention in this area. Studies have shown that cannabis use can have both short-term and long-term effects on mental health, ranging from acute intoxication-related symptoms to more chronic psychiatric illnesses.
In terms of acute effects, cannabis use has been linked to increased anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosis-like symptoms in some individuals. These presentations are often observed in the ED when individuals seek medical help for their distressing experiences. It is essential to distinguish between pre-existing mental illness exacerbations triggered by cannabis use and new-onset psychiatric symptoms directly attributable to its consumption.
Research has also identified a potential link between long-term cannabis use and an increased risk of developing mental health disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. However, the causal relationship between cannabis use and these disorders remains unclear. It is challenging to definitively establish if those already prone to mental illness are at higher risk due to their prior vulnerability or if heavy cannabis consumption plays a role independent of pre-existing predispositions.
Furthermore, recent studies have begun exploring gender differences related to the impact of cannabis on mental health outcomes. Some evidence suggests that females may be more vulnerable than males when it comes to adverse psychological reactions following cannabis use. This finding emphasizes the need for gender-specific research that considers biological factors as well as social contexts influencing drug responses.
3. Evaluation Bias:
To gain a clearer understanding of the existing literature on this topic, it is crucial to evaluate potential biases within research designs themselves. Several limitations can impact data validity when examining mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use in EDs.
One common bias stems from relying heavily on self-reported data or subjective assessments made by healthcare providers regarding patients' history or experience with drug consumption during ED visits. Accurate reporting relies heavily on patients' honesty and recall ability, which may be compromised during intoxication or due to social desirability bias.
Another potential bias arises from inadequate control of confounding factors and variable definitions among studies. Cannabis use is often found in conjunction with the use of other recreational substances, making it challenging to isolate the effects of cannabis alone. Further research applying rigorous control measures is necessary to disentangle these complex relationships.
Additionally, selection biases may occur when recruiting patients for research studies in ED settings. Not all individuals who consume cannabis and experience associated psychological symptoms seek medical attention in an ED setting. These selection biases can influence the representation of certain populations and limit generalizability.
4. Framework for Future Research:
To address these biases and improve the validity of future research on mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use in EDs, a framework for critical evaluation is proposed.
Firstly, standardized definitions need to be established regarding what constitutes a mental health adverse event related specifically to cannabis use. Consistency in terminology will facilitate comparison across studies and accurate identification within clinical settings.
Secondly, researchers should utilize objective measures whenever possible to mitigate reliance on subjective assessments or self-reported data. For instance, incorporating toxicology screens along with detailed clinical evaluations can provide more robust evidence linking specific substances directly to psychiatric symptoms observed upon presentation at an ED.
Thirdly, future studies should aim for better control of confounding variables by employing matched-control designs or adjusting statistical analyses for potential confounders such as co-occurring substance use or pre-existing psychiatric conditions that might impact outcomes independently from cannabis consumption itself.
Lastly, efforts must be made towards diversity in study populations by including individuals from various backgrounds and demographics to account for potentially differential effects related to age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status as well as gender differences previously mentioned above.
In conclusion, understanding mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use encountered in EDs requires ongoing analysis and critical evaluation due to continuously changing legal landscapes worldwide. The current state of knowledge indicates potential short-term and long-term effects on mental health, with some evidence suggesting gender-based differences in vulnerability. Evaluating biases within research designs and proposing a framework for future investigations will enable more accurate assessments of the relationship between cannabis use and mental health outcomes in the ED setting. By addressing these gaps, we can better inform clinical decision-making, develop targeted interventions, and enhance public health strategies surrounding cannabis use. 
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla and extra-adrenal paraganglia, respectively. These tumors are characterized by excessive production and release of catecholamines, resulting in episodic or sustained hypertension. Currently, surgical resection is the only curative treatment for these tumors, but in cases where metastasis has occurred or when surgery is not feasible, therapeutic options are limited.
Epigenetic alterations have been increasingly recognized as major contributors to tumorigenesis. Histone modifications, including acetylation and deacetylation of histones, play a pivotal role in gene regulation by affecting chromatin structure and accessibility to transcription factors. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from histones leading to condensed chromatin structure and gene silencing. Inhibition of HDAC activity can reverse this process and result in the activation of tumor suppressor genes or induction of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have emerged as promising therapeutics for various types of cancer due to their ability to modulate key cellular processes involved in tumorigenesis. HDACis exert their antitumor effects through multiple mechanisms such as the induction of cell cycle arrest, differentiation, apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, modulation of immune response pathways as well as affecting DNA repair mechanisms.
Several studies have investigated the potential therapeutic role for HDACis in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Preclinical studies using various HDACis have shown promising results with reduced tumor growth both in vitro and xenograft models. For instance, treatment with the pan-HDAC inhibitor vorinostat has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma cell lines. Another HDACi, panobinostat, has been found to decrease tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of metastatic paraganglioma.
In addition to their direct effects on tumor cells, HDACis have also been shown to modulate the tumor microenvironment. They can regulate the expression of immune checkpoint molecules and enhance natural killer cell-mediated killing of tumor cells. This suggests that HDACis may have potential synergistic effects with immunotherapy approaches for the treatment of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.
Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of HDACis in patients with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are still limited, but initial results are promising. In a phase II clinical trial, treatment with vorinostat resulted in disease stabilization or partial response in a subset of patients with advanced/metastatic paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma.
Overall, the available evidence suggests that HDACis hold promise as novel therapeutic agents for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Their ability to target multiple pathways involved in tumorigenesis makes them attractive candidates for combination therapies with other targeted agents or immunotherapies. However, further research is needed to optimize their use and elucidate mechanisms of resistance to these agents. Future clinical trials should focus on identifying predictive biomarkers for patient selection as well as investigating optimal dosing schedules and combination strategies to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. 2. Mechanisms of action
The antitumor effects of HDACis in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are mediated through a variety of mechanisms. One key mechanism is the induction of cell cycle arrest by upregulating cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) such as p21 and p27, which leads to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. HDACis can also inhibit the activation of key signaling pathways involved in tumor growth and survival, including PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways.
Furthermore, HDACis induce apoptosis in tumor cells by enhancing pro-apoptotic signals and suppressing anti-apoptotic signals. They can upregulate pro-apoptotic genes such as BAX and downregulate anti-apoptotic genes like BCL-2, thereby shifting the balance towards apoptosis. Moreover, HDACis can interfere with DNA repair mechanisms, making tumor cells more susceptible to DNA damage-induced cell death.
In addition to their effects on tumor cells themselves, HDACis also have an impact on the tumor microenvironment. They can modulate angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and decreasing angiogenic factors like hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α). This leads to reduced blood supply to tumors, impairing their growth.
3. Preclinical evidence
Several preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of HDACis in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma models. For example, treatment with vorinostat has been shown to significantly reduce cell viability and induce apoptosis in various pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma cell lines.
Another study using panobinostat showed potent antitumor activity in xenograft models derived from metastatic paragangliomas. The treated mice exhibited reduced tumor growth and increased survival compared to the control group. These preclinical findings provide a strong rationale for further investigating the clinical utility of HDACis in these tumors.
4. Clinical evidence
Although clinical evidence for the use of HDACis specifically in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas is limited, there have been some encouraging findings. In a phase II trial, vorinostat was administered to patients with advanced/metastatic paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma who had progressed on prior therapies. The treatment resulted in disease stabilization or partial response in a subset of patients, with manageable side effects.
5. Future directions
Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the potential of HDACis as therapeutic agents for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Firstly, more preclinical studies are necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms by which HDACis exert their antitumor effects in these tumors.
Furthermore, well-designed clinical trials are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of HDACis as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments such as targeted therapies or immunotherapies. Additionally, identifying predictive biomarkers that can help select patients who are most likely to benefit from HDACi therapy would be valuable.
It is also important to investigate strategies that can overcome potential resistance mechanisms towards HDACis. Combination approaches with other epigenetic modifiers or targeted agents may enhance therapeutic response and prevent resistance development.
6.The Conclusion
In conclusion, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) represent a promising therapeutic approach for treating pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. These drugs have shown antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo models through various mechanisms including cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, modulation of angiogenesis, and immune response pathways.
Initial clinical trial results have demonstrated disease stabilization or partial response in patients with advanced/metastatic disease. However, more research is needed to optimize dosing schedules, identify predictive biomarkers, and explore combination strategies that may enhance therapeutic efficacy.
Overall, HDACis hold great potential as an alternative treatment option for patients with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas where surgery is not feasible or metastasis has occurred. Further investigation into the use of HDACis in these rare neuroendocrine tumors will provide valuable insights into their clinical implementation and may ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes. 
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex, lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviors. It affects individuals from early childhood and can have a profound impact on their lives and the lives of their families. Currently, there is no known cure for ASD, and treatment options are limited to managing symptoms.
Over the years, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies have gained attention as potential treatments for ASD. Among these therapies, acupuncture has shown promise in improving symptoms associated with ASD. Acupuncture is an ancient practice rooted in traditional Chinese medicine that involves the insertion of thin needles at specific points on the body to stimulate healing.
However, despite its potential benefits, acupuncture has not yet been widely recognized as a preferred CAM therapy for ASD. In order to evaluate the current research status of acupuncture for ASD and explore its prospects, we conducted an analysis of clinical study reports published in the past 15 years.
The analysis focused on various aspects of these studies including study subjects, group settings, intervention modalities, acupoint selection, outcome evaluation measures used, and safety considerations. The goal was to determine if there was sufficient evidence to support the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture in treating ASD.
Based on our comprehensive analysis of existing studies conducted so far, it became evident that there were limitations in terms of sample sizes and methodological rigor. While initial evidence suggested possible effectiveness of acupuncture in improving certain aspects related to ASD symptoms such as communication skills or sensory-motor behaviors improvement have been reported but were not consistently replicated across different studies.
In order to reach firm conclusions about its efficacy regarding treatment for children with autism spectrum disorders more high-quality research is required with meticulous adherence towards reporting interventions following STRICTA guidelines which will help standardize reporting requirements when conducting trials involving acupuncture 
Additionally CONSORT guidelines will help identify key components such as having control groups comparative interventions , randomization techniques allocation concealment , blinding which contribute in maintaining rigor and robustness in any clinical trial .
Furthermore, to truly understand the mechanisms through which acupuncture could benefit individuals with ASD, it is important to include functional experiments that explore the effect of acupuncture on brain functioning and neurophysiology.
The significance of this review lies in its aim to provide a reference for researchers interested in conducting high-quality clinical trials involving acupuncture as a treatment for ASD. By considering the combination of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine principles, it will be possible to design studies that are scientifically rigorous and produce reliable results.
In conclusion, while there is currently limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for ASD, there is potential for future research to further explore its benefits. It is important for future studies to adhere to established guidelines such as STRICTA and CONSORT and include functional experiments that investigate its underlying mechanisms. This will help increase our understanding of acupuncture's potential role in improving symptoms associated with ASD and guide more effective treatment approaches. 
The healthcare industry is characterized by its critical need for effective communication and information sharing. In recent years, there has been significant focus on the concepts of employee silence and voice in healthcare settings. Employee silence refers to the withholding of relevant information or opinions, while employee voice encompasses speaking up and expressing ideas or concerns.
Numerous studies have explored these concepts in relation to patient safety, quality of care, and worker wellbeing. However, interventions aimed at encouraging speaking up have often yielded disappointing outcomes due to a prevailing professional and organizational culture that does not support open communication. This raises questions about our understanding of employee voice and silence in healthcare, as well as the complex relationship between withholding information and various healthcare outcomes.
This integrative systematic review aims to address two key questions: (1) How is voice and silence defined and measured in healthcare?; (2) What are the theoretical foundations underpinning these concepts?
To conduct this review, an extensive search was conducted across multiple databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science CINAHL, and Google Scholar. Only quantitative studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 2016-2022 were considered for inclusion.
Overall, 76 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review with a total sample size of 122009 participants. The majority of participants were female nurses. The findings revealed three main results:
Firstly,
the conceptualization and measurement of both voice a nd silence in healthcare varied widely across studies. There was no consensus on a standardized definition or measurement tool, resulting in heterogeneity within the research literature. This lack of consistency made it difficult to compare and generalize findings across studies.
Secondly, the theoretical background surrounding employee voice and silence in healthcare was found to be lacking. While numerous studies examined these concepts, there was no unified theoretical framework guiding the research. This highlights a gap in our understanding of the underlying psychological and organizational factors that influence employee voice and silence in healthcare settings.
Additionally, the review identified a need for further research regarding the distinction between safety voice - employees speaking up specifically about patient safety concerns - and general employee voice encompassing broader workplace issues. Understanding how these two forms of expression coexist within healthcare organizations is crucial for developing targeted interventions.
The limitations of the reviewed studies were also acknowledged. Many relied heavily on self-reported data from cross-sectional designs, which can introduce response bias and limit causal inference. Furthermore, there was an overrepresentation of nurses and female staff among study participants, potentially limiting generalizability to other healthcare professionals.
Overall, this integrative systematic review highlights several key implications for both researchers and practitioners in the healthcare sector.
On one hand, it underscores the need for more robust assessment approaches when studying employee voice and silence in healthcare settings. The lack of standardized definitions and measurement tools hampers comparability across studies. Therefore, developing validated instruments that capture both individual-level perceptions as well as contextual factors could enhance our understanding of these constructs.
On another note, this review calls attention to the fact that current research falls short of providing sufficient evidence linking theory to practice implications within the healthcare industry. Bridging this gap would enable researchers to develop evidence-based interventions aimed at cultivating an organizational culture conducive to open communication while also addressing specific challenges related to patient safety or worker wellbeing.
In conclusion, this integrative review sheds light on important gaps currently present in our understanding of employee voice and silence in healthcare. The heterogeneity in conceptualization and measurement, lack of theoretical foundation, and limited evidence on links to practice all highlight areas for future research. By addressing these gaps, we can work towards improving communication, information sharing, and ultimately the quality of care within healthcare organizations. 
Plant-based dietary patterns, characterized by a high consumption of plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, have gained increasing attention due to their potential health benefits. Numerous studies have demonstrated associations between plant-based diets and a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and obesity.
However, the definition and assessment of plant-based diets can vary widely across studies. To address this issue and facilitate research in the field of plant-based diets and health outcomes, diet quality indices have been developed. These indices aim to provide a standardized methodology for quantifying adherence to a plant-based dietary pattern based on specific food groups or components.
In order to better understand the existing approaches used to develop these indices and their implications for research on plant-based diets, a scoping review was conducted. The review aimed to identify common features among different indices regarding their basis for development (i.e., evidence source), scoring methodology (i.e., how they assign scores based on food intake), and validation approaches (i.e., how well they assess adherence to a plant-based diet).
A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Global Health databases from 1980 to 2022. Studies were included if they assessed plant-based diets in adults using an established methodology with food-based components. Pregnant or lactating individuals were excluded from the analysis.
The search yielded 137 articles that described the development or use of 35 unique plant-based diet quality indices. These articles were published between 2007-2022. The identified indices varied in terms of their basis for development: some were based on epidemiological evidence for associations between foods consumed as part of a plant-based diet pattern and specific health outcomes; others were adaptations or modifications of previously developed diet quality indices; some followed country-specific dietary guidelines, whereas others were based on traditional dietary patterns.
The composition of the indices also varied, with different indices including anywhere between 4 to 33 food groups. However, fruits, vegetables, and grains were consistently included in almost all of the indices. These food groups are key components of plant-based diets due to their high content of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals.
Scoring methodology for the indices varied as well. Some used population-specific percentile cutoffs to assign scores based on the distribution of intake within a specific population. Others used normative cutoffs derived from dietary recommendations or guidelines. Additionally, several indices differentiated between healthy and less healthy plant-based foods when scoring intakes.
Validation methods utilized for these plant-based diet quality indices predominantly included construct validity (assessing how well an index reflects a theoretical construct), reliability (assessing consistency in measurements over time), and criterion validity (comparing an index against a gold standard measure). Construct validity was most commonly assessed among the identified studies.
Overall, this scoping review provides insights into existing approaches used to develop plant-based diet quality indices. It highlights that most of these indices have been derived from epidemiological research and aim to reflect associations between specific foods or dietary patterns and health outcomes. Furthermore, they often differentiate between healthy and less healthy plant-based foods during scoring processes.
To ensure best practice in research on plant-based dietary patterns and their association with health outcomes, researchers should consider factors such as the basis for development of the index they choose to use or modify for their study purposes; methodology used for scoring; validation methods employed; as well as reporting standards related to these aspects.
By evaluating existing plant-based diet quality indices through this scoping review and considering these factors during selection processes in future research studies involving plant-based diets' evaluation is essential towards advancing knowledge on optimal eating patterns that promote human health while minimizing environmental impacts associated with frequently recommended animal-source food consumption. 
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids, immune cells, and extracellular matrix in the arterial wall. It is the underlying cause of various cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, there is still a need for improved diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as potential biomarkers and modulators of atherosclerosis pathogenesis. EVs are small membranous structures released by various cell types under normal physiological conditions or in response to cellular stress. They can be classified into different subtypes based on their biogenesis pathways, size range, surface markers, and cargo composition. The three main types of EVs include exosomes (30-150 nm in diameter), microvesicles (100-1000 nm), and apoptotic bodies (800-5000 nm).
EVs derived from different cell types within the arterial wall have been shown to contribute to various aspects of atherosclerosis development. Endothelial dysfunction is an early hallmark event in atherosclerosis pathogenesis that leads to increased vascular permeability and leukocyte migration into the subendothelial space. EVs shed from activated endothelial cells can facilitate inflammation by inducing endothelial cell activation and promoting leukocyte recruitment through interactions with adhesion molecules.
Inflammation plays a crucial role at all stages of atherosclerotic lesion formation. Immune cells release EVs that contain pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, miRNAs, DNA fragments known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), among other inflammatory mediators that contribute to lesion development. These EV-derived factors can not only act locally but also circulate systemically promoting systemic inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease.
Thrombosis is another critical event in atherosclerosis that can lead to acute cardiovascular events. EVs released by activated platelets and endothelial cells contain various proteins involved in coagulation and platelet activation, such as tissue factor, phosphatidylserine, and P-selectin. These EVs promote clot formation and amplify local thrombogenic reactions.
One of the challenges in studying EVs is isolating them from complex biological fluids with high purity and preserving their integrity during isolation procedures. Several methods have been developed for EV isolation, including ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, immune-affinity capture using antibody-coated beads or microfluidic devices, among others. Each isolation method has its advantages and limitations in terms of yield, purity, recovery of different subtypes of EVs.
EV analysis can be challenging due to their small size and heterogeneity. Various techniques have been employed to characterize the cargo composition of EVs such as proteomics, transcriptomics (RNA sequencing), lipidomics, flow cytometry-based phenotypic analysis (surface markers), electron microscopy for morphological characterization and nanoscale imaging approaches like super-resolution microscopy or atomic force microscopy.
To fully understand the roles of EVs in atherosclerosis pathogenesis and exploit their potential as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets requires studies using relevant animal models that recapitulate the human disease process as well as analysis of human samples including plasma/serum derived from patients with cardiovascular diseases at different stages.
In conclusion, this review highlights the growing interest in understanding the roles of EVs in atherosclerosis pathogenesis. The diverse cargoes carried by these vesicles contribute to endothelial dysfunction, inflammation propagation within plaques promoting lesion development but also influencing systemic inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease progression post-mortem events like plaque rupture causing acute arterial occlusions leading to myocardial infarction or stroke. The ability to isolate specific populations based on surface markers expressed EVs from patients with distinct pathophysiological profiles could potentially be used as non-invasive biomarkers aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, or monitoring response to therapy. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of EVs is being explored for targeted delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents in cardiovascular medicine. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to fully understand the complex mechanisms by which EVs contribute to atherosclerosis and to develop standardized protocols for their isolation, characterization as well as new tools for their analysis across laboratories facilitating effective translation of the growing knowledge of EV biology into clinical practice. 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in pharmaceutical and interventional therapies, a subset of AF patients continues to suffer from heart failure (HF) symptoms. Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT), delivered through biventricular epicardial (BiV) pacing, has been proven to be an effective treatment for these patients by improving ventricular synchrony and cardiac output. However, conduction system pacing (CSP) has emerged as a promising alternative delivery method for CRT.
In this review, we aim to explore the role of CSP specifically in patients with AF. We first examine the mechanistic evidence for the importance of sinus rhythm (SR) in CSP. It is well-established that adjusting atrioventricular delays (AVD) plays a crucial role in optimizing electrical response during CSP. In SR, AVDs can be adjusted to ensure optimal resynchronization of atrial-ventricular contraction, leading to improved hemodynamics. However, in AF where there is irregular atrial activity and loss of organized contraction, it remains uncertain whether adjusting AVDs can provide similar benefits.
To assess the efficacy of CSP in AF patients, we evaluate the largest clinical body of evidence available - studies conducted on patients receiving CSP following atrioventricular nodal ablation (AVNA) for AF. AVNA is a commonly performed procedure where electrical access between the atria and ventricles is disrupted intentionally to control heart rate and prevent rapid ventricular response during AF episodes. This patient population provides an interesting insight into the effects of CSP on cardiac function without confounding factors such as intrinsic sinus rhythm variability.
The findings from these studies suggest that CSP may indeed be beneficial even in patients with persistent or permanent AF following AVNA. Improved symptoms and exercise capacity have been reported along with favorable echocardiographic parameters indicating improved ventricular synchrony and function. However, the evidence is limited to small observational studies with diverse patient populations and variation in methodology.
Future research needs to address the vital question of whether CSP is effective in AF patients who have not undergone AVNA. Large-scale randomized controlled trials comparing CSP with conventional BiV pacing in patients with AF could provide valuable insights. However, conducting such trials may face several challenges. Patient selection criteria need to be clearly defined as including only those who are likely to benefit from CSP, as well as ensuring adequate follow-up periods for accurate assessment of outcomes.
In conclusion, while CSP has emerged as a promising novel delivery method for CRT, its efficacy specifically in patients with AF remains an area of ongoing research. The mechanistic evidence supports the importance of SR in optimizing AVDs during CSP; however, the clinical evidence is limited and predominantly focused on post-AVNA patients. Future studies designed rigorously with clear patient selection criteria and long-term follow-up are necessary to determine the true efficacy of CSP in this population. If proven effective, CSP could offer a viable alternative for AF patients who are not suitable candidates for AVNA or have failed conventional BiV pacing therapy. Furthermore, the potential benefits of CSP in AF patients extend beyond just improving cardiac function. The presence of AF can significantly impact quality of life due to symptoms such as palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath, and exercise intolerance. These symptoms can severely limit a patient's daily activities and overall well-being. Therefore, finding an effective treatment option for AF patients that not only improves cardiac function but also alleviates symptoms is essential.
CSP may offer a unique advantage in this regard. By directly pacing the conduction system, it may have the ability to restore atrial contractility and promote more organized atrial activity even in the presence of AF. This could potentially lead to a reduction in symptoms associated with AF and an improvement in overall quality of life.
Another important aspect to consider when evaluating the role of CSP in AF patients is its safety profile. Traditional CRT delivered through BiV pacing requires lead placement on both ventricles, which carries risks such as infection or lead dislodgement. In contrast, CSP involves pacing only through the conduction system without the need for ventricular leads. This may result in fewer complications related to lead placement and reduce overall procedure-related risks.
However, despite these potential advantages of CSP in treating AF patients with heart failure, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before widespread adoption can occur. First and foremost is the need for further research specifically focused on this patient population. The current evidence base is limited primarily to small observational studies with heterogeneous patient populations.
Additionally, optimizing AVDs during CSP remains a challenge when dealing with irregular atrial activity seen in AF patients without AVNA intervention. So far there have been some proposed algorithms for adjusting AVDs based on different sensor inputs or pattern recognition techniques but further research is needed to validate their efficacy.
Furthermore there are technical limitations associated with CSP devices currently available on the market that need to be overcome before widespread use can occur in clinical practice for this specific patient population. For example, the current pacing tools may not be optimized for delivering CSP in AF patients with varying atrial activation patterns. Improvements in device programming and migration towards more personalized algorithms may better address these challenges.
In conclusion, while CSP has emerged as a promising delivery method for CRT, its efficacy specifically in patients with AF is still an area of ongoing research. While the mechanistic evidence supports the importance of sinus rhythm for optimal AVD adjustment during CSP, more robust clinical evidence is needed to determine its true efficacy and safety profile in this specific population. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary to provide definitive answers regarding the benefits of CSP compared to conventional BiV pacing specifically in AF patients. If proven effective, CSP could offer a valuable alternative treatment option for a significant portion of heart failure patients who have AF and cannot undergo or have failed AVNA or traditional BiV pacing therapy. 
The digitalization of prevention and treatment has become a significant aspect of healthcare in recent years. With the advancement of technology, it has created new opportunities and challenges in various fields, including cardiovascular disease management. Acute heart failure is a condition that poses a serious threat to life, making it imperative to explore innovative approaches that can improve its management and prevention.
Traditional collegiate therapies have been the mainstay in the treatment of acute heart failure. These therapies often involve pharmaceutical interventions, such as diuretics or vasodilators, along with lifestyle modifications like dietary changes and exercise. While these approaches have shown some efficacy in managing symptoms and improving outcomes, there is still room for improvement.
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in combining Western medicine with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for cardiovascular disease management. TCM approaches seek to address not only the physical symptoms but also the underlying imbalances that contribute to disease pathogenesis. This holistic approach offers a complementary perspective that could potentially enhance the outcomes achieved through Western medical treatments alone.
Digital healthcare technology can play a pivotal role in bridging this gap between Western medicine and TCM by providing platforms for data integration and analysis. By utilizing electronic health records (EHRs), wearable devices, telemedicine platforms, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, healthcare providers can gather comprehensive patient information from multiple sources in real-time.
This wealth of data can be used to develop personalized treatment plans that combine both Western medicine interventions and TCM principles tailored specifically to individual patients' needs. For example, AI algorithms can analyze EHRs and wearable device data to identify patterns or biomarkers associated with acute heart failure progressions or recurrences.
Moreover, digital platforms enable remote monitoring of patients with acute heart failure through telemedicine services. This remote monitoring allows healthcare professionals access to crucial patient information continuously while minimizing the need for hospital visits—promoting convenience for patients while maximizing the effectiveness of their care plans.
Additionally, telemedicine platforms can facilitate provider-to-provider communication, enabling collaboration among Western medical practitioners and TCM experts. This interdisciplinary approach promotes the exchange of knowledge and experience between healthcare professionals with different perspectives on managing acute heart failure.
The integration of digital healthcare technology in the management of acute heart failure also presents opportunities for patient education and self-management. Mobile applications can provide patients with resources, such as personalized dietary recommendations or exercise plans, based on both Western medicine guidelines and TCM principles.
Furthermore, these applications may offer features like medication reminders or symptom trackers to help patients actively participate in their treatment plans. By empowering patients with knowledge and tools for self-management, they become partners in their care process—leading to more favorable health outcomes.
In conclusion, the digitalization of prevention and treatment has the potential to revolutionize the management of acute heart failure by combining Western medicine approaches with traditional Chinese medicine principles. The integration of digital healthcare technology enables comprehensive data collection, personalized treatment planning, remote monitoring, interdisciplinary collaboration between healthcare providers. It also facilitates patient education and self-management—a holistic approach that offers promising prospects for maintaining cardiovascular health in population-wide settings. While challenges such as data security or interoperability remain necessary considerations during this transition phase towards digitized healthcare systems—continuous efforts will undoubtedly drive advancements in this field—benefiting patients worldwide. 
Cancer is a complex and multifactorial disease characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation and invasion. Metabolic reprogramming, which refers to the alteration of cellular metabolism to support the energy demand of rapidly dividing cancer cells, has emerged as a hallmark of tumorigenesis. Among the three major substances involved in metabolism, lipids have shown significant implications in cancer development.
Abnormal lipid metabolism has been associated with various diseases, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The prevalence of abnormal lipid metabolism is steadily increasing worldwide, due in part to sedentary lifestyles and diets rich in saturated fats and sugars. Lipids are not only an essential energy source for cell growth but also play important roles in signal transduction pathways that control various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis.
The dysregulation of lipid metabolism has been demonstrated to contribute to tumor initiation and progression through different mechanisms. For instance, altered cholesterol homeostasis has been linked to increased cell membrane rigidity and aberrant signaling pathway activation in cancer cells. Abnormalities in triglyceride metabolism have also been implicated in promoting tumor growth through enhanced fatty acid synthesis for energy production.
Sphingolipids represent another class of lipids that have gained attention due to their involvement in multiple cellular processes such as apoptosis regulation and intracellular signaling cascades. Dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism has been observed in several cancers including breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.
Lipid rafts are specialized microdomains within cell membranes enriched with cholesterol and sphingolipids that serve as platforms for assembling specific proteins involved in signal transduction events. Alterations in lipid raft composition or function can impact oncogenic signaling pathways by affecting protein-protein interactions or receptor trafficking within these microdomains.
Adipocytes play a crucial role not only as energy reservoirs but also as active participants within the tumor microenvironment. Adipose tissue secretes various signaling molecules, collectively known as adipokines, that can influence cancer cell behavior and tumor angiogenesis. Additionally, the interaction between cancer cells and adipocytes can promote a pro-inflammatory state which further promotes tumor growth and metastasis.
Lipid droplets are dynamic cytoplasmic organelles that store neutral lipids such as triglycerides and cholesterol esters. Growing evidence suggests that lipid droplets play a critical role in cancer cell survival by providing energy-rich substrates for oxidative metabolism during periods of nutrient deprivation or hypoxia.
The dysregulation of lipid metabolism in cancer cells has clinical implications, particularly with regards to drug resistance. Several studies have shown that altered lipid metabolism can confer resistance to chemotherapy drugs by promoting efflux mechanisms or altering drug pharmacokinetics within the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, targeting key enzymes or signaling pathways involved in aberrant lipid metabolism may provide new avenues for overcoming drug resistance.
Current research in this field has yielded promising results but there are still limitations to be addressed. Firstly, the understanding of the metabolic heterogeneity among different tumor types is limited and there is a need for more comprehensive characterization of specific lipid metabolic profiles associated with each type of cancer. Moreover, there is a lack of clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of targeting specific lipid metabolic pathways as potential therapeutic interventions.
In conclusion, abnormal lipid metabolism plays a significant role in tumorigenesis through its influence on various cellular processes involved in cancer initiation and progression. Understanding the intricate relationship between lipids and tumors may provide new directions for developing targeted therapies aimed at disrupting aberrant lipid metabolic pathways. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulated lipid metabolism in different cancers while also exploring novel therapeutic strategies to improve treatment outcomes and patient survival prognosis. 
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels and associated with various clinical symptoms. It is a major health concern worldwide, affecting millions of people. The current standard treatment for T2D includes lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and physical exercise, along with medication therapy. Metformin, an oral antidiabetic drug, is commonly used as the first-line treatment for T2D due to its effectiveness in reducing blood glucose levels.
Jinlida granules are a traditional Chinese medicine formulation that has been used for many years in the management of T2D. Previous studies have shown that Jinlida granules can significantly reduce blood glucose levels when used alone or in combination with metformin. Furthermore, it has been found that Jinlida granules enhance the low-glucose action of metformin. However, there is limited research on the role of Jinlida granules in improving the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and relieving clinical symptoms in T2D patients.
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Jinlida granules in improving the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and relieving clinical symptoms based on secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. The trial included 192 T2D patients who were randomly assigned to receive either Jinlida or a placebo for 12 weeks.
The primary outcome measure was the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose defined as HbA1c < 6.5% and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2hPG) < 10 mmol/L or <11.1 mmol/L depending on guidelines. Secondary outcome measures included symptom disappearance rate, symptom improvement rate, efficacy of single symptoms, and total symptom score.
After 12 weeks of intervention, compared to the control group receiving placebo, the group receiving Jinlida showed statistically significant differences in achieving the standard-reaching rate of HbA1c < 6.5% and 2hPG levels as mentioned above. However, there were no significant differences in achieving the standard-reaching rate of HbA1c < 7% and fasting blood glucose (FBG) < 7.0 mmol/L between the two groups.
In terms of clinical symptoms, five symptoms (thirst, fatigue, increased eating with rapid hungering, polyuria, dry mouth) exhibited a significant difference in symptom disappearance rate between the Jinlida group and control group. All symptoms showed a significant difference in symptom improvement rate.
The analysis also revealed that there was a statistically significant improvement in total symptom score from baseline to week 12 for patients receiving Jinlida compared to those receiving placebo. This suggests that Jinlida granules can effectively improve multiple clinical symptoms associated with T2D.
It is important to note that this study did not find any significant correlation between symptom improvement and changes in HbA1c levels after 12 weeks of intervention with Jinlida granules or placebo. This suggests that the improvement in clinical symptoms may be independent of blood glucose control mediated by HbA1c levels.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that Jinlida granules can effectively improve the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and relieve clinical symptoms associated with T2D. The improvements were observed for various symptoms including thirst, fatigue, increased eating with rapid hungering, polyuria, dry mouth, spontaneous sweating, night sweat,vexing heat in the chest,palms,and soles,constipation indicating its potential as an adjuvant treatment for T2D patients experiencing these specific symptoms.Therefore,Jinlida granules can be considered as an effective complementary therapy option for T2D patients who present such clinical manifestations.
Overall,this study provides valuable insights into the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine interventions like Jinlida granules in the management of T2D and its associated symptoms. Further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms underlying these effects and evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Jinlida granules in a larger population. 
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. It is a major global health problem with significant mortality and morbidity rates. Pancreatic islets, composed of various endocrine cells including β-cells that secrete insulin, play a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in the body.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently gained attention as important mediators of intercellular communication. EVs are small membranous structures released by cells into the extracellular environment. They contain various bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that can be transferred to recipient cells to influence their function. EVs are involved in numerous physiological processes and disease conditions.
The intercellular communication mediated by EVs within pancreatic islets is critical for proper regulation of insulin secretion from β-cells. In response to changes in blood glucose levels, β-cells release EVs containing specific cargo molecules involved in signaling pathways that regulate insulin production and secretion. These EVs can communicate with neighboring β-cells as well as other cell types within the pancreatic islet microenvironment to coordinate the overall response.
Furthermore, EV-mediated crosstalk between pancreatic islets and peripheral insulin target tissues also plays a vital role in maintaining glucose homeostasis under normal physiological conditions. For instance, muscle and adipose tissue receive signals from pancreatic islet-derived EVs that enhance their sensitivity to insulin or increase glucose uptake.
In the context of DM, dysregulation of EV-mediated intercellular communication within pancreatic islets contributes to pathological changes associated with the disease. Autoimmune responses against β-cell antigens result in destruction of pancreatic islets through inflammatory processes involving immune cell-derived EVs carrying pro-inflammatory molecules or autoantigens.
Insulin resistance observed in type 2 DM involves impaired signaling between pancreatic islet-derived EVs and peripheral insulin target tissues. The cargo molecules within EVs released from β-cells fail to effectively promote insulin sensitivity, contributing to reduced glucose uptake and increased blood glucose levels.
In addition to their role as mediators of intercellular communication, EVs also have the potential to serve as biomarkers for DM. The composition and quantity of EVs released from pancreatic islets can reflect the physiological status of β-cells or indicate disease progression. Analysis of circulating EV populations enables non-invasive assessment of pancreatic islet health.
Moreover, therapeutic applications of EVs in DM are under investigation. Pancreatic islet-derived EVs can be engineered to deliver specific therapeutic cargos such as anti-inflammatory molecules or growth factors that enhance β-cell survival and function. These engineered EVs may hold promise for improving diabetes treatment outcomes.
In conclusion, understanding the role of EV-mediated intercellular and interorgan communication within pancreatic islets is crucial for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying both physiological homeostasis maintenance and pathological changes associated with DM. Investigating the composition, function, and regulatory mechanisms of these vesicles will provide valuable insights into developing novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for DM management.
Further research efforts focusing on the involvement of EV-mediated signaling in diabetes pathogenesis will contribute towards a greater understanding of this complex disease and potentially lead to innovative approaches for its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. 
Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent and debilitating condition that affects both men and women, but there may be sex differences in the cardiovascular outcomes of treatment with sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is). SGLT-2is have shown efficacy in reducing the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for HF in RCTs. However, a recent meta-analysis indicated that women with diabetes may experience less reduction in primary composite outcomes compared to men when treated with SGLT-2is.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to explore potential sex differences in primary composite outcomes among patients with HF treated with SGLT-2is. We systematically searched the medical database from 2017 to 2022 for RCTs using SGLT-2is with specified cardiovascular outcomes. The PRISMA method was utilized to screen for eligibility, and the quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We pooled the hazard ratio (HR) of primary composite outcomes in both sexes, performed a meta-analysis, and calculated the odds ratio (OR) of these outcomes based on sex.
A total of five RCTs involving 21,947 patients were included in our analysis, with 35.7% being female patients. Our findings demonstrated that both males and females taking SGLT-2is had significantly lower primary composite outcomes compared to those taking placebo (males - HR 0.77; p = 0.00001; females - HR 0.75; p =0 .00001). However, when examining pooled data from four RCTs involving 20,725 participants separately by sex, we observed a greater occurrence of primary composite outcomes among females compared to males (OR 1.32; p =0 .0002).
These results suggest that while SGLT-2is reduce the risk of primary composite outcomes in both sexes, the benefits may be less pronounced in women. The reasons for this disparity are not yet fully understood and require further investigation. It is possible that hormonal, physiological, or genetic factors could play a role in influencing the response to SGLT-2is and subsequent cardiovascular outcomes. Furthermore, differences in baseline characteristics between males and females such as age, comorbidities, or medication regimens may also contribute to divergent treatment effects.
Understanding these sex differences is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving outcomes for all patients with HF. Subgroup analyses based on sex are valuable tools in identifying potential disparities and tailoring interventions accordingly. Future research should explore the underlying mechanisms behind these observed differences to inform more personalized approaches to therapy.
In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that SGLT-2is reduce the risk of primary composite outcomes in both male and female patients with HF; however, women may experience less pronounced benefits compared to men. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the reasons behind these sex differences and develop targeted interventions that address any identified disparities. Ultimately, improving cardiovascular outcomes for all patients with HF remains a paramount goal of clinical practice and research endeavors.
 Additionally, it's worth noting that sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes have been observed in various other medication classes and disease conditions. These differences highlight the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in clinical trial design, analysis, and reporting.
Several potential mechanisms could contribute to the observed disparities in primary composite outcomes between men and women treated with SGLT-2is. One possibility is that hormonal factors may influence the response to treatment. Estrogen, for example, has known cardioprotective effects and may play a role in modulating the therapeutic effects of SGLT-2is. Further investigation into the interaction between hormonal status and SGLT-2i therapy could provide valuable insights into these sex differences.
Physiological differences between men and women could also contribute to varying treatment responses. For instance, there are known anatomical and functional variations in cardiac structure between sexes that may affect how individuals respond to interventions targeting heart failure. Additionally, differences in body composition (such as higher adiposity levels in women) or metabolic pathways could impact drug metabolism and efficacy.
Genetic factors might also play a role in mediating sex-specific responses to SGLT-2i therapy. Variations in genes involved in glucose metabolism or drug transporters/receptors may underlie some of these observed discrepancies. Exploring pharmacogenomic profiles among individuals receiving SGLT-2is could help identify genetic determinants associated with sex-specific treatment responses.
Furthermore, baseline characteristics such as age, comorbidities, or concomitant medications might interact differently with SGLT-2i therapy based on sex. It is possible that differing clinical profiles or prevalent conditions (such as diabetes) among male and female participants influenced their response to treatment with SGLT-2is.
To fully understand these complex relationships, future studies should consider conducting large-scale trials specifically powered for exploring sex differences within HF populations receiving SGLT-2i therapy. Such trials should include detailed assessment of hormonal, physiological, and genetic factors, as well as rigorous monitoring of concomitant medications and comorbidities.
Clinicians should be aware of these sex differences when prescribing SGLT-2is to patients with heart failure. Individualized treatment approaches that consider patient sex, along with other relevant clinical factors, may help optimize outcomes. Additionally, ongoing monitoring and evaluation of treatment responses in both men and women can inform adjustments to therapy if needed.
In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence for potential sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes among patients with heart failure treated with SGLT-2is. While the overall benefits in reducing primary composite outcomes are observed in both sexes, the magnitude of these benefits appears to be less pronounced in women. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these disparities and ultimately improve the care provided to all patients with heart failure. By considering sex as a biological variable in future clinical trials and incorporating personalized approaches into clinical practice, we can strive towards achieving equitable cardiovascular outcomes for all individuals affected by heart failure.
