Being fluent in more than one foreign language has become a major educational goal in Europe [REF]. However, teaching foreign languages in conjunction with English as a global foreign language seems to pose a challenge, since the simultaneous learning of English is believed to lead to negative interferences with students’ motivation to learn other languages [REF]. This appears to be a general European phenomenon [REF], as cross-sectional research from several countries has repeatedly shown that students usually report lower value beliefs and motivation to learn languages other than English [REF]. Still less is known about longitudinal relations between students’ motivation for several languages. Moreover, the motivational development might not be the same for all students. Previous studies indicate systematic individual differences in students’ motivational beliefs depending, for instance, on their gender, language background [REF], or experience with learning several languages at home [REF]. In order to expand previous research on language motivation, the present study focuses on upper secondary students’ academic language learning in Switzerland, a historically multilingual country. This context provides a unique opportunity to understand how students’ prior linguistic knowledge (e.g., growing up with more than one home language) may be related to their motivation to learn several languages. To explore the longitudinal relationship between students’ motivation for several languages in more depth, this study draws on the concept of value beliefs, which refer to the value students attribute to doing a certain task or activity [REF] and are particularly important for predicting students’ language learning motivation [REF]. First, we investigate the longitudinal relations between Swiss German students’ value beliefs in English (a foreign language), French (a foreign but national language), and German (the native language, as data were obtained in German-speaking Switzerland) from Grades 9 to 11. Second, we explore potential relations between students’ development of value beliefs in the three language subjects and their linguistic background (monolingual vs. multilingual).  Understanding students’ motivation for learning new languages has been a concern of teachers and researchers in psychology and applied linguistics for more than five decades [REF]. The most common motivation models used are the socioeducational model [REF], self-determination theory [REF], the second language (L2) motivational self-system [REF], and expectancy-value theory [REF]. These models have distinct characteristics in describing language motivation but they all share some commonalities, in that they usually differentiate between motivational beliefs arising from within individuals or being influenced from outside (e.g., by parents). For instance, EVT posits that students’ value beliefs (beliefs about the value of engaging in a task) can predict how they will learn [REF]. Some of these value beliefs, such as the intrinsic value (pertaining to personal interest or enjoyment) or the attainment value (pertaining to the personal importance of doing well), share some intrinsic aspects, which are generally argued to be particularly important in language learning [REF]. If students see the value in an activity, they are more likely to engage in learning and to use effective learning strategies [REF]. L2 studies that have included EVT-type constructs indicate that students’ value beliefs play a positive role for their persistence and intention to continue learning a new language [REF] as well as for their achievement [REF]. Regarding the development of value beliefs over time, a large body of EVT-based work has documented an average decline in students’ value beliefs across academic domains, especially throughout late childhood and adolescence [REF]. Moreover, some studies were able to show that longitudinal relations between value facets (e.g., intrinsic and attainment value) differ between academic subjects [REF]. Nonetheless, it is still an understudied issue in educational research whether and how certain value beliefs may also interact with each other over time and across several language subjects.
