Sea cucumbers, or Holothurians, are marine invertebrates belonging to the class Holothuroidea in Phylum: Echinodermata, inhabit various environments from shallow coastal waters to deep sea. Sea cucumbers perform several significant ecological functions, as efficient ecosystem engineers by deposit feeding habit reduce organic waste, constantly rework the sediments and facilitate bioturbation [REF]. Sea cucumbers are dried, processed, and sold as a product known as “Beche- de- mer” or “Trepang”, an expensive Chinese delicacy with growing demand [REF]. Globally, sea cucumber wild stocks have declined at alarming rates due to overfishing and poor management policies [REF]. However, aquaculture techniques are well established for commercial species such as Holothuria scabra [REF], which could potentially assist in recovering depleted population and trade in many parts of the world.Research on sea cucumbers of the Arabian Peninsula (AP) and Iran is scant and sporadic. Hence, a detailed and comprehensive review of the studies conducted in this region is warranted. Habitat diversity and prevailing extreme environmental conditions likely drive sea cucumber diversity in this region; however, such correlations remain poorly studied. In this review we focus on the aspects of historical and current research trends in sea cucumbers of the AP (which includes the following countries: Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and Yemen) and Iran and their marginal seas (Arabian/Persian Gulf (APG), Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Red Sea), to identify gaps in research and provide recommendations to address future research priorities.The AP is surrounded by marginal seas including the APG to the east, Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea to the south, and the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea to the west. The APG is a young (<6000 years), shallow sea (average depth 30–60 m), connected to the Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean by the Strait of Hormuz [REF]. The APG has a wide range of sea surface temperature (SST; 12 ○C to > 35 ○C) as well as highly variable salinity levels (>42 to >50 ppt) [REF]. The environmental extremes of the APG influences its relatively impoverished species richness and density of this water body [REF]. Over 200 species of macroalgae and four species of seagrass (Halodule uninervis, Syringodium istaefolium, Halophila ovalis, and Halophila stipulacea) in the APG serve as nursery grounds for several species of invertebrates and vertebrates [REF]. Resilient Corals (40 hard coral and 38 soft coral species) and coral reefs thrive in these extreme conditions [REF]. However, climate change-induced recurrent bleaching events have led to reef degradation [REF]. Furthermore, rapid coastal development in the AP threatens its biodiversity [REF].The Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, which surrounds Oman, consists of deep ocean waters with variable climatic conditions. The southwest summer monsoon triggers upwelling along the coast, which results in movement of the cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface and subsequent increase in primary productivity [REF]. Rich coral reefs and extensive sandy beaches occur along the Omani coast [REF]. In this region, mangrove forests, coral reefs, seagrass, and seaweed communities harbour rich biota [REF]. During the summer, upwelling leads to low temperature creating a dispersal barrier for the benthic fauna known as a “pseudo-high latitude effect” [REF].The Red Sea is also a relatively young sea, extending > 2000 km between the AP and Africa. With an average depth of 500 m, the Red Sea is warm and features relatively elevated salinity levels due to high evaporation rates. Mesoscale eddies play a crucial role in distributing nutrients in the oligotrophic environment of Red Sea [REF]. The world’s most productive and biodiverse tropical biotopes including mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs occur in the Red Sea [REF]. The coral reefs of the Red Sea accounts for 3.8% of the world’s reefs, and are rich in diversity of associated fauna (2710 species) with a high degree of endemism [REF]. The rich biodiversity of the Red Sea reefs attracts tourists for diving generating massive income and creating opportunities for tourism-based coastal development (e.g., beach resorts). However, such activities pose a serious threat to the biodiversity and functionality of this fragile ecosystem [REF].
