is the expansion of the NPC standing committee from seven to nine members . " The new leadership team will increasingly need to practice consensus building amongst themselves " , says Julien Lippmann from Credit Suisse Equity Research . Jiang Zemin 's " Three Representations " theory has also been enshrined in party doctrine . The party now represents " advanced production forces " , the " advanced culture " and the bulk of the population , in addition to peasants and the working class . In this way , the party aims to strengthen its power base amongst the population . This is a quantum leap that throws out the classical concept of the enemy - capitalists and intellectuals . " Furthermore , managers at state-owned enterprises now have the chance to join the party and will have a say in party politics " , explains analyst Julien Lippmann . There is still a lot of work to be done in the area of civil rights , however . The economic situation has improved tremendously . In addition to joining the WTO , the NPC and it 's standing committee have revised patent , copyright and trademark laws . " Chinese citizens can now acquire the right to own land " says Julien Lippmann . In the past , the Chinese could buy property but could only rent the land for 50 to 70 years . " This represents a milestone . Private property will have better protection under the law . " Although the communist regime continues to hold power , the People 's Republic of China is increasingly developing into a market economy . Reforms can only be tackled gradually . " The top priority of the government is currently social stability " , explains Julien Lippmann . Before allowing China 's economy to open , the government guaranteed a job for each citizen . Today unemployment is a major problem : state-owned enterprises are heavily indebted and the government is trying to bolster private enterprise to create new jobs . From December selected institutions will be able to invest in A-shares traded in yuan in Shanghai and Shenzhen . " Up to now , foreign investors were only allowed to invest in less liquid B-shares or in the H-shares and red chips listed on the Hong Kong exchange " , says Julien Lippmann . Only Chinese investors were able to invest in A-shares . " By opening the A-market , the authorities want to attract more foreign direct investment and stimulate stagnating local stock markets . " Credit Suisse analysts do not expect a rush of foreign interest , however , due to repatriation problems and expensive valuations for A-shares . Credit Suisse therefore continues to focus on selected stocks among the more favorably priced H-shares and red chips . Just how long can China continue to open up its economy without having to introduce political reform ? " Credit Suisse will maintain its neutral marketing rating until more details of political reforms emerge and the ministerial posts are filled " , says Julien Lippmann .
