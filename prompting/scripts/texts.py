cnn_news = "A 25-year-old Florida man intended to use explosives and weapons 'to create mayhem' in Tampa -- a plot that authorities say was foiled thanks to the local Muslim community and law enforcement -- a U.S. attorney said Monday. 'When a person's got an AK-47 which he believes is operable, when he has explosives which he believes are real, and when he has an explosive pack and a car bomb which ... he is going to utilize against Americans, that makes it a crime,' Robert O'Neill, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida, told reporters. 'Was it real? It was very real.' O'Neill spoke Monday in Tampa after an afternoon hearing for Sami Osmakac on one count of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. The 25-year-old naturalized American born in Kosovo planned a car bombing that would be followed by hostage-taking and the explosion of a suicide belt he planned to wear, according to a criminal complaint made public Monday. 'We all have to die, so why not die the Islamic way?' Osmakac allegedly told an undercover FBI employee, according to the complaint. Osmakac said in a martyrdom video message recorded shortly before his arrest Saturday night that he wanted  ''pay back' for wrongs he felt were done to Muslims, ' the complaint said. O'Neill said that, through the local Muslim community,  'we were able to know that this person had this ideology and wanted to commit a crime. ' Steve Ibison, who heads the FBI's Tampa office, called assistance from members of the Muslim community  'very significant ' throughout the investigation.  'This case is not about the Muslim religion, and it's not about the Muslim community, ' Ibison said.  'It's about an individual who committed a crime. ' Two law enforcement officials, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk about the probe, said the suspect does not appear to have any ties to al Qaeda, and early information indicated he was  'self-radicalized. '  'I don't have any indication anyone else was involved in the plot and pushing this, ' one official said.  'There is no indication he was acting at the control or direction of al Qaeda, ' a second official said. The federal investigation of Osmakac began in September when a  'confidential human source ' told the FBI that Osmakac, a resident of Pinellas Park, Florida,  'asked for al Qaeda flags, ' the complaint said. By November, the suspect was discussing potential terror targets in Tampa and asked for the confidential source's help in getting guns and explosives for the attacks, the complaint said. The government's source introduced Osmakac to an undercover FBI employee, which led to a December 21 meeting during which the suspect said  'he wished to acquire an AK-47-style machine gun, Uzi submachine guns, high capacity magazines, grenades and an explosive belt, ' the complaint said.  He later allegedly gave the FBI employee a $500 down payment for the weapons, according to the document.  'The explosives and firearms that he allegedly sought and attempted to use were rendered inoperable by law enforcement and posed no threat to the public, ' the government said. Osmakac outlined his plans during a New Year's Day meeting with the undercover FBI employee, it said.  His alleged bomb targets were  'night clubs in the Ybor City area of Tampa, the operations center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office in Ybor City and a business in the South Tampa area, ' the government said. By Saturday night, however, his primary target was an Irish bar in south Tampa, according to one of the law enforcement officials who spoke to CNN. Osmakac was looking for places where there would be large crowds, the official said. After the car bombing, he planned to retrieve guns and explosives stashed in a Tampa hotel room so he could begin the second phase of his attacks, the complaint said. He told the FBI employee that  'he wanted to use the explosive belt to 'get in somewhere where there's a lot of people' and take hostages, ' the complaint said.  He would then demand that the FBI  'release some prisoners, ' it said.  'Once I have this ... they can take me in five million pieces, ' he allegedly said,  'an apparent reference to the explosive belt that would be attached to his waist, ' according to the government. FBI agents arrested Osmakac on Saturday night, just after he made the video explaining his motives, the complaint said.  'We arrested him when the attack was imminent, ' O'Neill said. The U.S. attorney acknowledged that there might have been significant bloodshed were it not for the tips from local Muslims and the work of law enforcement.  'There was no real danger to the community once we got involved, because we knew we could handle the situation, ' O'Neill said."

e3c_clinical_case = "A 21 year old female patient with the diagnosis of SWS suffering from headaches admitted to our clinic. She had a 2 year history of frequent non-pulsating headaches. Her headache was relieving with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was not worsening with physical activity. There was no nausea or aura like symptoms accompanying the headache. Headaches were lasting for hours. The pain was bilateral, generalized and pressing in quality. The family history for headache was negative. She had a history of seizures occurring in the fifteenth day of life described as attacks of tonic clonic contractions and that's when she was diagnosed with SWS. At the age of 6 she had a history of callosotomy to control her seizures. At the age of 18 during a laser treatment done in order to get rid of her port wine birthmark she had her first seizure since callosotomy. After that she was prescribed carbamazepine 400 mg at daily dose and never had a seizure since then. According to the story taken from her parents even though she had a normal development at infancy she barely graduated from elementary school and she's hardly literate. There was nothing significant on her family history except for her elder sister's port wine stain on her face. The elder sister had no feature of SWS and no researches were done regarding her stain. She was inscribed daily doses of ketiapin 25 mg for anxiety disorder and venlafaxine 75 mg for both anxiety disorder and the chronic headaches. She was also inscribed NSAID drugs. After the first week of this treatment her headaches were slightly decreased by heaviness but the frequency was the same. At her physical examination a facial nevus -occurred due to choroid angioma-on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing and the cheek was observed. Intra oral examination showed a right sided overgrowth of gingiva. Gingival overgrowth was bright red in color and showed blanching on applying pressure suggesting angiomatous enlargement. On her extremities a mild asymmetry was visible. Her left arm and leg was slightly smaller in portions and showed hemiparesis both in the upper and lower extremities of the same size. On her ophthalmological evaluation she was diagnosed with glaucoma of the right eye. On her psychiatric examination she showed signs of anxiety disorder. Her neurological examination was not remarkable except for her hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on right hemisphere also with the diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI shows right calvarial thickness compared to the left and right hemisphere is asymmetrically smaller than the left. In addition to that, T2 weighted MRI shows extensive venous formations around corpus of right lateral ventricle and at Gallen vein localization and widespread vascular formations are seen at perivascular space, anterior to third ventricle at Willis polygon localization and at right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern localization. She was performed a proteus intelligence test in which she had 75 points and accepted as mildly mentally retarded.

ggponc = "#Adulte Weichgewebesarkome ##Postoperative Strahlentherapie (Extremitäten, Körperstamm, nicht retroperitoneal) In randomisierten Studien, in denen ganz überwiegend R0 (86 %) resezierte Weichgewebesarkome behandelt wurden, konnten Yang et al. [REF] für die adjuvante perkutane Strahlentherapie (45 Gy/1,8 Gy Einzeldosis + 18 Gy/1,8 Gy Einzeldosis Boost) und Pisters et al. [REF] für die adjuvante Brachytherapie (45 Gy low dose rate) zeigen, dass sich die lokale Rückfallrate durch die Strahlentherapie hochsignifikant senken lässt. In der letzteren Studie betrug bei Patienten mit G2/G3 Sarkomen die lokale Kontrollrate mit Brachytherapie 89 % gegenüber 66 % ohne Brachytherapie (p=0,0025). Die Bestrahlung war allerdings ohne Einfluss bei G1 Sarkomen (p=0,49) [REF]. Weitere randomisierte Studien mit dieser Fragestellung wurden nicht durchgeführt. Analysen aus großen prospektiven Datenbanken haben den deutlichen Effekt der adjuvanten Strahlentherapie auf die lokale Rückfallrate bestätigt [REF]. Lediglich bei kleinen (T1), im Subkutangewebe liegenden Tumoren mit niedriger Malignität, die weit im Gesunden reseziert wurden, konnte keine signifikante Verbesserung der lokalen Tumorkontrolle festgestellt werden. In einer Metaanalyse mit 3.155 Patienten überwiegend aus Kohortenanalysen (nur 4,5 % randomisiert) konnten Albertsmeier et al. [REF] zeigen, dass die adjuvante Strahlentherapie) die lokale Rückfallrate halbiert (Odds Ratio 0,49 [95 % CI 0,31–0,77]). Ein statistisch signifikanter Überlebensvorteil konnte in den randomisierten Studien nicht nachgewiesen werden. Die Fallzahlen in den Studien waren zum Nachweis eines Überlebensvorteils aber auch zu klein. Auch in den großen Datenbanken und deren Metaanalyse [REF] ergab sich kein statistisch signifikanter Überlebensvorteil. Eine mögliche Ursache für den fehlenden Überlebensvorteil, trotz deutlich verbesserter lokaler Tumorkontrolle, könnte der sogenannte „prescription bias“ sein, d.h. die Tendenz in nicht randomisierten Vergleichen die Strahlentherapie bei Patienten mit hohem Rückfallrisiko häufiger einzusetzen. Qu et al. [REF] haben die verfügbaren Studien nach dem „risk of bias“ stratifiziert, indem sie aus den Raten der R1-Resektionen und der G3-Tumoren in den Therapiearmen im Vergleich zu den Kontrollarmen der Untersuchungen den „risk of bias“ quantifiziert haben. Insgesamt wurden 5 Studien mit verfügbaren Hazard Ratios und einem sehr geringen „risk of bias“ (0,9–1,1) identifiziert. Für diese Studien mit geringem Bias (n = 2.294) ergab sich ein signifikanter Überlebensvorteil zu Gunsten der adjuvanten Strahlentherapie (Hazard Ratio 0,65 [95 % CI 0,52–0,82], p < 0,001). Im Falle einer R1-Resektion ist die Lokalrezidivrate nach adjuvanter Strahlentherapie ungefähr um den Faktor 2-3 gegenüber einer R0-Resektion erhöht, verbunden mit einem schlechteren Gesamtüberleben [REF]. Bei vorhersehbarer R1-Resektion sind daher neoadjuvante Behandlungskonzepte interdisziplinär zu diskutieren. Eine Nachresektion wird als sinnvoll angesehen, sofern diese chirurgisch mit vertretbarer Morbidität möglich ist. Ist eine Nachresektion nur unter Inkaufnahme einer deutlichen Funktionseinbuße möglich, z. B. einer Amputation, sollten Risiko und Nutzen gegeneinander abgewogen werden. Nach R1-Resektionen im Bereich der Extremitäten werden lokale Rückfallraten zwischen 15 % – 35 % berichtet, trotz additiver Strahlentherapie. DeLaney et al. [REF] konnten in einer retrospektiven Auswertung zeigen, dass Strahlendosen von > 64 Gy nach R1-Resektion die lokale Rückfallrate von 29 % auf 13 % (p < 0,01) reduzieren. Einen Sonderfall stellt die Subgruppe der atypischen lipomatösen Tumoren (G1 Liposarkom) dar. Die French Sarcoma Group (FSG) analysierte retrospektiv 283 Patienten von denen 132 eine adjuvante Strahlentherapie erhalten hatten [REF]. Bei Lokalisation der Entität an den Extremitäten konnte eine adjuvante Strahlentherapie nach R0-Resektion die Lokalrezidivrate nicht signifikant verringern (HR 1). Nach marginaler Resektion reduzierte die additive Strahlentherapie die lokale Rückfallrate dagegen signifikant (HR 6,49 (1,89–22,25), p<0,003). Für die Lokalisation am Körperstamm war das Kollektiv zu klein (n=25), um eine valide Aussage zu machen. Das Zeitintervall zwischen der Resektion und dem Beginn der postoperativen Strahlentherapie lag bei der Majorität der in den Studien und Datenbanken registrierten Patienten zwischen 3 Wochen und 2 Monaten. Da residuelle Tumorzellen postoperativ weiter proliferieren können, ist ein zeitnaher Beginn der postoperativen Strahlentherapie anzustreben. Allerdings sollte die Wundheilung weitestgehend abgeschlossen sein, so dass die Bestrahlung frühestens 3 Wochen nach der Operation beginnen kann. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Tumorentitäten wie z. B. beim Mammakarzinom [REF] und bei Kopf-Hals-Tumoren [REF], ist der negative Effekte eines langen Intervalls zwischen Chirurgie und Beginn der Strahlentherapie wissenschaftlich nicht gut belegt. Das liegt vor allem daran, dass dieser Zusammenhang bisher nur in kleinen Kollektiven [REF],  [REF],  [REF] untersucht wurde, in denen nur wenige Patienten ein langes Intervall zwischen Operation und Strahlentherapie aufwiesen. Angesichts der eindeutigen Daten bei anderen Tumorentitäten und in Abwesenheit eines plausiblen Grundes, warum residuelle Zellen von Weichgewebesarkomen nicht postoperativ proliferieren sollten, wird ein zeitnaher Beginn der Strahlentherapie möglichst innerhalb von 6 Wochen nach Resektion empfohlen. Die adjuvante Brachytherapie wurde in der randomisierten Studie von Pisters et al. [REF] 5 Tage nach der Chirurgie begonnen. Ein früherer Beginn war mit einer erhöhten akuten Komplikationsrate verbunden."

             "This article reviews current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs).Arteriovenous (AV) access allows patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to receive hemodialysis. Thrombosis of AV access can lead to delay in hemodialysis or abandonment of access requiring dialysis catheter placement. Endovascular approach has become the preferred treatment option for thrombosed access over surgery. Interventions include removal of thrombus from the AV circuit and treatment of the underlying anatomical abnormality, such as an anastomotic stenosis. Thrombolysis, or the act of dissolving thrombus, is performed by using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices for the administration of fibrinolytic agents. Thrombectomy, or the mechanical removal of thrombus, is performed by using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms. Adjunctive methods such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement are also used to treat stenoses in the AV circuit. Complications of these procedures include vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain.This narrative review article was written based on literature search from electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar.The understanding of thrombectomy techniques and their potential complications is essential in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access.", 
             "The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide and contributing to the global burden of disease. Hemodialysis is the most common renal replacement modality for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Compared to central venous catheters, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) are the preferred access for chronic hemodialysis treatment due to lower hospitalization risk and mortality [REF]. Poorer outcomes in catheter-dependent patients are associated with increased risk of sepsis and bacteremia [REF]. However, long-term vascular accesses typically require frequent interventions to maintain access patency, which is not only a significant burden on health care resources, but also impacts patients’ quality of life with implications on morbidity and mortality.Thrombosis is the leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG, accounting for 65–85% of the cases [REF]. Thrombosis rate for AVF is 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days [REF], and AVG thrombosis occurs 0.2 events per patient during 2 years follow-up [REF]. Access thrombosis is commonly caused by underlying venous or arterial anastomotic stenoses. Systemic factors that can increase the risk of access thrombosis include hypercoagulability [REF], low ejection fraction [REF], hypotension and hemoconcentration [REF]. Cannulation complications resulting in hematomas can also lead to access thrombosis [REF].Thrombosed access leads to hemodialysis treatment delays, treatment omissions, inpatient admissions and abandonment of access requiring dialysis catheter placement [REF]. Thrombus formed in arteriovenous (AV) access is comprised of two components: soft, friable clot that disintegrates easily in the venous outflow and a firm fibrin plug near the anastomosis [REF]. To date, no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies can prevent access thrombosis. The long-term effect of anti-platelet therapy and warfarin on access patency remains unclear [REF]. Thrombosed access should be treated as soon as possible to avoid delay on dialysis treatment and catheter placement. When fresh thrombus hardens into adherent thrombus in the native vein of an AVF, thrombectomy becomes less likely to be successful [REF]. As a result, thrombectomy in AVF should be performed within days, whereas thrombectomy in AVG can still be successful up to a week. Early experiences with thrombosed AV access required surgical thrombectomy, which usually requires hospitalization and operation room resources. However, with the development of intravascular techniques, endovascular thrombectomy has become the standard of care for thrombosed access. Under imaging guidance, not only can the thrombus be removed, underlying anatomical abnormalities (such as stenoses) can also be treated. As reported by prior studies, procedure success rates for thrombosed fistula or graft by endovascular approach have a range of 70–90% [REF]. Compared to 20 years ago, the number of endovascular access thrombectomy procedure has doubled for AVF and tripled for AVG [REF]. This article aims to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs.
