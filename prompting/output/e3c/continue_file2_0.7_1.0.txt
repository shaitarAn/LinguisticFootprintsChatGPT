On examination, the patient appeared pale and fatigued. She had a distended abdomen with tenderness in the epigastric region. There were no palpable masses or organomegaly. Her vital signs were within normal limits, and her blood pressure was slightly elevated at 130/90 mmHg.

Laboratory investigations revealed a mild microcytic hypochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL. Liver function tests were within normal range, ruling out liver pathology as the cause of her symptoms.

Given her history of weight loss and persistent abdominal pain, further investigations were conducted to determine the cause. An ultrasound was performed which showed an enlarged pancreas with irregular contours and dilated pancreatic ducts suggestive of chronic pancreatitis.

The patient was referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management. A detailed history revealed that she had a long-standing alcohol abuse problem, consuming about four to five alcoholic drinks daily for many years until she found out about her pregnancy.

The combination of chronic alcohol consumption and pregnancy can lead to an increased risk of developing pancreatitis due to hormonal changes and altered metabolism during pregnancy.

The gastroenterologist recommended abstinence from alcohol along with dietary modifications including low-fat meals rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. She was also prescribed pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid in digestion.

During follow-up visits, the patient reported improvement in her symptoms after implementing these lifestyle changes. Her pain gradually reduced over time as she adhered to the treatment plan provided by the gastroenterologist.

Additionally, regular antenatal care continued under close monitoring by both obstetricians and gastroenterologists throughout her pregnancy journey due to potential complications associated with chronic pancreatitis during gestation.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering underlying causes for abdominal pain during pregnancy beyond typical obstetric concerns. Collaborative management between multiple specialties is crucial for ensuring optimal outcomes for both the mother and the unborn child.
