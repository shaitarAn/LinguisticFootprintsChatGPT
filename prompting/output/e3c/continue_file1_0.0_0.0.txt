Upon further examination, the patient reported experiencing occasional visual disturbances, such as blurred vision and seeing flashing lights, during her headaches. She also mentioned that the headaches tended to occur more frequently during times of stress or lack of sleep. 

Physical examination revealed no abnormalities, and neurological examination was within normal limits. Given her history of seizures and the presence of visual disturbances, further investigations were warranted to determine the cause of her headaches.

An MRI scan of the brain was performed, which revealed characteristic findings consistent with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). The imaging showed leptomeningeal angiomas involving the left cerebral hemisphere, along with cortical atrophy and calcifications. These findings were consistent with the known neurologic manifestations of SWS.

The patient was referred to a neurologist specializing in headache disorders for further evaluation and management. The neurologist confirmed the diagnosis of SWS and explained that the headaches were likely related to the underlying vascular abnormalities associated with the syndrome.

Treatment options were discussed, and a multidisciplinary approach involving medication management, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up was recommended. The patient was prescribed a prophylactic medication to help reduce the frequency and severity of her headaches. Additionally, she was advised to maintain a regular sleep schedule, manage stress levels, and avoid triggers such as excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption.

The patient was also referred to a genetic counselor to discuss the potential risk of passing on the syndrome to future children. The counselor provided information about the genetic basis of SWS and the available options for prenatal testing and family planning.

Throughout her treatment, the patient's headaches gradually improved in frequency and intensity. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor her progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. The patient was also encouraged to join a support group for individuals with SWS to connect with others facing similar challenges and share experiences.

In conclusion, the 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of SWS presented with frequent non-pulsating headaches. Through a comprehensive evaluation, including imaging studies and consultation with specialists, an appropriate management plan was developed to address her symptoms and improve her quality of life.
