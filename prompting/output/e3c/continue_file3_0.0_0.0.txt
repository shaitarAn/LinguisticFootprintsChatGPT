During his hospitalization, the patient received extensive wound care and underwent multiple skin grafting procedures to promote healing and prevent infection. The medical team closely monitored his vital signs, administered pain medication, and provided psychological support to address his mental health needs.

Due to the severity of his injuries, the patient experienced significant physical and emotional challenges throughout his stay. The burns on his face and neck required delicate care to minimize scarring and preserve functionality. Occupational and physical therapists worked closely with him to regain mobility and strength in his upper extremities, while also addressing any potential limitations caused by the burns.

The patient's mental health was a primary concern throughout his hospitalization. He received regular visits from a psychiatrist who adjusted his medication regimen and provided therapy sessions to address the underlying causes of his attempted suicide. The medical team also collaborated with social workers and family members to develop a comprehensive aftercare plan that would support his ongoing mental health needs upon discharge.

As the patient's wounds gradually healed, he began to participate in group therapy sessions with other burn survivors. These sessions provided a supportive environment where he could share his experiences, learn coping strategies, and gain a sense of community. The patient's progress was closely monitored, and he was gradually reintegrated into daily activities and routines to promote his overall well-being.

After 66 days of hospitalization, the patient was deemed medically stable and ready for discharge. He was provided with detailed instructions for wound care, medication management, and follow-up appointments with various specialists. The medical team also ensured that he had access to ongoing mental health support, including therapy and counseling services.

The patient's journey towards recovery was far from over, but with the comprehensive care he received during his hospitalization, he had a solid foundation to build upon. The medical team remained committed to his long-term well-being and continued to provide support and guidance as he transitioned back into his community.
