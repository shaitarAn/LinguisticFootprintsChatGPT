During his hospitalization, the patient received extensive wound care and underwent multiple debridement surgeries to remove necrotic tissue and promote healing. The medical team closely monitored his vital signs, administered intravenous antibiotics to prevent infection, and provided pain management to alleviate his discomfort.

Due to the extensive nature of his injuries, the patient required specialized wound dressings and skin grafts to aid in the healing process. The medical team worked diligently to ensure proper wound care and prevent complications such as infection and contractures.

In addition to the physical injuries, the patient also received comprehensive psychiatric care to address his underlying mental health condition. A multidisciplinary team consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers collaborated to develop a treatment plan that included therapy, medication management, and support groups.

Throughout his hospitalization, the patient's mental health improved gradually. He engaged in therapy sessions, participated in group activities, and received continuous support from the medical staff. The combination of physical and mental health care played a crucial role in his overall recovery.

As the patient's wounds began to heal, he underwent physical therapy to regain strength and mobility in his affected limbs. The therapy sessions focused on range of motion exercises, strengthening exercises, and scar management techniques. The patient's progress was closely monitored, and adjustments were made to his therapy plan as needed.

After 66 days of hospitalization, the patient was deemed stable enough for discharge. He was provided with a comprehensive aftercare plan that included regular follow-up appointments with both his psychiatric and physical health care providers. The medical team also ensured that he had access to community resources and support groups to aid in his ongoing recovery.

The patient's journey from attempted suicide by fire to his eventual discharge was a testament to the dedication and expertise of the medical team involved in his care. Through their collaborative efforts, he was able to overcome both physical and mental health challenges and embark on a path towards a healthier and more fulfilling life.
