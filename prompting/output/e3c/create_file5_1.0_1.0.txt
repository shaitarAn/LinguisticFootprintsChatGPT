Patient Information:
On the 5th September 2021, a previously healthy, 25-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the medical ward at St. Mary's Hospital in London. The patient was transferred from a local clinic due to persistent symptoms and deteriorating condition. She presented with a two-week history of fever, generalized rash over her limbs and trunk, severe headache accompanied by neck stiffness, sore throat, and dry cough. Additionally, she reported experiencing intermittent episodes of diarrhea for the past three days but denied any joint pain or presence of oral or nasal ulcers.

Medical History:
The patient had no significant medical history and had not been on any medications prior to this illness. She reported being fully vaccinated for routine immunizations during her childhood.

Clinical Presentation:
Upon admission to the hospital, the patient appeared visibly unwell with a temperature of 39°C (102.2°F) and tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. Physical examination revealed diffuse maculopapular rash on her limbs and trunk that spared her face and palms. Her eyelids also showed mild edema without any conjunctival injection or discharge.

The patient complained of intense headache localized at the occipital area which was associated with neck pain upon movement. Neck stiffness was noted during examination without signs of meningeal irritation such as Kernig's or Brudzinski's signs.

Her throat examination revealed mild erythema but no exudates were observed on tonsils. The oral cavity did not show any ulcers or vesicular lesions suggestive of viral infections like herpes simplex virus (HSV). Moreover, there were no nasal ulcers reported by the patient.

Respiratory examination revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally without wheezing or crackles upon auscultation; she had an intermittent dry cough which worsened with deep inspiration.

Investigations:

1) Blood tests:
   - Complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.2 x10⁹/L (normal range: 4.5-11 x10⁹/L).
   - Mild thrombocytopenia was observed, with a platelet count of 150 x10⁹/L (normal range: 150-450 x10⁹/L).

2) Lumbar Puncture:
   - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed clear color and significantly elevated protein levels of 100 mg/dL (normal range: 15-45 mg/dL). Cell count in the CSF was within normal limits.

3) Chest X-ray:
   - The chest X-ray did not reveal any significant abnormalities, ruling out pneumonia or other infiltrative lung diseases.

Working Diagnosis:
Based on the clinical presentation and initial investigations, this patient is suspected to have meningitis with associated systemic involvement due to an infectious etiology.

Management Plan:
The patient was started on empiric antibiotic therapy consisting of intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin to cover for bacterial causes while awaiting further investigation results. Supportive care including analgesics for headache and fever reduction, as well as adequate hydration, were also initiated.

In addition to empirical treatment, viral serology tests were ordered to rule out common viral causes such as HSV. Further diagnostic investigations included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on both respiratory secretions and stool samples for potential viral pathogens causing diarrhea episodes.

Close monitoring of vital signs and neurological status was implemented alongside comprehensive nursing care including frequent assessments for worsening neck stiffness or meningeal irritation signs.

Outcome:
The final diagnosis will depend on the results from subsequent investigations. The patient's clinical course will be closely monitored, ensuring appropriate management based on test findings while alleviating symptoms through supportive measures.
