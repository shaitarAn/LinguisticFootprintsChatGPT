Clinical Case: A 25-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) presented to our clinic with chronic headaches. He reported a two-year history of frequent, non-pulsating headaches that were not worsened by physical activity. The headaches were relieved with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient did not experience nausea, aura, or any other accompanying symptoms. The pain was bilateral, generalized, and described as a dull, pressing sensation.

Family history was significant for a paternal aunt who had NF1, but there was no known history of headaches in the family. The patient had other clinical manifestations of NF1, including multiple café-au-lait macules over his body and cutaneous neurofibromas on his trunk and extremities. He also had Lisch nodules in both irises on ophthalmic examination.

Neurologically, the patient had no motor or sensory deficits. He denied any history of seizures or epilepsy. Further evaluation revealed a history of learning difficulties and poor academic performance throughout his schooling. On intellectual testing, he scored 68 on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, classifying him as having mild intellectual disability.

The patient's neurological examination was otherwise unremarkable. However, a cranial MRI revealed multiple T2-hyperintense lesions in the brain parenchyma consistent with the presence of gliomas. Notably, an optic glioma involving the optic chiasm was also identified.

Considering his chronic headaches and learning difficulties, the patient was started on a treatment regimen that included amitriptyline for headache prophylaxis and supportive measures for his intellectual disability. He was also referred to a multidisciplinary team including neurology, neurosurgery, and ophthalmology for further management of his NF1-related manifestations.

In conclusion, a 25-year-old male patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) presented with chronic headaches, which were the initial focus of his clinical evaluation. The presence of additional findings such as café-au-lait macules, cutaneous neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, and gliomas on cranial MRI confirmed the diagnosis of NF1. The patient's learning difficulties and intellectual disability further highlighted the systemic nature of NF1 and necessitated a holistic approach in his management.
