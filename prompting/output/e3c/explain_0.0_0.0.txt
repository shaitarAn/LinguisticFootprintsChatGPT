This clinical case describes a 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). SWS is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the presence of a facial birthmark called a port wine stain, seizures, and abnormalities in the brain.

The patient in this case has a history of frequent non-pulsating headaches that have been present for the past two years. These headaches are relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and are not worsened by physical activity. There are no accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura. The headaches last for hours and are bilateral, generalized, and pressing in quality.

The patient also has a history of seizures that started in the fifteenth day of life. These seizures are described as attacks of tonic-clonic contractions and led to the diagnosis of SWS. At the age of 6, the patient underwent a callosotomy procedure to control her seizures. However, at the age of 18, she experienced a seizure after undergoing laser treatment for her port wine birthmark. Since then, she has been prescribed carbamazepine, an antiepileptic medication, and has not had any seizures.

In terms of cognitive development, the patient's parents report that she had a normal infancy but struggled academically and is barely literate. Her family history is negative for SWS, except for her elder sister who also has a port wine stain on her face. However, no further investigations were done regarding her sister's condition.

The patient is currently being treated for anxiety disorder with medications such as ketiapin and venlafaxine, in addition to NSAIDs for her headaches. After one week of treatment, her headaches have slightly decreased in intensity but the frequency remains the same.

On physical examination, a facial nevus (port wine stain) is observed on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. Intraoral examination reveals an overgrowth of gingiva (gums) on the right side, which appears bright red and blanches upon pressure, suggesting angiomatous enlargement. Mild asymmetry is also noted in the patient's extremities, with the left arm and leg being slightly smaller and exhibiting hemiparesis (weakness) in both the upper and lower extremities of the same size.

Further evaluations reveal glaucoma in the patient's right eye and signs of anxiety disorder on psychiatric examination. Neurological examination is unremarkable except for the hemiparesis. Imaging studies, including cranial CT scans and gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI, show diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere, irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area, and multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere is also asymmetrically smaller than the left, as seen on axial T1 weighted cranial MRI. Additionally, T2 weighted MRI reveals extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle, at Gallen vein localization, at the perivascular space anterior to the third ventricle at Willis polygon localization, and at the right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern localization.

Finally, the patient underwent a proteus intelligence test, which yielded a score of 75, indicating mild mental retardation.

In summary, this clinical case describes a 21-year-old female patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome presenting with frequent headaches, seizures, cognitive impairment, facial nevus, gingival overgrowth, hemiparesis, glaucoma, and radiological findings consistent with SWS. The patient is also being treated for anxiety disorder.
