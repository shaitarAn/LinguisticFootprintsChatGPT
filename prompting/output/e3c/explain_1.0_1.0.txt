This clinical case describes a 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS). The patient presented with frequent, non-pulsating headaches that were relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and were not worsened by physical activity. There were no accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura. The headaches lasted for hours and were bilateral, generalized, and pressing in quality. 

The patient had a history of seizures since the fifteenth day of life, described as attacks of tonic-clonic contractions. At the age of 6, she underwent callosotomy surgery to control her seizures. However, at the age of 18, she experienced another seizure during laser treatment for her port wine birthmark.

Following this event, she was prescribed carbamazepine medication at a daily dose of 400 mg and remained seizure-free since then. Despite having normal development in infancy, according to her parents' report, she struggled academically and is barely literate.

Her family history revealed no significant information other than her elder sister having a port wine stain on her face (a birthmark caused by blood vessel abnormalities). No investigations or research have been conducted regarding her sister's stain.

Apart from SWS-related symptoms such as facial nevus (port wine stain), gingival overgrowth on the right side suggesting angiomatous enlargement (a vascular anomaly), mild extremity asymmetry with hemiparesis (weakness on one side), glaucoma in her right eye (increased pressure within the eye causing vision problems), and anxiety disorder; additional findings on diagnostic imaging included cranial CT scans showing diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area.

Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI identified multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere along with diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI revealed thickening of the right calvaria (skull bone) compared to the left, and the right hemisphere showed asymmetrically smaller size than the left. Furthermore, T2 weighted MRI demonstrated extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle and at various locations in the brain.

A psychiatric examination confirmed signs of an anxiety disorder, while a neurological examination did not reveal any remarkable findings except for her hemiparesis (weakness). Lastly, she underwent a proteus intelligence test which yielded a score of 75 points, classifying her as mildly mentally retarded.
