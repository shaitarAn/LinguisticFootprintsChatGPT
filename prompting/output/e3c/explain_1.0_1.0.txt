In this clinical case, we have a 21-year-old female patient who has been diagnosed with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS). She presented with a two-year history of frequent non-pulsating headaches. The headache was relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and did not worsen with physical activity. There were no accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura.

The patient also had a history of seizures, which began when she was 15 days old and led to her diagnosis of SWS. At the age of six, she underwent callosotomy surgery to control her seizures. However, at the age of 18, she experienced another seizure during laser treatment for her port wine birthmark.

To manage her seizures, the patient has been prescribed carbamazepine at a daily dose of 400 mg and has remained seizure-free since then. She also suffers from anxiety disorder and is taking ketiapin (25 mg) and venlafaxine (75 mg). In addition to these medications, she is prescribed NSAID drugs for her headaches.

On physical examination, several features associated with SWS were observed. These include a facial nevus on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek caused by choroid angioma. Intraoral examination showed an overgrowth of gingiva on the right side that appeared angiomatous in nature. Mild asymmetry between her left arm and leg was visible as well.

On further evaluations:
1. Ophthalmological evaluation revealed glaucoma in the right eye.
2. Psychiatric examination indicated signs of anxiety disorder.
3. Neurological examination revealed hemiparesis in both upper and lower extremities on the left side.
4. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere along with irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area.
5.The gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI showed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere, diffuse atrophy on the same side, and right calvarial thickness compared to the left.
6. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI demonstrated asymmetrical smaller size of the right hemisphere compared to the left along with extensive venous formations around corpus of the right lateral ventricle and other vascular formations.

Based on her proteus intelligence test, she scored 75 points and was considered mildly mentally retarded.

Overall, this patient's clinical case highlights various manifestations of Sturge-Weber Syndrome, including facial nevi, gingival overgrowth, hemiparesis, glaucoma in one eye, anxiety disorder, and intellectual disability. This syndrome is characterized by abnormal blood vessels affecting various organs such as skin, eyes, brain resulting in a wide range of symptoms.
