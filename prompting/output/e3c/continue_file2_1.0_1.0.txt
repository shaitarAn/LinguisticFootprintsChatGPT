On physical examination, the patient appeared pale but not jaundiced. Her vital signs were stable, and her abdomen was soft and non-tender on palpation. There were no signs of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Fetal monitoring showed a normal fetal heart rate with regular movements.

Given the patient's symptoms of persistent abdominal pain and significant weight loss, further investigations were warranted to determine the cause. Laboratory tests including a complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, and coagulation profile were ordered.

The CBC showed microcytic hypochromic anemia with hemoglobin levels as low as 9 g/dL. The liver function tests revealed mildly elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), but other liver enzymes including alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin were within the normal range. The coagulation profile showed no abnormalities.

Considering her pregnancy status along with her clinical presentation, further imaging studies needed to be performed cautiously to avoid any potential harm to both the mother and fetus. An ultrasound was chosen as the initial imaging modality due to its safety profile during pregnancy.

The ultrasound findings indicated an enlarged pancreas with multiple hypoechoic lesions scattered throughout its tissue. These findings raised concerns about pancreatic pathology such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pancreatitis.

To obtain a more definitive diagnosis without jeopardizing both mother and fetus, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was recommended by consulting with the obstetrician regarding fetal safety precautions during this procedure.

The MRI results confirmed multiple hypodense lesions in the head of the pancreas suggestive of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, it appeared that there was no evidence of metastasis at that stage based on findings from adjacent structures such as regional lymph nodes or nearby organs like liver or spleen.

Given her pregnancy status at 27 weeks gestation, a multidisciplinary team was assembled to discuss the best management options for both the patient and fetus. It was agreed upon that immediate intervention in the form of surgery would pose significant risks to both mother and fetus.

Instead, a conservative approach was chosen, with close monitoring of the patient's symptoms and overall condition. Regular obstetric visits were scheduled in conjunction with consultations from an oncologist and gastroenterologist. The patient's pain was managed using analgesics deemed safe during pregnancy.

Throughout her pregnancy, a close eye was kept on fetal growth, well-being, and viability via regular ultrasound examinations. The plan included delivery at term if no complications arose that required an earlier intervention.

This case highlights the complexities involved in managing pregnant patients with serious medical conditions such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A coordinated multidisciplinary approach is crucial to balance optimal maternal care while ensuring fetal safety. The prognosis in these cases is generally poor due to delayed diagnosis resulting from nonspecific symptoms and limitations in imaging modalities during pregnancy."
