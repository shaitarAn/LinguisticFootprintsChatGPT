Case Study: A 42-year-old Male Office Worker with Chronic Abdominal Pain

Introduction:
A 42-year-old male office worker, Mr. J, presented to our facility with a chief complaint of chronic abdominal pain of three months' duration. The pain was located in the epigastric region, was gradual in onset, and characterized as dull and persistent. Over time, the intensity of the pain had gradually worsened without any identified relieving or aggravating factors. He also experienced intermittent radiation of pain to his chest. Although Mr. J had been experiencing a significant weight loss during this period, he denied any associated early satiety, jaundice, fever, itchiness or spontaneous bleeding episodes.

Medical History:
Mr. J had no notable past medical history and reported no known allergies to medications or food items. He had not undergone any surgeries in the past and did not have a family history of gastrointestinal disorders or malignancies.

Social History:
Mr. J was an active non-smoker and consumed alcohol socially but within acceptable limits for his gender (1-2 standard drinks per day). He worked as an office administrator in an IT firm for ten years.

Clinical Examination:
On physical examination, Mr.J appeared relatively well-nourished but mildly pale. Vital signs were stable with a blood pressure reading of 120/80 mmHg and pulse rate at 84 beats per minute - regular rhythm without any cardiac murmurs detected on auscultation.
Abdominal examination revealed tenderness on deep palpation localized to the epigastric region without evidence of guarding or rebound tenderness.

Diagnostic Workup:
With suspicion for underlying pathologies causing chronic abdominal pain along with weight loss despite normal appetite as well as radiation to the chest region intermittently mentioned by patient; further investigations were warranted.
Initial laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), renal panel, and serum lipase levels, revealed no significant abnormalities. An abdominal ultrasonography was performed to visualize Mr. J's upper abdominal organs, which did not show any signs of pathology such as gallstones or liver enlargement.
Given the persistence of Mr.J's symptoms and his significant weight loss, a gastroscopy was scheduled to further evaluate his upper gastrointestinal tract.

Diagnosis:
The gastroscopy revealed findings consistent with chronic gastritis characterized by diffuse erythematous mucosa involving the gastric body and fundus. Multiple biopsies were obtained from these abnormal areas for histopathological examination.
Histopathology results from the biopsy samples demonstrated marked chronic inflammation with infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria along with focal reactive changes in gastric epithelial cells that were suggestive of Helicobacter pylori infection.

Treatment and Follow-up:
Mr. J received a diagnosis of chronic gastritis related to H. pylori infection based on clinical presentation and histopathology findings.
He was prescribed a combination therapy including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin along with a bismuth compound-based medication for eradication of H.pylori infection.
He was also advised to follow up after two weeks for complete symptom resolution evaluation along with urea breath test (UBT) to confirm successful eradication.

Conclusion:
This case presented a challenging diagnostic scenario where chronic abdominal pain accompanied by weight loss required an extensive diagnostic workup including gastroscopy with biopsy for definitive diagnosis. The identification of H.pylori-associated chronic gastritis will allow appropriate treatment initiation aimed at eradicating the infection and alleviating Mr.J's symptoms while preventing further complications associated with this condition.
