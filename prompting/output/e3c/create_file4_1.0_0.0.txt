Case 3: baby CJ, a female infant from Qwerty tribe delivered at term in a hospital by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 27-year-old para 1 mother. Baby cried well at birth and weighed 2.8kg. She was referred at age of 6 hours on account of absence of skin and skull bone noticed at birth. Pregnancy was supervised and uneventful and mother denied use of any medications orthodox or herbal except for antenatal drugs. Ultrasound scan in second trimester was reported as normal. She was the second child of parents in a non-consanguineous family setting. There was no history of congenital anomalies in the extended family. Mother is a 27-year-old nurse and father a 30-year-old engineer, both with a tertiary level of education.

Physical examination revealed a defined, large defect on the frontal region of the scalp over the frontal bone bilaterally, extending to the parietal region. The defect measured approximately 9 x 7 cm in the midline and 5 x 4 cm in the parietal region. The exposed brain tissue was covered with a transparent membrane. The patient had normal set ears, she was calm and alert, with a soft anterior fontanelle and no respiratory distress. Other system examinations were unremarkable. A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita was made.

Baby received routine care as per protocol, including observation, gentle cleaning of the exposed area with normal saline, and application of a non-adherent dressing. The patient's vital signs remained stable, and she tolerated oral feeds well. Consultations were made with neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons for further evaluation and management.

A cranial ultrasound was performed, which showed absence of frontal bone towards the vertex bilaterally, extending from 1 cm behind the anterior fontanelle down to the parietal region. The subcutaneous tissues of the scalp were visualized, and there were no abnormalities detected in the brain tissue beneath the defect. The cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brain stem structures appeared normal in morphology and echo intensity. No signs of hydrocephalus or other intracranial abnormalities were found.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita without underlying brain involvement was confirmed. Given the absence of complications and the relatively small size of the defect, conservative management was recommended. The patient's parents were educated on proper wound care and discharged home with instructions for regular follow-up at the specialty clinics.

Follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor the healing progress of the defect and ensure optimal growth and development of the patient. Over time, the defect gradually closed, and new skin tissue formed. The patient's neurological examination remained normal throughout the follow-up period.

In this case, the patient had a favorable outcome with conservative management, highlighting the importance of early recognition, multidisciplinary collaboration, and individualized treatment plans in the management of aplasia cutis congenita.
