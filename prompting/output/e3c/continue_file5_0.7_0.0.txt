On admission, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.5°F). Physical examination revealed bilateral conjunctival injection, a diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash that spared the palms and soles, and mild cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient appeared mildly ill but was alert and oriented. His respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable.

Laboratory investigations were conducted, including a complete blood count, which revealed leukopenia with a total white cell count of 3.8 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.0-11.0 x 10^9/L) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 98 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L). The patient's liver function tests were within normal limits. A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which returned negative.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, further investigations were carried out to establish a diagnosis. Serological testing for various infectious agents, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and syphilis, were all negative. However, serological testing for dengue virus revealed a positive IgM antibody titer.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of dengue fever was made. The patient was started on supportive treatment, including hydration and symptomatic relief for fever and pain. Regular monitoring of vital signs and platelet counts was initiated to ensure early detection of any complications, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever.

The medical team also emphasized the importance of mosquito bite prevention measures, as dengue fever is primarily transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. The patient was advised to use insect repellents, wear protective clothing, and avoid outdoor activities during peak mosquito activity times.

Over the course of his hospital stay, the patient's symptoms gradually improved, and his platelet counts began to normalize. He was discharged after a week of hospitalization, with instructions to continue monitoring his health and to seek medical attention if any concerning symptoms re-emerged.

This case highlights the importance of considering dengue fever as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with fever, rash, and other systemic symptoms, particularly in areas where the disease is endemic. Early recognition and prompt management are essential in preventing severe complications and ensuring a favorable outcome for the patient.
