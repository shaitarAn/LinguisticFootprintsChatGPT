Title: A 42-year-old Woman with Mental Health Issues following Self-inflicted Injury

Case Presentation:
A 42-year-old woman with a history of mental illness was admitted to our facility following a self-inflicted injury. The patient had attempted suicide by hanging two days prior to admission. She presented with signs of respiratory distress and was promptly transferred from a local psychiatric hospital.

History of Presenting Illness:
Three days before admission, the patient had experienced a significant episode of depression culminating in her suicide attempt. She tied a ligature around her neck and suspended herself until discovered in an unconscious state. Prompt emergency medical services were able to intervene successfully, resuscitating her at the scene before transferring her to our care.

Physical Examination:
Upon arrival, the patient appeared lethargic but responsive to verbal stimuli. Bilateral petechial hemorrhages were noted on her conjunctiva and face, consistent with prolonged strangulation. Her vital signs showed tachycardia (heart rate = 115 beats per minute), normal blood pressure (130/80 mmHg), elevated respiratory rate (25 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation maintained at 96% on room air.

Burn Assessment:
A thorough examination revealed that the patient sustained extensive injuries from partial-thickness burns involving approximately 30% total body surface area (TBSA). The affected areas included both upper extremities accounting for approximately 5% TBSA each, anterior chest wall (7%), abdomen (5%), lower back (3%), bilateral thighs each contributing around 4%, as well as right calf and left foot making up approximately 2-3% TBSA overall.

Management Course:
The patient's immediate treatment entailed securing an adequate airway followed by continuous supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 liters/minute to maintain oxygen saturation above 95%. She received tetanus prophylaxis given no prior immunization record available and was started on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to prevent infection in light of the burn wounds.

Psychiatric Evaluation:
A psychiatry consultation was requested soon after admission, and a comprehensive mental health evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features. The patient had a known psychiatric history, including multiple previous suicide attempts documented. Consequently, she received both individual psychotherapy sessions and close monitoring by our psychiatric team throughout her hospital stay.

Burn Wound Care:
The patient underwent daily wound care involving sterile dressing changes under sterile conditions. These measures were performed meticulously to minimize the risk of contamination and to promote wound healing. Regular assessment for signs of infection such as increasing erythema or purulent discharge was undertaken during each dressing change, with swab cultures collected when indicated.

Prognosis & Hospital Stay:
Given physical injuries and accompanying significant depressive symptoms warranting intervention, it was decided to hospitalize the patient for effective stabilization over time. Her overall recovery trajectory proved favorable, although she experienced acute distress related to her mental health condition during her 45-day hospitalization period.

Discharge Plan:
Upon reaching stable physical condition with well-healing burns indicating reepithelialization without any evidence of infection or dehiscence at follow-up examinations, transition planning commenced in collaboration with both psychiatry services and appropriate outpatient care facilities specializing in mental health treatment and ongoing support services.

Follow-up Care:
Following her discharge from our facility, close surveillance would be maintained by an interdisciplinary team consisting of primary care physicians well-versed in managing chronic mental health conditions alongside specialized psychiatrists providing comprehensive psychotherapy sessions as deemed necessary. Supportive community programs were also identified to foster social reintegration while addressing psychosocial stressors serving high-risk populations like herself.

Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights the challenges faced when caring for individuals with concomitant mental illness associated with significant self-inflicted injuries. A multidisciplinary approach encompassing medical management, psychiatric intervention, and coordinated rehabilitation services remains vital to ensure optimal recovery and prevent relapse in such complex cases.
