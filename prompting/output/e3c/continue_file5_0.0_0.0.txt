On admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed a generalized maculopapular rash over the body and eyelids, with no evidence of petechiae or purpura. The patient had mild bilateral conjunctival injection and mild pharyngeal erythema. There were no cervical lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly noted.

Laboratory investigations were conducted to further evaluate the patient's condition. Complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 8,500 cells/mm³, with a normal differential count. Hemoglobin and platelet counts were within normal limits. Liver function tests, renal function tests, and electrolyte levels were all within normal ranges. Blood cultures were obtained, and the patient was started on empirical antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and recent travel history, a thorough infectious workup was initiated. Serological tests for common viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus, were negative. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. The patient was placed in isolation pending the test results.

During his hospital stay, the patient's symptoms gradually improved. His fever subsided, and the rash began to fade. The headache and neck pain also resolved, and the cough became less frequent. The patient's diarrhoea resolved after a few days, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues. Repeat laboratory investigations showed no significant abnormalities, and the blood cultures remained negative.

After five days of hospitalization, the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 came back negative, ruling out COVID-19 infection. The patient was subsequently discharged with a diagnosis of viral exanthem, likely due to a self-limiting viral infection. He was advised to continue symptomatic treatment at home, including rest, hydration, and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed.

The case of this previously healthy 17-year-old African male highlights the importance of considering a broad differential diagnosis in patients presenting with fever and rash. While COVID-19 has been the focus of much attention during the ongoing pandemic, it is crucial not to overlook other potential causes of similar symptoms. In this case, the patient's symptoms were consistent with a viral exanthem, which is a rash associated with a viral infection.

Viral exanthems are common in children and adolescents and are typically self-limiting. They can be caused by a variety of viruses, including enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and parvovirus B19. The exact viral etiology in this patient's case remains unknown, as specific viral testing was not performed. However, the clinical course and resolution of symptoms support a viral etiology.

It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of the various presentations of viral exanthems and to consider them in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever and rash. While most viral exanthems are self-limiting and require only supportive care, it is essential to rule out other more serious conditions, such as certain bacterial infections or autoimmune diseases, which may present with similar symptoms.

In conclusion, this case emphasizes the need for a comprehensive evaluation of patients presenting with fever and rash, taking into account the patient's clinical history, physical examination findings, and appropriate laboratory investigations. By considering a broad differential diagnosis, healthcare providers can ensure appropriate management and timely identification of any underlying conditions that may require further intervention.
