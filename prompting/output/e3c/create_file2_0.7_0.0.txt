A 42-year-old male office worker presented to our facility with a chief complaint of persistent epigastric pain for the past 2 months. The pain was described as dull and constant, gradually increasing in intensity over time. He reported occasional radiation of the pain to his back. The patient mentioned experiencing a significant weight loss of approximately 15 pounds over the past few months without any intentional changes in his diet or exercise routine.

Upon further inquiry, the patient denied any associated symptoms such as early satiety, jaundice, fever, itch, or spontaneous bleeding. He had no history of blood transfusions and reported regular intake of over-the-counter multivitamins. Additionally, the patient mentioned that he had no family history of gastrointestinal disorders or malignancies.

The patient's medical history was unremarkable, with no known chronic illnesses or previous surgeries. He had never smoked cigarettes, consumed alcohol moderately, and denied any illicit drug use. His vital signs were stable, and there were no abnormalities noted during the physical examination. His abdomen appeared normal with no tenderness, palpable masses, or organomegaly.

Given the concerning nature of the patient's symptoms, further investigations were warranted. Initial laboratory tests, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests, were within normal limits. An ultrasound of the abdomen was performed, which revealed no significant abnormalities in the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas.

To further evaluate the cause of the patient's symptoms, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was scheduled. The procedure revealed mild erosion in the stomach lining but did not identify any specific pathology to account for the patient's symptoms. Multiple biopsies were taken during the procedure for histopathological examination.

Histopathological analysis of the biopsy samples revealed the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in the gastric mucosa. The infection was confirmed by positive staining for H. pylori antigen. The patient was diagnosed with H. pylori-associated gastritis.

Based on the diagnosis, the patient was prescribed a 14-day course of triple therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics to eradicate the H. pylori infection. He was also advised to make dietary modifications, such as avoiding spicy and acidic foods, as well as reducing caffeine intake. The patient was educated about the importance of completing the prescribed course of antibiotics and the potential side effects associated with the medication.

During a follow-up visit after completion of the treatment, the patient reported a significant improvement in his symptoms. He no longer experienced epigastric pain and had regained some of the weight he had lost. A repeat upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was scheduled to confirm eradication of the H. pylori infection.

In conclusion, a middle-aged male presented with persistent epigastric pain and unexplained weight loss. After thorough investigation, he was diagnosed with H. pylori-associated gastritis. Prompt treatment with triple therapy resulted in resolution of symptoms and improvement in the patient's overall well-being.
