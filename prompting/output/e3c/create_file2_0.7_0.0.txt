A 45-year-old male carpenter presented to our facility with a chief complaint of persistent epigastric abdominal pain. The pain had been gradually increasing in intensity over the past 6 months and was described as dull and constant. The patient noticed that the pain occasionally radiated to his back, causing discomfort in his chest as well. He reported a significant weight loss during this time but denied experiencing any early satiety, jaundice, fever, itchiness, or spontaneous bleeding. It is important to note that the patient had no history of blood transfusion and was currently taking his prescribed iron supplement as part of his routine care.

Upon further inquiry, the patient reported occasional nausea and indigestion, but no vomiting or diarrhea. He denied any recent travel, exposure to toxins, or use of non-prescription medications. His past medical history was unremarkable, with no significant surgeries or chronic illnesses. The patient did not smoke and consumed alcohol socially, with no history of excessive alcohol consumption.

Physical examination revealed a well-nourished individual with no visible signs of distress. Vital signs were within normal limits, and there were no abnormalities detected during the cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurological examinations. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness to palpation in the epigastric region, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were normal, and there were no palpable masses or organomegaly.

Considering the patient's symptoms of persistent epigastric pain, weight loss, and occasional radiation to the chest, as well as the absence of early satiety, jaundice, fever, itchiness, or spontaneous bleeding, further investigations were warranted. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, liver function tests, amylase, lipase, and tumor markers were ordered to assess for any underlying pathologies. Additionally, an abdominal ultrasound was scheduled to evaluate the abdominal organs, including the pancreas and gallbladder.

The initial assessment of this patient with chronic epigastric pain raises concerns regarding possible gastrointestinal or pancreatic disorders. However, further investigations are required to determine the exact cause of his symptoms. The patient's case will be followed closely, and appropriate interventions will be initiated based on the results of the investigations.
