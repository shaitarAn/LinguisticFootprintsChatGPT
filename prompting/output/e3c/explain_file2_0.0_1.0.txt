This clinical case describes a patient who presented with various symptoms and signs that led to a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) during pregnancy. The patient had no known chronic illnesses, such as diabetes or hypertension, and denied any alcohol consumption or smoking. She also did not have any respiratory, cardiovascular, or urogenital symptoms.

On examination, the patient showed wasting (unintentional weight loss), mild pallor (pale appearance), a tinge of jaundice (yellowing of the skin), but was well hydrated and had no fever. There were no palpable lymph nodes. Palmer erythema (redness on the palms) was observed, but there were no clubbing (enlargement of fingertips) or parotid enlargement.

The abdomen was grossly distended with distorted contour in the upper half and visibly distended anterior abdominal wall veins draining away from the umbilicus. The liver was enlarged 12cm below the costal margin with a span of 17cm. It felt hard, nodular with an irregular edge, mildly tender, and had a bruit on auscultation. Mild ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) and bipedal edema up to mid-shin were present.

The patient was also pregnant with a breech presentation at 27 weeks and 3 days gestation. Fetal heart rate was normal at 134 beats per minute.

Laboratory assessment revealed low hemoglobin levels (10.3g/dl), slightly elevated white blood cell count (10200 cells/dl) with increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes percentage-wise. Platelet count was within normal range at 350000/ul.

Liver function tests showed raised gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). Total protein and albumin levels were low while international normalized ratio(INR)-1.3 indicated impaired liver function. The patient tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and negative for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Hepatitis B viral load was measured at 126869 IU/ml. Syphilis screening test (VDRL) was positive, but confirmatory testing with TPHA was not done. The patient tested negative for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions, indicating the presence of tumors. The liver size was increased to 17.2cm, and there was mild ascites present.

A revised diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation during pregnancy was made.

The patient received management including pain relief medication, diuretics like furosemide and spironolactone to manage fluid accumulation, and lamivudine to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B infection.

The initial plan was to continue the pregnancy until at least 32 completed weeks to improve neonatal survival chances. However, due to progressive unbearable abdominal pain, the pregnancy was terminated successfully at 30 weeks and 3 days through induction of labor.

Unfortunately, the outcome resulted in a stillbirth weighing 1.2kg (2.6lbs). Post-delivery pain significantly reduced, and the patient was discharged home after five days with plans for follow-up visits at the gastrointestinal clinic.

Although she attended two follow-up visits after discharge from the hospital at two weeks and four weeks postpartum respectively, she subsequently became lost to follow-up care afterward.
