This clinical case presents a complex situation involving a pregnant patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer. The patient initially presented with wasting, mild pallor, and a tinge of jaundice, along with a distended abdomen and visible abdominal wall veins. On examination, her liver was found to be enlarged, hard, and nodular, with mild tenderness and a bruit. Additionally, there was mild ascites and lower leg swelling. The patient was also found to have a breech presentation and an elevated fetal heart rate.

Laboratory assessments revealed low hemoglobin levels, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. Specifically, the patient had raised levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), along with low total protein and albumin levels. The patient tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and had a high viral load of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a tumor marker, was significantly elevated. However, the patient tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions, consistent with HCC. The patient's liver had evidence of cirrhosis, indicating long-standing liver disease. A pelvic scan confirmed the gestational age of the fetus, which was actively moving.

Given the diagnosis of HCC in pregnancy, the patient's management included pain relief medication, diuretics such as furosemide and spironolactone to manage ascites and edema, and lamivudine to prevent vertical transmission of HBV to the fetus. The plan was to allow the pregnancy to continue until at least 32 weeks to improve the chances of neonatal survival. However, due to progressive abdominal pain, the pregnancy was terminated at 30 weeks 3 days through successful induction of labor. Unfortunately, the outcome was a stillbirth.

Post-delivery, the patient experienced a marked reduction in pain and was discharged after five days. She was scheduled for follow-up visits at the gastrointestinal clinic, but unfortunately, she was lost to follow-up after the first month.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is a primary liver cancer that typically arises in the setting of chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis B or C infection or alcoholic liver disease. In this case, the patient was not aware of her hepatitis status prior to the diagnosis. Chronic hepatitis B infection is a known risk factor for the development of HCC.

Pregnancy complicates the management of HCC due to the potential risks to both the mother and the fetus. In this case, the decision to terminate the pregnancy was made due to worsening symptoms and the need for immediate intervention. The stillbirth is a tragic outcome, highlighting the challenges of managing advanced liver disease in pregnancy.

The patient's lost follow-up is concerning, as regular monitoring and appropriate management are critical for patients with HCC. Long-term management of HCC usually involves a multidisciplinary approach, including oncologists, hepatologists, and surgeons, to determine the most appropriate treatment options, such as surgery, liver transplantation, or palliative care.

In conclusion, this clinical case illustrates the challenging scenario of hepatocellular carcinoma in pregnancy. Prompt diagnosis, close monitoring, and appropriate management are essential to optimize outcomes for both the mother and the fetus. Regular follow-up and a multidisciplinary approach are crucial in managing this complex condition.
