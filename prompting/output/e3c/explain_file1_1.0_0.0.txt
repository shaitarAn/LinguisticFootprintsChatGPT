Case Summary: This clinical case involves a young woman who had a callosotomy at the age of 6 to control her seizures. At age 18, during a laser treatment for her port wine birthmark, she experienced her first seizure since the callosotomy. Following this, she was prescribed carbamazepine, which effectively controlled her seizures. Despite having a normal development in infancy, she has struggled academically and has limited literacy skills. Her family history is unremarkable, except for her elder sister also having a port wine stain. The elder sister did not display any features of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), and no research was conducted regarding her birthmark. The patient is currently on medication for anxiety disorder and chronic headaches, as well as NSAIDs. She exhibits physical signs, such as a facial nevus (due to choroid angioma), gingival overgrowth, and mild asymmetry in her extremities. She has been diagnosed with glaucoma in her right eye. Neurological examination reveals hemiparesis, and cranial imaging shows brain atrophy, calcifications, and dilated venous structures in the right hemisphere. On a psychiatric examination, signs of anxiety disorder are observed. She has undergone an intelligence test and has been classified as mildly mentally retarded.

Explanation: The patient's history of a callosotomy, which involves cutting the corpus callosum to control seizures, suggests that she has been dealing with epilepsy. The fact that she experienced a seizure after her laser treatment for her port wine birthmark triggered the need for medication intervention. Carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug, was prescribed and has successfully prevented any further seizures.

The patient's struggle with academic progress and limited literacy skills, despite having a normal infancy, may be associated with her neurological condition. Epilepsy, especially when poorly controlled, can impact cognitive functioning and intellectual development. However, it's important to note that other factors, such as socioeconomic conditions, educational opportunities, and individual differences, can also contribute to these challenges.

The presence of a port wine birthmark in the patient's elder sister raises the possibility of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). SWS is a rare neurocutaneous disorder characterized by a facial port wine stain, glaucoma, and abnormalities in blood vessels in the brain. However, it is unclear whether the elder sister has any features of SWS, as no research was conducted. Further evaluation and genetic testing might be necessary to explore the potential relationship between the birthmark and SWS.

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with anxiety disorder, chronic headaches, and glaucoma in her right eye. She is prescribed medications such as ketiapin and venlafaxine to manage her anxiety and headaches. NSAIDs are also prescribed for pain relief. However, while her headaches showed slight improvement in intensity, the frequency remained unchanged. Therefore, further investigation or alternative treatments may be needed to effectively manage her headaches.

The physical examination reveals several symptoms associated with her condition. The facial nevus observed on her right forehead, eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek is likely due to the choroid angioma. Gingival overgrowth, characterized by a bright red color that blanches with pressure, suggests angiomatous enlargement. Mild asymmetry in her extremities, with her left arm and leg slightly smaller, is accompanied by hemiparesis on the same side. Her ophthalmological evaluation confirms the presence of glaucoma in her right eye, which can be associated with SWS.

Neurological examination, apart from the observed hemiparesis, does not reveal any significant abnormalities. However, cranial CT scans and MRI highlight diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere, irregular calcifications in the right occipital area, dilated venous structures, and asymmetrical brain size. These findings may be indicative of SWS and further support the hypothesis that the patient might be affected by this syndrome.

The patient's performance on an intelligence test has led to a diagnosis of mild mental retardation. It's important to approach this diagnosis with sensitivity and support the patient in her academic and cognitive development. Proper education and therapeutic interventions can help improve her quality of life.

In conclusion, this clinical case involves a young woman with a history of callosotomy for epilepsy control, who experienced a seizure after laser treatment for her port wine birthmark. She has been successfully managed with carbamazepine to control her seizures. However, she has faced challenges in academic development and literacy, likely due to the impact of epilepsy on cognitive functioning. Several physical symptoms, such as a facial nevus, gingival overgrowth, mild asymmetry, and glaucoma, suggest the potential presence of Sturge-Weber syndrome. Imaging studies support these findings, revealing brain atrophy, calcifications, and dilated venous structures. Further evaluation and support are vital in managing her associated conditions and improving her quality of life.
