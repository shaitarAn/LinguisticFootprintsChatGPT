Title: Management of Severe Malnutrition in a Schizophrenic Patient

Introduction:
This clinical case describes the management of severe malnutrition in a patient diagnosed with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by distorted thinking, delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized behavior. In this case, the patient presented with rebellious and self-destructive behavior, which necessitated occasional restraint. However, the focus of this article will be on the patient's severe malnutrition and its management.

Assessment of Nutritional Status:
Upon admission, the patient had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m2, indicating that the patient was underweight. The malnourished state was confirmed by subjective global assessment (SGA), which categorized the patient as severely malnourished (Group C). Unfortunately, information regarding the patient's dietary intake and weight change history could not be obtained. However, the patient's mother reported that the patient had been refusing food and relying mainly on smoking and drinking coffee.

Management Approach:
Given the patient's severe malnutrition, a comprehensive nutrition management plan was initiated. The patient was initiated on energy and protein supplementation, starting with 30 kcal/kg and gradually increasing to 50 kcal/kg. Protein supplementation was started at 2 g/kg, given as a 50:50 ratio between oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS).

In addition to energy and protein, the patient was given micronutrient supplements to address potential deficiencies. These included vitamin A (100,000 units for the first week), vitamin C (100 mg, three times a day), and zinc (20 mg, once a day). These supplements aimed to support the patient's overall nutritional status and enhance the healing process.

Clinical Progression:
Despite the initiation of the nutrition management plan, the patient continued to lose weight during the early weeks of hospitalization. By the second week, the patient's body weight had dropped to 36 kilograms, with a subsequent decrease to 33 kilograms by the 28th day. At this point, the patient's serum albumin level had also decreased to 2.1 gr/L. The sustained weight loss and significant hypoalbuminemia indicated a lack of response to the current nutrition intervention.

Challenges and Pharmacotherapy:
The patient's poor appetite and lack of cooperation with enteral access contributed to the difficulties in providing adequate nutrition. Additionally, the patient exhibited pain and aggression, which were unresponsive to analgesics and sedatives. Consequently, the decision was made to administer partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) to support the patient's protein needs. BCAAs are essential amino acids that may help counteract muscle wasting and promote tissue repair.

Outcome and Discharge:
Despite these efforts, the patient's BMI continued to decline, reaching a critically low level of 11.96 kg/m2 on the 42nd day. At this point, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed, indicating delayed wound healing. Considering the patient's mental and nutritional status, the decision was made not to proceed with the planned skin graft surgery. By the time of discharge on the 66th day, the patient had lost 24% of their body weight, resulting in severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss.

Conclusion:
Managing severe malnutrition in psychiatric patients poses unique challenges due to the patient's mental condition, impaired appetite, and potential medication interactions. In this case, despite the implementation of an aggressive nutrition management plan, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate. This underscores the importance of early identification and intervention for malnutrition in psychiatric patients, as delayed treatment can lead to significant complications and poor outcomes.

To improve the outcomes in similar cases, a multidisciplinary approach involving psychiatrists, nutritionists, and other healthcare professionals is crucial. Regular monitoring of the patient's nutritional status, frequent reassessment of appetite and dietary intake, and the use of appropriate interventions tailored to the individual patient's needs are essential for successful outcomes in the management of severe malnutrition in psychiatric patients.
