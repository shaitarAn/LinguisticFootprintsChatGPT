This clinical case involves a 35-year-old man with mental illness who was admitted to the hospital after attempting suicide by fire. He suffered burns to approximately 38% of his total body surface area (TBSA), including his face, neck, upper extremities, thighs, legs, and trunk. The patient had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and was being treated with Haloperidol and Diazepam.

Upon admission, the patient's weight was 40 kg and his BMI was calculated to be 17.57 kg/m2, indicating that he was underweight. It was reported that he had been refusing food and only consuming cigarettes and coffee. No information was available regarding his recent dietary intake or weight changes.

The patient was assessed to be severely malnourished based on the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool. His albumin level was 3.6 g/L, indicating an imbalance in electrolyte levels. There were no signs of fluid accumulation.

Nutrition management was initiated a week after hospitalization, which was considered late. The patient was started on an energy and protein intake of 30 kcal/kg, gradually increasing to 50 kcal/kg and 2 g protein/kg, divided between oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) in a 50:50 ratio. Micronutrient supplements including vitamin A, vitamin C, and zinc were also provided.

Despite the nutritional interventions, the patient continued to experience weight loss. On the 28th day of hospitalization, his body weight dropped to 33 kg with a serum albumin level of 2.1 g/L. The ratio of oral intake and ONS was adjusted to 70:30. Due to the patient's unstable appetite and difficulty with enteral access, partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was administered to support his protein needs.

However, the patient's BMI continued to decline, reaching 11.96 kg/m2 on the 66th day with a body weight of 32 kg and a serum albumin level of 2.5 g/L. Granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed, and it was decided not to proceed with skin graft surgery due to the patient's mental and nutritional status.

Throughout the hospitalization, the patient displayed severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss. Despite this, his general and mental condition improved, leading to his eventual discharge from the hospital.
