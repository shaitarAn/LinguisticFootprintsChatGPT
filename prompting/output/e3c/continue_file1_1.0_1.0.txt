Upon further examination, the patient's neurological and physical examinations were within normal limits. There were no signs of focal deficits or abnormalities on cranial nerve examination. Her vital signs were stable, and there were no other significant findings in her medical history.

Given the patient's history of SWS and the presence of frequent headaches for the past two years, a comprehensive evaluation was initiated. This included routine blood work to rule out any potential underlying causes such as metabolic disorders or hormonal imbalances that could contribute to her symptoms.

Neuroimaging studies, including an MRI scan of the brain with contrast, were performed to assess for any vascular malformations or abnormalities associated with SWS that could be contributing to her headaches. The MRI revealed characteristic findings consistent with Sturge-Weber syndrome, including leptomeningeal enhancement and atrophy in the affected hemisphere.

To further evaluate her seizures and ensure appropriate seizure control, an EEG (electroencephalogram) was ordered. It showed epileptiform discharges in both hemispheres but predominantly affecting the affected side. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of epilepsy secondary to SWS was confirmed.

The management plan for this patient involved a multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, dermatology (to monitor any cutaneous manifestations), ophthalmology (to assess for glaucoma), and neuropsychology (to evaluate cognitive function). Antiepileptic medication was prescribed by a neurologist specialized in epilepsy management.

Additionally, given the nature of her headaches and their response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), it was determined that they likely represented tension-type headaches rather than migraines. The patient was educated regarding lifestyle modifications such as stress reduction techniques, maintaining regular sleep patterns, and managing triggers that can exacerbate tension-type headaches.

Regular follow-ups were scheduled for monitoring seizure control as well as headache frequency/intensity assessment. Close collaboration between healthcare providers and the patient's support system was emphasized to ensure optimal management of her condition and improve her overall quality of life.
