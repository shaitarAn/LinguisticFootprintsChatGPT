SWS, also known as Sturge-Weber syndrome, is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the presence of a facial birthmark called a port-wine stain, along with other associated symptoms. These can include eye abnormalities, developmental delays, and seizures.

Upon further examination of the patient's medical history, it was discovered that she had been experiencing these non-pulsating headaches for around two years. The fact that the headaches responded to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs indicated that they were likely tension-type headaches rather than migraines. Tension-type headaches are typically described as a pressing or tightening sensation on both sides of the head and can last for several hours.

Unlike migraines, these types of headaches are not usually accompanied by nausea or aura-like symptoms. In this patient's case, there were no such additional symptoms reported. However, it is important to note that migraine symptoms can vary between individuals and may not always follow the typical pattern.

The absence of any family history for headache further supported the diagnosis of tension-type headache rather than migraine since there is typically a genetic component in migraine cases. However, given her previous diagnosis of SWS and concurrent seizures during infancy, it raised some concerns about whether her current headaches could be related to her underlying condition.

Sturge-Weber syndrome is caused by a mutation in the GNAQ gene and affects blood vessels in various areas of the body including the brain. The abnormal blood vessel development can lead to increased pressure within the brain which may contribute to headache development.

Although SWS-associated seizures often occur in infancy or early childhood, they can persist into adulthood as well. It was crucial for us to assess whether her current headaches were related to ongoing seizure activity or if they were independent entities co-existing with her SWS diagnosis.

To address these concerns and gather more information about her headache patterns and possible triggers/exacerbating factors, we decided to perform further investigations including neuroimaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. This would help us evaluate potential structural abnormalities within the brain and rule out any other underlying causes for her headaches.

Additionally, we planned to monitor her seizure activity closely and consider treatment modifications if necessary. Some anti-seizure medications have proven to be effective in managing both seizures and certain types of headaches simultaneously.

Further evaluation was also necessary to determine if there were any associated symptoms related to her SWS that could be contributing to her headaches. Eye abnormalities, such as increased intraocular pressure or glaucoma, can sometimes cause ocular discomfort leading to headache-like symptoms. Therefore, a thorough ophthalmological examination was included in the treatment plan.

In conclusion, this 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome presented with frequent non-pulsating headaches that responded well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but persisted for hours at a time. Although tension-type headache seemed likely given their characteristics, further investigations were warranted due to concerns regarding her underlying condition and history of seizures associated with SWS. Through neuroimaging studies and close monitoring of seizure activity, we hoped to better understand the relationship between these headaches and her neurological disorder while tailoring an appropriate treatment plan accordingly.
