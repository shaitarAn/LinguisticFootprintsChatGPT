On admission, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), and his blood pressure was within normal limits. Physical examination revealed bilateral conjunctival injection, erythematous tonsils with exudates, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient appeared fatigued but was alert and oriented.

Laboratory investigations were conducted, including a complete blood count (CBC) which showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia. Liver function tests indicated mildly elevated liver enzymes, while renal function tests were within normal range. Serological testing for common viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) came back negative.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, further investigations were carried out to identify the cause of the patient's symptoms. A lumbar puncture was performed to analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis with an elevated protein level but normal glucose level.

To rule out infectious etiologies, CSF samples were sent for bacterial culture as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for common pathogens like Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus-1/2 (HSV-1/2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and West Nile virus among others.

Additionally, serological testing for tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease was also requested due to the presence of rash along with other symptoms in the clinical presentation.

The patient was placed on supportive care measures including intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and fever control medications. Empiric antibiotic therapy consisting of ceftriaxone and vancomycin was initiated pending the results of the CSF studies.

Further investigations and consultations with specialists were scheduled to determine the underlying cause of this patient's symptoms and provide appropriate management.
