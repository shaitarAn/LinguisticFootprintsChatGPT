On examination, the patient appeared pale and fatigued, with a slightly distended abdomen. Mild tenderness was noted in the epigastric region, but no guarding or rigidity was present. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.

Given the patient's persistent abdominal pain and significant weight loss, further investigations were warranted. Laboratory tests revealed a mild normocytic anemia and elevated liver enzymes, including serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels. Serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels were within normal limits. Serum amylase and lipase levels were also normal, ruling out pancreatitis as the cause of the pain.

An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed a normal-sized liver with no evidence of hepatomegaly, gallstones, or biliary dilatation. The common bile duct appeared unremarkable, and there were no noticeable abnormalities in the pancreas.

Considering the patient's gestational age and persistent symptoms, a thorough history and evaluation guided by obstetric factors were necessary. The patient had an uneventful antenatal period, with routine ultrasounds showing normal fetal growth and development. There was no history of preterm labor, vaginal bleeding, or other obstetric complications.

In order to rule out any potential obstetric causes for the pain, a fetal ultrasound was performed, which revealed a normal-sized and well-developed fetus with adequate amniotic fluid. The fetal heart rate was within the normal range, indicating no immediate concerns regarding the well-being of the pregnancy.

To further investigate the cause of the patient's abdominal pain, a gastroenterologist was consulted. A detailed history was obtained, including a review of the patient's dietary habits, medication use, and any recent travel or exposure to potential gastrointestinal pathogens. The patient denied any significant dietary changes, recent medication use, or exposure to gastrointestinal pathogens.

Given the patient's persistent symptoms, weight loss, and abnormal liver enzymes, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was ordered. The CT scan revealed multiple hypodense lesions scattered throughout the liver, suggesting metastatic disease. Further investigation was required to establish the primary source of the metastatic lesions and to determine the appropriate management plan.

The patient was referred to an oncologist for further evaluation and management. A thorough workup was conducted to identify the primary cancer site, including additional imaging studies, such as a chest CT and a breast examination. After comprehensive evaluation, it was determined that the patient had advanced-stage breast cancer with liver metastasis.

The patient was counseled regarding the diagnosis and treatment options. Given the gestational age and potential risks to both the mother and fetus, a multidisciplinary team consisting of obstetricians, oncologists, and a perinatologist formulated a treatment plan that would prioritize the well-being of both the patient and the baby.

Chemotherapy options compatible with pregnancy were discussed, and the patient opted to undergo modified chemotherapy treatment. Regular surveillance and monitoring of both the cancer progression and fetal well-being were scheduled to ensure the safest outcome for both.

In conclusion, a 36-year-old pregnant farmer presented with abdominal pain and weight loss, leading to a diagnosis of advanced-stage breast cancer with liver metastasis. A multidisciplinary approach was undertaken to manage both the cancer and the pregnancy, with modified chemotherapy tailored to the patient's individual needs. Regular monitoring and surveillance were crucial to ensure the best possible outcome for both the patient and the unborn baby.
