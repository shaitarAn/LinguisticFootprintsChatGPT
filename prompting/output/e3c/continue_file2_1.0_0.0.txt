On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and had a distended abdomen with visible dilated veins on the abdominal wall. There were no signs of jaundice, lymphadenopathy, or palpable masses. Vital signs were stable, and her blood pressure was within the normal range.

Given her symptoms and physical findings, the initial differential diagnosis included gastrointestinal malignancy, peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, and liver disease. Laboratory investigations were ordered, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and tumor markers.

The complete blood count showed a mild normocytic anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL. Liver function tests were within normal limits, as were coagulation parameters. Tumor markers, including alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen, were also within normal range.

An abdominal ultrasound was performed, revealing a dilated common bile duct and intraductal calculi. The gallbladder appeared contracted, with no evidence of cholecystitis. The pancreas and liver appeared normal, with no masses or lesions identified.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, or gallstones in the common bile duct, was made. The patient was counseled about the condition and the need for further evaluation and management. Due to the advanced stage of her pregnancy, it was decided to manage the condition conservatively with close monitoring and symptomatic management.

The patient was started on pain medication to alleviate her symptoms and was advised to follow a low-fat diet to minimize the risk of further biliary obstruction. Regular antenatal check-ups were scheduled to assess the well-being of the fetus and the mother.

A multidisciplinary team, including a gastroenterologist and an obstetrician, was involved in the patient's care. Regular communication and coordination between the team members ensured that appropriate management decisions were made considering both the patient's medical condition and her pregnancy.

Throughout the remainder of her pregnancy, the patient's symptoms remained stable, with no further worsening of abdominal pain or complications. At 37 weeks gestation, the patient went into spontaneous labor and delivered a healthy baby via vaginal delivery.

Following delivery, the patient underwent an elective cholecystectomy to remove the gallstones and prevent future complications. The procedure was performed without any complications, and the patient recovered well postoperatively.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of careful evaluation and management of abdominal pain in pregnant patients. Close collaboration between different specialties can lead to successful outcomes, ensuring the well-being of both the mother and the baby.
