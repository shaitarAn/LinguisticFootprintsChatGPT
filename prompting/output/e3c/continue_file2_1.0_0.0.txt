On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and malnourished. Her vital signs were within normal limits. The abdominal examination revealed tenderness over the epigastric region with no rebound tenderness or guarding. There were no palpable masses or organomegaly. The fetal heart rate was normal, and there were no signs suggestive of fetal distress.

Given her history of significant weight loss, abdominal pain, and possible radiation to the chest, the differential diagnosis included various conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, biliary tract disease, gastrointestinal malignancy, and pancreatitis. Laboratory investigations were ordered to further evaluate her condition.

The patient's complete blood count showed mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL. Liver function tests were within normal limits. Serum amylase and lipase levels were also within normal range, ruling out acute pancreatitis. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which revealed a homogeneous hepatic mass measuring 5 cm in diameter. The common bile duct and pancreatic duct appeared normal. There were no other significant findings.

To further evaluate the hepatic mass, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was recommended. The CT scan revealed a hypervascular mass in the liver consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There were no signs of metastasis to the other organs.

The patient was referred to an oncologist for further management of her HCC. Considering her advanced stage of pregnancy, a multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians, oncologists, and hepatologists was assembled to determine the best approach for her treatment.

Options such as surgical resection, locoregional therapies (transarterial chemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation), and systemic therapy (such as sorafenib) were discussed. However, due to the advanced stage of her cancer and the risks associated with treatment during pregnancy, it was decided to defer treatment until after delivery.

Regular antenatal care was continued to monitor the well-being of the mother and the fetus. Close surveillance of the liver mass was also maintained through regular imaging studies. The patient was educated about the signs and symptoms of complications associated with her condition and advised to seek immediate medical attention if she experienced any abdominal pain, jaundice, or other concerning symptoms.

The patient delivered a healthy baby via elective cesarean section at 38 weeks gestation. The post-operative course was uneventful for both mother and baby. A few weeks after delivery, the patient underwent an extensive evaluation for treatment options. Unfortunately, the tumor had progressed and was no longer amenable to surgical resection.

The patient was started on systemic therapy with sorafenib, which is an oral targeted therapy for advanced HCC. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to assess her response to treatment and monitor any adverse effects. Despite the challenging prognosis, the patient remained optimistic and sought support from her family and healthcare team.

In conclusion, the case of the 36-year-old pregnant farmer with abdominal pain led to the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The management of her condition was complicated by the advanced stage of pregnancy, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach and careful consideration of treatment options. The patient's well-being and that of her baby were closely monitored throughout the pregnancy and treatment journey, with a focus on providing the best possible care and support.
