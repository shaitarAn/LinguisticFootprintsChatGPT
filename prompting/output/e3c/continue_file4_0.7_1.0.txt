On examination, baby NU appeared active and alert. He had a normal heart rate and respiratory rate. However, upon closer inspection, it was evident that the baby had very distinct abnormalities in his physical appearance. 

The absence of skin and skull bone at birth was a concerning finding. The exposed tissues were covered with a thin translucent membrane, leaving the underlying structures visible to the naked eye. This condition is known as Congenital Ectodermal Dysplasia (CED). 

The medical team quickly consulted with various specialists to determine the best course of action for baby NU's condition. Geneticists, pediatric surgeons, and dermatologists all came together to discuss possible causes and treatment options.

Given the family history of consanguinity (parents being cousins), genetic disorders were suspected as potential contributors to this rare condition. Further tests were ordered to confirm this hypothesis.

In addition to genetic testing, imaging studies such as CT scans were scheduled to evaluate any internal complications caused by the absence of skull bone. Neurological evaluations were also planned since there was concern about brain development.

Meanwhile, supportive care measures were initiated for baby NU's immediate well-being. The exposed areas on his head were carefully covered with sterile dressings to protect them from infection and trauma.

The parents received counseling regarding their child's condition and its implications for future pregnancies within their family setting.

As days went by, test results started coming in one by one. Genetic testing revealed a mutation in a gene associated with CED called TP63 gene mutation - confirming the diagnosis.

Further imaging studies showed no major internal complications related to cranial defects; however, close monitoring was advised throughout his development due to potential long-term effects on brain growth.

The medical team collaborated closely with plastic surgeons who specialized in reconstructive procedures for congenital anomalies like CED â€“ exploring surgical options that would help normalize NU's appearance over time.

In addition to surgical interventions, ongoing multidisciplinary care involving dermatologists, geneticists, and pediatricians was planned to address NU's complex medical needs.

Throughout this process, the parents were provided with emotional support and resources to help them cope with the challenges of raising a child with unique healthcare requirements.

Baby NU's journey was just beginning. The road ahead would be filled with numerous medical interventions and ongoing care. However, with a dedicated team of healthcare professionals and an involved family, everyone remained hopeful for his future.
