A 42-year-old male construction worker, gravida 0 para 0, presented to our facility with a chief complaint of persistent epigastric abdominal pain for the past 2 months. The pain was described as gradual in onset, dull, and constant. Over time, the pain had progressively worsened, and the patient reported occasional radiation to his back. He denied any relieving or aggravating factors associated with the pain.

The patient also reported unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the past 2 months. However, he denied experiencing early satiety, jaundice, fever, itch, or any spontaneous bleeding episodes. There was no history of blood transfusion, and the patient had been taking over-the-counter multivitamins regularly.

Upon further inquiry, the patient revealed a history of occasional alcohol consumption, with an average of two drinks per week. He denied any tobacco or illicit drug use. His medical history was unremarkable, with no known chronic illnesses or previous surgeries.

Physical examination revealed a well-nourished male in no acute distress. Vital signs were within normal limits, and the patient appeared comfortable. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the epigastric region, without any palpable masses or organomegaly. There were no signs of jaundice or peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Given the patient's persistent abdominal pain and unintentional weight loss, further investigations were warranted. Laboratory tests were ordered, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and serum amylase and lipase levels. Results revealed a mild elevation in liver enzymes, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels of 80 U/L and 70 U/L, respectively (normal range: ALT < 40 U/L, AST < 35 U/L). The complete blood count and serum amylase and lipase levels were within normal limits.

To further evaluate the patient's symptoms, an abdominal ultrasound was performed. The ultrasound revealed a dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm, with no evidence of gallstones or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The liver appeared normal in size and echotexture, and there were no focal lesions or signs of cirrhosis. The pancreas appeared unremarkable, with no evidence of masses or ductal dilatation.

Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, a diagnosis of choledocholithiasis was suspected. The patient was referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed, confirming the presence of a common bile duct stone. The stone was successfully removed during the procedure, and the patient's symptoms gradually resolved.

In conclusion, this case highlights a middle-aged male presenting with persistent epigastric abdominal pain and unintentional weight loss. The diagnosis of choledocholithiasis was made based on clinical suspicion and confirmed by ERCP. Early recognition and appropriate management of this condition are crucial to prevent complications such as cholangitis or pancreatitis.
