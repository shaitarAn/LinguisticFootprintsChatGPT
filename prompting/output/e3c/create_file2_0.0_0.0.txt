A 32-year-old female teacher gravida 3 para 2 at 28 weeks gestation presented to our facility with a chief complaint of persistent epigastric abdominal pain for the past 2 months. The pain was described as dull and constant, gradually worsening over time. The patient also reported occasional radiation of the pain to her back. She denied any relieving or aggravating factors associated with the pain. There was no significant weight loss, early satiety, jaundice, fever, itching, or spontaneous bleeding. The patient had no history of blood transfusion and was taking routine prenatal vitamins from the antenatal clinic.

The patient had no known chronic illnesses and denied any history of diabetes, hypertension, alcohol consumption, or smoking. She had no exposure to chemicals or ionizing radiation. On physical examination, the patient appeared well-hydrated, afebrile, and had no palpable lymph nodes. Mild pallor was noted, but there were no signs of jaundice or clubbing. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.

Abdominal examination revealed a grossly distended abdomen with a distorted contour in the upper half. Anterior abdominal wall veins were visibly distended, draining away from the umbilicus. The liver was palpable and enlarged, measuring 11 cm below the costal margin with a span of 16 cm. It felt hard, nodular, and had an irregular edge. Mild tenderness was noted, and a bruit was auscultated over the liver. The spleen was not palpable, but mild ascites and bipedal edema up to the mid-shin were present. Symphysio fundal height was 27 cm, indicating appropriate fetal growth. Fetal heart rate was 138 bpm and regular. Rectal and vaginal examinations were unremarkable.

Initial diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in pregnancy was made based on the clinical presentation and examination findings. Laboratory assessment revealed a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9,800 cells/dL. Neutrophils accounted for 62.5% of the total count, lymphocytes 28.3%, monocytes 7.2%, and eosinophils 1.9%. Platelet count was within normal limits at 320,000/Î¼L. Liver function tests showed elevated levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), four times the upper limit of normal. Total protein and albumin levels were low, measuring 42 g/L and 28 g/L, respectively. International normalized ratio (INR) was slightly elevated at 1.2. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was positive, while hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was negative. The patient's HBV DNA level was 98,500 IU/mL. Serological tests for HIV and HCV were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions. The liver measured 16.8 cm, and mild ascites were noted. A pelvic scan confirmed a 28-week, 4-day-old fetus with active fetal movements.

A revised diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation in pregnancy was made. The patient was managed with analgesics, furosemide, spironolactone, and lamivudine was added to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B infection. The plan was to continue the pregnancy until at least 32 completed weeks to improve the chances of neonatal survival. However, due to the worsening abdominal pain, the pregnancy was terminated at 30 weeks and 5 days by successful induction of labor. The outcome was a fresh stillbirth weighing 1.3 kg. Post-delivery, the patient experienced a significant reduction in pain and was discharged home after 5 days. She was scheduled for a follow-up visit at the gastrointestinal clinic. The patient attended the clinic at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-discharge but was subsequently lost to follow-up.
