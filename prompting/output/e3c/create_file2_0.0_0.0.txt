A 42-year-old male construction worker, with no significant past medical history, presented to our clinic with a chief complaint of persistent epigastric abdominal pain for the past 2 months. The pain was described as gradual in onset, dull, and constant. Over time, the pain had progressively worsened, and the patient reported occasional radiation to his back. 

The patient also reported unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the past 2 months. However, he denied experiencing any early satiety, jaundice, fever, itchiness, or spontaneous bleeding. There was no history of blood transfusion, and the patient had been compliant with his routine multivitamin supplementation.

On further inquiry, the patient mentioned occasional episodes of heartburn and acid reflux, which he attributed to his irregular eating habits due to his demanding work schedule. He denied any relief or aggravation of symptoms with specific foods or activities.

Physical examination revealed a well-nourished individual with no signs of distress. Vital signs were within normal limits, and there were no abnormalities noted on cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurological examination. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness on palpation in the epigastric region, without any rebound tenderness or guarding.

Given the patient's age and the persistence of symptoms, further investigations were warranted. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and pancreatic enzymes, were ordered. Results revealed no significant abnormalities, except for a mild elevation in liver enzymes, which could be attributed to his recent weight loss.

To further evaluate the cause of the patient's symptoms, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. The procedure revealed evidence of erosive gastritis and a small hiatal hernia. Biopsies were taken from the gastric mucosa for histopathological examination.

The patient was started on proton pump inhibitors to alleviate his symptoms of acid reflux and gastritis. He was also advised to make dietary modifications, including avoiding spicy and fatty foods, eating smaller and more frequent meals, and maintaining a regular eating schedule. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment to discuss the biopsy results and assess his response to treatment.

In conclusion, a 42-year-old male construction worker presented with persistent epigastric abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, and occasional heartburn. Initial investigations revealed erosive gastritis and a small hiatal hernia. Treatment was initiated with proton pump inhibitors and dietary modifications. Further evaluation of the biopsy results will guide the management plan for this patient.
