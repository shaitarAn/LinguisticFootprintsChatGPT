This clinical case involves a young woman who has a history of callosotomy at the age of 6 to control her seizures. Callosotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting the corpus callosum, which is the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. This procedure is typically done in cases of severe epilepsy that cannot be controlled with medication alone.

At the age of 18, she had a laser treatment to remove a port wine birthmark, and this triggered her first seizure since the callosotomy. Following this seizure, she was prescribed carbamazepine, an antiepileptic medication, at a daily dose of 400 mg. Since starting this medication, she has not experienced any further seizures.

According to her parents, she had a normal development during infancy, but she has struggled academically and is barely literate. There is no significant family history, except for her elder sister who also has a port wine stain on her face. However, her sister does not have any features of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), and no further investigations have been done regarding her birthmark.

In addition to her seizure medication, the patient is also taking ketiapin and venlafaxine for anxiety disorder and chronic headaches. She is also prescribed NSAID drugs for her headaches. After one week of this treatment, her headaches have slightly decreased in intensity but the frequency remains the same.

During her physical examination, a facial nevus (a type of birthmark) is observed on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. Intraoral examination reveals an overgrowth of gingiva (gums) on the right side, which appears bright red in color and blanches when pressure is applied, suggesting angiomatous enlargement. Mild asymmetry is also noted in her extremities, with her left arm and leg being slightly smaller and exhibiting hemiparesis (weakness) in both the upper and lower extremities of the same size.

On ophthalmological evaluation, she is diagnosed with glaucoma in her right eye. Psychiatric examination reveals signs of anxiety disorder, and her neurological examination is unremarkable except for the hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans show diffuse atrophy (shrinkage) in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area.

Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI reveals multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere, along with the diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI shows increased thickness of the right calvarium (skull) compared to the left, and the right hemisphere is asymmetrically smaller than the left. Additionally, T2 weighted MRI shows extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle and at the Gallen vein localization. Widespread vascular formations are also seen at the perivascular space, anterior to the third ventricle at Willis polygon localization, and at the right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern localization.

Based on her clinical presentation and imaging findings, she undergoes a proteus intelligence test, which reveals a score of 75, indicating mild mental retardation.

In summary, this clinical case involves a young woman who had a callosotomy at a young age to control her seizures. Following a laser treatment for a birthmark, she experienced her first seizure since the callosotomy. She was prescribed carbamazepine, which successfully controlled her seizures. However, she has struggled academically and has signs of anxiety disorder. Further investigations revealed physical abnormalities, including a facial nevus, gingival overgrowth, hemiparesis, glaucoma, and brain abnormalities seen on imaging. She was diagnosed with mild mental retardation based on her intelligence test results.
