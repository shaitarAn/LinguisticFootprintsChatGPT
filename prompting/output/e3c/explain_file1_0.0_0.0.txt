This clinical case involves a young woman who had a callosotomy procedure at the age of 6 to control her seizures. Callosotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting the corpus callosum, which is the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. This procedure is sometimes done in cases of severe epilepsy to prevent the spread of seizures from one side of the brain to the other.

At the age of 18, she had a seizure for the first time since the callosotomy during a laser treatment for her port wine birthmark. Following this seizure, she was prescribed carbamazepine, an antiepileptic medication, and has not had any seizures since then.

According to her parents, she had a normal development during infancy, but she struggled academically and has limited literacy skills. There is no significant family history, except for her elder sister also having a port wine birthmark, although no further investigations were done regarding her sister's condition.

In addition to her seizure medication, she is also taking ketiapin and venlafaxine for anxiety disorder and chronic headaches. She is also prescribed NSAID drugs for her headaches. After a week of this treatment, her headaches improved slightly in terms of heaviness, but the frequency remained the same.

During her physical examination, a facial nevus (a type of birthmark) was observed on her right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. Intraoral examination revealed an overgrowth of gingiva (gums) on the right side, which appeared bright red and showed blanching when pressure was applied, suggesting angiomatous enlargement (enlargement due to blood vessel abnormalities).

Mild asymmetry was noted in her extremities, with her left arm and leg being slightly smaller and showing hemiparesis (weakness or paralysis) in both the upper and lower extremities of the same size. She was also diagnosed with glaucoma in her right eye during her ophthalmological evaluation.

On psychiatric examination, she showed signs of anxiety disorder. Neurological examination did not reveal any remarkable findings except for the hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy (shrinkage) in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications (abnormal calcium deposits in the brain) in the right occipital area.

Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures (abnormal blood vessels) on the right hemisphere, along with the diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI showed right calvarial thickness compared to the left, and the right hemisphere was asymmetrically smaller than the left. T2 weighted MRI showed extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle and at the Gallen vein localization. Widespread vascular formations were also seen at the perivascular space, anterior to the third ventricle at Willis polygon localization, and at the right temporooccipital area at quadrigeminal cistern localization.

She underwent a proteus intelligence test, which revealed a score of 75, indicating mild mental retardation.

Based on the information provided, it appears that this patient has a complex medical condition involving neurological, ophthalmological, and psychiatric manifestations. The presence of a port wine birthmark, glaucoma, hemiparesis, and abnormal brain imaging findings suggests a possible diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). SWS is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the presence of a facial nevus (port wine birthmark), glaucoma, and abnormal blood vessel formations in the brain. It can also be associated with intellectual disability and seizures, which may explain the patient's history of seizures and cognitive impairment. However, a definitive diagnosis would require further evaluation and confirmation by a medical professional.
