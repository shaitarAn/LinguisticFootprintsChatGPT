This clinical case describes a patient diagnosed with schizophrenia type ICD 10 F20.3 who was treated with Haloperidol and Diazepam for their psychiatric symptoms. The patient exhibited rebellious and self-destructive behavior, requiring occasional restraint. However, the focus of this case is on the nutrition management of the patient.

The initial nutrition assessment revealed that the patient was underweight, with a BMI of 17.57 kg/m2. The patient's weight loss was attributed to refusal of food, as reported by their mother. The patient only consumed cigarettes and coffee.

Based on the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient was classified as severely malnourished (group C). To address this, energy and protein supplementation were initiated gradually, starting from 30 kcal/kg and increasing to 50 kcal/kg. Oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) were given in a 50:50 ratio.

Micronutrient supplementation included vitamin A (100,000 units for the first week), vitamin C (100 mg three times a day), and zinc (20 mg once a day).

Despite these interventions, the patient continued to lose weight during early hospitalization weeks. On day 28, body weight dropped to 36 kilograms with serum albumin level at 2.7 gr/L; on day 42 it further declined to 32 kilograms with serum albumin level at 2 gr/L.

Due to ongoing weight loss and complications such as poor appetite, pain writhing episodes, aggression, difficulty with enteral access for feeding tube placement or administration of medications like analgesics or sedatives; partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was administered to support protein needs.

By day 66 of hospitalization granulation tissues appeared on wound bed indicating some healing progress but considering mental health status along with persistent nutritional challenges including severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss, the decision was made not to proceed with skin graft surgery.

At discharge, the patient had lost 24% of body weight (BMI 11.96 kg/m2) and had a serum albumin level of 2.5 gr/L. Despite these physical challenges, there was some improvement in the general and mental condition of the patient.

It's important to note that this case highlights the complex interplay between mental health disorders such as schizophrenia and nutritional status, as well as challenges in managing patients with severe malnutrition who are uncooperative or non-responsive to conventional interventions.
