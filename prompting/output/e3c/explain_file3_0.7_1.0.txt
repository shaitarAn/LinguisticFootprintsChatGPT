This clinical case involves a 35-year-old mentally ill man who was admitted to the hospital after attempting suicide by fire. He suffered burns on approximately 38% of his total body surface area (TBSA), including his face, neck, upper extremities, thighs, legs, and trunk. The patient had schizophrenia and was being treated with Haloperidol and Diazepam for his mental illness.

The patient had been restrained at times due to his rebellious and self-destructive behavior. His nutrition management began late, about a week after hospitalization when he weighed only 40 kg with a height of 150 cm, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m2 which is considered underweight.

There were no gastrointestinal symptoms or signs found in the initial assessment. Information regarding the patient's dietary intake in the past two weeks and weight changes over the last six months was not available. However, according to the patient's mother, he seemed to have lost weight as he refused food offered to him and only consumed cigarettes and coffee.

The patient's albumin level was 3.6 g/L with imbalanced electrolyte levels but no fluid accumulation signs were observed. According to subjective global assessment (SGA), the patient was severely malnourished (group C). To address this malnutrition, energy and protein supplementation were started gradually from 30 kcal/kg increasing up to 50 kcal/kg along with oral nutrition supplements (ONS) divided between oral intake and ONS at a ratio of 50:50.

Micronutrient supplementations were also given including vitamin A for the first week (100,000 units), vitamin C three times daily (100 mg each), and zinc once daily (20 mg). Despite these interventions during early hospitalization weeks, there continued to be weight loss observed.

By day 28 of hospitalization, the patient's body weight dropped further to 33 kg with a serum albumin level of 2.1 g/L. The energy and protein intake were maintained, but the ratio of oral intake and ONS was modified to 70:30 due to unstable appetite. The patient also displayed pain and aggression, with poor response to analgesics and sedatives.

To support his protein needs, partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was administered. However, his BMI continued to decline, reaching 32 kg on day 42 with a serum albumin level of 2 g/L.

On day 66, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed. Considering the patient's mental state and nutritional status, it was decided not to proceed with skin graft surgery. At this point, the patient had lost a total of 24% body weight (BMI of 11.96 kg/m2), but his general and mental condition had improved relatively.

The patient was eventually discharged from the hospital in this malnourished state but displaying better overall health condition compared to earlier stages in his treatment journey.
