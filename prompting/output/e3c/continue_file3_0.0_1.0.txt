During his 66-day hospitalization, the 35-year-old mentally ill man received comprehensive care to address his physical and mental health needs. The primary focus was on managing his extensive burn injuries, which covered approximately 38% of his total body surface area (TBSA). These burns included full- and partial-thickness injuries on various parts of his body.

The patient's face and neck were particularly affected, accounting for approximately 5% of the total burn area. This presented a significant challenge as burns in these areas can have severe functional and cosmetic implications. The medical team worked diligently to prevent complications such as contractures that could impair the patient's ability to eat, speak, or breathe properly.

In addition to facial burns, both upper extremities were also affected, comprising around 8% of the TBSA. Burn injuries in this region can lead to limited mobility and impaired hand function. To mitigate these potential issues, occupational therapists played a crucial role in providing early mobilization exercises and splinting techniques to promote optimal healing and restore functionality.

The patient's right thigh sustained a burn injury covering approximately 4% of the TBSA while his left thigh and leg accounted for around 3%. Burns on lower extremities pose unique challenges due to their susceptibility to infection and difficulties with wound healing caused by reduced blood flow compared to other areas of the body. Close monitoring for signs of infection was essential throughout the patient's treatment journey.

The most extensive burn area encompassed most of the anterior (front) and posterior (back) trunk regions at approximately 16% TBSA. Such large burns require meticulous wound care management involving regular debridement surgeries – a process where dead or damaged tissue is removed – performed five times during this patient's hospital stay. Debridement helps promote healing by preventing infection while facilitating healthy tissue growth.

Beyond addressing physical wounds, it was crucial for healthcare professionals involved in this patient's care to address his mental health needs. The attempted suicide by fire indicated a significant underlying mental illness that required attention and treatment. A multidisciplinary team, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers, collaborated to provide comprehensive psychiatric care.

The patient received regular counseling sessions to address the emotional trauma associated with his suicide attempt and subsequent burn injuries. Psychiatric medications were prescribed as needed to manage any underlying mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety.

Throughout his hospitalization, the patient also participated in group therapy sessions where he could connect with others who had experienced similar challenges. These sessions provided a supportive environment for him to share his feelings and learn coping strategies from peers who understood the unique struggles associated with burn injuries.

As part of the rehabilitation process, physical therapists worked closely with the patient to gradually increase mobility and strength while minimizing scarring and contractures. Occupational therapists focused on improving daily living skills such as dressing, grooming, and self-care activities.

After 66 days of intensive medical care encompassing multiple surgeries, wound management procedures, psychiatric support, and rehabilitation efforts from various healthcare professionals working collaboratively as a team; this mentally ill man showed significant progress in both physical healing and psychological well-being.

Upon discharge from the hospital setting, he was referred for ongoing outpatient therapy services that would continue addressing his mental health needs while supporting him in reintegrating into society after this traumatic experience. The journey towards recovery would be ongoing but marked by resilience on both personal and professional fronts – a testament to the power of comprehensive care for individuals facing complex challenges like severe burn injuries combined with mental illness.
