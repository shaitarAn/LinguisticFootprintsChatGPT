During his hospitalization, the patient received extensive wound care and underwent multiple skin grafting procedures to promote healing and prevent infection. The medical team closely monitored his vital signs, administered pain medication, and provided psychological support to address the underlying mental health issues that contributed to his suicide attempt.

The initial debridement surgeries were performed to remove necrotic tissue and prepare the wounds for grafting. These procedures involved meticulous cleaning of the burn wounds followed by excision of any dead or damaged tissue. The patient's burns were categorized as both full-thickness (third-degree) and partial-thickness (second-degree), indicating varying degrees of damage to the layers of skin.

After each debridement surgery, dressings were applied to protect the exposed areas and promote a moist wound environment conducive to healing. The medical team utilized specialized dressings such as hydrogels or silver-impregnated dressings that have antimicrobial properties.

Skin grafting was performed at different stages throughout the patient's hospital stay. This procedure involves taking healthy skin from an unaffected area of the body (known as a donor site) and transplanting it onto the burned areas. Split-thickness skin grafts were used for larger areas while full-thickness grafts were employed for smaller, more delicate regions like the face.

Following each skin graft procedure, careful monitoring was necessary to ensure proper adherence of the transplanted skin and prevent complications such as infection or rejection. Dressings were changed regularly, with close attention paid to signs of infection or poor healing progress.

In addition to wound care, comprehensive rehabilitation services played a crucial role in this patient's recovery journey. Physical therapy helped maintain joint mobility while occupational therapy focused on regaining functional independence in daily activities such as dressing, grooming, and feeding.

Psychiatric support was also an integral part of his treatment plan during his extended hospital stay. Mental health professionals worked closely with him through individual counseling sessions aimed at addressing the underlying issues contributing to his suicide attempt. Medication management was also provided to stabilize his mental health condition.

After 66 days of intensive care, the patient's wounds showed significant improvement, with healthy granulation tissue forming and grafts successfully integrating into the burned areas. He was discharged from the hospital with a comprehensive aftercare plan that included regular follow-up appointments, continued psychiatric support, and ongoing wound care.

The patient's journey serves as a reminder of the complex nature of treating individuals with mental illness who have experienced severe burn injuries. It highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving medical, surgical, psychiatric, and rehabilitative interventions to achieve optimal outcomes for these patients.
