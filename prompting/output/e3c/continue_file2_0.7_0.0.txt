On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and had a distended abdomen. Blood pressure was within normal limits, but her heart rate was slightly elevated. The abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the epigastric region, and there was no palpable mass or organomegaly. The fetal heart rate was normal.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, further investigations were ordered. Laboratory tests showed mild anemia, with hemoglobin levels of 10.5 g/dL. Liver function tests, renal function tests, and coagulation profile were all within normal limits. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which revealed a large, hypoechoic mass in the epigastric region, measuring approximately 8 cm in diameter. The mass was compressing the stomach and causing mild gastric dilation.

Based on these findings, a provisional diagnosis of gastric cancer was made. The patient was referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management. A gastroscopy was scheduled, and a biopsy of the mass was taken during the procedure.

The biopsy results confirmed the diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma. The patient was informed about her diagnosis and the treatment options available. Due to her advanced pregnancy, a multidisciplinary team was involved in the decision-making process. It was decided that immediate surgical intervention was necessary to remove the tumor and prevent further complications. The patient was counseled about the risks and benefits of the surgery and provided informed consent.

The surgery was performed successfully, and the tumor was completely resected. The histopathology report showed a moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma with no evidence of lymph node involvement. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged from the hospital after a few days.

Post-operatively, the patient was referred to an oncologist for further management. Given her pregnancy, chemotherapy was not recommended at that time. Instead, close surveillance with regular follow-up appointments and imaging studies were planned to monitor for any recurrence or metastasis.

The patient continued her antenatal care alongside her oncology appointments. She delivered a healthy baby at term without any complications. After completion of her postpartum period, she started adjuvant chemotherapy to further reduce the risk of recurrence.

Over the following years, the patient remained in remission and continued to receive regular surveillance. She adopted a healthy lifestyle and participated in support groups for cancer survivors. With ongoing medical care and emotional support, she was able to navigate through the challenges of being a cancer survivor and a mother.
