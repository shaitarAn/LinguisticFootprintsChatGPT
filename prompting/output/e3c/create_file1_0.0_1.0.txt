Clinical Case: A 25-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) presenting with chronic headaches was admitted to our clinic. He had a history of recurrent non-pulsating headaches for the past 3 years. The headaches were not exacerbated by physical activity and responded well to over-the-counter pain relievers. There were no associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or visual disturbances.

The patient had a significant medical history of seizures since childhood, which led to his diagnosis of NF1 at the age of 5. His seizures were characterized by generalized tonic-clonic contractions and were effectively controlled with antiepileptic medication. At the age of 15, he underwent surgical resection for an optic glioma that was causing visual impairment.

During his current admission, it was noted that he had difficulty with cognitive tasks and struggled academically throughout his schooling years despite having normal development in infancy. Family history revealed no similar conditions except for his younger brother who also had NF1 but did not exhibit any neurological or cognitive abnormalities.

On physical examination, multiple café-au-lait macules were observed on various parts of his body along with cutaneous neurofibromas scattered across his trunk and extremities. Ophthalmological evaluation revealed optic nerve gliomas bilaterally without any signs of glaucoma or visual field defects.

Neurological examination showed no focal deficits except for mild weakness in the left upper limb compared to the right side. Cranial CT scans demonstrated bilateral optic nerve thickening consistent with optic gliomas and diffuse cortical atrophy predominantly involving the frontal lobes bilaterally.

Further imaging studies using MRI revealed extensive plexiform neurofibromas involving multiple cranial nerves along their course bilaterally. Additionally, T2-weighted MRI sequences showed hyperintense lesions within deep white matter tracts suggestive of hamartomatous nodules characteristic of NF1.

Psychometric testing using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale revealed an overall IQ score of 70, consistent with mild intellectual disability. The patient was referred to a multidisciplinary team including neurology, genetics, and psychiatry for comprehensive management.

In conclusion, this case highlights a 25-year-old male patient with NF1 presenting with chronic headaches and associated cognitive impairment. The presence of café-au-lait macules, cutaneous neurofibromas, optic gliomas, and cortical atrophy on imaging studies further supported the diagnosis. Multidisciplinary care involving neurology, genetics counseling, ophthalmology, and psychiatry was initiated to address the various aspects of his condition.
