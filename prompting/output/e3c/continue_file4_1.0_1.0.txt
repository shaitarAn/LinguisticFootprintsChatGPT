On examination, baby NU appeared markedly underdeveloped. His head circumference was 28 cm, which is significantly smaller than the average for an infant his age. The fontanelles were wide open and there was absence of any bony tissue on palpation. Additionally, the skin covering the skull and parts of the face was absent, revealing a reddish appearance due to visible blood vessels.

Further investigations were ordered to determine the cause of these abnormalities. Genetic testing was performed in order to assess for any underlying genetic disorders that could explain NU's condition. The results showed a mutation in a gene responsible for normal bone and skin growth.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of Aplasia Cutis Congenita (ACC) with cranial involvement was made. ACC is a rare condition characterized by localized or widespread absence of skin at birth which can be associated with other abnormalities such as defects in bone development.

The consanguineous relationship between NU's parents increased the likelihood of him inheriting genetic mutations from both sides of his family tree. This genetic predisposition contributed to his susceptibility for developing ACC.

During counseling sessions with NU's parents, it became apparent that they were unaware of their increased risk due to their familial connection. They expressed deep concern and asked about treatment options available for their son.

Treatment options for ACC depend on various factors such as the extent and severity of the condition as well as individual patient characteristics. In some cases, conservative management involving wound care and protection may be sufficient if complications such as infection are avoided.

However, considering NU's extensive involvement with absence not only in soft tissues but also in bony structures, surgical intervention would be necessary to address both aesthetic concerns and potential functional limitations he might face later in life.

NU's parents agreed to consult with a team of plastic surgeons specializing in reconstructive procedures at another hospital known for its expertise with deformities like those displayed by baby NU.

In consultation with the plastic surgeons and considering the overall health of baby NU, a staged surgical approach was planned. This would involve multiple surgeries to gradually reconstruct the missing skull bones and skin, tailored to NU's individual needs.

The medical team also emphasized the importance of close follow-up care to monitor his progress and ensure proper healing. Rehabilitation specialists were also involved in planning for future physical therapy sessions once surgical interventions were completed.

The journey ahead was daunting for baby NU and his family, but with their determination and support from a dedicated healthcare team, they remained hopeful that NU could lead a fulfilled life despite his condition. The focus would be on providing him with the best possible care, both medically and emotionally, in order to maximize his quality of life as he grows.
