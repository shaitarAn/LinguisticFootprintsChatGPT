This clinical case involves a young woman who had a callosotomy procedure at the age of 6 to control her seizures. Callosotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting the corpus callosum, which is a thick band of nerve fibers that connects the two hemispheres of the brain. The purpose of this procedure is to prevent the spread of seizures from one hemisphere to the other.

At the age of 18, she had a seizure for the first time since her callosotomy procedure while undergoing laser treatment to remove her port wine birthmark. Following this seizure, she was prescribed carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant medication, at a daily dose of 400 mg. Since then, she has not experienced any further seizures.

However, her parents report that she had difficulties with her cognitive development, and she struggled academically. She barely graduated from elementary school and has limited literacy skills. There is no significant family history, except for her elder sister who also has a port wine stain but does not exhibit any other features of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). No further investigations were performed regarding her sister's birthmark.

In addition to her seizure medication, the patient is also prescribed ketiapin and venlafaxine for anxiety disorder and chronic headaches. She is also taking NSAIDs for her headaches. Although her headaches have slightly improved in terms of heaviness, their frequency remains the same.

During her physical examination, a facial nevus is observed on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. The examination of her mouth reveals an overgrowth of gingiva (gum tissue) on the right side, which appears red and blanches (turns pale) when pressure is applied, indicating an angiomatous enlargement.

There is also mild asymmetry noted in her extremities, with her left arm and leg being slightly smaller and exhibiting hemiparesis (weakness or paralysis on one side of the body) in both the upper and lower extremities of the same size.

On ophthalmological evaluation, she is diagnosed with glaucoma in her right eye. During her psychiatric examination, signs of anxiety disorder are observed. Neurological examination does not reveal any remarkable findings, except for the hemiparesis.

Cranial CT scans show diffuse atrophy (shrinkage) in the right hemisphere of the brain and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications (calcium deposits in the brain tissue) in the right occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI reveals multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures (blood vessels on the surface of the brain) in the right hemisphere, along with the diffuse atrophy on the same side.

Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI shows increased thickness of the right calvarium (skull) compared to the left side, and the right hemisphere appears smaller than the left side. Additionally, T2 weighted MRI shows extensive venous formations (abnormal blood vessels) around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle (cavities in the brain) and at various other locations in the brain, including the perivascular space, anterior to the third ventricle, and in the right temporooccipital area.

The patient undergoes a proteus intelligence test, which assesses cognitive abilities, and she scores 75 points. Based on this score, she is classified as mildly mentally retarded.

In summary, this clinical case involves a young woman with a history of callosotomy for seizures, who later experienced a seizure during laser treatment for her port wine birthmark. She is prescribed carbamazepine to control her seizures, but she has cognitive difficulties and is classified as mildly mentally retarded. She also has physical manifestations of Sturge-Weber syndrome, including a facial nevus, gingival overgrowth, hemiparesis, glaucoma, and abnormal findings on brain imaging.
