This clinical case describes a 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). SWS is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the presence of a port-wine stain birthmark on the face, glaucoma, and abnormal blood vessel formations in the brain.

The patient presented with a history of frequent non-pulsating headaches lasting for hours. These headaches were relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and were not worsened by physical activity. There were no accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura. The patient also had a history of seizures, which were first diagnosed in the fifteenth day of life. She underwent a callosotomy procedure at the age of 6 to control the seizures. However, at the age of 18, she experienced a seizure after laser treatment for her birthmark. Since then, she has been taking carbamazepine and has not had any further seizures.

In addition to the headaches and seizures, the patient had developmental delays and was described as barely literate. Her family history was negative for SWS, except for her elder sister who had a port-wine stain birthmark but did not undergo any further investigations. The patient was also diagnosed with anxiety disorder and was prescribed medications for anxiety and chronic headaches.

On physical examination, the patient had a facial nevus (port-wine stain) on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. Intraoral examination revealed gingival overgrowth on the right side, which appeared red and showed blanching when pressure was applied. She also had mild asymmetry in her extremities, with her left arm and leg being slightly smaller and exhibiting hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body).

Ophthalmological evaluation confirmed glaucoma in the right eye. Psychiatric examination revealed signs of anxiety disorder. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for the hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures in the right hemisphere, along with diffuse atrophy on the same side. The MRI also showed asymmetry in calvarial thickness, with the right side being thicker than the left. Additionally, there were extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle and widespread vascular formations in various locations.

The patient underwent a proteus intelligence test, which revealed a score of 75, indicating mild mental retardation.

In summary, this clinical case describes a young female patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome presenting with frequent headaches, seizures, developmental delays, glaucoma, and various brain abnormalities on imaging. The patient also had a facial nevus and gingival overgrowth, consistent with the characteristic features of SWS.
