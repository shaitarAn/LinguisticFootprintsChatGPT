Case Study: A 42-year-old Mentally Ill Woman with Extensive Burn Injuries

Introduction:
A 42-year-old mentally ill woman was admitted to our hospital following a suicide attempt by self-immolation. She sustained full-thickness burns covering approximately 45% of her total body surface area (TBSA), including the face and neck (8%), both upper extremities (12%), lower extremities (10%), and anterior and posterior trunk (15%). The patient was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (ICD 10 F31.9) and was on a combination of Quetiapine 200mg and Sodium Valproate 1000mg daily. Due to her agitated and self-destructive behavior, she required occasional physical restraints for her safety.

Clinical Presentation:
Upon admission, the patient's weight was 48 kg and her height was 160 cm, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 18.75 kg/m², which falls within the normal range. She complained of severe pain and exhibited signs of anxiety and depression. The patient's mother reported a significant decrease in her appetite, as she refused most food offerings and primarily relied on smoking and drinking coffee. Unfortunately, detailed information regarding her dietary intake in the last two weeks and weight changes over the past six months was not available.

Nutritional Assessment:
A week after hospitalization, a thorough nutritional assessment was conducted. The patient's subjective global assessment (SGA) indicated severe malnutrition (group C). Laboratory findings showed a serum albumin level of 3.8 g/L and imbalanced electrolyte levels. No signs of fluid accumulation were observed.

Nutritional Intervention:
To address the patient's malnutrition, a multidisciplinary team initiated a nutrition management plan. Energy and protein requirements were initially set at 30 kcal/kg and 1.5 g/kg, respectively, and gradually increased to 40 kcal/kg and 2 g/kg over the course of two weeks. Oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) were provided in a 60:40 ratio. Additionally, the patient received micronutrient supplementation, including vitamin A (100,000 units/week), vitamin C (100 mg three times daily), and zinc (20 mg/day).

Clinical Progress:
During the early weeks of hospitalization, the patient continued to experience weight loss. By the end of the second week, her body weight had dropped to 45 kg, and her serum albumin level decreased to 3.0 g/L. To counteract the ongoing weight loss, the ratio of oral intake to ONS was adjusted to 50:50.

The patient's appetite remained unstable throughout her treatment, and she displayed resistance to enteral access. She frequently experienced pain and became increasingly agitated, showing poor response to analgesics and sedatives. To meet her protein needs, partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) was administered. Despite these interventions, her BMI continued to decline, reaching 16.72 kg/m² on the 42nd day, with a serum albumin level of 2.7 g/L.

Treatment Decisions:
On the 66th day, the patient's wounds showed granulation tissue formation. Considering her mental health status and the significant nutrition-related challenges she faced, the decision was made not to proceed with skin graft surgery. At this point, the patient had lost approximately 28% of her initial body weight, reaching a BMI of 15.63 kg/m², and her serum albumin level was 2.5 g/L. Severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss were evident. Despite these physical complications, there was notable improvement in her overall mental and general condition.

Final Outcome:
After a total hospitalization period of 80 days, the patient was discharged with ongoing psychiatric care and a comprehensive outpatient nutritional support plan. Close monitoring of her mental health, nutritional status, and wound healing was recommended.

Conclusion:
This case highlights the complex challenges faced when managing a mentally ill patient with extensive burn injuries. Early and aggressive nutritional intervention is crucial in preventing further weight loss and muscle wasting. A multidisciplinary approach, including psychiatric and nutritional support, is vital in achieving optimal outcomes for these patients.
