Title: A 42-year-old Woman with Severe Burn Injuries: A Case Report

Introduction:
We present the case of a 42-year-old woman who was admitted to our burn unit following a domestic accident resulting in severe burn injuries. This case report aims to describe the patient's clinical presentation, management, and outcomes, with particular emphasis on the extent of burns, treatment modalities, and the patient's overall progress during her hospitalization.

Case Presentation:
A 42-year-old woman with a history of depression and anxiety was brought to our facility after sustaining burn injuries in a house fire. The incident occurred three days prior to admission, and she was initially managed at a local emergency department before being transferred to our burn unit for specialized care.

Upon arrival, the patient exhibited signs of distress and was immediately assessed by our multidisciplinary team. Her initial physical examination revealed extensive burn injuries affecting approximately 45% of her total body surface area (TBSA). The burns involved her face and neck (10%), both upper extremities (15%), bilateral lower limbs (10%), and anterior and posterior trunk (10%). The severity of the injuries varied, with the majority being partial-thickness burns.

Management and Treatment:
The patient was promptly resuscitated, and her vital signs stabilized. An initial priority was given to pain management, with the administration of intravenous analgesics and wound care utilizing sterile dressings. A comprehensive treatment plan was established, involving daily wound assessment, debridement, and the application of topical antimicrobial agents.

Over the course of her hospital stay, the patient underwent a total of six debridement surgeries under general anesthesia to remove necrotic tissue and promote wound healing. In addition to surgical intervention, she received a combination of systemic antibiotics to prevent infection and tetanus prophylaxis due to the extensive nature of her injuries.

Psychosocial support was also an integral part of her care. A psychiatric consultation was arranged, and the patient was closely monitored for signs of depression and anxiety. Regular sessions with a mental health professional were conducted to address her emotional well-being and provide support throughout her recovery.

Outcome:
The patient's hospitalization lasted for a total of 70 days. During this period, she demonstrated remarkable progress in terms of wound healing and overall physical recovery. The burn wounds gradually transformed into healthy granulation tissue, and autografting was performed on several areas to promote wound closure and reduce scarring.

Psychological support played a crucial role in her rehabilitation. The patient actively participated in individual and group therapy sessions, which contributed to her emotional recovery and facilitated the management of her pre-existing mental health conditions. As her physical and psychological well-being improved, the patient was able to engage in daily activities and regain a sense of independence.

Conclusion:
We present the case of a 42-year-old woman who sustained severe burn injuries in a domestic accident. Through a multidisciplinary approach involving surgical intervention, wound care management, and psychological support, the patient achieved successful wound healing, functional recovery, and psychological well-being. This case highlights the importance of comprehensive care and the collaboration of various healthcare professionals in optimizing patient outcomes following burn injuries.
