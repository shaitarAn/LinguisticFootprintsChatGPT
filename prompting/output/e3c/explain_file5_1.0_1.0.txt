Clinical Case:
This clinical case involves a previously healthy individual, a grade ten scholar, who presented with various symptoms. The patient had no previous medical admissions, surgeries, or significant medication or recreational drug use. Although he had no known contact with COVID-19 cases, he had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal two weeks prior to presenting at the hospital.

Clinical Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared ill and displayed vital signs indicative of an elevated heart rate (123 beats per minute) and high temperature (39.5Â°C). He exhibited restlessness but showed no signs of cognitive dysfunction. A maculopapular rash was observed on his torso, upper back, limbs, and palmar surface of the hands. The rash was non-tender and accompanied by erythematous desquamating lesions on the eyelids and bilateral conjunctivitis. Abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal with no signs of jaundice or lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds with sinus tachycardia but without any additional sounds or abnormalities.

Diagnostic Assessment:
Prior to arriving at the hospital, the patient had received three days of treatment involving ceftriaxone and intravenous paracetamol but showed no improvement in his condition. Blood investigations revealed rising levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers. However, blood and urine cultures remained negative for any infection. Lumbar puncture results were normal along with chest radiographs and abdominal sonar tests.

Diagnosis and Differentials:
Given the clinical presentation of fever accompanied by an elevated CRP level as well as other inflammatory markers such as PCT, LDH, D-dimers along with deranged liver function tests - a diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was strongly suspected. Other infections such as viral infections (HIV seroconversion, acute Epstein-Barr virus infection, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus) and bacterial infections caused by Group A streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, other gram-negative bacteria, rickettsia, leptospirosis or malaria were also considered. Non-infectious diseases like Kawasaki-like disease (KD), adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were taken into account due to the patient's symptoms.

Therapeutic Intervention:
Upon admission to the hospital, intravenous fluid boluses were administered but showed no significant improvement in hemodynamic parameters. Inotropes and vasopressors were not initially initiated. Empiric treatment with doxycycline for rickettsial disease and continuation of ceftriaxone took place on day two. Hydrocortisone was started but discontinued on day three due to concerns of infection. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered along with a dobutamine infusion and diuresis on day four after the reevaluation of the patient's condition revealed cardiac abnormalities suggesting myopericarditis associated with MIS-C.

Follow-Up and Outcomes:
The patient displayed clinical improvement with a resolution of fever spikes and improvements observed in inflammatory markers as well as normalizing liver function tests over time. The rash also showed nearly complete resolution. A follow-up evaluation two weeks later revealed full recovery with no residual symptoms detected during examination or echocardiogram testing.

In conclusion, this case pertains to a previously healthy individual who presented with various symptoms including fever, rash, elevated inflammatory markers in addition to cardiac dysfunction consistent with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children(MIS-C). Prompt diagnosis followed by appropriate therapeutic interventions resulted in complete recovery.
