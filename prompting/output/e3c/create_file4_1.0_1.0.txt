Case 2: Mr. JK, a 60-year-old man of European descent, was admitted to the hospital with complaints of progressive weakness and difficulty walking for the past three months. He had a past medical history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension which were well-controlled with medications.

Mr. JK reported that his symptoms began insidiously and gradually worsened over time. He denied any significant trauma or recent illnesses. Physical examination revealed muscle atrophy in both lower limbs, bilateral foot drop, and weakness in hip flexors and knee extensors.

Further history taking revealed that Mr. JK had been experiencing frequent falls due to his weakened legs. He also complained of numbness and tingling in his lower extremities bilaterally but denied any bowel or bladder dysfunction.

Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 levels, folate levels, glucose levels, serum electrolytes level (calcium included), sedimentation rate were all within normal limits.

As part of the diagnostic work-up for Mr.JK's condition an electromyography (EMG) was performed which demonstrated prolonged motor latencies consistent with a peripheral neuropathy affecting the bilateral lower limbs more predominantly than upper limbs.

A nerve conduction study revealed reduced compound muscle action potential amplitudes along with delayed distal motor latencies indicating an axonal polyneuropathy mainly affecting myelinated fibers predominantly involving lower limbs (both proximal & distal) compared to upper limb nerves.

Based on these findings along with clinical presentation and history taken it is suspected that Mr.JK is suffering from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy(CIDP). To confirm this suspicion further investigations like cerebrospinal fluid analysis including protein electrophoresis will be considered as one step before initiating treatment based on certain specific criteria used for definite diagnosis confirmation.
