Upon further examination, the patient reported experiencing occasional episodes of visual disturbances, such as blurred vision and seeing flashing lights. These episodes would last for a few minutes and resolve spontaneously. She denied any other neurological symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, or tingling.

Physical examination revealed no abnormalities, including no signs of neurocutaneous involvement. Neurological examination was unremarkable, with no focal deficits or signs of increased intracranial pressure. The patient's vital signs were within normal limits.

Given the patient's history of seizures and the presence of visual disturbances, further investigations were warranted. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed, which showed intermittent focal epileptiform discharges in the left occipital region. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was also conducted, revealing characteristic findings consistent with Sturge-Weber syndrome, including leptomeningeal enhancement and cortical gyriform calcifications involving the left occipital lobe.

Based on the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) with associated migraine-like headaches was made. The patient was educated about the nature of the condition and the need for long-term follow-up to monitor for potential complications, such as glaucoma, intellectual disability, and neurological deterioration.

Treatment options were discussed with the patient, including the use of prophylactic medications for migraine headaches, such as beta-blockers or antiepileptic drugs. The patient opted to start on a trial of topiramate, an antiepileptic medication with proven efficacy in migraine prophylaxis. Lifestyle modifications, such as stress management techniques and regular sleep patterns, were also recommended.

The patient was scheduled for regular follow-up visits to monitor the response to treatment and assess for any new neurological symptoms or complications. Additionally, she was referred to a neurologist and ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management of her seizures and potential ocular involvement.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering Sturge-Weber syndrome as a potential underlying cause of headaches in young patients, especially in the presence of characteristic clinical features and diagnostic findings. Early recognition and appropriate management can help improve the quality of life for individuals with this rare neurocutaneous disorder.
