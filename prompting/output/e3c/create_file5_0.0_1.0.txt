Patient Information:
On the 15th November 2021, a previously healthy, 25-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the medical ward at St. Mary's Hospital with a two-week history of fever, fatigue, and joint pain. The patient reported no significant medical history or recent travel.

Clinical Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared fatigued with a temperature of 38.9Â°C and a heart rate of 110 beats per minute. She complained of generalized joint pain and had swelling in her wrists and knees bilaterally. There were no signs of cognitive dysfunction or skin abnormalities.

Diagnostic Assessment:
Blood investigations revealed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white cell count (WCC). Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies were positive. X-rays showed erosions in the affected joints.

Diagnosis and Differentials:
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was made. Other differentials considered included systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis.

Therapeutic Intervention:
The patient was started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for symptomatic relief of joint pain. Methotrexate was initiated as disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy to slow down disease progression. In addition, she received counseling on lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise and stress management techniques.

Follow-up and Outcomes:
The patient was followed up regularly in the rheumatology outpatient clinic over the next few months. With ongoing treatment, her symptoms gradually improved, including reduced joint pain and swelling. Repeat laboratory tests showed normalization of inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR.

At her last follow-up appointment six months later, she reported minimal joint pain and had regained her energy levels. Physical examination revealed no active synovitis, and repeat imaging showed no progression of joint erosions. The patient was advised to continue with methotrexate therapy and regular monitoring.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate management in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis. With timely intervention, patients can achieve improved outcomes and a better quality of life.
