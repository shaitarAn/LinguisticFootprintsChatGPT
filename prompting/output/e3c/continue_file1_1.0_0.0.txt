Upon further examination, the patient's medical history revealed that she had been diagnosed with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) when she was only 15 days old due to the presence of seizures characterized by tonic-clonic contractions. Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by a port-wine birthmark (hemangioma) on the face, specifically around the eye and forehead, as well as neurological abnormalities including seizures.

Upon physical examination, the patient's port-wine birthmark was evident, extending across her forehead and onto her eyelid. Neurological examination revealed no focal deficits, and her vital signs were within normal ranges. Given her history of seizures and the nature of her headaches, a comprehensive evaluation was warranted to better understand the underlying cause.

To assess the etiology of her headaches, a thorough neurological workup was initiated. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed, which revealed abnormal electrical activity in the brain, confirming the presence of epileptic activity. Additionally, a brain MRI was conducted to assess for any structural abnormalities that could be contributing to her symptoms. This imaging study revealed ipsilateral leptomeningeal angiomatosis, confirming the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome. The leptomeningeal angiomatosis is characterized by abnormal blood vessels affecting the brain's pia mater (the innermost layer covering the brain).

After considering the patient's clinical presentation, medical history, and diagnostic results, a multidisciplinary team, including neurologists and dermatologists, was convened to formulate an appropriate management plan.

The patient was started on antiepileptic medication to control her seizures. Additionally, preventive measures were employed to manage her headaches. The patient was advised to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, ensure proper hydration, and avoid known triggers such as stress and caffeine. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were prescribed for acute headache relief, as they had previously proven effective for the patient. The patient was encouraged to keep a headache diary to track the frequency, duration, and intensity of her headaches, enabling the healthcare team to monitor treatment efficacy.

Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to assess the patient's response to treatment and provide ongoing education and support. Close collaboration with other healthcare professionals, including psychologists and social workers, was also established to address any emotional and psychological issues the patient may be experiencing.

Furthermore, the patient was referred for evaluation and management of the hemangioma associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome. Various treatment options including laser therapy, surgical removal, and medication were discussed with the patient, allowing her to make an informed decision regarding further treatment.

It is important to note that Sturge-Weber syndrome is a chronic condition, requiring long-term management and multidisciplinary care. Regular follow-up appointments with both neurologists and dermatologists were emphasized to ensure proper monitoring and adjustment of the treatment plan as necessary.

In conclusion, this 21-year-old female patient's presentation of frequent non-pulsating headaches, in conjunction with a history of seizures and the characteristic port-wine birthmark, led to the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome. A comprehensive evaluation revealed abnormal brain activity on EEG and the presence of leptomeningeal angiomatosis on brain MRI. A multidisciplinary team approach was adopted to manage the patient's seizures, headaches, and associated hemangioma. Regular follow-up and close collaboration with various healthcare professionals are essential for long-term management and to provide comprehensive care for patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome.
