Upon further examination, the patient's neurological examination was unremarkable. Her vital signs were stable, and there were no signs of any abnormal findings. The patient reported no visual disturbances, hearing problems, or any other neurological symptoms.

Given her history of seizures and the presence of a birthmark on the face, known as a port-wine stain, characteristic of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS), a thorough evaluation was conducted. The physician ordered a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain to assess the extent of underlying brain abnormalities associated with SWS.

The MRI revealed classic findings consistent with SWS, including leptomeningeal angiomatosis, cerebral cortical calcifications, and ventricular enlargement. The presence of these abnormalities confirmed the diagnosis of SWS in the patient.

The physician discussed the diagnosis and its implications with the patient and her family. It was explained that SWS is a rare congenital disorder that primarily affects the brain and skin. It is characterized by the abnormal development of blood vessels in the leptomeninges, leading to various neurological symptoms and manifestations.

The patient's frequent non-pulsating headaches were likely a result of the underlying brain abnormalities associated with SWS. Although the exact cause of the headaches remains uncertain, it was postulated that increased blood flow and altered vascular dynamics within the affected brain regions could be contributing factors.

To manage her headaches, the physician advised the patient to continue using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as needed. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as maintaining regular sleep patterns, managing stress levels, and avoiding triggers known to induce headaches were recommended.

Given her history of seizures, the patient was already on antiepileptic medication. The physician reviewed her current treatment regimen and made adjustments to ensure optimal seizure control.

Given the potential complications associated with SWS, regular follow-up visits with the neurologist and other specialists were scheduled. These appointments would allow for close monitoring of the patient's symptoms, as well as prompt identification and management of any potential complications that may arise.

The patient and her family were provided with resources and support groups to help them better understand and cope with the challenges associated with living with SWS. A holistic approach to her care was emphasized, with a focus on addressing not only the physical aspects but also the psychological and emotional impacts of the condition.

With ongoing multidisciplinary care, regular monitoring, and appropriate management of her symptoms, the patient can experience a better quality of life and potentially minimize the long-term complications associated with SWS.
