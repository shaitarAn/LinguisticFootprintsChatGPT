During his hospitalization, the patient received intensive wound care and underwent several procedures to aid in the healing process. The initial priority was to stabilize his condition and prevent any further complications. The medical team closely monitored his vital signs, administered intravenous fluids, and provided pain management.

The first debridement surgery took place soon after admission to remove any dead or damaged tissue from the burned areas. This procedure aimed to promote healing by creating a clean environment for new tissue growth. Subsequent debridement surgeries were performed at regular intervals to ensure optimal wound healing.

In addition to surgical interventions, various specialized treatments were implemented throughout the patient's stay. He received daily dressing changes using aseptic techniques to prevent infection and promote granulation tissue formation. A combination of topical antimicrobial agents and advanced dressings were applied based on the specific needs of each affected area.

To address the extensive burns on his face and neck, he was evaluated by a plastic surgeon who recommended reconstructive procedures once sufficient healing had occurred. These procedures would focus on restoring functionality and improving aesthetic outcomes.

Throughout his hospitalization, mental health support played an integral role in the patient's overall care plan. A multidisciplinary team consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and nurses worked together closely with burn specialists to provide comprehensive treatment for both his physical injuries and mental health condition.

Psychiatric evaluations were conducted regularly alongside therapy sessions aimed at addressing underlying psychological issues that contributed to his attempted suicide by fire. Medication management was also incorporated into his treatment plan to assist with stabilizing mood swings associated with mental illness.

As time progressed, improvements in wound healing allowed for increased mobility exercises under careful supervision from physiotherapists or occupational therapists. Range of motion exercises assisted in preventing contractures while promoting functional independence for activities of daily living.

After 66 days of intense medical care and rehabilitation efforts within a supportive environment tailored specifically for burn victims with psychiatric comorbidities, the patient's condition significantly improved. He was discharged with a comprehensive aftercare plan in place, which included continued mental health support, outpatient wound care, and scheduled follow-up appointments with both plastic surgery and psychiatric teams.

Although the road to recovery remained challenging, this individual's journey demonstrated the power of interdisciplinary collaboration in providing holistic care for patients with complex needs. Ultimately, his successful rehabilitation highlighted the importance of addressing both physical and mental health aspects to achieve optimal outcomes in burn patients with underlying psychiatric conditions.
