This clinical case describes a 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). SWS is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the presence of a facial birthmark called a port wine stain, seizures, and abnormalities in the brain.

The patient presented with frequent non-pulsating headaches that had been occurring for the past two years. These headaches were relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and were not worsened by physical activity. There were no accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura. The pain was bilateral, generalized, and pressing in quality.

The patient had a history of seizures since the fifteenth day of life, which led to her diagnosis of SWS. At the age of 6, she underwent callosotomy surgery to control her seizures. However, at 18 years old, she experienced another seizure during laser treatment for her port wine birthmark. Since then, she has been taking carbamazepine daily and has not had any further seizures.

In addition to her neurological symptoms, the patient also exhibited signs of anxiety disorder and chronic headaches. She was prescribed ketiapin for anxiety and venlafaxine for both anxiety disorder and chronic headaches. NSAID drugs were also prescribed to manage her headache pain.

Physical examination revealed a facial nevus (port wine stain) on the right forehead, eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek due to choroid angioma (abnormal blood vessels). Intraoral examination showed overgrowth of gingiva (gums) on the right side with angiomatous enlargement (enlarged blood vessels). Mild asymmetry was observed in her extremities with hemiparesis (weakness) affecting both upper and lower limbs on the left side.

Ophthalmological evaluation revealed glaucoma in her right eye. Psychiatric examination confirmed signs of anxiety disorder while neurological examination did not reveal any significant abnormalities except for the hemiparesis.

Imaging studies, including cranial CT scans and gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI, showed diffuse atrophy (shrinkage) in the right hemisphere of the brain. Irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications (abnormal calcium deposits) were observed in the right occipital area. The MRI also revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere, along with widespread vascular formations in various locations.

Based on her clinical presentation and test results, she underwent a proteus intelligence test which indicated mild mental retardation with a score of 75 points.

In summary, this case describes a young female patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome presenting with chronic headaches, seizures since infancy, facial nevus (port wine stain), gingival overgrowth, hemiparesis, glaucoma in one eye, anxiety disorder symptoms, and imaging findings consistent with SWS. The patient also exhibited mild mental retardation based on intelligence testing.
