A 32-year-old female teacher gravida 3 para 2 at 28 weeks gestation presented to our facility with a chief complaint of persistent epigastric abdominal pain for the past two months. The pain was described as dull and constant, gradually worsening over time. She denied any relieving or aggravating factors but mentioned occasional radiation to her back. The patient reported no significant weight loss, early satiety, jaundice, fever, itching, or spontaneous bleeding. She had no history of blood transfusion and was taking routine prenatal vitamins from the antenatal clinic.

The patient had no known chronic illnesses and denied any alcohol consumption or smoking habits. There were no respiratory, cardiovascular, or urogenital symptoms present during examination. Physical assessment revealed mild pallor but overall good hydration status with normal temperature readings. No palpable lymph nodes were detected.

Upon abdominal examination, gross distension with an altered contour in the upper abdomen was observed along with visibly dilated veins on the anterior abdominal wall draining away from the umbilicus. The liver was enlarged approximately 10 cm below the costal margin and felt hard and nodular upon palpation. Mild tenderness and a bruit were noted on auscultation of the liver region. No clubbing or parotid enlargement were observed.

Laboratory investigations showed a hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 9,800 cells/dL with differential counts within normal limits (Neutrophils: 60%, Lymphocytes: 30%, Monocytes: 8%, Eosinophils:2%). Platelet count was within normal range at 300000/Î¼L. Liver function tests revealed elevated levels of GGT (3 times upper limit) and AST (2 times upper limit). Total protein level was slightly low at 45 g/L while albumin level remained within normal range at 35 g/L. INR was 1.2, indicating normal coagulation function. HBsAg was positive, while HBeAg was negative. HBV DNA level was measured at 80,000 IU/mL (viral load). HIV and HCV tests were negative.

Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a heterogeneous liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions. The liver size measured 15 cm and mild ascites were noted. Fetal ultrasound revealed a viable fetus at 28 weeks gestation with normal fetal movements.

A diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation in pregnancy was made based on the clinical presentation and investigations. The patient's pain was managed with appropriate analgesics, and lamivudine therapy was initiated to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B infection.

The initial plan involved continuing the pregnancy until at least 32 completed weeks to improve neonatal survival chances; however, due to worsening abdominal pain that became unbearable for the patient, labor induction was performed successfully at 30 weeks and 5 days gestation. Unfortunately, the outcome resulted in a stillbirth weighing approximately 1 kg.

Post-delivery, the patient experienced significant relief from her abdominal pain and remained in the hospital for five days before being discharged home. A follow-up visit at the gastrointestinal clinic was scheduled for further evaluation and management of her condition.

The patient attended her two-week and four-week post-discharge appointments but unfortunately failed to follow up afterward despite attempts to reach out for further care coordination.
