This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a fever, rash, and other symptoms. The patient had no prior medical admissions, surgeries, or significant medication or recreational drug use. They were a grade ten scholar and had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal two weeks before the onset of symptoms.

On examination, the patient appeared ill and had a low blood pressure, high heart rate, and elevated temperature. They also had a generalized maculopapular rash on their torso, upper back, limbs, and hands. Additionally, they had erythematous desquamating lesions over their eyelids and bilateral conjunctivitis.

Blood investigations showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers. However, blood and urine cultures were negative. The lumbar puncture was normal along with chest radiograph and abdominal sonar results.

The initial differential diagnosis included viral infections such as HIV seroconversion or acute infections caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), or cytomegalovirus (CMV). Bacterial infections caused by Group A streptococci or Neisseria meningitidis were also considered. Non-infectious differentials included Kawasaki-like disease (KD) or adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD).

Based on the elevated temperature along with rising inflammatory markers like CRP, PCT, LDH, D-dimers,and ferritin levels with deranged liver function tests(LFTs), the diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children(MIS-C) was suspected.

The patient received intravenous fluid boluses initially but did not show significant improvement in hemodynamic parameters. Empiric antibiotic treatment was started for rickettsial disease while continuing ceftriaxone. Hydrocortisone was initiated but later discontinued due to concerns for infection. A repeat echocardiogram revealed significant cardiac abnormalities, and the patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) along with dobutamine infusion and diuresis.

Serological testing confirmed the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, indicating a previous infection. The patient's condition improved with the addition of aspirin and enoxaparin to prevent thrombotic complications. They were discharged on prednisone, aspirin, and colchicine.

During follow-up, the patient fully recovered with no residual symptoms. Repeat echocardiogram showed improvement in cardiac function, and prednisone was gradually tapered off.

In summary, this clinical case highlights a patient who presented with fever, rash, and other symptoms consistent with MIS-C following a recent travel history to Kwa-Zulu Natal. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management led to a successful outcome for the patient.
