In the first clinical case, a 30-year-old teacher and a 35-year-old police officer, both with a secondary level of education, have a history of a stillbirth during the mother's first delivery. However, there were no congenital malformations observed in the baby, and there is no known history of congenital anomalies in the extended family. During physical examination of the newborn, an irregularly shaped defect is observed on the vertex of the scalp, extending bilaterally to the occipital region. The defect measures 10 x 8 cm in the midline and 6 x 6 cm in the occipital region. The defect is covered with a yellow layer of membrane. The baby also has low set ears, irritability, a tense anterior fontanelle, and is in respiratory distress. A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis is made. The baby receives routine care, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and wound dressing. The respiratory distress improves, and the baby tolerates oral feeds. The case involves a multidisciplinary team, including neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons. Brain imaging reveals absence of parietal bone, with an area of defect measuring 8.3 cm x 5.3 cm. The brain structures are normal, and there are no abnormalities observed. Plans are made for future intervention, involving a flap cover for autologous skin grafting. The baby is discharged home after 18 days with oral antibiotics and daily wound dressing.

In the second clinical case, a baby is referred at 48 hours of life due to the absence of part of the skull bone noticed at birth. The baby was delivered at home, without any overt trauma to the head. The mother is 25 years old and not employed, while the father is a hospital attendant. The baby is the third child in a monogamous, non-consanguineous setting, with two older siblings who are alive and well. There is no known family history of congenital anomalies, and the mother did not receive obstetric scans during pregnancy. The baby presents with a subcutaneous tissue defect of the scalp, extending from the frontal to the occipital area, with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The baby also has desquamating skin, hypoplastic finger and toe nails, dilated abdominal wall veins, and a grade 3 systolic cardiac murmur. A working diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies, including congenital cutis aplasia and ventricular septal defect, is made. Sepsis screen reveals bacterial infections in the blood and CSF. Financial constraints limit the ability to perform brain imaging, echocardiography, and chromosomal studies. The baby receives treatment with antibiotics and wound care, and complications such as CSF leakage and meningitis resolve over time. Plans for mesh and flap cover are made, but the baby is discharged upon parental request and unfortunately dies seven days later.

In both cases, the babies present with congenital anomalies involving the scalp and potential involvement of the central nervous system. Aplasia cutis congenita is observed in the first case, while multiple congenital anomalies, including congenital cutis aplasia and ventricular septal defect, are present in the second case. The multidisciplinary team, including neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons, plays a crucial role in the management and future interventions for these babies. Despite the challenges faced, such as financial constraints, efforts are made to provide appropriate care and treatment to improve the babies' conditions.
