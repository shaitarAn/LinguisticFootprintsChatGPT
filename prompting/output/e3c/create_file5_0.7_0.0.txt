Patient information:
On the 3rd November 2021, a previously healthy, 35-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the medical ward at St. Mary's Hospital, London. The patient was transferred from a local clinic with a chief complaint of fever, body aches, and a rash. 

Presenting symptoms:
The patient reported a one-week history of high-grade fever, reaching up to 39°C, which was accompanied by a generalized rash covering her body and eyelids. She also complained of intermittent headaches, neck pain, sore throat, and a dry cough. In addition, she mentioned experiencing a day of diarrhea prior to the onset of these symptoms. However, the patient denied any arthralgias, oral or nasal ulcers, or urethral discharge.

Medical history:
The patient had no significant medical history and had not experienced any similar symptoms or illnesses in the past. She reported that she was up to date with her vaccinations, including the influenza vaccine which she received two months ago.

Social history:
The patient worked as a teacher in a local primary school and had been in contact with numerous children. She denied any recent travel or exposure to individuals with known infectious diseases. She lived with her husband and two children, who were asymptomatic at the time of her admission.

Physical examination:
Upon admission, the patient appeared ill and fatigued. Her temperature was 38.5°C, and she had a slightly elevated heart rate of 100 beats per minute. The patient's blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were within normal limits. The physical examination revealed a diffuse maculopapular rash over her trunk and extremities, including her eyelids. No oral ulcers, nasal discharge, or genital lesions were observed. The patient's neck was supple, with no signs of meningismus.

Laboratory findings:
Initial laboratory investigations demonstrated leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.2 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.0-11.0 x 10^9/L) and a normal differential count. The patient's liver function tests, renal function, and electrolyte levels were all within normal limits. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected for respiratory viral panel testing.

Clinical impression and plan:
Based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and laboratory findings, the initial impression was that the patient may be experiencing a viral infection. Given the concern for a potential infectious etiology, the patient was placed on contact and droplet precautions to prevent potential transmission to healthcare workers and other patients. A broad-spectrum antibiotic was initiated while awaiting the results of the respiratory viral panel test. The patient was also provided with supportive care, including antipyretics for fever and analgesics for headache and body aches.

Follow-up:
The patient's respiratory viral panel test results revealed the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The patient was informed of the diagnosis and educated on self-isolation measures to prevent transmission to others. Over the course of her hospital stay, the patient's symptoms gradually improved, and she was discharged home with appropriate instructions for continued self-care and monitoring.
