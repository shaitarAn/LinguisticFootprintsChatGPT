Case Study: A 45-year-old mentally ill woman with attempted self-harm by consuming a large quantity of medication was transferred from a local psychiatric hospital to our facility. The patient exhibited symptoms of major depressive disorder with psychotic features, classified as ICD 10 F32.3. Upon admission, it was discovered that the patient had a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 kg/m^2, which falls within the normal weight range. She had a history of poor appetite, resulting in unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 kilograms over the course of the previous three months. Gastrointestinal symptoms were absent.

Due to the patient's mental health condition, she required close monitoring and occasional restraints to prevent self-inflicted harm. Psychiatric management included administration of Sertraline 50 mg daily and Risperidone 1 mg daily.

Nutrition management was initiated promptly upon admission. The patient expressed a desire to recover and was open to dietary interventions. An initial nutrition assessment revealed no fluid retention or signs of malnutrition. However, her serum albumin level was 3.2 g/L, indicating mild hypoalbuminemia. The assessment also categorized the patient as being at risk of malnutrition according to the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST). Information on her dietary intake in the past month could not be obtained, but she reported a significant decrease in appetite, preferring to eat only small portions of snacks and drinking mostly water.

The patient was advised to consume a balanced diet composed of whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Energy and protein requirements were calculated based on an estimated weight of 60 kilograms, with an aim to provide 25-30 kcal/kg and 1.2-1.5 g/kg of protein daily. To enhance nutrient intake, oral nutritional supplements (ONS) were recommended, consisting of a commercially available high-protein and high-energy drink. Micronutrient supplementation included a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement.

During hospitalization, the patient's weight remained stable, but her appetite fluctuated. She experienced periods of reduced food intake due to psychological distress and feelings of hopelessness. Behavioral modifications were implemented to encourage regular eating, including close monitoring during meals and individual counseling sessions with a nutritionist. The patient was educated about the importance of adhering to her prescribed diet and the potential consequences of inadequate nutrient intake on her overall health and recovery. Collaboration with the psychiatric team was crucial to address and manage the patient's underlying mental health condition, thereby optimizing her engagement in the nutrition program.

Throughout her hospital stay, the patient exhibited gradual improvement in her mood and overall well-being. She actively participated in therapy sessions and adhered to her prescribed medications and dietary recommendations. At discharge, the patient's weight remained stable, BMI was within the normal range, and her serum albumin level had improved to 3.6 g/L. Close outpatient follow-up was arranged to ensure continued support in maintaining a balanced diet and managing her mental health condition effectively.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of early nutrition intervention in mentally ill patients, as poor appetite and decreased food intake can lead to unintended weight loss and potential nutritional deficiencies. A multidisciplinary approach, involving the collaboration of psychiatric and nutritional professionals, is crucial in addressing the patient's mental health challenges while providing comprehensive nutritional care to facilitate their recovery and overall well-being.
