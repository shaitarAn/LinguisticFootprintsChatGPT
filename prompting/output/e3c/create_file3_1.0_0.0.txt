Title: Clinical Case: A 45-year-old Woman With Self-Inflicted Burns

Introduction:
We present the case of a 45-year-old woman who was admitted to our hospital following a deliberate self-inflicted burn injury. The patient's medical history is significant for a long-standing psychiatric illness, which complicated her overall management and required a multidisciplinary approach. This case aims to highlight the challenges faced in the treatment of complex psychiatric patients with severe burn injuries.

Patient Presentation:
Ms. L, a 45-year-old woman with a known history of bipolar disorder, was brought in by emergency medical services (EMS) after she attempted self-immolation two days prior to admission. According to her family, she poured flammable liquid on herself and set it ablaze in a moment of acute emotional distress. EMS promptly responded and managed to extinguish the flames.

Physical Examination and Assessment:
Upon admission, the patient displayed extensive burn injuries involving approximately 42% of the total body surface area (TBSA). Her injuries consisted of full-thickness burns on the anterior torso (25%), bilateral upper extremities (6% each), and both lower extremities (5% each). Partial-thickness injuries were observed on her face and neck, affecting approximately 20% of the TBSA. Multiple wound sites showed signs of infection, indicating a potentially compromised wound healing process.

Treatment:
The patient was immediately transferred to the burn unit, where she was stabilized and received comprehensive wound care. The initial treatment plan included escharotomy, fluid resuscitation, and broad-spectrum antibiotics to manage potential infection. She underwent a total of four surgical debridement procedures during her hospital stay to remove necrotic tissues and aid in wound healing. The medical team coordinated closely with the psychiatric department to manage her mental health and ensure her safety during the recovery period.

Hospital Course:
During her 72-day hospitalization, Ms. L's condition remained challenging, given her underlying psychiatric illness. The care team encountered difficulties in maintaining patient compliance with immobilization, dressing changes, and adherence to medication. Frequent psychiatric consultations were conducted to evaluate her mental status and adjust the pharmacotherapy accordingly. Psychotherapy sessions, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and supportive counseling, were integrated into her treatment plan to address the psychosocial impact of her self-inflicted burns. Furthermore, the multidisciplinary team, comprising plastic surgeons, nurses, psychiatrists, and social workers, worked together to provide holistic care throughout her hospital stay.

Outcome:
Despite the complexities associated with managing a patient with severe psychiatric illness and extensive burns, Ms. L demonstrated gradual improvement over time. With consistent engagement in mental health interventions, meticulous wound care, and the support from an extensive care team, her wounds began to show signs of healing and there was noticeable improvement in her mental health. Following her discharge, extensive post-hospitalization support was provided, including regular psychiatric follow-ups, social service connections, and community reintegration programs.

Conclusion:
This case underscores the challenges faced when treating patients with severe burn injuries who also suffer from underlying psychiatric illnesses. Managing both the physical and mental aspects of their care requires a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach. By addressing the complex needs of patients like Ms. L, healthcare providers can enhance their overall well-being and improve long-term outcomes.
