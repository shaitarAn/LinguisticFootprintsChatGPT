Case 2: Mr. JM, a 65-year-old male from the Lomani tribe, presented to the hospital with complaints of progressive muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing. He was previously healthy and had no significant medical history. His family reported a gradual onset of symptoms over the past six months. 

Mr. JM's physical examination revealed generalized muscle wasting and weakness, predominantly affecting the upper and lower extremities. His facial muscles appeared unaffected, and he had intact cranial nerve function. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished, and sensory examination was normal. 

Further investigations were conducted, including blood tests, which showed elevated levels of creatine kinase, suggesting muscle damage. Electromyography (EMG) revealed myopathic changes, supporting a primary muscle disorder. A muscle biopsy was performed, demonstrating necrotic and regenerating muscle fibers with inflammatory infiltrates.

The patient's family history was significant, with consanguinity between his parents. His parents were second cousins, suggesting a potential genetic component to his condition. Genetic counseling was recommended for the family to identify any inherited disorders.

To rule out other potential causes of muscle weakness, additional investigations were performed, including a nerve conduction study and a spinal cord MRI, which were both normal. Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and muscle biopsy results, a diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) was made.

The management plan for Mr. JM included physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and mobility. The patient was also referred to a geneticist for further evaluation and to determine the specific subtype of LGMD. Genetic testing was performed to identify any underlying gene mutations associated with this condition.

In conclusion, Mr. JM presented with progressive muscle weakness and was diagnosed with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. His family history and consanguineous background raised suspicions of a genetic etiology, which were further supported by laboratory investigations and muscle biopsy findings. The patient's management involved a multidisciplinary approach, including physical therapy and genetic evaluation.
