On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and had a distended abdomen. There was tenderness on palpation in the epigastric region, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. Bowel sounds were normal, and there were no signs of hepatosplenomegaly.

Given her symptoms and examination findings, further investigations were ordered. A complete blood count revealed mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL (normal range: 12-15 g/dL). Liver function tests showed elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, while other liver enzymes were within normal limits. Serum bilirubin levels were also within normal range.

An abdominal ultrasound was performed to evaluate the cause of her symptoms. The ultrasound revealed a dilated common bile duct measuring 1 cm in diameter with multiple gallstones visualized within the gallbladder. There was no evidence of biliary obstruction or any other abnormalities in the liver or pancreas.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of symptomatic cholelithiasis with possible choledocholithiasis was made. The patient was counseled about her condition and treatment options including conservative management versus surgical intervention.

Considering her pregnancy status and persistent symptoms, it was decided to consult with a multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians, general surgeons, and anesthesiologists to discuss the best course of action for this patient.

After careful consideration and weighing the risks versus benefits for both mother and fetus, it was determined that an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy would be performed during her second trimester under general anesthesia by an experienced surgical team specialized in managing pregnant patients.

The patient underwent preoperative optimization including correction of anemia through iron supplementation as well as close monitoring of fetal well-being throughout the procedure using continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring.

The surgery went smoothly without any complications. Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored in the recovery room and then transferred to the antenatal ward for further observation. She received appropriate pain management and was encouraged to ambulate as tolerated.

During her hospital stay, the patient's symptoms gradually improved, and she reported resolution of her epigastric pain. Her hemoglobin levels were monitored regularly, and she received iron supplementation as needed.

The multidisciplinary team continued to provide comprehensive care for both mother and fetus until delivery. Regular antenatal check-ups were scheduled to monitor fetal growth and well-being.

At 38 weeks gestation, the patient went into spontaneous labor and delivered a healthy baby boy via vaginal delivery without any complications. Both mother and baby were discharged home in stable condition with plans for follow-up visits.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering surgical intervention in pregnant patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis when conservative management fails or when there are significant complications such as choledocholithiasis. A multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians, general surgeons, anesthesiologists, and close monitoring of fetal well-being is crucial in ensuring optimal outcomes for both mother and fetus.
