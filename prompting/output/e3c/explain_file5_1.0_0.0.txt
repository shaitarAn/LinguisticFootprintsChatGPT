In this clinical case, a 17-year-old African male presented with a one-week history of fever, generalized rash over the body and eyelids, intermittent headache with associated neck pain, sore throat, dry cough, and a history of diarrhea. The patient had no prior medical admission, no history of surgery, and no significant medication or recreational drug use. They had also not been in contact with any known COVID-19 case, but had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal.

On examination, the patient appeared ill and had a high blood pressure, elevated heart rate, and high temperature. A rash was observed over the body, eyelids, and palms, and conjunctivitis was present. The patient had normal abdominal and respiratory examinations, and their cardiovascular examination revealed a normal heart with a sinus tachycardia. Diagnostic assessments, including blood investigations, lumbar puncture, chest radiograph, abdominal sonar, and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR, were performed. Blood investigations showed elevated inflammatory markers, but blood and urine cultures remained negative. The first echocardiogram showed a normal heart.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, a wide differential diagnosis of infections and non-infectious conditions was considered, including viral infections, bacterial infections, Kawasaki-like disease, adult-onset Still's disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. However, based on the elevated temperature, rising inflammatory markers, and deranged liver function tests, a diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) was made.

Therapeutic interventions included administration of intravenous fluid boluses, antibiotics, hydrocortisone (which was later discontinued due to infection concerns), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), dobutamine infusion, and diuresis. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies confirmed their previous exposure to the virus. Colchicine, aspirin, and enoxaparin were added to address possible associated myopericarditis and thrombotic risk. The patient started showing improvement, with resolution of fever, downward trend in inflammatory markers, and improvement in cardiac function. They were discharged on prednisone, aspirin, and colchicine.

During follow-up, the patient recovered fully with no residual symptoms. Repeated examination and echocardiogram showed further improvement, and the prednisone dosage was gradually reduced.

Overall, the patient's clinical course highlights the importance of recognizing and managing MIS-C, a severe condition that can occur in children and adolescents following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are crucial for a favorable outcome.
