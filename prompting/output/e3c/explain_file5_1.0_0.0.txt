This clinical case describes the presentation, diagnostic assessment, and therapeutic intervention for a patient who presented with a fever, rash, and other systemic symptoms. The patient was a grade ten scholar with no prior medical admission, history of surgery, or significant medication or recreational drug use. There was no known contact with a COVID-19 case, but the patient had traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal two weeks prior to presentation.

On clinical examination, the patient appeared ill with a blood pressure of 103/44 mmHg, a heart rate of 123 beats per minute, and a temperature of 39.5Â°C. The patient was restless but showed no evidence of cognitive dysfunction. A generalized maculopapular rash was observed over the torso, upper back, limbs, and palmar surface of the hands. The rash was non-tender and accompanied by erythematous desquamating lesions over the eyelids and bilateral conjunctivitis. The patient's abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal, with no signs of jaundice, lymphadenopathy, or meningism. The cardiovascular examination revealed a sinus tachycardia, normal heart sounds, and warm, well-perfused extremities.

The patient had received three days of ceftriaxone and intravenous paracetamol prior to arriving at the hospital, but there was no clinical improvement. Blood investigations showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers. However, blood and urine cultures were negative, and the lumbar puncture, chest radiograph, and abdominal sonar were all normal.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, a wide differential diagnosis was considered. Possible viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and bacterial infections caused by Group A streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, other gram-negative bacteria, rickettsia, leptospirosis, or malaria were considered. Non-infectious differential diagnoses, including Kawasaki-like disease (KD), adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), were also considered.

The patient received therapeutic interventions based on the clinical presentation. Intravenous fluid boluses were administered but did not have a significant effect on the patient's haemodynamic parameters. Inotropes and vasopressors were not initiated as part of initial management. Antibiotics were continued, and hydrocortisone was initiated but later discontinued due to concern for infection. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was started along with a dobutamine infusion and gentle diuresis when repeat echocardiography revealed significant cardiac abnormalities. The patient also received an IV methylprednisolone pulse. Serological testing confirmed the presence of immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

The patient's condition gradually improved with the implementation of treatment. Fever subsided, and inflammatory markers, LDH, and ferritin decreased. Repeat echocardiography showed improvement in ejection fraction. The patient was discharged on a medication regimen consisting of prednisone, aspirin, and colchicine.

During follow-up in the rheumatology outpatient clinic, the patient had fully recovered with no residual symptoms. Examination revealed complete resolution of the rash, improved ejection fraction, and no signs of heart failure. The prednisone dosage was gradually tapered down, and the patient returned to school.

In summary, this clinical case highlights the diagnostic challenges and therapeutic interventions involved in managing a patient with a fever, rash, and systemic symptoms. The differential diagnosis included infectious and non-infectious causes, and treatment involved a combination of supportive measures and specific medications targeting the underlying condition. The patient showed a positive response to treatment and had a full recovery.
