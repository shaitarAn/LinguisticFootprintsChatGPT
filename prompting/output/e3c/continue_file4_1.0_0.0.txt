Case 1: Baby NU is a male infant from the Gbayi tribe who was delivered at term in a hospital by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 30-year-old para 2 mother. At birth, the baby cried well and weighed 3kg. However, a concerning issue was noticed immediately - the absence of skin and skull bone. This discovery prompted the baby to be referred to a specialized medical facility at the age of 4 hours.

During pregnancy, Baby NU's mother received regular prenatal care, and the pregnancy was reported as uneventful. The mother adamantly denied the use of any medications, whether orthodox or herbal, except for the prescribed antenatal drugs. An ultrasound scan performed in the second trimester showed no abnormalities, further adding to the mysterious nature of the baby's condition.

Being the third child of parents in a monogamous consanguineous family setting, Baby NU's parents were cousins. Consanguineous marriages, where the parents share a common ancestor, have been associated with an increased risk of certain genetic disorders due to the possibility of carrying recessive genes. This consanguinity may have played a role in the development of the baby's condition.

Upon arrival at the specialized medical facility, a team of healthcare professionals consisting of pediatricians, geneticists, and plastic surgeons assessed Baby NU's condition. The absence of skin and skull bone at birth raised concerns about a severe congenital anomaly known as Aplasia Cutis Congenita (ACC). ACC is a rare condition characterized by the partial or complete absence of skin layers, mostly affecting the scalp, but can also affect other parts of the body.

The underlying cause of ACC remains largely unknown, with multiple factors potentially contributing to its development. These factors can include genetic abnormalities, environmental factors, and certain medications taken during pregnancy. Genetic testing was conducted to determine if any specific gene mutations or chromosomal abnormalities were present in Baby NU's case.

In addition to ACC, the team investigated the possibility of a condition known as craniosynostosis, which is the premature fusion of skull bones leading to an abnormal head shape. Craniosynostosis can occur as a part of a genetic syndrome or as an isolated anomaly. Evaluation for associated features and further specialized imaging tests were initiated to confirm or rule out this condition.

The medical team also paid careful attention to other potential anomalies and health issues that might be present in Baby NU. They performed a complete physical examination to check for any additional abnormalities or signs of systemic involvement. Furthermore, a thorough family history was obtained to identify any other individuals in the extended family who might have exhibited similar conditions.

As Baby NU's medical journey continued, ongoing multidisciplinary care was crucial. The team worked collaboratively to develop a comprehensive management plan for the baby, addressing his immediate needs as well as planning for any potential long-term complications that may arise. This plan included regular follow-up appointments, potential surgical interventions, genetic counseling, and psychological support for the family.

Baby NU's case served as a reminder of the complexity of congenital anomalies and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to their evaluation and management. The medical team remained dedicated to providing the best possible care for Baby NU, ensuring his well-being while also offering support to his parents during this challenging and uncertain time.
