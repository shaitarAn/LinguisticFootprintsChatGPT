This clinical case describes a patient with a psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia type ICD 10 F20.3. The patient was being treated with Haloperidol 1.5 mg and Diazepam 5 mg daily. Due to rebellious and self-destructive behavior, the patient was occasionally restrained. The patient's nutrition management was started late, after a week of hospitalization. 

In the initial nutrition assessment, it was found that the patient was underweight, with a weight of 40 kg and height of 150 cm, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m2. The patient did not exhibit any gastrointestinal symptoms or signs. However, the patient's mother claimed that the patient seemed to have lost weight because he refused any food offered to him and only consumed cigarettes and coffee.

The patient's albumin level was 3.6 g/L, indicating imbalanced electrolyte levels. There were no signs of fluid accumulation. According to the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient was classified as severely malnourished (group C). The patient was started on energy and protein supplementation, with a gradual increase from 30 kcal/kg to 50 kcal/kg, and 2 g/kg divided into oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) in a 50:50 ratio. Micronutrient supplementation was also provided, including vitamin A, vitamin C, and zinc.

Despite the nutritional intervention, the patient continued to lose weight during the early weeks of hospitalization. At the end of the second week, the patient's body weight dropped to 36 kg, and the serum albumin level decreased to 2.7 g/L. By the 28th day, the patient's body weight further decreased to 33 kg, with a serum albumin level of 2.1 g/L. The energy and protein intake were maintained, but the ratio of oral intake and ONS was modified to 70:30.

The patient's appetite remained unstable, and the patient was uncooperative with enteral access. The patient experienced pain and increased aggression, with poor response to analgesics and sedatives. Partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was administered to support protein needs. However, the patient's BMI continued to decline, reaching 11.96 kg/m2 on the 42nd day, with a body weight of 32 kg and a serum albumin level of 2 g/L.

On the 66th day, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed. Considering the patient's mental and nutrition status, it was decided not to proceed with skin graft surgery. The patient had lost 24% of body weight, displayed severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss, and had a serum albumin level of 2.5 g/L. Despite the severe physical condition, the patient's general and mental condition showed some improvement, and the patient was discharged from the hospital.
