This clinical case involves a 35-year-old man with a history of mental illness, specifically schizophrenia. He was transferred to a hospital after attempting suicide by setting himself on fire. The burns resulted in significant injuries, affecting approximately 38% of his total body surface area (TBSA). The burns were categorized as full-thickness and partial-thickness, and they involved various parts of his body, including his face, neck, upper extremities, thighs, legs, and trunk.

Upon admission, the patient was started on medications to manage his schizophrenia, including Haloperidol and Diazepam. Due to his rebellious and self-destructive behavior, he was occasionally restrained. The patient's nutrition management was initiated a week after hospitalization, which is considered late. At the time of the initial nutrition assessment, the patient weighed 40 kg and was 150 cm tall, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m2, indicating that he was underweight.

The patient's mother reported that he had been refusing food and only consuming cigarettes and coffee, leading to weight loss. The patient's albumin level was 3.6 g/L, indicating imbalanced electrolyte levels. Signs of fluid accumulation were not observed. Based on the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient was classified as severely malnourished (group C).

To address the patient's malnutrition, energy and protein were provided gradually, starting from 30 kcal/kg and increasing to 50 kcal/kg. The patient received oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) in a 50:50 ratio. Micronutrient supplementation, including vitamin A, vitamin C, and zinc, was also administered. However, despite these interventions, the patient continued to lose weight during the early weeks of hospitalization. By the end of the second week, his body weight had dropped to 36 kg, and his serum albumin level was 2.7 g/L. On the 28th day, his body weight further decreased to 33 kg, with a serum albumin level of 2.1 g/L.

The patient's appetite remained unstable, and he had difficulty cooperating with enteral access. He experienced pain and increased aggression, which did not respond well to analgesics and sedatives. Partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was administered to meet his protein needs. However, despite these efforts, the patient's BMI continued to decline, reaching 11.96 kg/m2 on the 42nd day, with a body weight of 32 kg and a serum albumin level of 2 g/L.

On the 66th day, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed. Considering the patient's mental and nutritional status, it was decided not to proceed with skin graft surgery. At this point, the patient had lost 24% of his body weight, with a BMI of 11.96 kg/m2 and a serum albumin level of 2.5 g/L. The patient exhibited severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss. However, his general and mental condition had relatively improved, leading to his discharge from the hospital.
