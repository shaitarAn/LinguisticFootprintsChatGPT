Clinical Case: Schizophrenia and Severe Malnutrition

In this clinical case, the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia type ICD 10 F20.3 and was being treated with Haloperidol 1.5 mg and Diazepam 5 mg daily. Due to rebellious and self-destructive behavior, the patient occasionally required restraint. However, the focus of this discussion is on the patient's severe malnutrition and its management.

The patient's nutrition management was initiated after a week of hospitalization, which is considered late. The initial nutrition assessment revealed that the patient had a low body weight of 40 kg and a height of 150 cm, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m2, indicating underweight status. The patient's mother reported that the patient had been refusing food and only consumed cigarettes and coffee, leading to weight loss. Gastrointestinal symptoms and signs were not observed, and there were no indications of fluid accumulation.

According to the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient was classified as severely malnourished (group C). To address the patient's nutritional needs, energy and protein intake were initiated at 30 kcal/kg and gradually increased to 50 kcal/kg. The protein intake was set at 2 g/kg, divided between oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) in a 50:50 ratio. Micronutrient supplementation was also provided, including vitamin A (100,000 units for the first week), vitamin C (100 mg three times a day), and zinc (20 mg once a day).

Despite the nutritional intervention, the patient's weight loss continued during the early weeks of hospitalization. By the end of the second week, the patient's body weight had dropped to 36 kg, and the serum albumin level was 2.7 g/L. On the 28th day, the patient's body weight further decreased to 33 kg, with a serum albumin level of 2.1 g/L. The energy and protein intake were maintained, but the ratio of oral intake and ONS was modified to 70:30.

The patient's appetite remained unstable, and the patient was uncooperative with enteral access. The patient experienced pain and increased aggression, which did not respond well to analgesics and sedatives. To support the patient's protein needs, partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was administered. However, despite these interventions, the patient's BMI continued to decline, reaching 11.96 kg/m2 on the 42nd day, with a body weight of 32 kg and a serum albumin level of 2 g/L.

On the 66th day, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed. Considering the patient's mental and nutritional status, it was decided not to proceed with skin graft surgery. At this point, the patient had lost 24% of their body weight, displayed severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss, and had a serum albumin level of 2.5 g/L. However, the patient's general and mental condition showed some improvement, leading to their discharge from the hospital.

This clinical case highlights the challenges of managing severe malnutrition in a patient with schizophrenia. The patient's refusal to eat and limited dietary intake contributed to their significant weight loss and compromised nutritional status. Despite efforts to provide adequate energy, protein, and micronutrient supplementation, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate.

The patient's mental health condition, characterized by schizophrenia, likely played a role in their poor cooperation with nutritional interventions. The aggressive behavior and resistance to enteral access further complicated the management of their malnutrition. The decision to administer partially parenteral nutrition enriched with BCAA aimed to address the patient's protein needs but did not prevent further weight loss.

In conclusion, this case emphasizes the importance of early nutrition management in patients with severe mental health conditions such as schizophrenia. Timely intervention and close monitoring of nutritional status are crucial to prevent severe malnutrition and its associated complications. Collaborative efforts between psychiatric and nutritional healthcare professionals are essential to optimize patient outcomes in such complex cases.
