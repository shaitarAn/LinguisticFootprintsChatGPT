Clinical Case: A 45-year-old mentally ill woman was admitted to the hospital after a suicide attempt by self-inflicted lacerations to her wrists and abdomen. She had a history of bipolar disorder, diagnosed as ICD 10 F31.3, and was on medication including Lithium 900 mg and Quetiapine 200 mg daily. The patient had a long-standing history of non-compliance with her medication regimen and had been experiencing worsening symptoms of depression and anxiety in the weeks leading up to her admission.

Upon arrival, the patient was found to have deep lacerations on both wrists and a superficial laceration on her abdomen. She was immediately taken to the operating room for wound exploration and repair. The wounds were cleaned, debrided, and sutured under general anesthesia. The patient was then transferred to the psychiatric unit for further evaluation and management of her mental health condition.

During her hospitalization, it was noted that the patient had lost a significant amount of weight. She was initially weighed at 60 kg with a height of 165 cm, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 22.04 kg/m2. However, over the course of two weeks, her weight dropped to 55 kg, and her BMI decreased to 20.20 kg/m2. The patient reported a loss of appetite and had been refusing most meals, only consuming small amounts of food and fluids. She admitted to feeling guilty about eating and believed she did not deserve nourishment.

A comprehensive nutrition assessment was conducted, revealing signs of malnutrition. The patient appeared emaciated, with visible muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss. Laboratory tests showed low levels of albumin (3.2 g/L) and imbalanced electrolyte levels. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not present, and there were no signs of fluid accumulation.

Based on the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient was classified as severely malnourished (group C). A nutrition plan was initiated, starting with an energy intake of 25 kcal/kg and gradually increasing to 35 kcal/kg. Protein intake was set at 1.2 g/kg, divided between oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) in a 60:40 ratio. Micronutrient supplementation, including vitamin A 10,000 units daily, vitamin C 100 mg twice a day, and zinc 15 mg once a day, was also prescribed.

Despite the nutrition intervention, the patient's weight continued to decline. By the end of the fourth week, her body weight had dropped to 50 kg, and her serum albumin level was 2.8 g/L. The nutrition team modified the nutrition plan, increasing the energy intake to 40 kcal/kg and adjusting the ratio of oral intake and ONS to 50:50. The patient's appetite remained unstable, and she often expressed feelings of guilt and self-loathing related to eating.

Due to the patient's worsening mental state and resistance to enteral access, partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with essential amino acids was initiated to meet her protein needs. However, her BMI continued to decline, reaching 18.32 kg/m2 on the 6th week, with a body weight of 45 kg and a serum albumin level of 2.5 g/L.

At this point, the patient's wounds showed signs of healing, and her mental condition had improved slightly. Considering her overall mental and nutritional status, it was decided not to proceed with any surgical interventions. The patient had lost 25% of her body weight and displayed severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss. On the 8th week of hospitalization, she was discharged with a BMI of 17.45 kg/m2 and a serum albumin level of 2.7 g/L. A comprehensive outpatient care plan was established to continue monitoring her mental health and nutritional status.
