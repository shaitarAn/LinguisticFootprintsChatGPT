Clinical Case: A 45-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder was admitted to the burn unit following a suicide attempt by self-immolation. The incident occurred three days prior to admission, and she was transferred from a local psychiatric hospital for specialized burn care. The patient sustained extensive burns involving approximately 40% of her total body surface area (TBSA), including her face and neck (6%), both upper extremities (10%), right thigh (5%), left thigh and leg (4%), and most of her anterior and posterior trunk (15%). Over the course of her hospitalization, she underwent multiple debridement surgeries and required an extended stay of 70 days.

The patient, Ms. A, had a long-standing history of bipolar disorder, characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. She had been under the care of a psychiatrist and was prescribed mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications. Despite her treatment, she experienced a recent exacerbation of her psychiatric symptoms, leading to a significant decline in her mental health.

On the day of her admission, Ms. A had intentionally set herself on fire in an attempt to end her life. She was rescued by bystanders and immediately transferred to the local psychiatric hospital for stabilization. Due to the severity of her burns, she was subsequently referred to the burn unit for specialized care.

Upon arrival at the burn unit, Ms. A was in a critical condition. She presented with full-thickness burns on her face, neck, and upper extremities, as well as partial-thickness burns on her lower extremities and trunk. The burns were estimated to involve approximately 40% of her TBSA, indicating a high risk for complications such as infection, fluid loss, and impaired wound healing.

The initial management of Ms. A's burns involved immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent infection. She was also started on aggressive pain management, including intravenous opioids and non-pharmacological interventions such as wound dressings and positioning to alleviate discomfort.

Over the course of her hospitalization, Ms. A underwent five debridement surgeries to remove necrotic tissue and promote wound healing. Each procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and meticulous care was taken to preserve viable tissue and prevent further damage. Following each surgery, she received specialized wound care, including the application of antimicrobial dressings and the use of negative pressure wound therapy to enhance healing.

Throughout her stay, Ms. A received comprehensive multidisciplinary care. In addition to the burn team, she was closely monitored by a psychiatric consultant who collaborated with her primary psychiatrist to optimize her mental health treatment. Regular psychiatric evaluations were conducted to assess her mood, suicidal ideation, and response to medication adjustments.

Ms. A's physical and psychological recovery was challenging and required a coordinated effort from the burn team, psychiatric consultants, and the patient herself. Gradually, her wounds began to heal, and she demonstrated improved emotional stability. As her physical condition stabilized, she was provided with extensive rehabilitation, including physical and occupational therapy, to regain functional independence and improve her quality of life.

After a prolonged hospitalization of 70 days, Ms. A was discharged to a specialized rehabilitation facility for further recovery and ongoing psychiatric care. A comprehensive discharge plan was developed, involving close follow-up with her outpatient mental health team and regular burn clinic visits to monitor her wound healing progress and prevent complications.

In conclusion, Ms. A's case highlights the complex interplay between mental health and burn injuries. The successful management of her burns required a multidisciplinary approach, addressing both her physical and psychological needs. Through the collaborative efforts of the burn team and psychiatric consultants, Ms. A was able to overcome her life-threatening injuries and embark on a path towards recovery and improved mental well-being.
