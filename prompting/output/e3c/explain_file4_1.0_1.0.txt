Clinical Case 1:
In this case, a baby was born with a large defect on the scalp, known as aplasia cutis congenita. The defect measured 10 x 8 cm in the midline and 6 x 6 cm in the occipital region. The baby also had low set ears, irritability, tense anterior fontanelle (soft spot on the head), and respiratory distress. A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis was made.

The baby received routine care including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics for meningitis, and wound dressings. The multidisciplinary team consisting of neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons were involved in the management.

A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that there was absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally extending from 2 cm behind the anterior fontanelle down to the posterior fontanelle. The brain in this region was covered by dural meninges. However, other parts of the skull were spared and brain structures appeared normal.

Plans were made for future intervention which involved raising a flap cover for autologous skin grafting.

The baby was discharged after 18 days with oral antibiotics and daily wound dressing for follow-up at specialty clinics.

Clinical Case 2:
In this case, a newborn baby was found to have a part of their skull bone missing at birth. There were no overt traumatic events during delivery or any history of exposure to harmful factors during pregnancy.

The baby presented with various clinical findings including fever, cyanosis (bluish discoloration), hypertonicity (increased muscle tone), subcutaneous tissue defect on scalp extending from frontal to occipital area with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Additionally, there were skin desquamation (peeling skin), hypoplastic finger and toe nails, dilated abdominal wall veins as well as a heart murmur.

A working diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies was made, including congenital cutis aplasia (missing skull bone) and ventricular septal defect (a hole in the heart wall). Meningitis was also suspected.

Bacterial cultures from blood and CSF revealed Providencia species and E. coli respectively, indicating an infection. Due to financial constraints, additional tests such as brain MRI, echocardiography, and chromosomal studies could not be done.

The baby received treatment with antibiotics and wound care for the scalp defect. Complications such as CSF leakage and meningitis occurred but resolved over time.

Plans were made for surgical intervention including prolene mesh/titanium mesh placement and latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap cover.

The baby was discharged upon parents' request after 35 days of admission but unfortunately died 7 days later.
