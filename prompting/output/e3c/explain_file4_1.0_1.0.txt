Case 1 involves a male infant, known as baby NU, who was delivered at term in a hospital. At birth, it was noticed that there was absence of skin and skull bone on the vertex of the scalp. The baby's parents are cousins and there was a history of fresh stillbirth during the mother's first delivery. The baby had low set ears, respiratory distress, and a tense anterior fontanelle.

A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis was made. The baby received routine care including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics for meningitis, and wound dressings. The respiratory distress improved over time and oral feeds were started.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally with an area of defect measuring 8.3 cm x 5.3 cm (AP X TR). However, the brain structures were normal in morphology and signal intensity.

The burns and plastic unit along with neurosurgeons made plans for future intervention to raise a flap cover for autologous skin grafting. The baby was discharged after 18 days on oral antibiotics and wound care for follow-up at specialty clinics.

Case 2 involves another infant, known as baby YA, who was referred at 48 hours old due to absence of part of the skull bone noticed at birth. This baby was delivered at home without trauma to the head. Clinical findings included fever, cyanosis (bluish discoloration), hypertonicity (increased muscle tone), desquamating skin (skin peeling), hypoplastic finger/toe nails (underdeveloped nails), dilated abdominal wall veins, and a systolic cardiac murmur.

A working diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies including aplasia cutis congenita and ventricular septal defect (a heart defect) with meningitis was made. Blood culture revealed Providencia species while CSF culture revealed E. coli, indicating infection. Financial constraints prevented further investigations such as brain MRI, echocardiography, and chromosomal studies.

The baby was treated with antibiotics and wound care for the scalp defect. Complications included CSF leakage and meningitis, which resolved over time. The burns and plastic unit planned for mesh repair of the defect.

Unfortunately, the baby was discharged but died 7 days later.

These are two separate cases involving infants with congenital abnormalities affecting the skull bone. Baby NU had aplasia cutis congenita while baby YA had multiple congenital anomalies including aplasia cutis congenita and a heart defect. Both cases required multidisciplinary team management and surgical interventions to address the issues with the scalp defects.
