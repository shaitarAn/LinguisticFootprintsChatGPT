This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a fever, rash, and other symptoms. The patient had no prior medical admissions, surgeries, or significant medication or recreational drug use. They were a grade ten scholar and had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.

On examination, the patient appeared ill and had a low blood pressure, high heart rate, and elevated temperature. They had a generalized maculopapular rash on their torso, upper back, limbs, and hands, along with erythematous desquamating lesions on the eyelids and conjunctivitis. The patient's abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal, and their cardiovascular examination revealed a normal heart with a sinus tachycardia. There were no signs of meningism or arthritis.

Initial diagnostic assessments included blood investigations, which showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers. Blood and urine cultures were negative, and a lumbar puncture, chest radiograph, and abdominal sonar were all normal. The first echocardiogram (ECHO) showed a structurally normal heart with normal systolic function.

The differential diagnosis included viral and bacterial infections, as well as non-infectious conditions such as Kawasaki-like disease (KD), adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, based on the patient's elevated temperature, rising inflammatory markers, and deranged liver function tests, a diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) was considered.

Therapeutic interventions included intravenous fluid boluses, antibiotics, and hydrocortisone. However, the patient did not respond significantly to the fluid boluses, and their condition worsened with low mean arterial pressures and elevated cardiac troponin-T levels. A repeat ECHO revealed poor heart function, and the patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), dobutamine, and diuretics. Steroids were also initiated, and serological testing confirmed the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

The patient showed improvement with these interventions, and their fever resolved. Inflammatory markers decreased, and a repeat ECHO showed improved heart function. The patient was discharged on a tapering dose of prednisone, aspirin, and colchicine. At a follow-up appointment, the patient had fully recovered, with no residual symptoms. Their heart function had improved, and they were gradually weaned off prednisone.

In summary, this clinical case describes a patient who presented with symptoms consistent with MIS-C, a condition associated with COVID-19 in children. The patient received appropriate interventions, including IVIG, steroids, and supportive care, leading to a full recovery. This case highlights the importance of considering MIS-C in children with fever and multisystem involvement, especially in the context of recent COVID-19 exposure or travel history.
