Upon arrival at the hospital, baby NU was immediately assessed by a team of healthcare professionals. The absence of skin and skull bone was confirmed, revealing a rare and complex condition known as aplasia cutis congenita. This condition is characterized by the partial or complete absence of skin at birth, most commonly affecting the scalp.

The medical team conducted a thorough examination of baby NU to assess the extent of the condition. They discovered that the absence of skin and skull bone was localized to the parietal region of the scalp, measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter. The underlying brain tissue was visible through the defect, but there were no signs of bleeding or infection.

Further investigations were carried out to determine the underlying cause of aplasia cutis congenita in baby NU. Genetic testing was recommended due to the consanguineous relationship between his parents. The results revealed a mutation in the TP63 gene, confirming the diagnosis of AEC syndrome (Ankyloblepharon-Ectodermal defects-Cleft lip/palate syndrome).

AEC syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of ectodermal tissues, including the skin, hair, nails, and teeth. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that a child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation if one parent carries it.

The medical team provided counseling and support to baby NU's parents, explaining the nature of the condition and its long-term implications. They reassured the parents that with appropriate medical care and interventions, baby NU could lead a relatively normal life.

In terms of immediate management, the medical team decided to cover the exposed brain tissue with a sterile, non-adherent dressing to protect it from infection and trauma. They also initiated a multidisciplinary approach involving plastic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and dermatologists to plan for the surgical reconstruction of the skull and skin.

Baby NU was closely monitored in the neonatal intensive care unit to ensure his overall well-being. He was provided with appropriate nutrition, hydration, and pain management. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his growth and development, as well as to address any potential complications that may arise.

The case of baby NU highlighted the importance of comprehensive prenatal care and genetic counseling, particularly in consanguineous families. It also emphasized the need for a multidisciplinary approach in managing complex congenital conditions, ensuring the best possible outcomes for the affected child.
