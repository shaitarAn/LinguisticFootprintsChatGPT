Clinical Case: A 25-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) presenting with chronic headaches was admitted to our clinic. He had a 3-year history of recurrent non-pulsating headaches. The headaches were not relieved by over-the-counter pain medications and were not exacerbated by physical activity. There were no associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or visual disturbances. The pain was described as bilateral, dull, and constant. The patient had no family history of headaches.

The patient had a medical history of NF1, diagnosed during childhood due to the presence of café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas. He had no history of seizures or other neurological disorders. He had been on regular follow-up with a neurologist for his NF1, but no specific treatment had been initiated for his headaches.

On physical examination, multiple café-au-lait spots were observed on his trunk and extremities. Neurological examination revealed no focal deficits or abnormalities. Ophthalmological evaluation showed no signs of optic glioma or other ocular abnormalities.

Given the chronic nature of his headaches and the presence of NF1, further investigations were warranted. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, which revealed multiple T2 hyperintense lesions in the white matter, consistent with the presence of neurofibromas. There were no signs of hydrocephalus or other intracranial abnormalities.

The patient was started on a prophylactic medication for his headaches, considering their chronicity and impact on his quality of life. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant with analgesic properties, was initiated at a low dose and gradually titrated up. The patient was also advised to keep a headache diary to monitor the frequency, intensity, and triggers of his headaches.

During follow-up visits, the patient reported a significant reduction in the frequency and intensity of his headaches after being on amitriptyline for 6 weeks. He experienced only occasional mild headaches, which were manageable with over-the-counter pain medications. The patient was counseled on the importance of regular medication adherence and the need for long-term follow-up.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering underlying conditions in patients presenting with chronic headaches. In patients with NF1, headaches can be a common symptom, and appropriate management strategies, including prophylactic medications, can significantly improve their quality of life. Regular follow-up and monitoring are essential to ensure optimal headache control and to address any potential complications associated with NF1.
