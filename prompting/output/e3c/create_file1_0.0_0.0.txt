Clinical Case: A 25-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) presenting with chronic headaches was admitted to our clinic. He had a 3-year history of recurrent non-pulsating headaches. The headaches were not relieved by over-the-counter pain medications and were not exacerbated by physical activity. There were no associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or visual disturbances. The pain was described as bilateral, dull, and constant. The patient had no family history of headaches.

The patient had a medical history of seizures starting at the age of 5, characterized by generalized tonic-clonic contractions. He was diagnosed with NF1 at the age of 8 due to the presence of café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas. He had been on antiepileptic medication (valproic acid) since then and had not experienced any seizures since starting the treatment. Developmentally, he had achieved normal milestones during infancy and childhood, but his academic performance had been below average. He struggled with reading and writing, requiring additional educational support.

On physical examination, multiple café-au-lait spots were observed on his trunk and extremities. Neurofibromas were present on his face, neck, and back. He had no significant findings on his family history, and his siblings did not exhibit any signs of NF1. The patient was also diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and was prescribed sertraline 50 mg daily for anxiety management.

Following the initiation of sertraline treatment, the patient reported a slight reduction in the intensity of his headaches after the first week, but the frequency remained unchanged. Intraoral examination revealed gingival hyperplasia, characterized by an overgrowth of gingival tissue that appeared red and blanched upon pressure, suggestive of angiomatous enlargement. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities except for mild weakness in the left upper and lower extremities.

Ophthalmological evaluation revealed optic glioma in the right eye, leading to a diagnosis of optic pathway glioma associated with NF1. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures in the right hemisphere, along with diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1-weighted cranial MRI demonstrated asymmetrical calvarial thickness, with the right hemisphere appearing smaller than the left. Additionally, T2-weighted MRI revealed extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle, as well as perivascular spaces anterior to the third ventricle and in the right temporooccipital area.

The patient underwent a cognitive assessment using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, which yielded a score of 70, indicating mild intellectual disability. Psychological support and educational resources were provided to assist the patient in managing his cognitive challenges.

In summary, this case presents a 25-year-old male patient with NF1 who presented with chronic headaches. The patient exhibited characteristic features of NF1, including café-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and optic glioma. The headaches were not responsive to over-the-counter pain medications and were associated with mild intellectual disability. Further investigations revealed diffuse brain atrophy, calcifications, and vascular abnormalities in the right hemisphere. The patient's treatment plan included antiepileptic medication, sertraline for anxiety, and supportive measures for his cognitive challenges.
