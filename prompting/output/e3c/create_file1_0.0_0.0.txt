Clinical Case: A 35-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of Migraine presenting with chronic headaches admitted to our clinic. He had a 5-year history of frequent pulsating headaches. The patient reported that his headaches were often triggered by stress and lack of sleep. He found relief with over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen, and the pain did not worsen with physical activity. There were no accompanying symptoms of nausea or aura-like sensations.

The patient described his headaches as lasting for several hours, typically starting on one side of his head and then spreading to the other side. The pain was intense, throbbing, and localized to the frontal and temporal regions. He reported sensitivity to light and sound during these episodes. The patient had no family history of migraines or other headache disorders.

In addition to his chronic migraines, the patient also reported experiencing occasional visual disturbances. He described seeing zigzag lines and flashing lights in his visual field, which lasted for approximately 20 minutes before resolving spontaneously. These visual disturbances were not associated with any headache pain or other neurological symptoms.

The patient had a history of anxiety and depression, which he had been managing with therapy and occasional use of anti-anxiety medications. He reported that his anxiety symptoms often worsened during migraine episodes, leading to increased stress levels.

During the physical examination, the patient appeared generally well and in no acute distress. His vital signs were within normal limits. Neurological examination revealed no focal deficits, and cranial nerve function was intact. There were no signs of meningeal irritation.

Given the patient's history of chronic migraines and visual disturbances, a diagnosis of Migraine with Aura was suspected. However, further investigations were warranted to rule out other potential causes and to confirm the diagnosis.

Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, and electrolyte levels, were within normal limits. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed to evaluate the patient's brain activity and rule out any underlying seizure disorder. The EEG results showed no abnormal epileptiform activity.

To manage the patient's chronic migraines, a multidisciplinary approach was initiated. The patient was advised to maintain a regular sleep schedule, practice stress management techniques, and avoid known triggers such as certain foods and excessive caffeine intake. Non-pharmacological interventions, including relaxation exercises and cognitive-behavioral therapy, were recommended to help manage anxiety and stress levels.

In terms of pharmacological management, the patient was prescribed a triptan medication to be taken at the onset of a migraine attack. He was also advised to keep a headache diary to track the frequency, duration, and intensity of his headaches, as well as any associated triggers or patterns.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor the patient's response to treatment and make any necessary adjustments. The patient was encouraged to reach out to the healthcare team if there were any concerns or if his symptoms worsened.

In conclusion, this clinical case highlights a 35-year-old male patient with a history of chronic migraines and occasional visual disturbances. The patient's symptoms, including the pulsating nature of the headaches, sensitivity to light and sound, and visual disturbances, are consistent with a diagnosis of Migraine with Aura. A comprehensive management plan, involving lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, was implemented to help alleviate the patient's symptoms and improve his quality of life.
