This clinical case describes a 36-year-old pregnant woman who presented with a 3-month history of epigastric abdominal pain. The pain was dull and persistent, gradually worsening over time, and occasionally radiating to the chest. She also experienced significant weight loss but denied other associated symptoms such as early satiety, jaundice, fever, itch, or spontaneous bleeding.

Upon examination, the patient showed signs of wasting, mild pallor, a tinge of jaundice but was well hydrated and had no palpable lymph nodes. Her abdomen appeared grossly distended with distorted contours in the upper half and visible distended veins on the anterior abdominal wall. The liver was enlarged with a hard nodular texture and irregular edges. There was mild tenderness on palpation and a bruit could be heard upon auscultation.

Further evaluation revealed laboratory abnormalities including low hemoglobin levels (10.3g/dl), elevated white blood cell count (10,200 cells/dl) with increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes and monocytes percentages. Platelet count was normal at 350000/ul. Total protein and albumin levels were low (44g/L and 29g/L respectively) along with an elevated INR (1.3). The patient tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) but negative for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Hepatitis B virus DNA level was high at 126869 IU/ml indicating an active infection.

Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (cancer originating from liver cells) on top of pre-existing cirrhosis of the liver.

Due to unbearable abdominal pain that continued to worsen despite treatment measures like analgesia,furosemide,and spironolactone,the decision was made to terminate her pregnancy at 30 weeks 3 days gestation. The patient delivered a stillborn baby weighing 1.2kg.

The patient was discharged after 5 days and advised to follow up with the gastrointestinal clinic. However, she was lost to follow-up after the first two post-discharge visits at 2 weeks and 4 weeks.

This case highlights a rare and challenging situation of hepatocellular carcinoma in pregnancy, where the presence of liver cancer complicates an already delicate condition. The management involves a multidisciplinary approach to balance the needs of both mother and fetus, with close monitoring for potential complications such as liver decompensation.
