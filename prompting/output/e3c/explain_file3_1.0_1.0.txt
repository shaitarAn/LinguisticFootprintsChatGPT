This clinical case involves a 35-year-old man with a diagnosis of schizophrenia who attempted suicide by fire. He sustained burns to approximately 38% of his total body surface area (TBSA), including his face, neck, upper extremities, thigh, leg, trunk. The patient was transferred from a local psychiatric hospital and required multiple debridement surgeries during his 66-day hospitalization.

The patient's psychiatric condition was managed with Haloperidol and Diazepam medications. Due to behavioral issues, the patient required occasional physical restraints. However, the focus of this case is on the patient's nutrition status and management.

Nutrition assessment revealed that the patient had a low body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m², indicating that he was underweight. The patient had been refusing food offered to him and only consumed cigarettes and coffee according to his mother's report.

The initial subjective global assessment (SGA) categorized the patient as severely malnourished (Group C). To address this malnutrition, energy and protein intake were gradually increased from 30 kcal/kg to 50 kcal/kg per day along with 2 g protein/kg divided between oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS).

Micronutrient supplementation was also provided in the form of vitamin A (100,000 units for the first week), vitamin C (100 mg three times daily), and zinc (20 mg daily).

However, despite these interventions, the patient continued to lose weight during early weeks of hospitalization. By day 28 he weighed 33 kg with a serum albumin level of 2.1 g/L; by day 42 he weighed only 32 kg with a serum albumin level of 2 g/L.

Due to ongoing weight loss and inadequate response to pain medications and sedation for procedural interventions like enteral access placement for feeding tube administration or skin graft surgery for wound closure; the patient's BMI dropped to 11.96 kg/m² on the 66th day.

Although granulation tissues started to appear at the wound site, it was decided not to proceed with skin graft surgery due to the patient's mental and nutrition status.

Ultimately, despite severe muscle wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat, the patient's general and mental condition improved relative to his initial presentation. Therefore, he was discharged from the hospital after a challenging 66-day hospitalization period.

It is important to note that this case highlights the complex management issues associated with patients who have significant burn injuries combined with mental health conditions that can impact their ability to comply with necessary treatments and affect their nutritional outcomes.
