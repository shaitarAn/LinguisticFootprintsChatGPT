In this clinical case, we have a 21-year-old female patient diagnosed with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). SWS is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal blood vessels on the surface of the brain and type specific birthmark called port wine stain. It commonly affects the brain, skin, and eyes.

The patient presented with frequent non-pulsating headaches that had started two years prior to admission. The headaches were bilateral, generalized, and pressing in quality. Interestingly, they were relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and not worsened by physical activity. There did not seem to be accompanying symptoms like nausea or aura before the headache episodes.

It's essential to note that this patient's medical history indicated seizures at birth. These attacks are described as tonic clonic contractions and later led to her diagnosis of SWS. At age 6, she underwent a callosotomy procedure, which is surgical disconnection of the two hemispheres of the brain used to control seizures.
