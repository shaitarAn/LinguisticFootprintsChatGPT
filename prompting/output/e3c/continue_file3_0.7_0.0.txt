During his 66-day hospitalization, the 35-year-old mentally ill man underwent a rigorous and extensive treatment plan to manage his burn injuries. The primary goal was to promote wound healing, prevent infection, and address the psychological aspects of his condition.

Upon admission, the patient was immediately placed on a specialized burn unit where a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals collaborated to provide him with the best possible care. This team consisted of burn surgeons, nurses, psychiatrists, physical and occupational therapists, and social workers, all working together to address both his physical and mental health needs.

The patient's burns were assessed and classified according to the extent and depth of the injury. His injuries were predominantly deep partial-thickness and full-thickness burns, affecting approximately 38% of his total body surface area (TBSA). The burns were distributed across various regions of his body, including his face and neck (5%), both upper extremities (8%), right thigh (4%), left thigh and leg (3%), and most of his anterior and posterior trunk (16%).

In order to promote wound healing and prevent infection, the patient underwent a series of five debridement surgeries. Debridement involves the removal of dead or damaged tissue from the burn site, allowing for healthy tissue regeneration. This process helps to reduce the risk of infection and promotes the formation of granulation tissue, which is essential for wound healing.

During each surgery, the burn surgeon meticulously removed necrotic tissue, ensuring that healthy tissue was preserved. Following the debridement procedures, the wounds were thoroughly cleaned and dressed with specialized dressings to promote a moist wound environment and prevent infection.

In addition to surgical interventions, the patient received a comprehensive wound care regimen. This included regular dressing changes, application of topical antimicrobial agents, and the use of specialized wound healing techniques such as negative pressure wound therapy. These interventions were aimed at optimizing wound healing and minimizing the risk of complications.

In parallel to the physical aspects of his treatment, the patient also received psychological support from the psychiatric team. Given his history of mental illness and the attempted suicide that led to his burn injuries, addressing his psychological well-being was crucial. The psychiatric team conducted regular assessments, provided counseling, and prescribed appropriate medications to manage his mental health condition.

Furthermore, the patient was referred to physical and occupational therapy to improve his mobility and functional abilities. The therapists implemented a progressive exercise program to prevent muscle contractures and joint stiffness, which are common complications following burn injuries. They also provided him with adaptive devices and techniques to assist with activities of daily living.

As the patient's wounds gradually healed, the focus of treatment shifted towards scar management and rehabilitation. Scar tissue can cause functional limitations and aesthetic concerns, so the patient underwent scar massage, compression therapy, and silicone gel application to minimize scar formation and improve the appearance and flexibility of his skin.

Throughout his hospitalization, the patient's progress was closely monitored, and his treatment plan was adjusted accordingly. The multidisciplinary team worked collaboratively to ensure that all aspects of his care were addressed, from wound healing to psychological support and rehabilitation.

After 66 days in the hospital, the patient was discharged with a comprehensive aftercare plan in place. This included regular follow-up appointments with the burn surgeon, continued psychiatric support, and outpatient therapy sessions to further enhance his physical and functional recovery.

The case of this mentally ill man with extensive burn injuries highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of burn care. It underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, where healthcare professionals from various disciplines come together to provide holistic care and support to patients with burn injuries. Through the coordinated efforts of the healthcare team, this patient was able to achieve significant progress in his physical and mental recovery, paving the way for a better quality of life moving forward.
