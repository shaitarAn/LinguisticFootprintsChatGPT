During his hospitalization, the patient received extensive wound care and underwent multiple skin graft surgeries to promote healing and minimize scarring. The medical team closely monitored his vital signs, ensuring he received appropriate pain management and psychological support to address his mental health condition.

Due to the severity of his injuries, the patient experienced significant physical limitations and required extensive rehabilitation. Occupational and physical therapists worked closely with him to regain functional independence and improve his mobility. They implemented a comprehensive rehabilitation program that included therapeutic exercises, range of motion activities, and adaptive equipment to assist with daily activities.

In addition to the physical challenges, the patient also received intensive psychological therapy to address the underlying mental health issues that contributed to his suicide attempt. A multidisciplinary team consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers provided individual and group therapy sessions to help him cope with his emotions, develop healthy coping mechanisms, and prevent future incidents.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's progress was closely monitored, and his wounds were regularly assessed for signs of infection or complications. The medical team maintained strict infection control protocols, including wound dressing changes, antibiotic therapy, and meticulous hygiene practices.

As the patient's physical and psychological conditions improved, he was gradually reintroduced to daily activities and social interactions. The hospital staff worked closely with his family and caregivers to provide education and support for the patient's transition back into the community. They helped establish a comprehensive aftercare plan, including regular follow-up appointments with the psychiatric team, continued wound care, and ongoing rehabilitation.

After 66 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged with a significantly improved physical and mental state. He continued to receive outpatient care, including regular therapy sessions and follow-up visits with his healthcare providers. The patient's journey towards recovery was a testament to the dedication and expertise of the healthcare team who provided comprehensive care and support throughout his hospitalization and beyond.
