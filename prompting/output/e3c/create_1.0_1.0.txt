Case Study: A 27-year-old male patient diagnosed with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) presenting with recurrent headaches was admitted to our clinic. The patient reported experiencing non-pulsating headaches for the past 3 years. These headaches responded well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and were not exacerbated by physical activity. There were no associated symptoms like nausea or aura, and the duration of each headache episode ranged from several hours.

Medical history revealed that at birth, the patient had a seizure characterized by tonic-clonic contractions, leading to a diagnosis of SWS. Remarkably, at the age of 6, he underwent callosotomy surgery to manage his seizures effectively. However, during an unrelated laser treatment performed when he was 18 years old, he experienced his first seizure since the surgery took place. Consequently, carbamazepine was prescribed thereafter at a daily dose of 400 mg which has successfully controlled his seizures without any subsequent episodes.

The patient's background provided insight into their academic struggles despite an initially normal developmental trajectory during infancy; they barely completed elementary school and exhibit limited literacy skills presently. No significant family history related to SWS was noted except for an older sister who also presented with a port wine stain on her face; however, no further investigations were conducted in relation to her condition.

Currently, apart from SWS diagnosis and chronic headaches management through pharmacotherapy comprising ketiapin (25 mg daily), venlafaxine (75 mg daily), and NSAIDs as needed; the patient receives treatment for anxiety disorder as well. Initial response after one week indicated slight relief in headache intensity but no change in frequency.

During physical examination, distinct facial nevi secondary to choroid angioma were observed on their right forehead,hemifacial region encompassing both eyelid and nasal wing areas.The presence of bright red gingival overgrowth with angiomatous enlargement seen on the right side during intraoral examination was evident, exhibiting blanching upon applying pressure. Additionally, mild asymmetry in extremities was apparent with the left arm and leg being relatively smaller in proportion and displaying hemiparesis affecting both upper and lower limbs to a similar extent. Ophthalmological evaluation confirmed the presence of glaucoma in the patient's right eye.

Psychiatric assessment revealed signs consistent with an anxiety disorder. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for the observed hemiparesis. Imaging studies including cranial CT scans demonstrated diffuse atrophy within the right hemisphere along with irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications localized predominantly to the right occipital region. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI unveiled multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the affected hemisphere alongside diffuse atrophy on that same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI images indicated a thickened calvarium on the right compared to left, further confirming asymmetric hemispheric reduction in size primarily involving the right side.Meanwhile,T2-weighted MRI provided visual evidence of extensive venous formations encircling and surrounding corpus callosum centrally,anterior region of third ventricle at Willis polygon localization,and within quadrigeminal cistern perimeter distributed across their posterior temporooccipital regions.

Finally,a proteus intelligence test conducted yielded a score of 75 points leading to a clinical determination that classified this patient as having mild intellectual disability.

In conclusion, this case presents a 27-year-old male with Sturge-Weber Syndrome experiencing recurrent headaches along with associated neurological manifestations such as hemiparesis and glaucoma.The co-existence of anxiety disorder further complicates their clinical presentation.Treatment options for chronic headaches are under review given limited response thus far while other symptoms are managed using medications tailored towards symptomatic relief.Future interventions will aim to mitigate physical discomfort effectively while facilitating optimal cognitive development for the patient.
