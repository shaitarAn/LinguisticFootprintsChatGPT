This clinical case describes a patient who presented with various symptoms and was ultimately diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) during pregnancy. The patient did not have a known history of diabetes, hypertension, or chronic illness, and denied alcohol and smoking. There were no symptoms related to the heart, lungs, or urogenital system. On physical examination, the patient had wasting (weight loss), mild pallor (pale appearance), a slight yellowing of the skin (jaundice), but appeared well hydrated and had no fever or enlarged lymph nodes. The patient had redness of the palms (palmar erythema) but no clubbing (abnormal changes in the shape of fingers) or enlargement of the salivary glands.

However, further examination revealed a grossly distended abdomen, with visible swollen veins on the front wall of the abdomen. The liver was enlarged, hard, nodular, and tender, with an irregular edge and a bruit (abnormal sound) heard on auscultation. Mild ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) and edema in the lower limbs were also present. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed a heterogeneous (irregular) liver with multiple hypoechoic (dark) lesions.

Laboratory tests indicated a low hemoglobin level, mildly elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests (raised GGT and AST). The total protein and albumin levels were low, and the INR (international normalized ratio) was slightly elevated. The patient tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and had a high viral load, indicating an active infection. The patient was negative for HIV and hepatitis C.

A pelvic scan confirmed an ongoing pregnancy at 27 weeks and 3 days, with normal fetal movements. The revised diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic (scarred) liver with decompensation during pregnancy. The management plan involved pain relief, diuretic medication (furosemide and spironolactone) to manage ascites and edema, and the addition of lamivudine to prevent transmission of hepatitis B to the baby. The goal was to allow the pregnancy to continue until at least 32 weeks to improve the chances of neonatal survival. However, due to worsening abdominal pain, the pregnancy was terminated at 30 weeks and 3 days by induction of labor. The outcome was a stillbirth weighing 1.2 kg.

Following delivery, the patient's pain significantly reduced, and she was discharged after five days. She was scheduled for a follow-up visit at the gastrointestinal clinic but was lost to follow-up after the 4-week post-discharge visit.
