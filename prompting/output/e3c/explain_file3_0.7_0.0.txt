This clinical case describes a patient with a psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia type ICD 10 F20.3. The patient was being treated with the medications Haloperidol 1.5 mg and Diazepam 5 mg daily. Due to rebellious and self-destructive behavior, the patient was occasionally restrained. 

After a week of hospitalization, the patient's nutrition management started, which was considered late. The initial nutrition assessment revealed that the patient had a low body weight of 40 kg and a height of 150 cm, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m2, indicating that the patient was underweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not observed, but the patient's mother reported that the patient had been refusing food and only consumed cigarettes and coffee. The patient's albumin level was 3.6 g/L, and electrolyte levels were imbalanced. No signs of fluid accumulation were found. 

Based on the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient was categorized as severely malnourished (group C). The patient's nutrition plan included gradually increasing energy and protein intake from 30 kcal/kg to 50 kcal/kg and 2 g/kg, respectively. The patient received oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) in a 50:50 ratio. Micronutrient supplementation included vitamin A (100,000 units for the first week), vitamin C (100 mg three times a day), and zinc (20 mg once a day). 

However, during the early weeks of hospitalization, the patient continued to lose weight. At the end of the second week, the patient's body weight dropped to 36 kg, and the serum albumin level decreased to 2.7 g/L. By the 28th day, the patient's body weight decreased further to 33 kg, with a serum albumin level of 2.1 g/L. The patient's energy and protein intake were maintained, but the ratio of oral intake and ONS was modified to 70:30. 

The patient's appetite remained unstable, and the patient was uncooperative with enteral access. The patient experienced pain and increased aggression, which did not respond well to analgesics and sedation. Partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was initiated to meet the patient's protein needs. However, the patient's BMI continued to decline, reaching 11.96 kg/m2 on the 42nd day, with a body weight of 32 kg and a serum albumin level of 2 g/L. 

On the 66th day, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed. Considering the patient's mental and nutrition status, the decision was made not to proceed with the planned skin graft surgery. The patient had lost 24% of their body weight, resulting in severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss. Despite this, the patient's general and mental condition had relatively improved, leading to their discharge from the hospital.
