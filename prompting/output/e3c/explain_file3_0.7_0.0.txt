In this clinical case, we have a 35-year-old mentally ill man who was transferred from a psychiatric hospital after attempting suicide by setting himself on fire. He sustained burns over approximately 38% of his total body surface area (TBSA), including his face, neck, upper extremities, thighs, legs, and trunk.

Upon admission, the patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia (ICD 10 F20.3) and was being treated with Haloperidol and Diazepam. Due to his rebellious and self-destructive behavior, he was occasionally restrained. The patient's nutrition management began a week after hospitalization, which is considered late. He weighed 40 kg and had a height of 150 cm, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m2, indicating that he was underweight.

The patient's mother reported that he had been refusing food and only consumed cigarettes and coffee, leading to weight loss. The patient's albumin level was 3.6 g/L, indicating imbalanced electrolyte levels. Signs of fluid accumulation were not observed. Using the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient was categorized as severely malnourished (group C).

To address the patient's malnutrition, his energy and protein intake were gradually increased from 30 kcal/kg to 50 kcal/kg and 2 g/kg, respectively. This was divided between oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) in a 50:50 ratio. Micronutrient supplements, including vitamin A, vitamin C, and zinc, were also provided.

Despite these interventions, the patient continued to experience weight loss during the early weeks of hospitalization. By the second week, his body weight had dropped to 36 kg, with a serum albumin level of 2.7 g/L. By the 28th day, his body weight was 33 kg, and his serum albumin level was 2.1 g/L. The patient's appetite remained unstable, and he had difficulty with enteral access.

To support his protein needs, partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was administered. However, the patient's BMI continued to decline, reaching 11.96 kg/m2 on the 42nd day, with a body weight of 32 kg and a serum albumin level of 2 g/L.

On the 66th day, granulation tissues started to appear on the wound bed, and it was decided not to proceed with skin graft surgery considering the patient's mental and nutrition status. The patient was discharged from the hospital with a 24% loss of body weight, severe muscle wasting, and subcutaneous fat loss. However, his general and mental condition had relatively improved.

Overall, this case highlights the challenges faced in managing the nutrition of a mentally ill patient with extensive burn injuries. Despite attempts to provide adequate nutrition, the patient's condition deteriorated, leading to significant weight loss and muscle wasting. Close monitoring and individualized interventions are crucial in such cases to prevent further complications and promote recovery.
