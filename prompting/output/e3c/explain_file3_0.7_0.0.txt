Title: Managing Malnutrition in a Patient with Schizophrenia: A Challenging Clinical Case

Introduction:
In this clinical case, we encounter a patient diagnosed with schizophrenia type ICD 10 F20.3, who presented with severe malnutrition. The patient's history of rebellious behavior and self-destruction led to occasional restraint. Nutritional management was initiated late, resulting in a significantly underweight patient with gastrointestinal symptoms. This case highlights the complexities of addressing malnutrition in psychiatric patients and the challenges faced in providing adequate nutrition support.

Assessment and Diagnosis:
The patient, weighing 40 kg and measuring 150 cm in height, had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m2, indicating underweight status. No significant gastrointestinal symptoms were observed, but the patient's mother reported that he had been refusing food, consuming only cigarettes and coffee. Objective assessment revealed a low albumin level and imbalanced electrolyte levels, indicating malnutrition. According to the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool, the patient was classified as severely malnourished.

Nutrition Management:
The patient's nutritional support began with an energy intake of 30 kcal/kg, gradually increasing to 50 kcal/kg, along with a protein intake of 2 g/kg. Both oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) were administered in a 50:50 ratio. Micronutrient supplementation included vitamin A, vitamin C, and zinc. Despite these interventions, the patient's weight loss continued during the early weeks of hospitalization.

Challenges and Complications:
The patient exhibited unstable appetite and was non-cooperative with enteral access, experiencing pain and increased aggression. Analgesics and sedatives were ineffective in managing these symptoms. Partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was initiated to meet protein needs. However, the patient's BMI continued to decline, reaching a critical level of 11.96 kg/m2 by day 42. Granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed, making the decision to forgo skin graft surgery due to the patient's mental and nutrition status.

Discharge and Outcome:
Despite severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss, the patient's general and mental condition improved slightly. By the time of discharge, the patient had lost 24% of body weight, with a serum albumin level of 2.5 g/L. The management of this complex case highlights the multidisciplinary approach required to address the medical, psychiatric, and nutritional needs of patients with schizophrenia.

Discussion:
Schizophrenia, a chronic mental disorder, often presents challenges in managing physical health, including nutrition. The patient's refusal to eat and limited dietary intake, combined with the side effects of antipsychotic medications such as Haloperidol, contributed to the development of severe malnutrition. Moreover, psychiatric symptoms such as rebellious behavior and self-destruction necessitated occasional restraint, further complicating nutrition management and reducing opportunities for therapeutic engagement.

Early initiation of nutrition support is crucial to preventing further weight loss and malnutrition-related complications. In this case, the delayed start of nutrition management likely contributed to the patient's continued weight loss. To address this, a gradual increase in energy and protein intake was implemented, along with a combination of oral nutrition and ONS. Micronutrient supplementation aimed to correct deficiencies and support the body's healing processes.

However, challenges such as the patient's unstable appetite and non-cooperative behavior with enteral access hindered the effectiveness of nutrition interventions. The patient's pain and aggression were difficult to manage, and conventional analgesics and sedatives were ineffective. Partially parenteral nutrition enriched with BCAA was employed to provide essential protein, but the patient's BMI continued to decline.

Conclusion:
Managing malnutrition in patients with schizophrenia is a complex task requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Early nutrition assessment and intervention are essential to prevent severe weight loss and associated complications. In this case, delayed nutrition management and the patient's refusal to eat resulted in severe malnutrition, despite efforts to provide adequate nutritional support. Further research is needed to explore effective strategies for managing malnutrition in psychiatric patients, addressing both their mental health needs and nutritional requirements.
