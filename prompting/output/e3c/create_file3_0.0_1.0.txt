Clinical Case: A 45-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder was admitted to the hospital following a suicide attempt by overdose 4 days prior to admission. She sustained extensive burns involving approximately 42% of her total body surface area (TBSA). The burn injuries included her face and neck (6%), both upper extremities (9%), right thigh and lower leg (5%), left thigh and lower leg (4%), as well as the majority of her anterior and posterior trunk (18%). The patient required an extended hospital stay of 70 days during which she underwent six debridement surgeries.

The patient, Ms. A, had a long-standing history of bipolar disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and mania. She had been under psychiatric care for several years, receiving regular therapy sessions and taking mood stabilizing medications. Despite these interventions, she experienced a severe depressive episode leading to suicidal ideation.

On admission, Ms. A presented with signs of respiratory distress due to inhalation injury from the fire incident. She was immediately intubated for airway protection and transferred to the intensive care unit for further management. After stabilization, she was transferred to the burn unit for specialized care.

Upon examination in the burn unit, it was noted that Ms. A had sustained deep partial-thickness burns on her face and neck region along with full-thickness burns on both upper extremities extending up to mid-forearm level bilaterally. Additionally, there were deep partial-thickness burns involving her right thigh extending down towards the knee joint while her left thigh exhibited similar injuries extending down towards the ankle joint.

Further assessment revealed extensive full-thickness burns covering most of Ms. A's anterior chest wall including breasts as well as posterior trunk regions such as back and buttocks.

Over the course of her hospitalization period, Ms.A underwent multiple debridement surgeries under general anesthesia in order to remove necrotic tissue and promote wound healing. These procedures were performed at regular intervals to ensure optimal wound care management.

In addition to burn-related interventions, Ms. A received comprehensive psychiatric care throughout her hospital stay. She was closely monitored for any signs of worsening depression or suicidal ideation, and appropriate adjustments were made to her medication regimen as needed. Regular therapy sessions were conducted to address the underlying mental health issues contributing to her suicide attempt.

During her prolonged hospitalization, Ms.A's physical and psychological recovery progressed gradually but steadily. With the combined efforts of the burn care team and psychiatric specialists, she demonstrated significant improvement in both wound healing and mental well-being.

After 70 days of intensive treatment, Ms.A was deemed medically stable for discharge from the hospital. She was referred for continued outpatient psychiatric follow-up along with ongoing burn care management at a specialized rehabilitation center.

This case highlights the complex interplay between mental illness and physical trauma in patients presenting with self-inflicted injuries. It underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving both medical and psychiatric professionals in providing comprehensive care for such individuals.
