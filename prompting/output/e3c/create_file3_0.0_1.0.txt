Clinical Case: A 45-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder was admitted to the burn unit following a suicide attempt by self-immolation. The incident occurred three days prior to admission, and she sustained extensive burns over approximately 40% of her total body surface area (TBSA). The burn distribution involved her face and neck (6%), both upper extremities (10%), right thigh (5%), left thigh and leg (4%), as well as the majority of her anterior and posterior trunk (15%). Throughout her hospitalization, which lasted for 70 days, she underwent six debridement surgeries.

The patient, Ms. A, had a long-standing history of bipolar disorder characterized by recurrent depressive episodes interspersed with manic episodes. She had been under psychiatric care for several years but experienced a recent exacerbation in symptoms leading up to the suicide attempt. On admission, she presented with signs of severe depression including profound sadness, hopelessness, anhedonia, poor sleep patterns, decreased appetite resulting in significant weight loss over the past month.

Upon arrival at the emergency department after the self-immolation incident, Ms. A was immediately assessed by both psychiatric and burn care teams. Her vital signs were stable but showed evidence of mild hypotension likely due to fluid shifts from extensive burns. Physical examination revealed full-thickness burns involving her face and neck region with associated edema compromising airway patency necessitating endotracheal intubation for airway protection.

After stabilization in the emergency department setting, Ms. A was transferred to the burn unit where she received comprehensive multidisciplinary care from plastic surgeons specializing in burn reconstruction along with psychiatrists managing her mental health needs throughout hospitalization.

In addition to standard wound care protocols involving daily dressing changes using sterile techniques and topical antimicrobial agents such as silver sulfadiazine cream or mafenide acetate solution on open wounds; Ms.A required multiple surgical interventions to achieve wound closure. The initial debridement surgery was performed within 24 hours of admission, followed by subsequent surgeries at regular intervals to remove necrotic tissue and promote healing.

Throughout her hospital stay, Ms. A received extensive psychological support from the psychiatric team. She was started on a combination of pharmacotherapy including mood stabilizers and antidepressants to manage her bipolar disorder and depressive symptoms. Additionally, she participated in individual therapy sessions as well as group therapy with other burn survivors to address the psychological impact of her injuries.

The multidisciplinary team closely monitored Ms. A's progress throughout her hospitalization, assessing wound healing, managing pain with a combination of opioids and non-opioid analgesics while minimizing potential addiction risks associated with long-term opioid use.

As Ms.A's physical condition improved over time, she underwent intensive physical therapy aimed at restoring range of motion in affected joints and preventing contractures. Occupational therapists also played a crucial role in helping her regain independence in activities of daily living such as dressing, grooming, and self-care.

After 70 days of hospitalization marked by significant progress both physically and mentally; Ms.A was discharged home under close outpatient follow-up care from both burn care specialists for ongoing wound management as well as psychiatric professionals for continued management of her bipolar disorder.

In conclusion, this case highlights the complex interplay between mental health disorders such as bipolar disorder and burn injuries resulting from self-harm attempts. It underscores the importance of comprehensive multidisciplinary care involving burn specialists alongside mental health professionals to optimize patient outcomes in terms of physical recovery and psychological well-being.
