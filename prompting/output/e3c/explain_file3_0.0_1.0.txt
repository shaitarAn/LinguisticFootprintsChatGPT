This clinical case describes a patient with schizophrenia (ICD 10 F20.3) who was treated with Haloperidol and Diazepam for their symptoms. The patient exhibited rebellious and self-destructive behavior, which occasionally required restraint. The patient's nutrition management was initiated late, one week after hospitalization.

Upon initial assessment, the patient had a low body weight of 40 kg and a height of 150 cm, resulting in a BMI of 17.57 kg/m2, indicating underweight status. There were no gastrointestinal symptoms or signs observed. Although specific information about the patient's dietary intake in the past two weeks and weight changes over the last six months could not be obtained, the patient's mother reported that he had been refusing food and only consuming cigarettes and coffee.

The albumin level was measured at 3.6 g/L with imbalanced electrolyte levels, but there were no signs of fluid accumulation noted. According to the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool used to evaluate malnutrition status, the patient fell into group C (severely malnourished). To address this malnutrition, energy and protein supplementation were initiated starting from 30 kcal/kg/day gradually increasing to 50 kcal/kg/day along with protein intake of 2 g/kg/day divided between oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) in a ratio of 50:50.

Micronutrient supplementation was also provided including vitamin A (100,000 units for the first week), vitamin C (100 mg three times daily), and zinc (20 mg once daily). Despite these interventions during early hospitalization weeks, the patient continued to lose weight. By the end of the second week, his body weight dropped further to 36 kg while his serum albumin level decreased to 2.7 g/L.

On day 28th of hospitalization, his body weight further declined to 33 kg with a serum albumin level of 2.1 g/L. Although energy and protein intake were maintained, the ratio of oral intake to ONS was modified to 70:30. The patient's appetite remained unstable, and he exhibited difficulty with enteral access, experiencing pain and increased aggression. Analgesics and sedatives did not provide effective relief.

To support the patient's protein needs, partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was administered. However, despite these interventions, the patient's BMI continued to decline. By day 42nd of hospitalization, his body weight dropped further to 32 kg with a serum albumin level of 2 g/L.

On day 66th of hospitalization, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed. Considering the patient's mental state and nutritional status at this point, it was decided not to proceed with skin graft surgery due to severe weight loss (24% body weight loss) resulting in a BMI of 11.96 kg/m2 and a serum albumin level of 2.5 g/L.

Despite severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss observed in the patient, their general condition showed some improvement compared to earlier stages. As a result, the decision was made to discharge the patient from the hospital at this point in their treatment journey
