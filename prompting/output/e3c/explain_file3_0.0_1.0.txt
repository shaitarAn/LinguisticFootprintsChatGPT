Clinical Case: Schizophrenia and Severe Malnutrition

This clinical case involves a patient diagnosed with schizophrenia type ICD 10 F20.3, who was treated with Haloperidol 1.5 mg and Diazepam 5 mg daily. The patient exhibited rebellious and self-destructive behavior, leading to occasional restraint. However, the focus of this discussion will be on the patient's severe malnutrition and its management.

The nutrition assessment of the patient was conducted after a week of hospitalization, which is considered late in terms of initiating nutritional support. At that time, the patient weighed 40 kg and had a height of 150 cm, resulting in a body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m2 or underweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not observed during the assessment.

Unfortunately, information regarding the patient's dietary intake over the past two weeks and weight changes within the last six months could not be obtained directly from the patient due to his refusal to eat any food offered to him except for smoking and drinking coffee. The mother claimed that he seemed to have lost weight during this period.

The subjective global assessment (SGA) tool categorized this severely malnourished patient as belonging to group C based on albumin levels (3.6 gr/L) and imbalanced electrolyte levels without signs of fluid accumulation.

To address his nutritional needs, energy and protein were provided starting from 30 kcal/kg gradually increasing up to 50 kcal/kg per day divided into oral nutrition supplements (ONS) along with regular oral intake at a ratio of 50:50 by volume or weight respectively.

Micronutrient supplementation was also initiated including vitamin A at a dose of 100,000 units for one week followed by vitamin C at a dose of 100 mg three times daily along with zinc supplementation at a dose of 20 mg once daily.

Despite these interventions during early weeks of hospitalization, the patient continued to lose weight. By the end of the second week, his body weight dropped to 36 kilograms with a serum albumin level of 2.7 gr/L. On the 28th day, his body weight further decreased to 33 kilograms with a serum albumin level of 2.1 gr/L.

To address this ongoing weight loss and severe malnutrition, modifications were made in terms of oral intake and ONS ratio, increasing ONS intake to 70% while reducing oral intake to 30%. However, the patient's appetite remained unstable throughout treatment.

Additionally, enteral access was challenging due to the patient's lack of cooperation and resistance resulting in pain and increased aggression. Analgesics and sedatives did not provide adequate relief for these symptoms.

Considering these difficulties in providing nutrition through enteral means, partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was administered to support protein needs.

Despite these interventions aimed at improving nutritional status, including energy and protein supplementation along with micronutrient support and PN administration enriched with BCAA, the patient's BMI continued to decline. On day 42, his body weight dropped further down to 32 kilograms with a serum albumin level of 2 gr/L.

On day 66, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed indicating some healing progress; however, due to the mental condition and severe malnutrition status of the patient along with ongoing BMI decline (11.96 kg/m2), it was decided not to proceed with skin graft surgery.

At this point in time when considering discharge from hospital care on day 66 after admission for schizophrenia treatment as well as severe malnutrition management over several weeks since admission; it is important that healthcare providers continue monitoring this patient closely post-discharge ensuring appropriate follow-up care is provided including nutritional rehabilitation programs tailored specifically for patients suffering from severe malnutrition and mental health disorders.

In conclusion, this clinical case highlights the challenges faced in managing severe malnutrition in a patient with schizophrenia. The patient's refusal to eat, unstable appetite, and resistance to enteral access posed significant obstacles in providing adequate nutrition. Despite various interventions including energy and protein supplementation, micronutrient support, and partially parenteral nutrition enriched with BCAA, the patient's BMI continued to decline. Close monitoring and follow-up care are crucial for patients with similar conditions to ensure their nutritional needs are met adequately.
