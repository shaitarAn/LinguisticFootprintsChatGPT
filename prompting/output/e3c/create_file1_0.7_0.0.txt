Clinical Case: A 27-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) presenting with chronic headaches.

History:
The patient, a 27-year-old male, presented to our clinic with a 5-year history of recurrent non-pulsating headaches. He reported that the headaches were not worsened by physical activity and were partially relieved with over-the-counter pain medications. There were no associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or visual disturbances. The patient had no significant family history of headaches.

Medical History:
The patient was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) during childhood due to the presence of café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas. He had a history of multiple surgeries to remove neurofibromas from various parts of his body. At the age of 15, he experienced his first seizure, described as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and was started on antiepileptic medication (valproic acid) to control the seizures. Since then, he has been seizure-free.

Neurological Examination:
On physical examination, the patient had multiple café-au-lait spots distributed over his trunk and extremities. There were also cutaneous neurofibromas palpable on his back and arms. Neurological examination revealed no focal deficits, but the patient had mild cognitive impairment and learning difficulties. He had difficulty with reading and writing, and his academic performance was below average. The patient also reported occasional episodes of anxiety.

Imaging and Investigations:
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed hyperintense T2-weighted lesions in the bilateral globus pallidus, consistent with neurofibromatosis-related changes. There were no intracranial tumors or significant structural abnormalities identified.

Treatment and Follow-up:
The patient was started on a prophylactic medication for headaches, amitriptyline, at a low dose of 25 mg at bedtime. He was also referred for cognitive and behavioral therapy to address his learning difficulties and anxiety symptoms. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor his response to treatment and manage any potential side effects.

Conclusion:
In summary, a 27-year-old male patient with a known history of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) presented with chronic non-pulsating headaches. The headaches were not associated with any alarming symptoms and were partially relieved with over-the-counter pain medications. Neurological examination revealed cognitive impairment and learning difficulties, consistent with his NF1 diagnosis. The patient was started on amitriptyline for headache management and referred for cognitive and behavioral therapy to address his learning difficulties and anxiety symptoms. Regular follow-up appointments were planned to optimize his treatment plan.
