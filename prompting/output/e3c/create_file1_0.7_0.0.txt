Clinical Case: A 32-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of migraine presenting with recurrent headaches admitted to our clinic. He had a 5-year history of frequent throbbing headaches. The headaches were typically relieved with triptans and worsened with physical activity. There were no accompanying symptoms of nausea or aura. The headache episodes lasted for approximately 24 hours. The pain was predominantly unilateral, localized to the right temple, and described as pulsating in nature. The patient reported no family history of headaches. He had a history of visual disturbances and sensitivity to light associated with some of his headache episodes.

The patient, Mr. J, a 32-year-old male, presented to our clinic with a chief complaint of recurrent headaches. He reported experiencing these headaches for the past 5 years, with increasing frequency over time. The headaches were characterized as throbbing in nature and were typically located on the right side of his head, specifically in the temporal region. He described the pain as moderate to severe and rated it as 7 out of 10 on a pain scale.

Mr. J mentioned that his headaches were typically relieved when he took triptans, a class of medications commonly used for migraines. However, he noticed that his headaches would worsen with physical activity, such as climbing stairs or engaging in strenuous exercise. These episodes of headache would last for approximately 24 hours, which significantly impacted his daily routine and productivity.

During the headache episodes, Mr. J reported experiencing visual disturbances, such as seeing flashing lights and increased sensitivity to light. These symptoms often preceded the onset of his headaches and would persist throughout the duration of the episode. He denied experiencing any nausea or vomiting accompanying his headaches.

Upon obtaining his medical history, Mr. J indicated that he had no family history of headaches. He denied any previous head trauma or surgeries. However, he did mention a history of occasional dizziness and lightheadedness during his headache episodes. He had not sought medical attention for his headaches until now, as the frequency and severity had become increasingly bothersome.

Physical examination findings were unremarkable, with normal vital signs and no focal neurological deficits. Given the clinical presentation and history provided, a diagnosis of migraine without aura was suspected. Further investigations, including laboratory tests and neuroimaging, were ordered to exclude any secondary causes of headache.

Treatment options were discussed with the patient, including lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding trigger factors (such as certain foods or alcohol), and stress management techniques. Pharmacological management was also discussed, with triptans being the first-line medication for acute relief of migraines. Additionally, prophylactic medications, such as beta-blockers or antiepileptic drugs, were considered for long-term management to reduce the frequency and severity of his headaches.

Mr. J expressed relief and hope upon receiving a diagnosis and a comprehensive treatment plan. He understood the importance of adhering to the prescribed medications and incorporating lifestyle modifications to better manage his migraines. A follow-up appointment was scheduled to monitor his progress and make any necessary adjustments to his treatment plan.

In conclusion, Mr. J, a 32-year-old male, presented with a 5-year history of recurrent throbbing headaches localized to the right temporal region. The headaches were relieved with triptans but worsened with physical activity. He experienced visual disturbances and sensitivity to light during his headache episodes. A diagnosis of migraine without aura was made, and a comprehensive treatment plan was developed to address his symptoms and improve his quality of life.
