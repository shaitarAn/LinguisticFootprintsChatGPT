This clinical case describes a patient who presented with various symptoms and signs that led to a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during pregnancy. The patient had no known chronic illnesses, such as diabetes or hypertension, and denied any alcohol consumption or smoking. She was also not aware of her hepatitis status.

Upon examination, the patient exhibited wasting, mild pallor, and a tinge of jaundice. However, she was well hydrated, afebrile, and had no palpable lymph nodes. Palmer erythema, a reddening of the palms, was observed, but there were no signs of clubbing or parotid enlargement. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.

The abdomen examination revealed gross distension with a distorted contour in the upper half and visibly distended anterior abdominal wall veins draining away from the umbilicus. The liver was enlarged, hard, nodular, and had an irregular edge. It was also mildly tender and had a bruit on auscultation. The spleen was not palpable, but there was mild ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity) and bipedal edema (swelling in the lower legs). The patient was also pregnant, with a symphysio fundal height of 26 cm, a longitudinal lie, and a breech presentation. The fetal heart rate was regular at 134 bpm.

Laboratory assessment revealed a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 10,200 cells/dL. The differential count showed increased neutrophils (59.3%), lymphocytes (26.1%), and monocytes (10.1%), with a slightly elevated eosinophil count (2.7%). Platelet count was within the normal range at 350,000/Î¼L. Liver function tests indicated normal bilirubin levels, but elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (four times the upper limit). Total protein and albumin levels were low at 44 g/L and 29 g/L, respectively, and the international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.3. The patient tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and negative for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level was 126,869 IU/mL. The patient was also positive for VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) test, indicating a possible syphilis infection, but TPHA (Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay) was not performed. The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was significantly elevated at >50,000 KU/L. The patient tested negative for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions. The liver size was measured at 17.2 cm, and there was mild ascites. Pelvic ultrasound confirmed the presence of a 27-week, 3-day-old fetus with active fetal movements.

Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results, the patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation during pregnancy. Management of the patient involved providing analgesia for pain relief and administering furosemide and spironolactone to manage ascites and edema. Additionally, lamivudine was added to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B infection.

The initial plan was to allow the pregnancy to continue until at least 32 completed weeks to improve the chance of neonatal survival. However, due to progressive unbearable abdominal pain, the pregnancy was terminated at 30 weeks and 3 days through successful induction of labor. Unfortunately, the outcome was a fresh stillbirth weighing 1.2 kg. Post-delivery, the patient experienced a marked reduction in pain and was discharged home after five days. She was scheduled for a follow-up visit at the gastrointestinal clinic.

The patient attended the clinic at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-discharge but was subsequently lost to follow-up. It is important for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, especially during pregnancy, to receive appropriate medical care and follow-up to monitor their condition and manage any potential complications.
