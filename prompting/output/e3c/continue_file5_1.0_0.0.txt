On admission, the patient was febrile, with a body temperature of 38.5°C, and appeared fatigued. Physical examination revealed diffuse erythematous macules and papules over the body and eyelids, which blanched upon pressure. The rash was non-pruritic and predominantly located on the trunk, sparing the face and palms. The patient had enlarged posterior cervical lymph nodes and tenderness, consistent with lymphadenopathy.

Laboratory investigations revealed leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.1 × 10^9/L (reference range: 4.0-11.0 × 10^9/L) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 125 × 10^9/L (reference range: 150-400 × 10^9/L). Liver function tests, renal function, and coagulation parameters were within normal limits.

Due to the patient's clinical presentation and recent travel history, a detailed travel history was obtained. The patient had recently visited a rural area in Mozambique, where he had direct contact with farm animals and vegetation. No other family members or close contacts had similar symptoms.

Given the combination of symptoms, including fever, rash, headache, neck pain, sore throat, and gastrointestinal symptoms, a provisional diagnosis of dengue fever was considered. However, further investigations and serological testing were required to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other viral infections.

The patient was isolated and placed on supportive care, including fluid resuscitation and regular monitoring of vital signs. In the meantime, appropriate samples were collected for serological testing, including dengue virus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies.

The patient's condition remained stable over the next few days, with a gradual improvement in symptoms and resolution of the rash. On the fifth day of admission, the serological test results returned positive for dengue virus-specific IgM antibodies, confirming the diagnosis of dengue fever.

The patient's management was adjusted accordingly, with continued supportive care and close monitoring for any complications associated with dengue fever, such as hemorrhagic manifestations. The patient was also educated about preventive measures to limit the transmission of the virus, including mosquito bite prevention and elimination of potential breeding sites.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering travel history in patients presenting with febrile illnesses and rash. Prompt identification and diagnosis of dengue fever allowed for appropriate management, ensuring timely recovery and minimizing the risk of complications.
