This clinical case describes a patient who presented with fever, rash, and other symptoms. The patient had no prior medical admissions, surgeries, or significant medication or drug use. They were a grade ten scholar and had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal. The patient appeared ill and had a low blood pressure, high heart rate, and high temperature. They had a rash on their torso, back, limbs, and hands, as well as conjunctivitis. Their abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal, and their cardiovascular examination revealed a normal heart with a rapid heartbeat. The patient did not have signs of meningitis or arthritis.

Initial diagnostic tests were performed, including blood tests and imaging. The patient had elevated levels of inflammation markers, such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, white cell count, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimers. However, blood and urine cultures were negative, and a lumbar puncture and chest X-ray were normal. The patient also tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

The differential diagnosis included viral and bacterial infections, as well as non-infectious conditions like Kawasaki-like disease and adult onset Still's disease. The patient's elevated temperature, inflammation markers, and liver function tests suggested a diagnosis of MIS-C (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children), which can occur after a viral infection.

The patient was given supportive care, including intravenous fluids and medications to stabilize their condition. Antibiotics were started empirically to cover potential bacterial infections. Steroids were initially given but discontinued due to concerns about infection. However, the patient's symptoms worsened, and a repeat echocardiogram revealed significant heart abnormalities. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroids were then given to treat the inflammation and improve heart function.

Serological testing confirmed the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, indicating a previous infection. The patient's condition gradually improved, with resolution of fever, rash, and inflammatory markers. They were discharged on medications to manage their condition and followed up in the outpatient clinic. The patient fully recovered with no residual symptoms.

Informed consent was obtained from the patient to share their medical information and images without identifying features.
