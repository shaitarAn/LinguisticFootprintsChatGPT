This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a fever, rash, and other symptoms suggestive of a systemic inflammatory condition. The patient had no prior medical admissions, no history of surgery, and no significant medication or recreational drug use. He was a grade ten scholar and had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal two weeks prior.

Upon examination, the patient appeared ill and had a low blood pressure, high heart rate, and elevated temperature. He had a generalized maculopapular rash on various parts of his body, including the palms of his hands, along with erythematous desquamating lesions over the eyelids and conjunctivitis. Other physical examinations, such as abdominal and respiratory exams, were normal.

Initial diagnostic assessments included blood investigations, which showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, white cell count, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimers. However, blood and urine cultures were negative, and the lumbar puncture, chest radiograph, and abdominal sonar were all normal. The first echocardiogram revealed a structurally normal heart with normal systolic function. Nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 testing were negative.

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the differential diagnoses considered included viral infections (such as HIV seroconversion, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus), bacterial infections (caused by Group A streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, other gram-negative bacteria, rickettsia, leptospirosis, or malaria), as well as non-infectious conditions like Kawasaki-like disease, adult-onset Still's disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Therapeutic interventions for the patient included intravenous fluid boluses, antibiotics (ceftriaxone and doxycycline), and hydrocortisone. However, the patient did not show significant improvement, and his condition worsened with signs of low cardiac output. A repeat echocardiogram revealed severe cardiac dysfunction. The patient was then treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), dobutamine infusion, diuresis, and methylprednisolone pulse. Serological testing confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

The patient's condition gradually improved with the addition of aspirin, enoxaparin, and prednisone. He was discharged after 12 days with a tapering dose of prednisone, aspirin, and colchicine. Follow-up visits showed complete recovery, with no residual symptoms and improved cardiac function.

In this case, the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and response to treatment suggest a diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). MIS-C is a rare but serious condition that can occur in children and adolescents following a COVID-19 infection or exposure.

It is important to note that this case report highlights the need for careful evaluation and consideration of various differential diagnoses in patients presenting with systemic inflammatory symptoms. Prompt recognition and appropriate management are crucial in achieving positive outcomes in such cases.
