On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and had a distended abdomen. There was tenderness on palpation in the epigastric region, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. Bowel sounds were normal, and there were no palpable masses or organomegaly.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, further investigations were ordered. Laboratory tests revealed a mild normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL (normal range: 12-15 g/dL). Liver function tests were within normal limits, and there were no abnormalities in the coagulation profile. Serum amylase and lipase levels were also normal.

An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed a large, hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreas. The mass appeared to be compressing the adjacent structures, including the stomach and duodenum. There were no signs of biliary obstruction or gallstones.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of pancreatic tumor was suspected. The patient was referred to a specialist for further evaluation and management. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was recommended to provide more detailed information about the tumor and its extent.

In the meantime, the patient was started on symptomatic treatment for her abdominal pain, including analgesics and antacids. She was advised to follow a small, frequent meal pattern to alleviate her symptoms of early satiety. The importance of regular antenatal care and close monitoring of fetal well-being was emphasized.

The patient was scheduled for a CT scan, which confirmed the presence of a large mass in the head of the pancreas. The radiologist suspected it to be a pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but a biopsy was required for definitive diagnosis. The patient was referred to an oncologist for further management.

Given the advanced stage of the tumor and the patient's pregnancy, a multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians, oncologists, and neonatologists was involved in the decision-making process. After careful consideration of the risks and benefits, it was decided to delay any surgical intervention until after the patient had delivered her baby.

The patient was closely monitored throughout the remainder of her pregnancy, with regular ultrasound scans to assess fetal growth and well-being. She received supportive care, including nutritional supplementation and pain management. The patient delivered a healthy baby at 38 weeks gestation via cesarean section.

Following delivery, the patient underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) to remove the tumor. The histopathology report confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The patient was referred for adjuvant chemotherapy and regular follow-up to monitor for any recurrence or metastasis.

This case highlights the challenges of managing a pregnant patient with a pancreatic tumor. The rarity of such cases and the need to balance the risks to both the mother and the fetus make decision-making complex. A multidisciplinary approach involving specialists from various fields is crucial to ensure the best possible outcome for both the mother and the baby.
