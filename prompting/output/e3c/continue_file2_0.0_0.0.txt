On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and had a distended abdomen. There was tenderness on palpation in the epigastric region, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. Bowel sounds were normal, and there were no palpable masses or organomegaly. The rest of the examination, including cardiovascular and respiratory systems, was unremarkable.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, further investigations were warranted to determine the cause of her abdominal pain and weight loss. Laboratory tests were ordered, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and serum amylase and lipase levels. The complete blood count revealed mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL. Liver function tests were within normal limits, and serum amylase and lipase levels were also normal.

An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed a large, hypoechoic mass in the epigastric region, measuring approximately 8 cm in diameter. The mass appeared to arise from the pancreas and was causing compression of adjacent structures. There was no evidence of liver metastasis or lymphadenopathy. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of pancreatic tumor was suspected.

The patient was referred to a tertiary care center for further evaluation and management. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed, which confirmed the presence of a large pancreatic mass. The mass was found to involve the body and tail of the pancreas, with no evidence of vascular invasion or distant metastasis. The CT scan also revealed dilatation of the pancreatic duct, suggesting obstruction of the pancreatic outflow.

A percutaneous biopsy of the pancreatic mass was performed, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The patient was then referred to an oncologist for further management. Given her advanced stage of disease and the fact that she was pregnant, a multidisciplinary team consisting of an obstetrician, oncologist, and neonatologist was involved in her care.

After discussing the risks and benefits, the patient and her family decided to proceed with chemotherapy to control the tumor growth and delay disease progression. The chemotherapy regimen chosen was deemed safe for use during pregnancy and was initiated under close monitoring. The patient also received nutritional support and pain management to improve her quality of life.

Throughout her treatment, the patient's pregnancy was closely monitored. Regular ultrasound scans were performed to assess fetal growth and well-being. The patient received counseling and emotional support to help her cope with the challenges of her diagnosis and treatment.

Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the medical team, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate. The tumor progressed rapidly, causing further compression of adjacent structures and leading to worsening abdominal pain and discomfort. At 32 weeks gestation, the patient developed preterm labor and delivered a premature baby boy via emergency cesarean section.

Following delivery, the patient's pain management was intensified, and palliative care measures were implemented to provide comfort and support. The patient's family was involved in decision-making regarding her care, and efforts were made to ensure her comfort and dignity.

Tragically, the patient succumbed to her illness two months after delivery. Her case highlighted the challenges of managing advanced pancreatic cancer in pregnancy and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to provide the best possible care for both the mother and the baby. It also underscored the need for increased awareness and research in the field of cancer management during pregnancy to improve outcomes for these patients.
