Clinical Case: A 28-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of migraine presenting with severe headaches admitted to our clinic. He had a 5-year history of frequent episodes of throbbing headaches. The patient reported that the headaches were often triggered by exposure to bright lights and loud noises. He experienced relief when lying down in a dark, quiet room. The headaches were known to last for up to 72 hours and were occasionally accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain was localized to one side of the head and was described as pulsating in nature.

The patient had a positive family history for migraines, with both his mother and sister experiencing similar symptoms. He mentioned that his mother's migraine attacks were also triggered by certain foods and stressed that he had noticed similar triggers in his own case. In addition to the headaches, the patient reported occasional visual disturbances preceding the migraines. These visual disturbances consisted of seeing bright, zigzag lines or blind spots in his visual field.

Apart from the migraines, the patient had a history of depression, which he described as an ongoing condition for the past four years. He reported feeling persistently sad, lacking energy, and experiencing changes in his appetite and sleep patterns. He had tried various antidepressant medications without significant improvement.

The patient denied any history of seizures or epilepsy-like symptoms. He described his headaches as debilitating, interfering with his ability to work and perform daily activities. He was currently employed as a computer programmer and revealed that prolonged screen time exacerbated his symptoms. He reported mild relief when using over-the-counter pain medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

On physical examination, the patient appeared generally well-nourished and in no acute distress. His vital signs were within normal limits. Neurological examination findings, including cranial nerve assessment, were unremarkable. No significant abnormalities were noted during the fundoscopic examination.

Given the patient's history and clinical presentation, a diagnosis of migraine with aura was suspected. The presence of aura preceding his migraines, along with the characteristic duration, unilateral pulsating pain, triggers, and positive family history, supported this diagnosis. The patient was advised to maintain a headache diary to help identify potential triggers and patterns in his attacks.

Additionally, the patient's ongoing depression warranted further evaluation. He was referred to the psychology department for a comprehensive psychological assessment and counseling sessions. Incorporating non-pharmacological interventions, such as stress management techniques and lifestyle modifications, were also discussed as part of his overall management plan.

The patient was educated about the different treatment options available for migraines, including both acute and preventive medications. Prophylactic therapy was initiated with a beta-blocker, as recommended by the International Classification of Headache Disorders. The patient was scheduled for regular follow-up visits to monitor the response to treatment and make any necessary adjustments.

In conclusion, this clinical case highlights a 28-year-old male patient with a well-established history and clinical features consistent with migraine headaches. Understanding the patient's symptoms, triggers, and associated conditions played a crucial role in establishing an accurate diagnosis and developing an appropriate management plan tailored to his specific needs.
