Upon further examination, the patient reported experiencing visual disturbances during her seizures, including flickering lights and blurred vision. She also mentioned occasional episodes of tingling and numbness on the right side of her face and arm, which lasted for a few minutes before resolving on their own. These symptoms were not associated with any particular triggers or activities.

Physical examination revealed the presence of a port-wine stain birthmark on the right side of the patient's face, extending to her neck and scalp. The birthmark had a distinctive reddish-purple color and irregular borders. She also had a slightly larger right eye compared to the left, known as anisocoria.

Given the patient's clinical history and examination findings, a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) was confirmed. Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare neurocutaneous disorder characterized by the presence of a facial birthmark, typically involving the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. It is often associated with underlying vascular abnormalities, including leptomeningeal vascular malformations and glaucoma.

To further assess the patient's condition, additional investigations were performed. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain was ordered to evaluate the extent of the leptomeningeal angioma and determine if there were any additional abnormalities. The MRI revealed the presence of a prominent leptomeningeal angioma involving the right parietal and occipital lobes.

In light of the patient's persistent headaches, a neurologist was consulted. They recommended initiating prophylactic treatment with anti-epileptic medications to manage the patient's seizures and potentially reduce the frequency and severity of her headaches. Additionally, the patient was referred to an ophthalmologist for regular monitoring of her intraocular pressure to rule out the development of glaucoma.

The patient was provided with education and support regarding her condition, including the potential long-term complications associated with SWS. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor her progress and adjust treatment as necessary.

In conclusion, this 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome presented with a history of frequent non-pulsating headaches, seizures, and characteristic physical findings. With appropriate management and multidisciplinary care, it is hoped that the patient's symptoms can be effectively controlled, improving her overall quality of life.
