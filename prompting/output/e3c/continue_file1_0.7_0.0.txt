Upon further examination, the patient reported experiencing visual disturbances such as blurred vision and double vision during her headaches. She also mentioned occasional dizziness and difficulty concentrating. The patient denied any recent head trauma or any other significant medical history. 

On physical examination, the patient appeared well-nourished and in no acute distress. Her vital signs were within normal limits. Neurological examination showed no focal deficits, and her cranial nerves were intact. There were no abnormalities in her fundoscopic examination.

Given her history of seizures and the presence of visual disturbances during her headaches, the possibility of migraines with visual aura was considered. However, the duration of her headaches and the absence of typical migraine symptoms such as nausea and worsening with physical activity raised some concerns.

Further investigations were warranted to rule out other causes of her headaches. A brain MRI was ordered to evaluate the possibility of any structural abnormalities or vascular malformations associated with SWS. Additionally, an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recommended to assess her seizure activity and determine if it correlated with her headaches.

In the meantime, to manage her headache symptoms, the patient was advised to continue using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as needed. She was also encouraged to maintain a regular sleep schedule, practice stress-reducing techniques, and avoid triggers such as bright lights and loud noises.

The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of her investigations and to formulate an appropriate management plan. The multidisciplinary team, including neurology and neurosurgery specialists, would collaborate to ensure comprehensive care for the patient, taking into consideration her diagnosis of SWS and its potential impact on her overall health.
