A 28-year-old male patient presented to our clinic with a chief complaint of recurrent headaches. The patient had been experiencing these headaches for the past 5 years. He described the pain as a dull, constant pressure on both sides of his head. The headaches typically lasted for several hours and were not aggravated by physical activity. Over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provided some relief.

The patient had a past medical history significant for epilepsy, which was diagnosed at the age of 12. He experienced tonic-clonic seizures characterized by involuntary contractions, and after thorough evaluation, he was diagnosed with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). At the age of 18, he underwent a callosotomy procedure to control his seizures successfully.

Two years ago, during laser treatment to address his facial port wine birthmark associated with SWS, he experienced his first seizure since the callosotomy procedure. As a result of this new seizure event, he was prescribed carbamazepine at a daily dose of 400 mg and has remained seizure-free since then.

In addition to his headache symptoms and epilepsy diagnosis associated with SWS, the patient reported difficulty with cognitive function throughout childhood and adolescence. Although he met developmental milestones during infancy without any issues, academic progress became challenging for him in elementary school and continued into adulthood. His family history was unremarkable except for an older sister who also had a facial port wine birthmark but did not undergo diagnostic investigations.

The patient's current medication regimen included ketiapin (25 mg daily) for anxiety disorder management and venlafaxine (75 mg daily) for both anxiety disorder and chronic headaches along with NSAID use as needed.

On physical examination, notable findings included multiple nevi on the right side of his forehead extending onto the eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek due to choroid angioma associated with SWS. An intraoral examination revealed gingival overgrowth on the right side, with bright red coloration and blanching upon pressure, suggestive of angiomatous enlargement. Mild asymmetry was observed in his extremities, with the left arm and leg appearing slightly smaller compared to the right side. The patient exhibited hemiparesis bilaterally in both upper and lower extremities of equal severity. An ophthalmological evaluation confirmed glaucoma in his right eye.

Psychiatric evaluation revealed signs consistent with anxiety disorder, while neurological examination did not yield any significant findings apart from the documented hemiparesis.

Imaging studies including cranial CT scans demonstrated diffuse atrophy involving the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the occipital region. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI depicted multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures within the right hemisphere along with diffuse atrophy correlating to this region. Further analysis revealed increased calvarial thickness on the right side compared to the left, as well as asymmetric smaller size of the entire right hemisphere compared to its counterpart on the left. T2-weighted MRI sequences highlighted extensive venous formations around corpus callosum, periventricular regions anterior to third ventricle at Willis polygon localization, and within quadrigeminal cisterns adjacent to areas within temporal-occipital regions.

As part of cognitive assessment, a proteus intelligence test was administered yielding a score of 75 points consistent with mild mental retardation.

Overall, this case highlights a patient presenting with recurrent headaches secondary to SWS along with associated manifestations such as epilepsy, glaucoma, facial nevi due to choroid angioma involvement, gingival overgrowth presenting as angiomatous enlargement involving one side of oral cavity, limb asymmetry accompanied by bilateral hemiparesis indicating developmental anomalies associated with SWS (such as hypertrophy or hypotrophy), anxiety disorder, and cognitive impairment categorized as mild mental retardation. Diagnostic imaging confirmed the presence of diffuse atrophy, cortical calcifications, dilated pial venous vascular structures within the right hemisphere, and asymmetry in calvarial thickness and cerebral size.
