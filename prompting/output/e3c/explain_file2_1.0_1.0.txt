This clinical case outlines the presentation and management of a pregnant patient who was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a type of liver cancer.

The patient in question did not have a known history of diabetes, hypertension, or other chronic illnesses. She denied any alcohol consumption or smoking habits. There were no notable symptoms related to the heart, lungs, kidneys, or genital/urinary system. However, upon examination, she exhibited wasting (unintentional weight loss), mild pallor (pale appearance), slight jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes) but was well hydrated and had no fever. No palpable lymph nodes were found. The patient had palmar erythema (reddening of the palms) but no clubbing (changes in fingers and nails) or enlargement of the parotid glands.

The abdominal examination revealed gross distention with an altered upper contour and visibly dilated veins on the abdominal wall away from the belly button. The liver was enlarged, hard to touch, nodular with an irregular edge; it also showed mild tenderness and could be heard producing a bruit (an abnormal sound). The spleen was not palpable but there was evidence of mild ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity) as well as bipedal edema up to mid-shin level.

Regarding pregnancy-related findings: The symphysio fundal height measurement indicated a 26 cm fundal height with longitudinal lie presentation and breech position for fetal delivery. Fetal heart rate appeared normal at 134 beats per minute.

Laboratory assessments revealed low hemoglobin levels along with slightly elevated white blood cell counts including neutrophils, lymphocytes monocytes; eosinophil count stayed within reference ranges. Platelets count fell within normal limits too. Total protein and albumin levels were low while INR value showed mild prolongation suggesting impaired blood clotting. The patient was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), indicating active infection, but negative for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Hepatitis B viral load was quantified at 126869 IU/ml. She tested negative for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). An elevated alpha-fetoprotein level (>50000 KU/L) suggests HCC.

Abdominal ultrasound showed an abnormal liver with multiple hypoechoic (dark) lesions. Additionally, the liver size measured 17.2 cm and mild ascites were noted. A pelvic scan confirmed a viable fetus at 27 weeks and three days gestation with active fetal movements.

The revised diagnosis, based on these findings, was hepatocellular carcinoma occurring on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation during pregnancy. Management of the patient included analgesia for pain relief as well as diuretic medications like furosemide and spironolactone to manage the ascites symptoms. Lamivudine was added to minimize transmission of hepatitis B infection from mother to child.

Initially, the plan was to allow the pregnancy to continue until at least 32 completed weeks in order to enhance neonatal survival chances; however, due to worsening abdominal pain, the pregnancy had to be terminated at 30 weeks and three days through successful induction of labor. Unfortunately, there resulted in stillbirth—indicating that the baby did not survive—together with a weight recorded as 1.2 kg.

Post-delivery pain significantly reduced, leading to her discharge after five days of hospital stay while being scheduled for follow-up visits at the gastrointestinal clinic thereafter.

Although she attended scheduled visits two and four weeks post-discharge, unfortunately she became lost-to-follow-up following that time period
