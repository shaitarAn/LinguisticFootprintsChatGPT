In this clinical case, we have a patient who presents with various symptoms and signs that ultimately lead to a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in pregnancy. Let's go through the details of the case and discuss the implications.

The patient has no known chronic illnesses such as diabetes or hypertension, but her hepatitis status is unknown. She denies any alcohol consumption or smoking habits. There are no cardiorespiratory or urogenital symptoms reported by the patient.

On examination, several clinical signs are observed. The patient exhibits wasting, mild pallor, and a tinge of jaundice but overall appears well-hydrated and afebrile. No palpable lymph nodes are found. Palmer erythema is present, but there is no evidence of clubbing or parotid enlargement.

Respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological examinations yield unremarkable findings. However, upon examining the abdomen, gross distension with distorted contour in the upper half is noted along with visibly distended anterior abdominal wall veins draining away from the umbilicus. The liver is enlarged significantly (12cm below costal margin) with nodularity and irregular edges; it also exhibits mild tenderness on palpation and a bruit on auscultation.

Although spleen enlargement isn't detected during palpation examiaton,the presence of mild ascites suggests underlying liver pathology.A bipedal edema up to mid-shin level signifies fluid retention due to increased pressure within blood vessels caused by hepatic dysfunction.Liver span measurements are outside normal range (17cm), indicating its excessive size.Meanwhile,symphysio fundal height measurement estimates gestational age based on uterine height(26c).Fetal wellbeing is assessed through fetal heart rate assessment(134bpm)and regular rhythm.Rectal vaginal examination yield no notable findings.

Given these clinical findings combined with laboratory assessments,the initial diagnosis made was hepatocellular carcinoma in pregnancy. Her hemoglobin level is within normal range (10.3g/dl), but complete blood count reveals an elevated total white blood cell count (10200 cells/dl). Differential white blood cell count shows increased neutrophils (59.3%) and lymphocytes(26.1%), suggesting some degree of inflammation or active infection.Monocytes are also elevated (10.1%)-another consistent finding with chronic liver disease.Eosinophils, responsible for allergic reactions and parasite infections,are slightly raised as well(2.7%).Platelet counts indicate no abnormality with a value of 350000/ul.

Liver function tests reveal normal bilirubin levels but elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase(GGT) and aspartate aminotransferase(AST) values.These elevated liver enzymes indicate hepatocellular injury.Albumin synthesis by the liver is impaired as seen by low protein(albumin)levels.Depending on the region, INR readings above 1 can signify deficiency in clotting factors made by the liver.Hepatitis B surface antigen(HBsAg)is positive ,indicating acute or chronic hepatitis B virus(HBV) infection.This diagnosis is further supported by negative HIV and HCV test results; however, it's advisable to investigate HBV co-infections such as hepatitis D virus.The patient's HBV DNA level is 126869 IU/ml indicating high viral load.Alpha-fetoprotein(AFP),a marker often associated with HCC,is significantly increased (>50000KU/L).

To further assess her condition,pelvic scans revealed a fetus measuring approximately 27 weeks and three days old.Given this advanced gestational age,it was decided to allow the pregnancy to continue until at least 32 completed weeks,to improve chances of neonatal survival.Nonetheless,due to severe progressive abdominal pain,the patient underwent successful induction of labor at 30 weeks and three days,resulting in a stillbirth weighing 1.2kg.

After the delivery, the patient experienced marked reduction in pain.She was given analgesia for pain relief, furosemide to manage fluid retention/spironolactone for aldosterone antagonist effect(limits sodium and water reabsorption),and lamivudine to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B infection. The patient was discharged home after five days but unfortunately lost to follow-up after two and four weeks of post-discharge visits.

Considering her diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation during pregnancy,the patient's management included palliative measures to address symptoms,rather than curative interventions,such as surgical resection or chemotherapy.Pain control and fluid management were prioritized instead.Though it is unfortunate that the patient was lost to follow-up,continuing appointments at gastrointestinal clinics would have focused on monitoring disease progression,staging via imaging techniques,and possible referral for liver transplantation.A multidisciplinary approach involving obstetrics,gastroenterology,and anesthesiology teams would be crucial when managing HCC in pregnancy due to its complex nature and potential risks associated with both pregnancy and cancer treatment interventions.
