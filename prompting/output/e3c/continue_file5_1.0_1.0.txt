On admission, the patient was found to be febrile with a temperature of 39.5Â°C and had significant lymphadenopathy in the cervical region. His blood pressure was within normal limits, and his heart rate was slightly elevated. The physical examination also revealed mild conjunctival injection and an enlarged spleen.

Initial laboratory investigations showed a mild leukopenia with lymphopenia, as well as thrombocytopenia. There were no abnormalities in liver function tests or renal function tests. A chest X-ray performed upon admission appeared normal.

Given the patient's history of travel to rural areas several weeks prior, there were concerns for various tropical infections such as malaria or dengue fever. Tests for malaria antigen and dengue serology were ordered but yielded negative results.

Further evaluation included obtaining a lumbar puncture to assess for meningitis due to the presence of neck pain associated with headache. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed increased protein levels, but no pleocytosis was detected.

In light of the persistent fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and abnormal CSF findings, infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) became a leading differential diagnosis.

The patient's symptoms gradually improved over the course of hospitalization without any specific treatment initiated for EBV infection. Symptomatic relief was provided for headache and sore throat management along with hydration support due to diarrhea episodes experienced during admission.

As part of routine viral screening following discharge from the hospital ward after a week-long stay; molecular testing confirmed acute EBV infection by positive detection of viral DNA in peripheral blood leukocytes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

The patient was advised on appropriate follow-up measures including rest at home until complete recovery due to fatigue commonly experienced post-EBV infection that can last several weeks.
Overall clinical improvement coupled with laboratory confirmation solidified the diagnosis of acute EBV infection. The patient was discharged in stable condition with instructions for gradual return to normal activities as symptoms improved. Scheduled follow-up clinic visits were planned to monitor recovery progress and address any potential complications that may arise.
