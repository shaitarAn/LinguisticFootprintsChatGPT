Upon further examination, the patient reported experiencing occasional visual disturbances during her headaches, including blurred vision and sensitivity to light. She also mentioned feeling fatigued and having difficulty concentrating during these episodes. The frequency of her headaches had progressively increased over the past few months, occurring at least three times per week.

During the physical examination, no abnormalities were detected in her neurological or cranial nerves. However, a detailed skin examination revealed port-wine stain birthmarks on the right side of her face and scalp, which are commonly associated with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS). Given this finding and her history of seizures in infancy, it was evident that this headache presentation could be attributed to SWS.

To confirm the diagnosis and assess any potential underlying causes for her worsening symptoms, further tests were ordered. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed to evaluate brain wave patterns for any abnormal activity indicative of epilepsy or other seizure disorders associated with SWS.

Furthermore, imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were recommended to examine brain structures more closely. This would help identify any abnormalities or potential complications related to SWS that could be contributing to her symptoms.

In addition to these investigations, a comprehensive medical history review was conducted to assess any potential triggers for her headaches. It was discovered that she had been experiencing high levels of stress due to recent academic pressures and personal life challenges.

Considering all these factors together – including the patient's clinical presentation consistent with migraine without aura features along with a confirmed diagnosis of SWS – a multidisciplinary approach involving neurology and dermatology specialists was initiated for optimal management.

The treatment plan aimed at controlling both the headache symptoms as well as managing other aspects related to SWS progression. Non-pharmacological interventions such as stress reduction techniques including relaxation exercises and cognitive-behavioral therapy were recommended alongside medication therapy targeting migraine headaches specifically.

Triptans were prescribed as an acute treatment option, which the patient found effective in providing relief during her headache episodes. Additionally, a prophylactic medication regimen consisting of beta-blockers and antiepileptic drugs with migraine prophylactic properties was initiated to reduce the frequency and severity of her headaches.

Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor the response to treatment and adjust medications accordingly. Education regarding potential triggers, lifestyle modifications, and self-management techniques were also provided to empower the patient in taking an active role in her healthcare.

Overall, by adopting a comprehensive approach that addressed both the specific headache symptoms and underlying SWS condition, we aimed to improve the patient's quality of life and mitigate any potential complications associated with this rare neurological disorder.
