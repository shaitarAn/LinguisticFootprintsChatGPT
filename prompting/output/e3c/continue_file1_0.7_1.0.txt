Upon further examination, the patient's neurological examination was within normal limits. Her vital signs were stable, and there were no focal neurological deficits noted. However, a thorough evaluation of her medical history revealed that she had multiple cutaneous vascular malformations on her face, indicating a possible association with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS).

Given her symptoms and history of seizures in infancy, the presence of headaches could be related to SWS-related complications such as cerebral vascular abnormalities or increased intracranial pressure. To confirm this suspicion and assess the severity of her condition, further investigations were ordered.

An MRI scan of the brain was performed to evaluate any structural abnormalities or vascular lesions associated with SWS. The results showed bilateral leptomeningeal enhancement predominantly involving the occipital lobes along with mild cortical atrophy on both sides.

Based on these findings and in conjunction with her clinical presentation, a diagnosis of migraine without aura secondary to Sturge-Weber syndrome was made. Migraine is known to be comorbid with SWS due to abnormal blood vessel formation in both conditions.

To manage her headaches effectively, a multimodal approach was adopted. Firstly, lifestyle modifications including good sleep hygiene and stress management techniques were recommended. Non-pharmacological measures like regular exercise and maintaining a balanced diet were also emphasized.

As for pharmacological treatment options, triptans were avoided due to their vasoconstrictive properties that might exacerbate underlying cerebral vasculopathy associated with SWS. Instead, prophylactic medications such as beta-blockers or antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) like topiramate or valproic acid were considered as potential options after discussing their benefits and risks.

Furthermore, close monitoring for any signs of worsening neurological symptoms such as recurrent seizures or progressive cognitive decline would be crucial in this patient's long-term management plan.

In conclusion, this 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome presented with chronic non-pulsating headaches, and a comprehensive evaluation confirmed the presence of migraine without aura as a secondary manifestation of her underlying condition. With appropriate lifestyle modifications and targeted pharmacotherapy, the goal was to alleviate her symptoms and improve her overall quality of life while closely monitoring for any disease progression or complications related to SWS.
