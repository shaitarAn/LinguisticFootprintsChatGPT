Case 2: Mrs. AB, a 25-year-old female of African descent, presented to the obstetrics department at term for delivery. She was a para 1, having no previous live births. Her pregnancy had been uneventful and was closely monitored by her healthcare provider throughout.

Mrs. AB delivered a male infant weighing 3.2kg via spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications. The baby cried vigorously at birth and appeared healthy initially; however, concerns arose when an absence of skin and skull bone was noticed shortly after delivery.

The mother reported that she had not used any medications during her pregnancy, including both orthodox and herbal remedies. She had received routine antenatal care and all ultrasound scans conducted during the second trimester were reported as normal.

This child was born into a non-consanguineous family setting with no known familial history of congenital abnormalities or genetic disorders.

Upon examination, the newborn exhibited extensive areas of skin loss over the scalp region, exposing underlying skull bones in several areas. Additionally, there were irregular bony defects noted on palpation along with exposed brain tissue in some regions associated with these defects.

Laboratory investigations were ordered to further evaluate this unusual presentation in the newborn. Routine blood tests revealed normal complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), electrolytes levels as well as renal function panel results within normal limits for his age.

A consultation with a pediatric surgeon was promptly arranged to assess the extent of cranial involvement and provide appropriate management options for this rare condition observed in our patient.

Further imaging studies including X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed to visualize the extent of cranial abnormalities and assess potential involvement of intracranial structures such as brain tissue or meninges.

Genetic counseling was also initiated for both parents to provide them with information about potential underlying genetic causes contributing to this rare presentation in their child's case.
 
Given the unique presentation of this newborn, a multidisciplinary team involving pediatric surgeons, plastic surgeons, and neurologists was formed to discuss and plan for the best possible management approach.

The parents were reassured and provided with emotional support during this challenging time. The healthcare team ensured that they were well-informed about the condition and involved in decision-making regarding their child's care.

In conclusion, Mrs. AB delivered a baby boy who presented with extensive skin loss over the scalp region along with cranial bone defects exposing underlying brain tissue. Further investigations including laboratory tests and imaging studies were conducted to assess the extent of involvement. A multidisciplinary team was assembled to provide comprehensive management for this rare condition. Genetic counseling was also initiated to explore potential underlying genetic causes contributing to this unique presentation in our patient's case.
