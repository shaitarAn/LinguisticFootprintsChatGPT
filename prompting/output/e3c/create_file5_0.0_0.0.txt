Patient Information:

On the 15th October 2021, a previously healthy, 32-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the medical ward at St. Mary's Hospital, London. The patient was transferred from a local clinic due to worsening symptoms. She presented with a two-week history of fever, a generalized rash over her body and eyelids, intermittent headache with associated neck pain, sore throat, and a dry cough. Additionally, she reported a three-day history of diarrhea. There was no history of joint pain, oral or nasal ulcers, or urethral discharge.

Medical History:

The patient had no significant medical history and was not taking any medications prior to the onset of her symptoms. She had no known allergies and had not traveled outside of the country recently. The patient denied any recent exposure to sick contacts or animals.

Clinical Presentation:

Upon admission, the patient appeared fatigued and mildly dehydrated. Her vital signs were as follows: temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate of 100 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Physical examination revealed a diffuse maculopapular rash over her trunk, extremities, and face, including her eyelids. The rash was non-blanching and not pruritic. The patient had mild tenderness over her neck, but no stiffness or limitation of neck movement. Her throat examination showed mild erythema without exudates, and her lungs were clear on auscultation.

Diagnostic Workup:

Laboratory investigations were ordered to further evaluate the patient's condition. Initial blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 9,500 cells/mm³, with a normal differential count. Her hemoglobin level was within the normal range, and her platelet count was slightly elevated at 400,000 cells/mm³. Liver function tests, renal function tests, and electrolyte levels were all within normal limits. A chest X-ray was performed, which showed no abnormalities.

Differential Diagnosis:

Based on the patient's clinical presentation, several differential diagnoses were considered. Infectious causes such as viral or bacterial infections, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or Streptococcus pyogenes, were considered due to the patient's fever, sore throat, and rash. Other possibilities included autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or drug reactions. Meningitis was also considered due to the patient's headache and neck pain.

Treatment and Management:

The patient was started on supportive care, including intravenous fluids to correct her dehydration. Symptomatic treatment was provided for her headache and sore throat. Empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated to cover potential bacterial causes, pending further investigations. The patient was placed on droplet precautions to prevent the spread of any potential infectious agents.

Follow-up and Outcome:

The patient's condition gradually improved over the next few days. Her fever subsided, and the rash began to fade. Repeat blood tests showed a normalization of her white blood cell count and platelet count. Further investigations, including serological tests for viral infections and autoimmune markers, were ordered to aid in confirming the diagnosis. The patient was closely monitored for any new symptoms or complications.

Conclusion:

This case highlights the importance of considering various differential diagnoses in a patient presenting with fever, rash, headache, and other associated symptoms. Further investigations and close monitoring are crucial in determining the underlying cause and providing appropriate management.
