Case 2: Mr. JM, a 45-year-old male from the rural village of Xanadu, presented to the clinic with complaints of progressive weakness and difficulty walking for the past six months. He reported no significant medical history and denied any use of medications or herbal remedies. Mr. JM was born to a 35-year-old mother through spontaneous vaginal delivery and weighed 3.5kg at birth.

Upon further investigation, it was revealed that Mr. JM's parents were first cousins in a consanguineous marriage. His mother had an uneventful pregnancy with regular antenatal care visits, during which no abnormalities were detected on ultrasound scans.

The patient's symptoms began insidiously, initially manifesting as occasional tripping while walking but gradually progressing to frequent falls and difficulty in performing daily activities such as climbing stairs or getting up from a seated position without assistance.

On physical examination, Mr. JM appeared thin and weak but was alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Neurological examination revealed muscle wasting predominantly in the lower limbs along with bilateral foot drop and reduced deep tendon reflexes in both lower extremities.

Further investigations were conducted to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms. Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests (RFTs), electrolyte levels, thyroid function tests (TFTs), vitamin B12 levels, folate levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were all within normal limits.

Electromyography (EMG) showed evidence of chronic denervation changes in multiple muscles consistent with motor neuron disease affecting both upper motor neurons (UMNs) and lower motor neurons (LMNs). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain did not reveal any significant abnormalities.

Given his clinical presentation along with consanguinity between his parents, a diagnosis of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) was suspected. Genetic testing was recommended to confirm the diagnosis and provide further information regarding the specific subtype.

Genetic counseling was also offered to Mr. JM and his family, emphasizing the importance of early detection, management, and potential implications for future pregnancies within their consanguineous family setting.

In conclusion, Mr. JM presented with progressive weakness and difficulty walking, which raised suspicion for a neurological disorder such as hereditary spastic paraplegia. Consanguinity between his parents further supported this possibility. Genetic testing was recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management strategies for both the patient and his family members.
