On examination, the patient appeared well-nourished and in no acute distress. Her vital signs were within normal limits. On neurological examination, there were no focal deficits noted. However, a facial port-wine stain was observed on the right side of her forehead and upper eyelid.

Given the patient's history of seizures and headache, further investigations were ordered to assess her condition. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed which revealed intermittent epileptiform discharges in the left hemisphere consistent with an ongoing seizure focus.

Neuroimaging studies including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were conducted to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or features characteristic of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS). The MRI demonstrated leptomeningeal enhancement overlying the left cerebral hemisphere accompanied by underlying cortical atrophy. These findings confirmed a diagnosis of SWS with associated epilepsy.

The patient was referred to an epileptologist who recommended initiating anti-seizure medication therapy with close monitoring for efficacy and potential side effects.

To manage her headaches, lifestyle modifications including regular sleep patterns, avoiding triggers such as stress and excessive caffeine intake, and maintaining hydration were advised. Additionally, she was prescribed preventive medications such as amitriptyline or topiramate to help reduce the frequency and intensity of her headaches.

Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor her response to treatment interventions and adjust management strategies accordingly. Given that SWS can affect different aspects of an individual's health ranging from seizures to cognitive impairment or glaucoma among other complications, a multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists specializing in epilepsy care, ophthalmologists managing potential ocular concerns related to SWS such as increased intraocular pressure or visual field deficits should be considered for comprehensive care planning.

Patient education regarding their condition along with support from healthcare professionals would be crucial in helping them navigate their journey living with Sturge-Weber Syndrome while minimizing associated symptoms and optimizing their overall quality of life.
