Upon admission to our clinic, the patient underwent a thorough physical examination. Neurological examination revealed subtle asymmetry in the facial features on the right side, including slight ptosis and mild hypertrophy of the right hemiface. Additionally, there was evident cutaneous angioma involving the right side of her face, consistent with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS).

Given her history of headaches and seizures, further investigations were warranted to understand the underlying cause and provide appropriate management. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was conducted to assess her brain activity during both awake and sleep states. The results indicated interictal epileptiform discharges originating from the left cerebral hemisphere.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained to evaluate cerebral abnormalities associated with SWS. The MRI scans revealed leptomeningeal enhancement involving predominantly the left cerebral hemisphere along with cortical atrophy on that side.

Based on these findings, a definitive diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome was confirmed. SWS is a rare congenital neurocutaneous disorder characterized by facial cutaneous angioma (port-wine stain), glaucoma, leptomeningeal angiomas leading to calcifications (tram-track appearance), and underlying ipsilateral brain involvement.

In this case, our focus primarily remained on managing her debilitating headaches while considering potential treatment options for neurological symptoms secondary to SWS. As her headache characteristics suggested tension-type headaches without any concerning red flags like worsening symptoms or accompanying aura and nausea, we initiated symptomatic treatment using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as previously found effective for pain relief.

To optimize seizure control in this patient with epilepsy related to SWS, antiepileptic medication was started after consulting a neurologist specializing in epilepsy management. Close monitoring and regular electrolyte assessments were planned throughout medication administration due to potential drug interactions or side effects.

Furthermore, given her lifelong condition requiring multidisciplinary care involving dermatology, neurology, and ophthalmology specialties, we initiated referrals to relevant specialists for comprehensive management of her symptoms.

Counseling and education were provided to the patient and her family regarding SWS, including the potential long-term complications that may arise from this condition. The importance of regular follow-ups with multiple specialists was emphasized to ensure early intervention if new signs or symptoms appeared.

In conclusion, our plan for this 21-year-old female patient with SWS included both symptomatic treatment for her headaches as well as long-term management addressing other associated manifestations. Our aim is to enhance her quality of life by alleviating pain and optimizing control over her seizures while actively monitoring for any further developments or complications that may arise from Sturge-Weber Syndrome.
