Title: A 42-year-old Man with Mental Health Challenges Who Sustained Extensive Burn Injuries

Introduction:
We present the case of Mr. John, a 42-year-old man with a history of mental illness who was admitted to our hospital following a suicide attempt by self-immolation. This comprehensive case report will detail the patient's clinical presentation, management, and treatment outcomes during his hospitalization.

Case Presentation:
Mr. John was transferred from a local psychiatric facility where he had attempted suicide by setting himself on fire three days before admission to our burn unit. Upon arrival, his condition was assessed as critical due to the extensive nature of his injuries. Initial examination revealed full-and partial-thickness burns affecting approximately 38% of his Total Body Surface Area (TBSA). Notably, these burns involved his face and neck (5%), both upper extremities (8%), right thigh (4%), left thigh and leg (3%), as well as most of his anterior and posterior trunk (16%).

Medical History:
Beyond Mr. John's mental health challenges which included depression and anxiety disorder, he had no significant past medical history or known allergies.

Hospital Course:
Upon admission to the burn unit, Mr. John underwent immediate stabilization measures including airway management using an endotracheal tube due to respiratory distress caused by inhalational injury secondary to smoke inhalation during the suicide attempt.

Over the course of his hospitalization spanning 66 days, Mr. John underwent five surgical debridement procedures aimed at removing necrotic tissue from his extensive burn wounds in order to facilitate healing and reduce infection risk.

Treatment Approach:
In addition to surgical interventions, Mr. John received comprehensive wound care consisting of daily dressing changes utilizing advanced wound dressings like silver sulfadiazine cream for antimicrobial coverage along with non-adherent dressings for gentle wound bed protection.

Pain management played a crucial role in optimizing patient comfort throughout his treatment. A multimodal approach, including opioid analgesics and adjunctive therapies such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and regional nerve blocks, were employed to provide adequate pain relief while minimizing the risk of opioid-related adverse effects.

Psychosocial Support:
Recognizing the importance of addressing Mr. John's mental health needs alongside his physical recovery, a multidisciplinary team comprised of psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers collaborated to provide comprehensive psychosocial support throughout his hospital stay. Regular psychiatric evaluations were conducted to assess for any changes in mood or suicidal ideation.

Outcome:
Despite the challenges posed by Mr. John's extensive burn injuries and underlying mental health condition, he demonstrated significant progress during his hospitalization period. The surgical debridement procedures effectively removed necrotic tissue from his burn wounds, allowing for granulation tissue formation along with subsequent epithelialization.

Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights the complex management of a patient with mental health challenges who sustained extensive burn injuries following a suicide attempt by self-immolation. Through a multidisciplinary approach encompassing surgical interventions, wound care strategies, pain management protocols, and psychosocial support services aimed at optimizing both physical and psychological outcomes for patients like Mr. John can be achieved.
