During his hospitalization, the 35-year-old man received intensive care and treatment to address his burn injuries and mental health condition. The multidisciplinary medical team provided him with comprehensive wound care, pain management, and psychological support.

The patient's burns were classified as both full-and partial-thickness injuries, indicating a severe and complex case. To promote healing, he underwent five debridement surgeries, a procedure in which dead or damaged tissue is removed to prevent infection and aid in wound closure. With each surgery, the medical team carefully removed the affected tissue, allowing healthy tissue to grow and replace it.

Throughout his 66-day hospital stay, the patient's wounds were regularly cleaned and dressed to prevent infection and promote the healing process. A specialized ointment or topical medication may have been applied to aid in wound healing and reduce scarring. Skin grafts, a procedure in which healthy skin is taken from one area of the body and transplanted onto the burned areas, may have been used to accelerate the healing process.

In addition to physical care, the patient received comprehensive mental health support. A team of psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists worked closely with him to address his underlying mental health condition that led to the suicide attempt. They utilized various therapeutic interventions such as individual and group therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and medication management to stabilize his mental health and provide him with coping mechanisms.

As the patient progressed in his healing journey, he may have undergone physical therapy to regain strength, mobility, and independence. This could include exercises, stretching, and occupational therapy to restore his ability to perform daily activities.

The 66-day hospitalization allowed for significant progress in the patient's physical and mental health. Throughout this period, the medical team closely monitored his progress, adjusted treatment plans as needed, and provided ongoing support and education to both the patient and his family.

Upon discharge, the patient's care would have transitioned to an outpatient setting, where he would continue to receive follow-up appointments, wound care, medication management, and ongoing mental health support. The medical team would have also ensured that appropriate social support systems and resources were in place to promote the patient's continued recovery and prevent relapse.

The case of this mentally ill man highlights the critical need for a multidisciplinary approach when treating patients with complex physical and mental health conditions. The collaboration between medical professionals from various disciplines ensures comprehensive and holistic care, addressing both the physical and psychological aspects of the patient's well-being.
