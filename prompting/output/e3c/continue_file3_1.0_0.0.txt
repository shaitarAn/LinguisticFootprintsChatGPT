During his hospitalization, the patient received extensive medical care to address his burn injuries. Immediately upon arrival, he was admitted to the burn unit and started on intravenous fluids to restore hydration and prevent complications. Pain management was also initiated with a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics.

Given the severity of his burns, the patient required multiple debridement surgeries to remove necrotic tissue and promote wound healing. The first surgery occurred within the first 24 hours of his admission, followed by subsequent surgeries at regular intervals to ensure proper wound care. Each debridement procedure involved the meticulous removal of burned tissue, with the goal of reducing the risk of infection and improving the cosmetic outcome.

In addition to surgical interventions, the patient received daily wound care, which consisted of the application of specialized dressings to promote healing and prevent infection. Various topical creams, such as silver sulfadiazine or mafenide acetate, were used to manage the burn wounds and prevent bacterial colonization.

To prevent contractures and maintain joint mobility, the patient underwent physical therapy and range-of-motion exercises. Occupational therapists also provided assistance in adapting to daily activities and maximizing his functional independence during the healing process.

Psychiatric care played a crucial role in the patient's treatment plan. As a mentally ill individual who had previously attempted suicide, he required close monitoring and support from a multidisciplinary team, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers. Regular counseling sessions were conducted to address his emotional well-being, provide coping strategies, and develop a comprehensive aftercare plan to ensure his successful reintegration into society.

Throughout his 66-day hospitalization, the patient's condition gradually improved. With proper wound care and medical intervention, the burned areas began to heal, and new tissue formed. Physical therapy helped prevent the development of contractures, while psychiatric support enabled the patient to address the underlying mental health issues that contributed to his suicide attempt.

As his discharge approached, a comprehensive plan was put in place to ensure continued care and support after leaving the hospital. This included regular follow-up appointments with both the burn unit and psychiatric team, as well as outpatient therapy and support groups to aid in his ongoing recovery.

The case of this mentally ill man with severe burn injuries highlights the importance of a holistic approach to patient care. By addressing both the physical and psychological aspects of his condition, the healthcare team was able to provide comprehensive treatment and support, helping him on his journey to recovery.
