The Impact of Climate Change on Biodiversity: Building a Global Information Infrastructure

Abstract: Climate change poses a significant threat to biodiversity worldwide, making it essential to conduct extensive research to understand the implications and take appropriate measures. Consequently, numerous research projects have been initiated globally to address this issue. However, the abundant and diverse information available often makes it challenging to obtain a comprehensive overview of the various research activities and their findings. In response to this challenge, the "Global Biodiversity Research Initiative" (GBRI) has established a task force aimed at ensuring easier access to climate change and biodiversity-related research data. The task force incorporates the principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to facilitate faster communication of research outcomes. Key objectives of the task force include creating a study portal with metadata, research instruments, study documents, results, and publications, as well as a search engine for preprint publications. Additionally, the initiative aims to develop a framework for linking research and monitoring data, providing services for improved handling of image data, and implementing standardized analysis routines for harmonized quality assessments. The ongoing development of this infrastructure will enhance the discoverability and management of global research on the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Furthermore, the advancements made within the GBRI task force can be applied to other research areas, as the challenges addressed are generic to the discoverability and handling of research data.

1. Introduction

Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time, with far-reaching consequences for the Earth's ecosystems and biodiversity. The increasing emission of greenhouse gases and the resultant rise in temperature have led to a wide range of ecological disruptions, including altered weather patterns, melting of polar ice caps, and changes in precipitation levels. Such changes have a profound impact on the distribution and abundance of species, with potential cascading effects on entire ecosystems.

Understanding the implications of climate change on biodiversity is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate its adverse effects and safeguard our planet's natural resources. Consequently, researchers from various disciplines, including ecology, environmental science, and conservation biology, have embarked on numerous studies to investigate the response of species and ecosystems to changing climatic conditions.

However, the vast amount of research conducted on climate change and biodiversity presents a considerable challenge in obtaining a comprehensive overview of current knowledge and research gaps. The diverse data sources and disparate research methods make it difficult to synthesize the available information and identify patterns across different regions and ecosystems.

To address this challenge, the Global Biodiversity Research Initiative (GBRI) has launched a task force dedicated to improving the accessibility and management of research data related to climate change and biodiversity. This initiative aims to develop a comprehensive information infrastructure that adheres to the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. By adopting these principles, the GBRI seeks to facilitate the discovery, accessibility, and usability of biodiversity research data for scientists, policymakers, and the general public.

The task force's efforts encompass the creation of a centralized study portal that consolidates metadata, research instruments, study documents, results, and publications from various research projects. This portal will serve as a valuable resource, enabling researchers to access and analyze data from multiple sources efficiently. Furthermore, the task force will develop a search engine specifically tailored to preprint publications, allowing for rapid dissemination of research findings in real-time.

Beyond data organization and accessibility, the GBRI task force recognizes the importance of integrating research data with routine monitoring data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of climate change on biodiversity. By establishing a framework for data integration, researchers will be able to link their findings with ongoing monitoring efforts and establish long-term datasets that can drive evidence-based conservation strategies.

To enhance the usability and analysis of biodiversity data, the task force will provide services for improved handling of image data, as visual records are vital in documenting species distributions and ecosystem changes. Additionally, standardized analysis routines will be developed to ensure consistent and comparable assessments of biodiversity across different spatial and temporal scales.

The establishment of the GBRI task force and its ongoing efforts to build a global information infrastructure for climate change and biodiversity research represent a significant step towards addressing the knowledge gaps and facilitating evidence-based decision-making on a global scale. The advancements made within this initiative will not only benefit researchers working on climate change and biodiversity but also serve as a model for improving the discoverability and management of research data in other areas of study.

In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the ongoing efforts within the GBRI task force and discuss the potential implications of this global information infrastructure for advancing our understanding of the impact of climate change on biodiversity.
