COVID-19-Related Mental Health Research: Establishing an Integrated Information Infrastructure

Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic has not only had a significant impact on physical health but has also created challenges for mental well-being. As a result, numerous research projects focusing on understanding the psychological effects of the pandemic have been initiated worldwide. However, due to the overwhelming amount of information available, it has become increasingly difficult to obtain an overview of the diverse research activities and their findings. In light of this challenge, an integrated information infrastructure is needed to facilitate access to COVID-19-related mental health research data.

In this paper, we propose the establishment of a nationwide information infrastructure dedicated to compiling and disseminating COVID-19-related mental health research data. Drawing inspiration from the "National Research Data Infrastructure for Personal Health Data" initiative (NFDI4Health), our objective is to leverage existing frameworks for creating a task force specifically focused on aggregating and organizing mental health research data related to COVID-19.

Aligning with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), our task force aims to enhance communication and collaboration among researchers by offering streamlined access to metadata, study documents, survey instruments, study results, and publications through a centralized online platform. Furthermore,

we propose developing a search engine specifically tailored for preprint publications in order to expedite knowledge sharing within scientific communities.

Beyond establishing seamless integration between research datasets and routine clinical data sources as outlined in NFDI4Healthâ€™s framework,

our infrastructure will also provide services for improved handling of audiovisual data pertaining especially towards analyzing non-verbal cues associated with mental well-being during times of crisis such as facial expressions or body language analysis via standardized analytical routines while ensuring harmonized quality assessments.

By implementing these initiatives within our proposed integrated information infrastructure dedicated solely to COVID-19-related mental health studies conducted in Germany,

we aim at enhancing discoverability and facilitating utilization by researchers and practitioners, thus accelerating the advancement of knowledge in this crucial field.

Introduction:

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has not only posed significant challenges to global healthcare systems but also severely impacted individuals' mental health. The unprecedented levels of stress, anxiety, and social isolation caused by prolonged lockdowns and uncertainty have raised concerns regarding the psychological impact on affected populations. As a response, numerous research projects worldwide have been initiated to comprehend the multifaceted dimensions of mental well-being during such crises. However, as with other areas of COVID-19 research mentioned in previous studies (Smith et al., 2021), there is a pressing need for an integrated information infrastructure that can facilitate easy access to COVID-19-related mental health research data.

In this paper, we propose the establishment of a dedicated nationwide information infrastructure designed specifically for aggregating and disseminating COVID-19-related mental health research data conducted within Germany. Our objective is to build upon existing frameworks such as the "National Research Data Infrastructure for Personal Health Data" initiative (NFDI4Health)...
