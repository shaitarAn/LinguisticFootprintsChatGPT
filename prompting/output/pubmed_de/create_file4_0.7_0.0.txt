Public Mental Health in international perspective: From Shifting the Curve to the inclusion of vulnerable populations

Abstract:
In recent years, efforts in the field of Public Mental Health have intensified to strengthen mental health and health literacy at the population level, as well as make progress in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders. This article provides an overview of current conceptualizations of indicators and determinants of Public Mental Health, as well as population-based intervention strategies from an international perspective. Current conceptual and methodological challenges of so-called high-risk strategies, population strategies, and the vulnerable population approach are critically discussed. Future efforts in policy, research, and practice should focus more on fundamental causes of social and health inequalities, considering all societal action fields, in order to contribute to the improvement of population-based health.

1. Introduction

Mental health is a critical component of overall well-being and has a significant impact on individuals, families, communities, and societies as a whole. Mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, are prevalent worldwide and impose a considerable burden on individuals and healthcare systems. Addressing mental health needs requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond individual-focused interventions and considers the broader social, economic, and environmental factors that influence mental well-being.

Efforts in the field of Public Mental Health have gained momentum in recent years, focusing on promoting mental health and preventing mental disorders at the population level. This approach recognizes the importance of addressing mental health from a public health perspective, emphasizing prevention, promotion, and early intervention rather than solely focusing on treatment.

The concept of Public Mental Health encompasses various dimensions, including mental health literacy, social determinants of mental health, and population-based interventions to improve mental well-being. It aims to shift the focus from a narrow biomedical model to a more holistic and inclusive approach that considers the social, cultural, and economic factors that shape mental health outcomes.

While progress has been made in understanding and addressing mental health needs, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed. High-risk strategies, which target individuals at increased risk for mental disorders, have shown limited effectiveness in reducing the overall burden of mental illness. Population-based strategies, on the other hand, aim to improve mental health outcomes for entire populations by addressing broader social determinants of mental health. However, the implementation and evaluation of these strategies pose significant conceptual and methodological challenges.

Furthermore, the inclusion of vulnerable populations, such as individuals with low socioeconomic status, refugees, and marginalized communities, is crucial to ensure equity in mental health outcomes. These populations often face multiple social and economic disadvantages that contribute to their increased risk of mental disorders. Therefore, it is essential to develop interventions that are tailored to their specific needs and address the underlying social determinants of mental health inequalities.

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current conceptualizations of Public Mental Health and the challenges and opportunities associated with population-based interventions. It will critically discuss the limitations of high-risk strategies and explore the potential of population-based approaches in addressing mental health needs. Additionally, it will highlight the importance of including vulnerable populations in mental health promotion efforts and propose strategies to enhance their inclusion.

In conclusion, addressing mental health needs at the population level requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that considers the social determinants of mental health and promotes equity in mental health outcomes. By shifting the focus from individual-focused interventions to population-based strategies, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners can contribute to the improvement of mental well-being for all.
