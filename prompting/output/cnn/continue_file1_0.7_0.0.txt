Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Kosovo, had been under surveillance by the FBI for several months following concerns raised by members of the local Muslim community. They had noticed his increasingly radicalized behavior and extremist views, prompting them to alert law enforcement.

The FBI then launched an investigation, which included undercover agents who befriended Osmakac and gained his trust. Over the course of their interactions, Osmakac revealed his plans to carry out a violent attack in Tampa. He expressed his desire to target crowded areas, including nightclubs and a local sheriff's office, with the intention of causing maximum casualties.

The plan involved using firearms, explosives, and a car bomb to inflict widespread destruction and instill fear in the community. Osmakac believed that his actions would be a form of retaliation against what he perceived as injustices committed against Muslims worldwide.

However, unbeknownst to Osmakac, the weapons and explosives he had acquired were all inert and provided to him by undercover agents. The FBI ensured that Osmakac never had access to real weapons or explosives, ensuring the safety of the public.

During the hearing, O'Neill emphasized the severity of Osmakac's intentions and commended the vigilance of both the Muslim community and law enforcement. He stressed the importance of community engagement and cooperation in preventing acts of terrorism and maintaining public safety.

"This case is a testament to the power of community involvement and the effectiveness of law enforcement collaboration," O'Neill stated. "The Muslim community here in Tampa acted as true partners, alerting us to a potential threat and allowing us to intervene before any harm could be done."

Osmakac, now facing charges for his attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, awaits trial. If convicted, he could face a lengthy prison sentence.

The incident serves as a reminder that terrorism knows no boundaries and can emerge from any background or community. It also highlights the importance of being vigilant and fostering strong relationships between law enforcement and community members to prevent such acts of violence.
