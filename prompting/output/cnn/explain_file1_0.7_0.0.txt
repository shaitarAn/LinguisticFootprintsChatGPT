This news article is about a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac from Florida who was planning a terrorist attack in Tampa. He intended to use explosives and weapons to cause chaos and harm to Americans. However, thanks to the help of the local Muslim community and law enforcement, his plot was foiled. Osmakac was arrested and charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.

Osmakac, a naturalized American born in Kosovo, planned to carry out a car bombing followed by taking hostages and detonating a suicide belt. He expressed his desire for revenge against what he perceived as wrongs done to Muslims in a video message recorded before his arrest.

The local Muslim community played a vital role in alerting authorities to Osmakac's ideology and plans. The FBI worked alongside them throughout the investigation. It is important to note that this case is not about the Muslim religion or community but about an individual who committed a crime.

Authorities have stated that Osmakac does not appear to have any ties to al Qaeda and was likely "self-radicalized." The investigation began when a confidential source informed the FBI about Osmakac's request for al Qaeda flags. He then began discussing potential targets and sought help in acquiring weapons and explosives.

Law enforcement ensured that the explosives and firearms Osmakac sought were rendered inoperable and posed no threat to the public. His planned targets were nightclubs in the Ybor City area, the local sheriff's office operations center, and a business in the South Tampa area. However, his primary target on the day of his arrest was an Irish bar in south Tampa.

Osmakac's arrest occurred just after he made a video explaining his motives. The U.S. attorney involved in the case acknowledged that without the tips from the local Muslim community and the work of law enforcement, there could have been significant bloodshed.

Overall, this article highlights the importance of community and law enforcement cooperation in preventing potential acts of terrorism.
