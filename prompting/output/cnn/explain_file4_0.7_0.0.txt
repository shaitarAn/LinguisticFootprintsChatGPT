The news article is about a tragic incident that occurred in Jerusalem. Rabbi Kalman Levine, along with three other rabbis, was killed during an attack at a synagogue in the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Har Nof. Levine, who grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, had been a dental student at the University of Southern California before going on a college trip to Israel. He fell in love with the country and decided to stay, devoting his life to studying Jewish text.

The attackers, two Palestinian cousins from East Jerusalem, entered the synagogue armed with a gun and butcher knives and killed Levine and the other rabbis. The attack also left several others wounded, including an Israel police officer of the Druze religious community, who later died from his injuries.

The incident has sparked tension between Palestinians and Jews and has put Jerusalem on edge. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Hamas and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for inciting violence. However, Abbas condemned the attack and emphasized the importance of resolving the underlying issues that contribute to such violence.

The article also highlights the lives and backgrounds of the other rabbis who were killed. Moshe Twersky, originally from Boston, came from a family of renowned rabbis and scholars. Aryeh Kupinsky, who grew up in Michigan, was described as a sweet and kind person by his friends. Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, a British-Israeli national, used to work as a chemical engineer.

The article concludes with the grieving friends and family of the victims, who remember them as dedicated individuals who cared deeply for their faith and their loved ones.
