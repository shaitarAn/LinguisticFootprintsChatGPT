This news article is about a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac who plotted to carry out acts of terrorism in Tampa, Florida. Osmakac intended to use explosives and weapons to cause chaos and harm Americans, according to the authorities. The local Muslim community and law enforcement played a crucial role in foiling the plot. It was thanks to their assistance that law enforcement became aware of Osmakac's extremist ideology and criminal intentions.

Osmakac, who was born in Kosovo but had become a naturalized American citizen, planned to carry out multiple attacks. He wanted to start by detonating a car bomb and taking hostages, all while wearing an explosive suicide belt. His motivations seem rooted in wanting revenge for perceived wrongs done against Muslims.

The government's investigation into Osmakac began when a "confidential human source" reported that he had asked for al Qaeda flags. From there, he discussed potential targets with the source and requested help in obtaining guns and explosives.

Law enforcement introduced an undercover FBI employee into the plot, who pretended to assist Osmakac but actually worked towards thwarting his plans. The undercover employee took a down payment from Osmakac for weapons that were later rendered inoperable by authorities.

During one meeting with the FBI employee on New Year's Day, Osmakach described his intended targets as nightclubs in Tampa's Ybor City area, as well as the operations center of Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office and South Tampa business.

Before his arrest on Saturday night, he recorded a video explaining his motives for these attacks – presumably intending it as propaganda material or documentation of his actions – after expressing gratitude towards fellow Muslim activists in other terror-related areas such Bosnia-Herzegovina .

It is important to note that there is no indication so far that this individual had any connections or direct ties with al Qaeda or any international terrorist organizations. He seems to have been self-radicalized.

The U.S. attorney commended the local Muslim community and law enforcement for their assistance in bringing down this plot, emphasizing that the investigation was not about the Muslim religion or community but about an individual committing a crime. Thanks to the cooperation of all parties involved, considerable harm was prevented, and there was ultimately no threat to public safety.

Osmakac now faces charges of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.
