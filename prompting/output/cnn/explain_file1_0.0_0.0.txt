This news article is about a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac from Florida who planned to carry out a terrorist attack in Tampa. He intended to use explosives and weapons to cause chaos and harm to Americans. However, his plot was foiled thanks to the local Muslim community and law enforcement.

Osmakac had an AK-47, explosives, and a car bomb that he believed were real and planned to use against Americans. He also planned to wear a suicide belt and take hostages. He expressed his desire for revenge for what he believed were wrongs done to Muslims.

The local Muslim community played a crucial role in alerting law enforcement about Osmakac's ideology and intentions. The FBI then began investigating him in September after receiving information from a confidential source. Osmakac was introduced to an undercover FBI employee who helped him acquire weapons and explosives.

However, the explosives and firearms that Osmakac sought were rendered inoperable by law enforcement, so there was no actual threat to the public. He had planned to target nightclubs, the sheriff's office, and a business in Tampa.

Osmakac was arrested on Saturday night, just after he made a video explaining his motives. The U.S. attorney stated that there might have been significant bloodshed if it weren't for the tips from the local Muslim community and the work of law enforcement.

It is important to note that there is no indication that Osmakac had any ties to al Qaeda or that he was acting under their control or direction. He appears to have been self-radicalized.
