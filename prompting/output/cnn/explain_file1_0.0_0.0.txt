The news article discusses the arrest of a 25-year-old naturalized American born in Kosovo who was planning a terrorist attack in Tampa, Florida. The suspect, identified as Osmakac, had planned a car bombing followed by hostage-taking and the detonation of a suicide belt he intended to wear.

According to a criminal complaint made public on Monday, Osmakac expressed his desire to die in the "Islamic way" and sought revenge for perceived wrongs done to Muslims. He recorded a martyrdom video message shortly before his arrest, expressing his motives for the planned attack.

The article highlights the involvement of the local Muslim community in assisting law enforcement in identifying Osmakac's extremist ideology and intentions. Steve Ibison, who heads the FBI's Tampa office, emphasized the significance of the Muslim community's cooperation throughout the investigation. He clarified that the case was not about the Muslim religion or community but about an individual who had committed a crime.

Law enforcement officials, who requested anonymity, stated that Osmakac did not appear to have any ties to al Qaeda and was likely "self-radicalized." They also mentioned that there was no indication of anyone else being involved in the plot or pushing Osmakac to carry out the attack.

The federal investigation into Osmakac began in September when a confidential human source informed the FBI that he had requested al Qaeda flags. By November, Osmakac was discussing potential targets in Tampa and seeking assistance from the source in obtaining guns and explosives for the attack.

The government's source introduced Osmakac to an undercover FBI employee, leading to a meeting on December 21. During this meeting, Osmakac expressed his desire to acquire various weapons, including an AK-47-style machine gun, Uzi submachine guns, high capacity magazines, grenades, and an explosive belt. He provided a $500 down payment for the weapons.

Osmakac outlined his plans during a meeting on New Year's Day with the undercover FBI employee. His intended targets included nightclubs in the Ybor City area of Tampa, the operations center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office in Ybor City, and a business in the South Tampa area. However, by Saturday night, his primary target had become an Irish bar in south Tampa, where he believed there would be large crowds.

After the car bombing, Osmakac planned to retrieve additional weapons and explosives from a hotel room in Tampa to continue his attacks. He intended to use the explosive belt to take hostages and demand the release of prisoners from the FBI.

FBI agents arrested Osmakac on Saturday night, just after he had recorded a video explaining his motives. The U.S. attorney acknowledged that the tips from local Muslims and the work of law enforcement had prevented significant bloodshed and ensured the safety of the community.

In conclusion, the article details the arrest of a 25-year-old naturalized American who planned a terrorist attack in Tampa. The suspect's intentions were discovered through the assistance of the local Muslim community, leading to his arrest before the attack could be carried out.
