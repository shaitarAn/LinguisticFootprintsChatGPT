This news article reports on a foiled plot by a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac in Tampa, Florida. Osmakac intended to carry out an act of terrorism, planning to use explosives and weapons to cause chaos and harm. The local Muslim community and law enforcement played a crucial role in preventing this attack.

According to the article, Osmakac believed he had an operable AK-47, real explosives, and planned to use a car bomb against Americans. He expressed his intentions in conversations with an undercover FBI employee. In addition, he recorded a martyrdom video message stating that he wanted revenge for perceived wrongs done to Muslims.

The investigation into Osmakac began when a confidential source informed the FBI that he had asked for al Qaeda flags. From there, discussions about potential targets and obtaining firearms and explosives took place between Osmakac and the undercover FBI employee.

Law enforcement officials clarified that there is no evidence of any ties between Osmakac and al Qaeda or any other terrorist organization. They also mentioned that early indications suggest he was "self-radicalized," meaning his extremist beliefs developed independently.

Osmakac's plans involved targeting nightclubs in the Ybor City area of Tampa, as well as the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office operations center and a business in South Tampa. His primary target eventually became an Irish bar where large crowds were expected.

The authorities arrested Osmakac just after he made his video explaining his motives for carrying out these attacks. They emphasized that due to the tips from members of the local Muslim community and their own investigative work, there was no real danger posed once they became involved.

In conclusion, this news article highlights how law enforcement agencies worked with information provided by members of the Muslim community to prevent a potential terrorist attack in Tampa by Sami Osmakac.
