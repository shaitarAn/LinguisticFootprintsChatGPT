This news article discusses the life and political career of James Traficant Jr., a former congressman from Ohio. Traficant was known for his controversial statements, flamboyant personality, and unique appearance.

The article begins by highlighting a statement made by Traficant during an ethics hearing, where he boldly declared that there are no ethics in politics and advocated for the removal of ethics committees. These comments made him popular with reporters in Washington, who appreciated his willingness to share his opinions on various topics.

Traficant was also famous for his distinctive hairstyle, which led to speculation about whether it was real or not. The Washington Post described it as a "Planet of the Apes sort of hair helmet," while others compared it to a creature from Lake Erie before its clean-up efforts. However, it was later revealed that Traficant wore a toupee when he was booked into jail in 2002.

The article mentions that Traficant had a background as a football player at the University of Pittsburgh before becoming involved in public service as a drug counselor and sheriff in Mahoning County, Ohio. While serving as sheriff, he faced bribery charges but managed to convince the jury to acquit him by claiming he had conducted his own sting operation. He went on to be elected to Congress in 1984.

In Washington, Traficant continued his unconventional approach by wearing rumpled sports coats and loud shirts. He positioned himself as a maverick populist who criticized foreign aid and government agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He famously referred to the CIA as "lying, thieving stealing nincompoops."

However, despite his popularity among some constituents for challenging established institutions, things took a turn for Traficant when he was convicted in April 2002 on charges of bribery, racketeering, and tax evasion. Despite not being a lawyer, Traficant represented himself during the trial. As a result of his conviction, he was expelled from the House of Representatives by an overwhelming vote of 420-1. This made him only the second congressman to be expelled since the Civil War.

During his time in prison from 2002 to 2009, Traficant took up painting as a hobby. After his release, he attempted to regain his old seat as an independent candidate but lost to sitting Representative Tim Ryan.

In conclusion, this news article provides an overview of James Traficant Jr.'s political career and controversial personality. It highlights his provocative statements about politics and ethics, his distinctive hairstyle (later revealed to be a toupee), and his eventual downfall due to bribery charges. Despite these setbacks, Traficant maintained popularity among some constituents for challenging established institutions before ultimately losing in a bid for political office after serving time in prison.
