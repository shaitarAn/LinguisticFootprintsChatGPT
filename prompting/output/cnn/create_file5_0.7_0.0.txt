California Governor Gavin Newsom, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, expressed confidence on Tuesday despite recent poll numbers showing him trailing behind in key primary states. Only 5% of Democratic primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire backed him in a recent CNN survey. The governor finished near the bottom of the list of potential candidates, with many questioning his ability to resonate with voters.

"I believe these polls are measuring early name recognition," Newsom told reporters at a press conference in Sacramento. "When I first ran for mayor of San Francisco, I was also polling low, and yet I went on to win the election. So, I'm not worried about these numbers at this point."

Newsom, 54, who has been actively raising his profile by advocating for progressive policies and addressing climate change, made it clear that he would not make a final decision about running for president until after the 2022 midterm elections.

"If I do decide to run in 2024, it won't be based solely on polls or fundraising figures," he said. "It will be based on my belief that I can make a positive impact and bring about meaningful change for the American people. It will be about whether I have the necessary experience, ideas, and vision to lead our country forward."

During the press conference, Newsom unveiled a comprehensive plan to address homelessness in California. The proposal includes increasing funding for affordable housing, expanding mental health services, and implementing job training programs to help homeless individuals reintegrate into society.

Newsom also criticized the federal government's lack of action on climate change and pledged to make California a global leader in renewable energy. He emphasized the importance of transitioning to clean energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to combat the ongoing climate crisis.

In response to questions from reporters, Newsom expressed support for the Biden administration's decision to increase efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, including vaccine distribution and mask mandates. He stressed the need for continued vigilance and adherence to public health guidelines to protect communities and prevent further outbreaks.

When asked about national security issues, particularly the rising tensions with China, Newsom called for a diplomatic approach and stressed the importance of maintaining strong alliances with international partners.

"I believe in the power of diplomacy and collaboration," he said. "We must work with our allies to address global challenges and find peaceful resolutions to conflicts. It is crucial to prioritize diplomacy over military intervention whenever possible."

Newsom touched on several key issues that resonate with Democratic primary voters, including income inequality, racial justice, and voting rights. He vowed to fight for economic equity, promote criminal justice reform, and protect the right to vote for all Americans.

While facing criticism from some quarters, Newsom remained undeterred, expressing his belief in his ability to connect with voters and bring about positive change. He acknowledged the challenging road ahead but remained optimistic about his chances in the upcoming presidential race.

"I am confident that the American people are looking for bold leadership and new ideas," Newsom said. "I am committed to being a voice for the voiceless and fighting for a better future for all Americans."

With the 2024 presidential election still far away, Newsom has ample time to build his campaign, gain name recognition, and present his vision for the country. As the political landscape evolves, it remains to be seen whether the California governor can overcome his current polling numbers and emerge as a formidable contender in the Democratic primary race.
