This news article discusses the arrest of a 25-year-old naturalized American who was born in Kosovo. It is alleged that the individual planned a car bombing, followed by hostage-taking, and was also planning to wear a suicide belt for another explosion. The suspect was allegedly motivated by a desire to seek revenge for perceived wrongs against Muslims. The case was initiated following a tip-off from a "confidential human source" who informed the FBI that the suspect had requested to obtain al Qaeda flags. The suspect then began discussing potential targets for terrorist attacks in Tampa and sought assistance from the source in obtaining weapons and explosives. The source then introduced the suspect to an undercover FBI employee who agreed to help him obtain the requested weapons. The suspect allegedly provided a down payment for the weapons, but they were rendered inoperable by law enforcement. During a meeting on New Year's Day, the suspect outlined his plans to the undercover employee, with his primary target being an Irish bar in South Tampa. The suspect planned to retrieve additional weapons and explosives from a hotel room after the initial car bombing. He intended to wear the explosive belt to gain entry to an area with a large crowd and take hostages, demanding that the FBI release prisoners in exchange. The suspect was arrested shortly after he recorded a video explaining his motives. It is mentioned that the arrest was made when the attack was imminent. Law enforcement officials credit the assistance of the local Muslim community for providing valuable information throughout the investigation. However, there is no indication of any direct ties to al Qaeda, and early information suggests that the suspect was self-radicalized.
