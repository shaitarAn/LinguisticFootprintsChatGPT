The article is about a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac from Florida who planned to carry out an attack in Tampa using explosives and weapons. The authorities were able to prevent the attack thanks to the help of the local Muslim community and law enforcement.

Sami Osmakac, who was born in Kosovo but became a naturalized American citizen, intended to carry out a car bombing followed by hostage-taking and the explosion of a suicide belt. He expressed his desire to carry out the attack as a form of revenge for what he believed were wrongs done to Muslims.

The local Muslim community played a crucial role in alerting the authorities about Osmakac's plans and ideology. Law enforcement officials emphasized that this case was about an individual committing a crime, rather than being representative of the Muslim religion or community in general.

According to the article, Osmakac does not have any known ties to al Qaeda and appears to have been self-radicalized. The federal investigation into Osmakac began when a confidential human source informed the FBI that he had requested al Qaeda flags. This led to Osmakac discussing potential terror targets and seeking help from an undercover FBI employee to acquire weapons and explosives.

Law enforcement was able to render the explosives and firearms Osmakac sought inoperable, ensuring they posed no threat to the public. Osmakac outlined his plans to the undercover FBI employee, targeting nightclubs in the Ybor City area of Tampa, the operations center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, and a business in the South Tampa area.

Osmakac intended to use an explosive belt to take hostages and demand the release of prisoners. However, he was arrested by FBI agents just after making a video explaining his motives, ensuring the attack was prevented.

The U.S. attorney emphasized that there was no real danger to the community once law enforcement got involved, as they were able to handle the situation. The article highlights the importance of the local Muslim community and law enforcement cooperation in foiling this plot and preventing significant bloodshed.
