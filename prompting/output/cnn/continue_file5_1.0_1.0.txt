Jindal's confidence in the face of low poll numbers is not unwarranted. Many political analysts argue that early poll numbers are not indicative of a candidate's ultimate success. Several past presidential elections have seen candidates who started with low polling numbers rise to become frontrunners or even win the nomination.

Jindal acknowledged this historical trend and emphasized that his focus is on connecting with voters on the ground rather than paying too much attention to polls. He believes that building personal relationships and engaging in substantive policy discussions will eventually translate into support from voters.

The Louisiana governor also pointed out that name recognition plays a significant role in polling at this early stage of the campaign. While candidates like Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, and Scott Walker enjoy high name recognition due to their previous political experiences or media exposure, Jindal is still relatively unknown among nationwide Republican primary voters. However, he sees this as an opportunity rather than a setback.

"I think it's a good place to be," Jindal said. "It means I can define myself." He argued that having limited name ID allows him to present his policy positions without being pigeonholed by past perceptions or preconceived notions about his background.

In order to increase his visibility and connect with more potential supporters, Jindal has been actively traveling across the country attending fundraisers and speaking engagements at conservative events. By doing so, he aims to introduce himself directly to voters who may not be familiar with him yet.

Furthermore, Jindal takes pride in his hands-on approach when interacting with constituents during town hall meetings and public events. According to him, these interactions allow people "to see your heart" beyond any preconceived notions they may have about him based solely on media coverage or polling data.

While some critics argue that Jindal's chances of winning the Republican nomination are slim given his current lack of support, others believe he could emerge as a dark horse candidate in the race. They cite his strong conservative credentials, executive experience as governor, and policy expertise as factors that may appeal to voters as they get to know him better.

Jindal has made a point of distinguishing himself from other contenders by highlighting his record of implementing conservative policies in Louisiana, including education reforms, tax cuts, and implementing pro-life legislation. He aims to position himself as a true conservative alternative to other candidates who he believes are not committed enough to the principles of limited government and individual liberty.

While it is still early in the campaign season and much can change before primary voting begins, Jindal remains optimistic about his chances. He understands that polls fluctuate and that name recognition can be built over time through dedicated campaigning. As he continues to make his case directly to voters across the country, Jindal hopes that his message resonates with conservatives who are searching for an alternative choice in the 2016 Republican primaries.

In conclusion, Gov. Bobby Jindal remains undeterred by poor poll numbers at this stage of the presidential race. Recognizing that early polls are primarily measuring name recognition rather than substantive support for policies or experience, he is focusing on connecting with voters directly through grassroots campaigning efforts. While Jindal faces an uphill battle given his low initial support among Republicans in New Hampshire and nationally, he sees this as an opportunity rather than a setback for people to get acquainted with him on their own terms rather than relying on media narratives or polling data alone. By staying true to conservative principles and building personal relationships with potential supporters one voter at a time, Jindal hopes to turn the tide and emerge as a viable contender for the 2016 Republican nomination.
