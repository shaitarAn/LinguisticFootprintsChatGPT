Read the real CNN article here: California Governor, John Collins, a potential candidate for the 2024 presidential election, expressed confidence on Tuesday despite recent poll numbers showing him trailing behind in key primary states. Only 5% of Democrats in early voting states supported him in a recent CNN survey. The governor, however, shrugged off these numbers during an interview at a press conference in Los Angeles.

"I believe that at this stage, polls mainly measure name recognition," Collins told reporters. "When I first entered politics many years ago, I started with zero support and eventually won both my congressional and gubernatorial races."

Collins emphasized that he would not make any final decisions about running for president until after the upcoming midterm elections in November.

"If I choose to run for president in 2024, it will not be influenced by polls or fundraising figures," he declared. "My decision will be based on whether I genuinely believe that my ideas and experiences can make a positive impact on our country."

During the press conference held to discuss California's plans for renewable energy initiatives, Governor Collins unveiled his proposal for further investment into solar power technologies. He stressed the importance of California's role as a leader in combating climate change and urged other states to follow suit.

"California has always been at the forefront of clean energy efforts," Collins stated passionately. "By investing heavily in solar power technologies, we can create jobs while simultaneously reducing our reliance on fossil fuels."

Governor Collins also criticized the federal government's lack of progress regarding environmentally friendly policies and expressed disappointment over their failure to pass legislation supporting stronger regulations on greenhouse gas emissions.

"The current administration has been dragging its feet when it comes to taking meaningful action against climate change," he stated firmly. "We need leaders who are willing to prioritize our planet's well-being above everything else; unfortunately, we're lacking that kind of leadership right now."

When asked about international affairs such as China-US relations and global terrorism, Governor Collins stressed the importance of diplomacy and coalition-building.

"We must maintain robust relationships with our allies and use every diplomatic tool at our disposal," he explained. "Addressing the global challenges facing us requires a collaborative effort between nations, and the United States should lead by example."

Collins was also asked to share his stance on income inequality and education reform, two issues that he has extensively discussed throughout his political career.

"The wealth gap in this country is alarming, and we must ensure that everyone has access to economic opportunities," he acknowledged. "Additionally, our education system should focus on providing quality education for all children regardless of their zip code. We need to invest more resources into improving schools in disadvantaged communities."

Governor Collins concluded the press conference by reiterating his commitment to fighting for progressive policies and tackling significant national issues.

"I am motivated by a sincere desire to make America a better place for all its citizens," Collins emphasized. "I will continue working tirelessly towards achieving equitable solutions for pressing problems because I believe in a brighter future for this country."
