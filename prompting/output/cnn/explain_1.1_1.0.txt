This news article describes an attempted terrorist attack by a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac in Tampa, Florida. Osmakac intended to use explosives and weapons to cause chaos and harm Americans. However, his plot was foiled thanks to the cooperation of the local Muslim community and law enforcement.

Osmakac believed he had access to an operable AK-47, real explosives, an explosive pack, and a car bomb which he planned on using against Americans. He expressed his desire for revenge in a martyrdom video where he stated he wanted payback for what he viewed as wrongs against Muslims.

The investigation began when a confidential informant informed the FBI that Osmakac had requested al Qaeda flags. Eventually, an undercover FBI employee was introduced to Osmakac, leading to discussions about potential terror targets in Tampa. Osmakac sought help acquiring weapons and explosives for his attacks until his arrest on December 21st.

Authorities have determined that there are no indications of any involvement with al Qaeda or any other organization influencing or directing Osmakac's actions. The sources further state that there is no threat of anyone else being involved in the plot.

Law enforcement rendered all explosives and firearms inert before they reached the public. According to one official interviewed by CNN, among the targets mentioned were night clubs in Ybor City area of Tampa, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office operations center in Ybor City, and a business establishment located within South Tampa region.

Osmakac planned on staging a car bombing first, followed by taking hostages while wearing an explosive belt around his waist. His intention was then to demand prisoner release from the FBI before ultimately being willing to die due wearing said explosive device attached around him.

Fortunately, law enforcement agents arrested Osmakac just after he made a video explaining his motives for carrying out this attack near imminent danger time-frame scheduled action initiation. The U.S. attorney acknowledged the significant role played by local Muslims in providing information that allowed law enforcement to intervene and prevent a potentially devastating attack.
