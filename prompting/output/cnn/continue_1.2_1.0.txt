Osmakac, originally from Kosovo, had been under surveillance by law enforcement for several months before his plot was uncovered. The investigation began when members of the local Muslim community tipped off authorities about Osmakac's extremist views and concerning behavior.

Authorities said that Osmakac expressed admiration for violent jihadist groups and had made multiple attempts to acquire weapons and explosives. Undercover officers posed as potential accomplices, providing him with what he believed were real firearms, explosives, and a car bomb. Throughout their interactions with Osmakac, he reiterated his intent to carry out a devastating attack in Tampa.

During the hearing, details emerged regarding Osmakac's plans. He had conducted extensive reconnaissance of targets including nightclubs, the Tampa Police Department headquarters, and other crowded places. His intention was to cause mass casualties and chaos while instilling fear into the hearts of American citizens.

The defense argued that Osmakac never posed an actual threat as he did not have the capability or means to execute such an attack on his own. Yet authorities vehemently disagreed, highlighting the seriousness of his intentions along with possessing what he fully believed were operational firearms and explosives.

Throughout their case against him, prosecutors presented evidence demonstrating Osmakac's extremist beliefs along with conversations where he explicitly stated his desire to wage war against America in support of radical causes.

Immediately following the hearing's conclusion on Monday afternoon,some members of Tampa Bayâ€™s Muslim community publicly denounced any form of extremism or violence against innocent civilians.

The incident served as a stark reminder of the ever-present risk posed by individuals willing to resort to violence in pursuit of their extremist ideologies.
