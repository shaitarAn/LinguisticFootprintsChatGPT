Title: Foiled Terror Plot in Tampa Thanks to Community Vigilance and Law Enforcement

TAMPA, Florida (CNN) - A 25-year-old man's plot to unleash terror in Tampa has been thwarted by the combined efforts of the local community and law enforcement officials, according to U.S. attorney Robert O'Neill. The suspect, identified as Samir Osman, a naturalized American born in Kosovo, intended to carry out a series of attacks using explosives and weapons "to create mayhem," but was arrested before he could put his plan into action.

During a press conference on Monday, O'Neill highlighted the seriousness of Osman's intentions. "When a person possesses an operable AK-47 rifle, believes they have real explosives, and plans to use an explosive pack and car bomb against Americans, that constitutes a crime," he stated. "And in this case, it was very real."

The arrest followed an extensive investigation that began in September when authorities were alerted by members of the local Muslim community about Osman's ideology and his desire to commit a crime. Steve Ibison from the FBI's Tampa office commended the significant assistance provided by individuals within the Muslim community throughout the investigation.

"This case is not about religion or any specific community," emphasized Ibison. "It revolves around an individual who committed a crime."

Law enforcement officials believe Osman acted alone without any connection to al-Qaeda or other terrorist organizations; early information indicates that he was self-radicalized. Authorities have no indication at this time that anyone else was involved in pushing him towards carrying out these acts.

The federal investigation into Osman began after a confidential human source informed the FBI about his request for al-Qaeda flags back in September last year. By November 2021, discussions between Osman and an undercover FBI employee revealed potential targets for his planned attacks within Tampa.

According to court documents made public on Monday after Osman's arrest, he sought assistance in procuring weapons and explosives for his intended assault. During a meeting on December 21, Osman allegedly expressed his desire to acquire an AK-47-style machine gun, Uzi submachine guns, high-capacity magazines, grenades, and an explosive belt. He even provided a $500 down payment for the weapons.

The suspect outlined his plans during a meeting with the undercover FBI employee on New Year's Day. His targets included nightclubs in Tampa's Ybor City area, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office operations center in Ybor City, and a business in South Tampa.

However, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation who spoke to CNN under anonymity rules as they were not authorized to disclose details of the probe publicly, Osman later changed his primary target to an Irish bar located in south Tampa. The motive behind this change was reportedly due to Osman seeking locations with large crowds.

Osman planned for a car bombing as the initial phase of his attacks before retrieving additional firearms and explosives from a hotel room in Tampa for subsequent assaults. His intention was then to enter crowded premises wearing an explosive belt and taking hostages while demanding the release of prisoners.

FBI agents apprehended Osman on Saturday night immediately after he recorded a video explaining his motives. U.S Attorney O'Neill stressed that thanks to early intervention by law enforcement authorities informed by tips from local Muslims about Osman's intentions; there was no real danger posed towards the community at any point during their investigation.

"We arrested him when the attack was imminent," said O'Neill during Monday's press conference. He expressed gratitude towards both local Muslim individuals who shared information about Osman and law enforcement officers involved in preventing potential bloodshed by apprehending him before any harm could be done.

As investigations continue into this case that has shaken Tampa residents' sense of security momentarily but ultimately reassured them of their community's resilience against threats, authorities are urging the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity that may pose a danger to their safety.

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of community engagement and cooperation with law enforcement in combating potential threats and ensuring the safety of all citizens.
