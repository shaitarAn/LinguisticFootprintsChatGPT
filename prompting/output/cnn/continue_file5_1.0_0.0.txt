Jindal expressed confidence in his ability to gain support and increase his name recognition among voters in New Hampshire and beyond. He acknowledged that polling numbers at this stage in the race are not indicative of future success and pointed to his own experience as proof.

The governor's focus appeared to be on distinguishing himself from the crowded field of potential candidates rather than worrying about current polling numbers. He believed that voters will ultimately prioritize candidates based on their qualifications, experience, and policy positions rather than simply recognizing a name.

"If all that mattered was name ID, then we should just have one primary and general election and not have candidate debates," Jindal remarked. He emphasized the importance of engaging with voters directly and presenting his vision for the country. Jindal stated that he had plans to visit New Hampshire frequently to engage with voters and discuss his conservative principles.

Despite the low polling numbers, Jindal remained optimistic about his chances. He was determined not to let these results deter him from running a strong campaign. With a pragmatic and confident tone, Jindal emphasized that he would not be swayed by the current standings but would instead focus on his message and values.

"I think the most important thing isn't where you are in the polls today, it's where you'll be on Election Day. And that's why we're going to keep fighting," Jindal stated firmly.

The governor's positive outlook and determination resonated with his supporters. They appreciated his focus on ideas and solutions rather than pandering to popularity. Jindal's policy proposals, including tax reform, education reform, and a strong defense against the Islamic State, garnered praise from conservatives who saw his pragmatic approach as a breath of fresh air in the crowded field.

Jindal also drew attention to his experience as the governor of Louisiana, highlighting his successful conservative reforms in the state. He saw his track record as evidence of his ability to make meaningful change at the national level.

As the campaign season continued, Jindal ramped up his efforts to gain momentum. He attended town hall meetings, spoke at local events, and engaged in grassroots campaigning to connect with voters directly. He utilized social media platforms to share his policy proposals and engage with supporters, hoping to build a broader base of support beyond the limited polling numbers.

Jindal's refusal to be discouraged by the initial polling numbers seemed to pay off as the campaign progressed. His consistent message and tireless campaigning helped him gain traction among voters who appreciated his perseverance and commitment to conservative principles.

While he still faced challenges in a competitive field, Jindal's determination and ideas ultimately propelled him to a more respectable position in the polls. He continued to present himself as a viable alternative to other candidates, focusing on his record, policy positions, and the vision he had for the country.

In the end, the early polling numbers proved to be just that - early and not necessarily indicative of the final outcome. Jindal's refusal to be deterred by initial setbacks showcased his resilience and dedication to his campaign. Regardless of the ultimate results, his presence on the campaign trail as a serious contender made an impact and injected fresh ideas into the discussion surrounding the 2016 presidential election.
