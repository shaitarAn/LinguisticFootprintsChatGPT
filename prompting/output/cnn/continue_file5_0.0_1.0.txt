Jindal continued, "Polls can fluctuate and change dramatically as the campaign progresses. It's still early in the process, and I am confident that as voters become more familiar with my record and my vision for America, their support will grow."

He acknowledged that his low polling numbers were a challenge but remained optimistic about his chances. "I understand that I have work to do to gain the trust and support of New Hampshire Republicans," Jindal said. "But I am committed to visiting the state frequently, meeting with voters, and sharing my conservative principles."

Jindal emphasized his accomplishments as governor of Louisiana, highlighting his efforts to cut taxes, reduce government spending, and improve education. He believed that these achievements would resonate with Republican primary voters who prioritize fiscal responsibility and limited government.

"I have a proven track record of conservative leadership," Jindal stated confidently. "I believe that once people see what I have accomplished in Louisiana, they will recognize my ability to bring those same principles to the White House."

When asked about other potential Republican candidates who were faring better in polls, Jindal remained unfazed. He stressed that he was focused on presenting himself as a strong alternative rather than comparing himself to others.

"I'm not running against anyone else; I'm running for president because I believe in America's potential," he declared passionately. "I will continue working hard every day to earn the trust of voters across this country."

As Jindal concluded his remarks at the breakfast event, he reiterated his determination not to be discouraged by poll numbers or media speculation.

"Politics is unpredictable," he said firmly. "What matters most is connecting with people on a personal level and demonstrating how my conservative values align with their hopes for our nation's future."
