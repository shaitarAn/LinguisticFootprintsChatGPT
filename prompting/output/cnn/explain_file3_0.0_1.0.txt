This news article provides a brief overview of the life and career of James Traficant Jr., a former politician from Ohio. Traficant was known for his controversial statements, flamboyant personality, and unique hairstyle.

The article begins by highlighting Traficant's comments during an ethics hearing where he declared that there are no ethics in politics and that there should be no ethics committee. This statement made him popular among reporters in Washington, who sought his opinions on various topics. The article also mentions his famous catchphrase, "Beam me up!" which he often used at the end of his animated House speeches.

Traficant's appearance was also a subject of interest in Washington. Reporters struggled to describe his pompadour hairstyle, with some comparing it to a "Planet of the Apes sort of hair helmet." However, it was later revealed that Traficant wore a toupee when he was booked into jail in 2002.

The article briefly touches upon Traficant's background as a former football player at the University of Pittsburgh and his role as a drug counselor and sheriff in Mahoning County, Ohio. During his time as sheriff, he faced bribery charges but managed to convince the jury to acquit him by claiming he was conducting a sting operation.

After being elected to Congress in 1984, Traficant continued to make headlines with his unconventional style. He criticized foreign aid and government agencies such as the IRS and CIA. He referred to the latter as "lying, thieving stealing nincompoops."

In April 2002, Traficant faced legal troubles once again when he was convicted on charges including bribery, racketeering, and tax evasion. Despite not being a lawyer himself, he represented himself during the trial. As a result of these convictions, he became only the second congressman expelled from Congress since the Civil War after receiving an overwhelming vote of 420-1.

During his time in prison from 2002 to 2009, Traficant took up painting as a hobby. After his release, he attempted to regain his old seat in Congress but lost to sitting Representative Tim Ryan.

The article concludes with a quote from Traficant where he describes himself as a regular guy and the son of a truck driver, distancing himself from the political world.
