The city's holy sites, including the Temple Mount and al-Aqsa Mosque, will be jointly managed by a committee composed of representatives from various faiths, fostering a spirit of mutual respect and understanding.

In addition to the momentous peace accord, the Jerusalem Peace Initiative also includes provisions for joint economic development projects, aimed at improving the quality of life for all residents.
