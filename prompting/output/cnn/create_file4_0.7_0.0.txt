Jerusalem, Israel - A life-changing journey to the historic land of Israel has propelled a Kansas City native, Rachel Thompson, into a new and fulfilling career path. Thompson, known for her unwavering dedication and compassion, discovered her true calling after a transformative college trip to the Middle East.

Growing up in the heart of Kansas City, Missouri, Thompson had always exhibited a sharp intellect, a great sense of humor, and a kind-hearted nature. These qualities stayed with her as she pursued her studies in dentistry at the University of Southern California. However, it was during a college trip to Israel that Thompson's life took an unexpected turn.

Accompanied by her close childhood friend, Jessica Bennett, Thompson embarked on a journey to explore the rich cultural heritage and historical significance of Israel. The trip had such a profound impact on her that she decided to extend her stay indefinitely, immersing herself in the study of Jewish text and traditions.

"Israel opened my eyes to a world of knowledge, history, and spirituality that I had never experienced before," Thompson shared. "I felt an instant connection to this land and its people, and I knew I had to dedicate my life to understanding and promoting its cultural significance."
