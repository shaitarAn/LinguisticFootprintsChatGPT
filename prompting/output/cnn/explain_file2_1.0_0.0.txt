This news article discusses the horrific bombing that took place during the Boston Marathon on April 15th. The article starts by mentioning that the range of suspects and motives for the bombing are still unknown. The bombs used in the attack were two identical pressure-cooker bombs that were filled with BB-like pellets and nails, causing even more damage. Photos obtained by CNN showed parts of a pressure cooker, a shredded black backpack, and what appeared to be metal pellets or ball bearings.

The evidence, including a partial circuit board, is being sent to an FBI facility in Quantico, Virginia for analysis in hopes of identifying the person or persons responsible for the attack. However, regardless of the outcome of the investigation, the pain and suffering caused by the bombings cannot be erased. Many people were physically and mentally affected by the blasts, including Ron Brassard, who lost a chunk of his leg, his wife was also injured, and a friend lost both her legs. Brassard expressed his anger at the situation but also emphasized that he wouldn't let this terror change him.

The article then shifts focus to the heroic acts of the people who rushed to help after the blast. Carlos Arredondo, an affiliate of the Red Cross, tended to a man who had lost two limbs. Dr. Natalie Stavas, a pediatric resident, ran towards the blast site to offer her medical assistance despite having just finished running the marathon. She performed CPR on one person and worked to stop the bleeding of two others.

The bombs used in the attack were possibly placed in pressure cookers hidden inside backpacks or another black nylon bag. It is not yet known if they were detonated using a timer or remotely by a cell phone. The bombs were small and the materials used were crude, but they were deadly. The article then goes on to mention the victims who lost their lives in the attack, including 8-year-old Martin Richard, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell, and a Boston University graduate student from China.

The article acknowledges the efforts of emergency personnel, volunteers, and medical professionals in treating the injured. It also highlights the ongoing investigation and the FBI's request for the public's help in providing any relevant information. By Tuesday evening, the FBI had received over 2,000 tips and was examining numerous photos and videos from the scene.

The article concludes by mentioning the increased security measures in various cities following the attack. There are questions about the future of the Boston Marathon, but officials have promised to rebuild the race and not let terror dictate their actions. Governor Deval Patrick and Mayor Thomas Menino both expressed a sense of defiance, stating that they would not let terror take over Boston.
