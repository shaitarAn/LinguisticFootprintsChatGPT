This news article is about a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac from Florida who planned to carry out a terrorist attack in Tampa. He intended to use explosives and weapons to cause chaos and harm to Americans. However, his plot was foiled thanks to the local Muslim community and law enforcement.

Osmakac believed he had an operable AK-47, real explosives, and a car bomb that he planned to use against Americans. He was charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. In a video message recorded before his arrest, he expressed his desire for revenge against those he felt had wronged Muslims.

The local Muslim community played a significant role in alerting law enforcement about Osmakac's ideology and intentions. The FBI's Tampa office acknowledged the assistance they received from members of the Muslim community throughout the investigation. It is important to note that this case is not about the Muslim religion or community but about an individual who committed a crime.

Officials stated that Osmakac does not appear to have any ties to al Qaeda and was likely self-radicalized. The investigation began when a confidential source informed the FBI that Osmakac had asked for al Qaeda flags. He later discussed potential targets in Tampa and sought help in acquiring weapons and explosives.

Law enforcement rendered the explosives and firearms Osmakac sought inoperable, ensuring they posed no threat to the public. His planned targets included nightclubs, the sheriff's office operations center, and a business in Tampa. He intended to carry out a car bombing and then take hostages, demanding the release of prisoners.

Osmakac was arrested just after he made a video explaining his motives, and authorities believe they prevented significant bloodshed thanks to the tips from the local Muslim community and their intervention.
