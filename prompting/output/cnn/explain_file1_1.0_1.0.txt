This news article discusses the arrest of a 25-year-old Florida man named Sami Osmakac who planned to carry out a terrorist attack in Tampa. Osmakac intended to use explosives and weapons to create chaos and harm Americans. However, thanks to the local Muslim community's cooperation with law enforcement, his plot was discovered and foiled.

Osmakac had an AK-47, believed he had real explosives, possessed an explosive pack and a car bomb, all of which he planned on using against Americans. He expressed his intentions in conversations with undercover FBI agents.

He allegedly wanted "payback" for wrongs he felt were done to Muslims. Osmakac recorded a martyrdom video message before his arrest stating that he wanted to die "the Islamic way." The motive behind his actions was retaliation against perceived injustices towards Muslims.

The investigation into Osmakac began when a confidential human source reported him asking for al Qaeda flags. The suspect discussed potential targets in Tampa and requested help obtaining firearms and explosives from the source.

During meetings with undercover FBI agents in December and January, Osmakac expressed his desire to acquire various weapons including high-capacity magazines, grenades, an AK-47-style machine gun, Uzi submachine guns, as well as an explosive belt.

His planned targets included nightclubs in Ybor City area of Tampa, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office operations center in Ybor City, and a business in South Tampa. However, by Saturday night before his arrest occurred at an Irish bar south Tampa focused on large crowds.

After initiating the car bomb detonation at his chosen location, Osmakac planned on retrieving additional weapons from a hotel room so that he could take hostages during the next phase of attacks. He reportedly threatened that once he had access through the explosive belt attached around him: "they can take me in five million pieces."

Fortunately, law enforcement took him into custody just after he recorded a video explaining his motives, and the attack was imminent. The U.S. attorney Robert O'Neill acknowledged the significant role of law enforcement and the local Muslim community in preventing this attack from happening.

It is important to note that there is no indication that Osmakac had any ties to al Qaeda or was acting under their direction. He appears to have been "self-radicalized," meaning he became radicalized without direct involvement or guidance from any extremist organization.

Overall, this article emphasizes the importance of community cooperation with law enforcement in identifying potential threats and preventing acts of terrorism.
