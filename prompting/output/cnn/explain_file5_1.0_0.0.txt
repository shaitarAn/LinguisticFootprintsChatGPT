The news article discusses Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal's response to recent poll numbers showing him trailing in popularity among New Hampshire Republicans. The article mentions that only 3% of New Hampshire Republican primary voters supported him in a recent CNN poll. However, Jindal believes that the polls are primarily measuring name recognition at this point and that he is not deterred by the low numbers.

Jindal states that he is considering running for the 2016 presidential election and will make a final decision after the November midterm elections. He emphasizes that his decision will not be based on polls or fundraising numbers but on whether he believes he can make a difference and has unique ideas or experiences to offer.

During a breakfast event, Jindal unveils an energy proposal from his nonprofit group, America Next. The proposal supports an "all of the above" strategy but emphasizes the importance of domestic oil and gas development, particularly for Louisiana's economy. Jindal criticizes the Obama administration's stance on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and accuses them of ignoring America's energy potential.

Jindal also discusses his support for efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak in Africa and proposes backing White House proposals to train and arm Syrian rebels to confront ISIS. However, he criticizes the administration for delays that allowed Islamic extremists to gain power. He also addresses the need for spending controls and criticizes what he sees as a "war on religious liberty" in the US.

Jindal concludes by expressing his belief that President Obama is the worst American president since Jimmy Carter. He criticizes Obama's stance on American exceptionalism and considers him to be the most radical and incompetent president in his lifetime.
