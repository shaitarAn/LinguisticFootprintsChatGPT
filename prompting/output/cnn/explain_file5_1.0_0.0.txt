The news article discusses Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal's considerations for running in the 2016 presidential election. Jindal, who is 43 years old, has been increasing his national profile by serving as the vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association. However, he clarifies that he will not make a final decision until after the November midterm elections.

Jindal states that his decision to run in 2016 would not be influenced by polls or fundraising numbers. Instead, he would base his decision on the same factors he considered when running for Congress or governor. He asks himself whether he believes he can make a difference, if he has unique ideas or experiences to offer, and if this is a path he is meant to pursue.

During a breakfast event, Jindal announced an energy proposal from his nonprofit organization, America Next. The plan advocates for an "all of the above" strategy, with a focus on developing domestic oil and gas resources through hydraulic fracturing and other methods. He emphasizes the significance of the oil and gas industry in Louisiana's economy and criticizes the Obama administration for not supporting the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.

Jindal also addresses other topics during the breakfast event. He expresses support for the administration's efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak in Africa and highlights both the humanitarian reasons and the vested interest the United States has in assisting the hardest-hit countries. When questioned about confronting ISIS in the Middle East, Jindal urges Congress to support the White House's proposals to train and arm Syrian rebels. However, he criticizes the administration for allowing the power of Islamic extremists to grow due to repeated delays.

The article notes that Jindal discusses several subjects that would resonate with Republican primary voters. He talks about the need for spending controls and raises concerns about a perceived "war on religious liberty" within the United States. Jindal believes that President Obama fails to address the issues faced by Christians in the country, contrasting it with his support for protecting Christians overseas. He criticizes Obama, calling him the worst American president since Jimmy Carter, arguing that Carter at least believed in American exceptionalism, while Obama is the "most radical" and "incompetent" president in his lifetime.

To summarize, the article primarily focuses on Governor Bobby Jindal's considerations for running in the 2016 presidential election, his energy proposal, and his commentary on various national and international issues.
