This tragic ending to such a noble life is a painful reminder of the senseless violence that exists in the world. Shimon Kraft, now a successful businessman, reminisces about his dear friend Rabbi Kalman Levine, whose life was forever changed during a college trip to Israel.

Growing up in Kansas City, Missouri, Kalman Levine and Shimon Kraft shared a remarkable bond. They were inseparable, spending countless hours together as they navigated the challenges of childhood and adolescence. Although they had different aspirations – Kalman in academia and Shimon in the business world – their friendship remained strong.

After finishing high school, Kalman pursued his dreams at the University of Southern California, studying dentistry. It was during his time there that he and Shimon embarked on a life-changing trip to Israel. The experience created a profound shift in Kalman's perspective, igniting a deep passion for Judaism and Jewish text in his soul.

Kalman's love for Israel was so intense that he decided to make it his permanent home. He immersed himself in the study of Jewish text, dedicating his life to understanding and teaching the wisdom and traditions of his heritage. His newfound purpose and dedication to his faith impressed and inspired those who knew him.

"To be killed in such a cruel way when all he cared about was kindness..." Shimon's voice trails off, unable to conceal the sorrow that lingers in his heart. It is a sentiment echoed by everyone who knew Rabbi Kalman Levine; his gentle nature and unwavering kindness were his defining qualities.

As a husband, Kalman Levine exemplified what it meant to be giving and understanding. His devotion to his wife was unwavering, and their bond served as an example to others. Together, they built a nurturing home, raising nine children in an environment filled with love, respect, and the values that Kalman held dear.

Fatherhood allowed Kalman to pass on the qualities he cherished most, instilling in his children the importance of empathy, education, and the pursuit of justice. He taught them to embrace their Jewish heritage, to honor their roots, and to stand up for what they believed in. Kalman's wisdom and guidance shaped their lives in profound ways.

As a doting grandfather, Kalman relished in the joy of watching his grandchildren grow. He showered them with love and attention, ensuring that they understood the value of family and tradition. His warm smile and playful demeanor made him a beloved figure in their lives, and they cherished the moments shared with him.

The news of Kalman's untimely death shook the community, leaving a void that cannot be filled. To lose someone like him, someone who dedicated his life to spreading goodness and kindness, is a heart-wrenching tragedy. The violent and senseless act that took his life serves as a reminder of the darkness that persists in the world.

But in the face of such sorrow, Shimon holds on to the memories and lessons learned from his childhood friend. He cherishes every moment they spent together, every conversation that sparked laughter and insight. Shimon finds solace in knowing that Kalman's legacy continues to live through his teachings, his family, and the lives he touched.

Rabbi Kalman Levine's journey from Kansas City to Israel was not just a physical one but a transformation of the soul. His commitment to kindness and compassion remains an enduring testament to the power of love in a world plagued by hatred. May his memory be a blessing and an inspiration to all who strive for a brighter, more compassionate future.
