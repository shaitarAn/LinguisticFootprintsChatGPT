The news article discusses the arrest of a 25-year-old naturalized American born in Kosovo who planned a car bombing and hostage-taking followed by exploding a suicide belt. The suspect, identified as Osmakac, allegedly expressed his desire to die in an "Islamic way" and seek revenge for what he perceived as wrongs done to Muslims.

According to the criminal complaint made public on Monday, Osmakac recorded a martyrdom video message shortly before his arrest expressing his intentions. The law enforcement officials involved in the investigation stated that there were no indications of any ties between Osmakac and al Qaeda. They believed he was "self-radicalized" with no evidence suggesting others were involved or pushing him towards this plot.

The federal investigation into Osmakac began when a confidential source informed the FBI that he had requested al Qaeda flags. As discussions progressed, Osmakac discussed potential targets for terror attacks in Tampa and sought assistance from the source to obtain guns and explosives.

Eventually, he was introduced to an undercover FBI employee who arranged a meeting where Osmakac expressed his desire for weapons such as AK-47-style machine guns, Uzi submachine guns, grenades, high capacity magazines, and an explosive belt. He even provided a $500 down payment for these items.

Osmakac revealed his plans during a New Year's Day meeting with the undercover FBI employee. His intended targets included nightclubs in Tampa's Ybor City area, the operations center of Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office also located there, as well as another business in South Tampa.

However, by Saturday night before his arrest took place; it was discovered that his primary target had become an Irish bar in South Tampa due to its anticipated large crowds. After initiating the car bombing at this location, Osmakac planned on retrieving additional weapons and explosives stored at a Tampa hotel room to continue with subsequent attacks.

His plan involved using the explosive belt to enter a crowded area, taking hostages, and then demanding the release of prisoners. Osmakac allegedly stated that he was prepared to die in the process.

FBI agents arrested Osmakac shortly after he recorded a video explaining his motives and just as the attack was imminent. The U.S. attorney emphasized that thanks to tips from local Muslims and effective law enforcement work, significant bloodshed was prevented.

The investigation began when a confidential source alerted authorities about Osmakac's interest in obtaining al Qaeda flags, leading them to uncover his plans for terror attacks in Tampa.
