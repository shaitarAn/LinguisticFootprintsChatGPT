This news article is about Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, who is considering running for the White House in 2016. The article mentions that recent CNN poll numbers show him trailing badly among New Hampshire Republicans, with only 3% of Republican primary voters supporting him. However, Jindal dismisses the significance of these polls, stating that they are mainly measuring name recognition. He also mentions that he will not make a final decision about running until after the November midterm elections.

During a breakfast event, Jindal unveils an energy proposal from his nonprofit group, America Next, which emphasizes the importance of domestic oil and gas development. He criticizes the Obama administration's refusal to move forward with the Keystone XL pipeline and accuses them of being "science deniers" when it comes to harnessing America's energy resources.

Jindal also addresses other topics during the breakfast, expressing support for the administration's efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak in Africa and advocating for Congress to back White House proposals to train and arm Syrian rebels to confront ISIS. He also discusses the need for spending controls and complains about what he perceives as a "war on religious liberty" in the United States.

Jindal concludes by calling President Obama the worst American president since Jimmy Carter, stating that he believes Obama lacks belief in American exceptionalism and is the most radical and incompetent president in his lifetime.
