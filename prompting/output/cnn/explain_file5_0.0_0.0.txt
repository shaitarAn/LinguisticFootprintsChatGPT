This news article is about Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal considering a run for the presidency in 2016. Jindal states that he is thinking and praying about whether he will run, and that he will not make a final decision until after the November midterm elections. He emphasizes that his decision will not be based on polls or fundraising numbers, but rather on whether he believes he can make a difference and has unique ideas and experiences to offer.

During a breakfast event, Jindal unveils an energy proposal from his nonprofit group, America Next, which supports an "all of the above" strategy for energy development. He criticizes the Obama administration for not moving forward with the Keystone XL pipeline and accuses them of being "science deniers" when it comes to harnessing America's energy resources.

Jindal also discusses other topics, such as his support for U.S. efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak in Africa and his belief that Congress should back White House proposals to train and arm Syrian rebels to confront ISIS. He criticizes the administration for allowing the power of Islamic extremists to grow unchecked due to repeated delays.

Additionally, Jindal addresses issues that are likely to resonate with GOP primary voters, including the need for spending controls and complaints about a "war on religious liberty" in the United States. He calls President Obama the worst American president since Jimmy Carter, stating that Carter at least believed in American exceptionalism, while he believes Obama is the most radical and incompetent president in his lifetime.
