Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Kosovo, had been under surveillance by law enforcement for several months after concerns were raised by members of the local Muslim community about his extremist views and potential plans for violence. The community members alerted authorities, who then initiated an investigation into Osmakac's activities.

During the investigation, undercover agents made contact with Osmakac and gained his trust by posing as fellow extremists sympathetic to his cause. Over time, Osmakac revealed his intentions to carry out a large-scale attack in Tampa targeting innocent civilians.

According to court documents, Osmakac had acquired an AK-47 rifle that he believed was functional and had obtained what he thought were real explosives. He also planned to use an explosive pack and a car bomb in order to maximize casualties.

However, unbeknownst to him, all of the weapons and explosives provided to him were inert or non-functional devices supplied by undercover agents. This ensured that no harm would come to anyone during the operation while allowing law enforcement officials to gather evidence against Osmakac.

The arrest of Sami Osmakac is seen as a significant victory for both the Muslim community in Tampa and law enforcement agencies working tirelessly to prevent acts of terrorism. It highlights the importance of cooperation between communities and authorities in identifying potential threats before they can materialize into dangerous situations.

U.S. Attorney Robert O'Neill emphasized that this case serves as a reminder that individuals who plan or attempt acts of violence will be held accountable under the law regardless of their motivations or affiliations. The successful disruption of this plot demonstrates the effectiveness of proactive measures taken by law enforcement agencies in safeguarding communities from potential harm.

As investigations continue into any possible connections or influences on Sami Osmakac's radicalization process, authorities remain vigilant in their efforts against domestic terrorism threats across the country. The collaboration between communities and law enforcement will continue to play a crucial role in preventing acts of violence and maintaining the safety and security of all Americans.
