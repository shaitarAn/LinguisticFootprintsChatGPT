Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Kosovo, had been under surveillance by the FBI for several months after expressing radical views and making statements about his desire to carry out an attack on American soil. His plans came to the attention of law enforcement when members of the local Muslim community reported his suspicious behavior and extremist ideology.

Authorities were able to infiltrate Osmakac's network through an undercover agent who posed as a fellow extremist sympathizer. This covert operation allowed them to gather valuable evidence against him, including recorded conversations where he discussed his plans in detail.

During these conversations, Osmakac expressed his intention to target innocent civilians at popular locations in Tampa using explosives and firearms. He believed he was working with like-minded individuals who would assist him in carrying out the attack but was unaware that they were undercover agents gathering evidence against him.

The FBI ensured that all materials provided to Osmakac, such as weapons and explosives, were inert and posed no actual threat. However, O'Neill emphasized that even though the weapons and explosives were not functional, Osmakac's intent was real and demonstrated clear criminal intent.

At the hearing on Monday, O'Neill outlined how law enforcement had meticulously monitored Osmakac's activities to ensure public safety while collecting sufficient evidence for prosecution. The U.S Attorney praised both the Muslim community for reporting their concerns and local law enforcement agencies for their continued cooperation throughout the investigation.

Authorities believe that this case serves as a prime example of cooperation between communities and law enforcement agencies in preventing potential acts of terrorism. They hope it sends a strong message both locally and nationwide that extremism will not be tolerated within any community.

Osmakac now faces serious charges related to domestic terrorism offenses which could result in significant prison time if found guilty. As this case progresses through court proceedings, authorities remain vigilant in ensuring public safety while upholding justice against those who pose threats to national security.
