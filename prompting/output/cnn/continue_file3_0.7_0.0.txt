Despite his controversial and unconventional style, Traficant had a strong following among his constituents who appreciated his tough stance against government agencies and his outspoken nature. He was known for his fiery speeches on the House floor, often wearing his signature rumpled suit and cowboy boots.

Traficant's unorthodox approach to politics earned him both admirers and critics. His populist rhetoric and fierce defense of the working class resonated with many, particularly in his economically struggling district. However, his abrasive and confrontational style often alienated his colleagues in Congress.

In 2002, Traficant's career took a dramatic turn when he was convicted on multiple charges including bribery, racketeering, and tax evasion. Despite maintaining his innocence and claiming he was the victim of a political conspiracy, he was sentenced to eight years in prison.

His expulsion from Congress marked the end of a colorful and controversial era in Ohio politics. Traficant's absence was felt by his supporters and detractors alike, as he left a void that was not easily filled.

After serving his prison sentence, Traficant attempted a political comeback in 2010, running as an independent candidate for Congress. However, his bid was unsuccessful, and he ultimately faded from the political spotlight.

In his later years, Traficant focused on his personal life and spent time on his farm in Greenford, Ohio. He continued to be a polarizing figure, with some viewing him as a champion of the people and others seeing him as a symbol of corruption and misconduct.

With Traficant's passing, the political landscape in Ohio loses one of its most colorful and controversial figures. His legacy will be debated and remembered for years to come, as his impact on the political discourse and his unapologetic approach to challenging the status quo remains a part of Ohio's political history.
