This news article discusses the horrific bombings that took place during the Boston Marathon on April 15th. The article begins by stating that the range of suspects and motives for the bombings remains wide open, according to Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office. The bombs used in the attack were two identical pressure-cooker bombs, each with the capacity to hold six liters of liquid. They contained BB-like pellets and nails, causing significant damage and injuries.

Photos obtained by CNN show parts of a pressure cooker, a shredded black backpack, and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings. These pieces of evidence, along with a partial circuit board, are being sent to an FBI facility in Quantico, Virginia for further analysis to determine how the devices worked and potentially identify the person or persons responsible for the attack.
