This news article provides an update on the investigation into the bombings that occurred during the Boston Marathon. The article begins by stating that the range of suspects and motives for the attack remains wide open, according to Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office. The bombs used in the attack were two identical pressure-cooker bombs, each capable of holding six liters of liquid. They contained BB-like pellets and nails, causing significant damage.

Photos obtained by CNN show evidence from the scene, including parts of a pressure cooker and a shredded black backpack. These pieces of evidence will be sent to an FBI facility in Quantico, Virginia for further analysis to determine how the devices worked and potentially identify those responsible.

The article then goes on to describe some personal accounts from survivors and witnesses at the scene. Ron Brassard was injured in one of the blasts along with his wife and a friend who lost both her legs. Despite his anger at what happened, Brassard is determined not to let this terror change him any more than it already has.

The article also highlights stories of bravery and heroism from individuals who rushed to help those affected by the bombings. Carlos Arredondo tended to a man who had lost two limbs, while Dr. Natalie Stavas performed CPR on one person she encountered before working to stop bleeding for others.

Authorities have provided details about possible devices used in this attack - pressure cookers hidden inside backpacks or black nylon bags - but have not yet identified any suspects or motives for carrying out this act of terrorism.

The article mentions that initial tests showed no high-grade explosives were used in these bombs; instead, crude materials were employed which still caused significant harm and loss of life.

The victims mentioned include 8-year-old Martin Richard, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell, and a Boston University graduate student from China whose identity was not revealed at that time.

There is also a call for the public's help in providing any information that may lead to identifying the perpetrator. The FBI had received over 2,000 tips by that point and was analyzing photos and videos from the scene.

The article notes that while there are still many people in critical condition, some progress has been made with over 100 of the 183 people who received treatment able to go home by Tuesday night.

The article concludes by addressing concerns about future security measures and whether the Boston Marathon will continue. Officials promise to build up the race even stronger next year, emphasizing their defiance against terrorism.

Overall, this news article provides updates on various aspects of the investigation into the Boston Marathon bombings, including evidence analysis, personal accounts from survivors and witnesses, details about possible devices used in the attack, victims' stories, calls for public assistance, and plans for future security measures.
