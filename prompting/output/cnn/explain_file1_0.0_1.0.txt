The news article discusses the arrest of a 25-year-old naturalized American born in Kosovo who was planning a terrorist attack in Tampa, Florida. The suspect, identified as Osmakac, had planned to carry out a car bombing followed by hostage-taking and the detonation of a suicide belt he intended to wear.

According to a criminal complaint made public on Monday, Osmakac expressed his desire to die "the Islamic way" and sought revenge for perceived wrongs done to Muslims. He recorded a martyrdom video message shortly before his arrest, expressing his intentions.

The investigation into Osmakac began in September when an informant informed the FBI that he had requested al Qaeda flags. By November, he was discussing potential targets for terror attacks in Tampa and seeking assistance from the informant in obtaining guns and explosives.

The government's source then introduced Osmakac to an undercover FBI employee. In December, during their meeting, Osmakac expressed his desire to acquire weapons such as AK-47-style machine guns, Uzi submachine guns, high capacity magazines, grenades, and an explosive belt. He even provided a $500 down payment for these weapons.

Osmakac outlined his plans during another meeting with the undercover FBI employee on New Year's Day. His intended targets included nightclubs in the Ybor City area of Tampa, the operations center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office also located there and a business in South Tampa. However, by Saturday night (the day of his arrest), it was revealed that his primary target had become an Irish bar located in south Tampa.

After carrying out the car bombing at one of these locations with large crowds present, Osmakac planned to retrieve additional weapons and explosives from a hotel room so that he could proceed with further attacks. He intended to use an explosive belt attached to himself while taking hostages and demanding prisoner releases from law enforcement agencies.

Fortunately, the explosives and firearms that Osmakac sought were rendered inoperable by law enforcement, posing no threat to the public. The FBI arrested him on Saturday night, just after he had recorded a video explaining his motives.

Law enforcement officials emphasized that there was no indication of Osmakac having any ties to al Qaeda or acting under their control or direction. They described him as "self-radicalized." The investigation was initiated based on information provided by a confidential human source within the local Muslim community.

The article highlights the significant role played by members of the Muslim community in assisting law enforcement throughout the investigation. Steve Ibison, who heads the FBI's Tampa office, expressed gratitude for their cooperation and stressed that this case should not be seen as representative of either Islam or the Muslim community as a whole.

In conclusion, this news article reports on an attempted terrorist attack planned by a 25-year-old naturalized American born in Kosovo named Osmakac. His intentions were discovered through an FBI investigation initiated based on information from a confidential source within the local Muslim community. Law enforcement agencies successfully thwarted his plans and arrested him before any harm could be done to innocent civilians.
