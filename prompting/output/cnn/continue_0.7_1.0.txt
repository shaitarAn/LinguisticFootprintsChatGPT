Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Kosovo, had been under surveillance by law enforcement since September 2021. The investigation began when members of the local Muslim community alerted authorities to Osmakac's suspicious activities and extremist ideologies.

According to O'Neill, the evidence gathered during the investigation revealed that Osmakac had expressed his desire to carry out a violent attack on American soil. He had meticulously planned his actions and intended to target multiple locations in Tampa, aiming to cause chaos and harm innocent civilians.

During the hearing, details emerged about Osmakac's plot. He had acquired an AK-47 rifle and believed it was functional. Additionally, he possessed what he believed were real explosives along with an explosive pack and a car bomb that he intended to utilize in his attack.

Law enforcement officials involved in the case emphasized that this arrest was a direct result of effective collaboration between the Muslim community and law enforcement agencies working together against extremism. This partnership highlighted the importance of trust-building efforts between communities and authorities in preventing potential acts of violence.

"Our mission is not only to protect our nation but also to work closely with communities," stated Special Agent Michael McPherson from the FBI Tampa Field Office during a press conference following the hearing. "We rely on information from community members who serve as our eyes and ears on the ground."

The case against Osmakac will now proceed through legal proceedings where evidence will be presented before a judge or jury for evaluation. If convicted of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, Osmakac faces severe penalties including life imprisonment.

Authorities reiterated their commitment to ensuring public safety while emphasizing that this arrest should not fuel Islamophobia or negative sentiments towards any particular community or religion.

"This individual does not represent any religion or group," stated Sheriff Chad Chronister from Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office during the press conference. "He represents himself â€“ an individual who sought to commit an act of terror."

The successful disruption of Osmakac's plot serves as a reminder of the importance of community engagement in countering extremism and preventing acts of violence. It also highlights the dedication and collaboration between law enforcement agencies and communities in safeguarding the nation against potential threats.
