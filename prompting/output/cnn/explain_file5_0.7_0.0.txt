This news article is about Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal considering a run for the presidency in 2016. Jindal stated that he is thinking and praying about whether or not to run, and he will not make a final decision until after the November midterm elections. He emphasized that his decision would not be based on polls or fundraising numbers but on whether he believes he can make a difference and has unique ideas and experiences to offer.

During an appearance at a breakfast event, Jindal unveiled an energy proposal from his nonprofit group, America Next. The plan supports an "all of the above" strategy for energy, with a focus on developing domestic oil and gas resources through methods like hydraulic fracturing. Jindal criticized the Obama administration for not moving forward with the Keystone XL pipeline and accused them of being science deniers when it comes to harnessing America's energy potential.

Jindal also addressed other topics, such as the Ebola outbreak in Africa and the fight against ISIS in the Middle East. He supported the administration's efforts to combat Ebola and called for Congress to back White House proposals to train and arm Syrian rebels. However, he criticized the administration for allowing the power of Islamic extremists to grow due to delays.

In addition, Jindal discussed popular issues among GOP primary voters, including the need for spending controls and concerns about religious liberty in the United States. He accused President Obama of ignoring the "war on religious liberty" in the country while speaking eloquently about the rights of Christians overseas. Jindal called Obama the worst American president since Jimmy Carter, stating that Carter was just incompetent but Obama is both radical and incompetent.
