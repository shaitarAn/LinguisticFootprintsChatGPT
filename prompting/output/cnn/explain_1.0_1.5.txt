This news article is about a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac who was planning to carry out a terrorist attack in Tampa, Florida. He intended to use explosives and weapons to cause chaos and harm. However, thanks to the combined efforts of the local Muslim community and law enforcement, his plot was foiled.

Osmakac believed he had an operable AK-47, real explosives, an explosive pack, and a car bomb that he planned to use against Americans. These intentions are considered criminal because they pose a serious threat to public safety.

The arrest came after Osmakac interacted with an undercover FBI employee who helped him acquire weapons and discussed potential terror targets in Tampa. He expressed a desire for revenge against perceived wrongs done by Muslims through martyrdom.

It is important to note that there is no evidence suggesting Osmakac had any ties or connections with al Qaeda or any other extremist group before his arrest. The investigation began when someone reported his request for al Qaeda flags which led law enforcement on his trail.

The authorities rendered the explosives and firearms inoperable beforehand so that they posed no actual threat once Osmakac attempted using them in the planned attacks targeting nightclubs, law enforcement centers, businesses, etc., focusing on places where large crowds would gather.

With assistance from members of the local Muslim community sharing information about Oskamac's radical ideology leading up to this crime alongside extensive work by law enforcement officials throughout this investigation eventually resulted in preventing significant bloodshed.

In short summary: A potential terrorist attack planned by Sami Osamkac intending destruction through violence has been successfully thwarted due largely (and commonly) recognized as eminent official vigilance matched with vital support from cooperating community members identifying anomalous behavior potentially dangerous involving immigrant European-born US citizens facing domestic grievances claimed religious motivations newly converted into murderous form-seeking acts yet absent direct international terror organization affiliation all increasingly common in the age of broad information availability disseminating globally.
