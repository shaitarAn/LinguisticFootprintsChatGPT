Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Kosovo, had been under investigation by the FBI for several months before his arrest. The investigation was sparked by tips from members of the local Muslim community who became concerned about Osmakac's radicalized beliefs and extremist rhetoric.

According to authorities, Osmakac had expressed his desire to carry out a large-scale attack in Tampa, targeting crowded locations such as nightclubs and bridges. He believed that by causing widespread chaos and destruction, he could strike fear into the hearts of Americans and further his extremist agenda.

However, thanks to the vigilance of the Muslim community and law enforcement's swift action, Osmakac's plans were thwarted. Undercover agents had been monitoring him for months, gathering evidence of his intent to carry out an act of terrorism.

During the hearing on Monday, prosecutors presented chilling details of Osmakac's preparations. They revealed that he had acquired weapons including an AK-47 rifle which he believed was functional but was actually rendered inoperable by law enforcement beforehand. He also possessed what he thought were explosives capable of causing significant damage.

O'Neill emphasized that although some may argue this was merely a case involving someone expressing their views or engaging in idle talk without real intent to harm others, this situation was different. The evidence clearly showed that Osmakac not only possessed dangerous weapons but also intended to use them against innocent civilians.

The U.S Attorney praised the cooperation between law enforcement agencies at both federal and local levels as well as the courageous actions taken by members of Tampa's Muslim community who came forward with crucial information leading to Osmakac's arrest.

"This case is an example of how important it is for communities and authorities to work together in combating extremism," said O'Neill during the press conference. "Our shared commitment to safety can prevent tragedies like these from occurring."

As investigations continue into any potential connections or influences that may have radicalized Osmakac, the focus remains on ensuring the safety and security of Tampa's residents. Law enforcement agencies will continue to collaborate with community leaders to promote understanding, tolerance, and resilience against extremist ideologies.
