Jindal went on to explain that he believes polls at this stage in the race are more reflective of name recognition than actual support. He pointed out that when he first ran for office, he faced similar polling numbers but was able to overcome them through hard work and connecting with voters.

"I'm not going to let a poll discourage me from running," Jindal stated firmly. "I know that I have a strong message and a proven track record of conservative leadership. I believe that once voters get to know me and my vision for the country, they will see why I am the best candidate for president."

Jindal emphasized his accomplishments as governor of Louisiana, highlighting his efforts in cutting taxes, reducing government spending, and improving education. He also touted his experience in dealing with natural disasters such as hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

"I've seen firsthand the resilience and strength of the American people," Jindal said. "I know what it takes to lead during challenging times, and I am confident that I can bring that same leadership to the White House."

While acknowledging the tough competition among potential Republican candidates, Jindal expressed confidence in his ability to stand out from the crowd.

"There are many talented individuals vying for this position," he admitted. "But I believe my conservative values, innovative ideas, and diverse background set me apart. The American people are looking for someone who can bring real change and provide solutions to our nation's problems. That's what I offer."

Jindal also addressed criticism from some within his own party who have questioned whether he is too moderate or lacks charisma compared to other contenders.

"I believe in staying true to my principles rather than pandering or trying to be something I'm not," Jindal asserted. "As for charisma, leadership is about more than just charm or personality; it's about having a clear vision and being willing to make tough decisions even when they may not be popular."

He went on to outline his conservative agenda, which includes repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, reducing the size of government, protecting religious liberties, and strengthening national security.

Jindal concluded his remarks by urging voters to look beyond poll numbers and focus on the substance of each candidate's message.

"Polls can be misleading and don't always capture the full story," he said. "I encourage voters to do their own research, attend campaign events, and listen to what each candidate has to say. I am confident that if they do so, they will see that I am a strong leader with a clear vision for America's future."

As Jindal left the breakfast event, he remained resolute in his determination to continue his campaign despite the challenging poll numbers. With a sense of optimism and conviction in his voice, he declared,

"I may be at zero percent today according to some polls, but I believe in this great country and its people. With hard work and perseverance, we can overcome any obstacle."
