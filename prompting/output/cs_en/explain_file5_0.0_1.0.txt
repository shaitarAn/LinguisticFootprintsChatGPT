This news article discusses the use of Big Data and its impact on personal privacy. It highlights how traditional methods of data collection, such as surveys conducted by city governments, are slow, expensive, and limited in comparison to the faster and cheaper data gathering enabled by Internet technologies.

However, while Big Data offers many benefits in terms of data analysis and insights, it also poses risks to personal privacy. These risks range from people knowing more about individuals than necessary to people making incorrect assumptions or inferences based on their data. The article suggests that these privacy concerns could be a significant barrier to the adoption of Big Data solutions.

The concept of a legal right to privacy is relatively recent in the United States. Privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the US Constitution, and whether it is implied is currently a matter of legal debate. In contrast, Europe takes a more comprehensive approach to privacy protection with explicit guarantees for respect of one's private life.

The article mentions various US laws governing specific sectors like health information, financial privacy, and information collection from children under 13. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) plays a crucial role in enforcing these laws through fines imposed on companies that violate privacy regulations.

Europe is revising its 1995 Data Protection Directive with provisions that require explicit consent for processing individuals' data and granting online users the "right to be forgotten." Offending companies can face fines up to 2 percent of their global turnover under this new regulation.

The landscape of data technology continues evolving rapidly with researchers developing camera-based systems for real-world advertisements and integrating systems with TV sets for audience analysis. Smartphones have become powerful devices capable of sensing various aspects like location, sound, light, motion while accessing personal information like contact lists or browsing history.

Companies' approach towards protecting user data depends on their industry-specific value proposition and revenue generation models. Financial firms prioritize data protection due to its importance for their business model but may restrict innovation as a result. Younger industries like social networks encourage users to share more information to enhance their network, potentially compromising privacy.

Consumers are becoming more aware of data collection and usage issues, with many uninstalling or refusing to install apps due to privacy concerns. However, few people actually read the lengthy and complex privacy policies before using apps.

The article mentions a research group that combines Big Data techniques with crowdsourcing to examine privacy issues with smartphone apps. They found that people often did not know what data their apps were collecting and were most uncomfortable when the use of their data was unexpected. Explaining the purpose of data in a concise manner helped reduce user concerns.

To protect personal privacy, individuals can be more selective in what they share online and periodically delete web browser cookies. There are also business opportunities in helping consumers manage their privacy online and on smartphones.

However, the challenge lies in protecting personal data collected by sensors in the physical world, such as wearable devices for health monitoring or smart cars tracking trajectory. The article suggests that better privacy laws will be necessary for adequate protection of personal data as more companies organize, collate, and sell this kind of information.

In summary, this news article discusses how Big Data enables faster and cheaper data gathering but also poses risks to personal privacy. It compares the approaches towards privacy protection in the US and Europe while highlighting specific laws governing different sectors in the US. The article emphasizes consumers' growing awareness of data collection issues and suggests measures individuals can take to protect their privacy. It concludes by mentioning challenges posed by data collection through physical sensors and advocates for better privacy laws as a solution.
