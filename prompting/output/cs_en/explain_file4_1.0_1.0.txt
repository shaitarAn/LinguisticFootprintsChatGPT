The news article discusses various aspects of data centers and their operations. It highlights the need for cooling and security in data centers, as well as the importance of diversity in connections to utility companies. The article also mentions the use of backup power supplies, such as batteries and diesel generators, to ensure uninterrupted operations.

The concept of having multiple data centers distributed around the world is introduced, with examples like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon having many centers instead of a single large one. This approach allows for better reliability and redundancy in case one center experiences problems or natural disasters.

The article also delves into energy efficiency in data centers, specifically focusing on a metric called Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE). PUE measures the ratio of total energy consumed by a data center's support functions (cooling and electricity distribution) compared to that consumed by IT equipment alone. Leading-edge data centers are running at PUEs of 1.2 or 1.25, indicating significant advances in reducing electrical overhead over the years.

Additionally, there is mention of efforts by companies to seek cleaner and renewable energy sources for operating their data centers. Different factors are considered when choosing locations for new data center deployments; these include customer base, internet connectivity, and electricity cost.

Regarding future possibilities for data center deployment, alternative ideas such as placing computers individually in people's closets are mentioned but viewed skeptically by some experts.

In conclusion, this news article provides insights into various aspects related to data centers including cooling requirements, security measures against intrusion both online and physically. It also covers topics like backup power supplies for uninterrupted operation during outages or natural disasters. Furthermore it touches on improvements made regarding energy efficiency measured using PUE ratios. The discussion regarding future possibilities explores ideas such as distributed computing systems or using individual computers at users' premises.
