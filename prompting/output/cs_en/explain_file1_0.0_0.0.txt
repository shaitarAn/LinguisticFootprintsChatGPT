This news article discusses a study that focuses on Asian family businesses and their role in the region's economy. The study reveals that the market capitalization of Asian family businesses has increased significantly between 2000 and 2010, reflecting their growth-oriented approach and the development of the Asian capital market.

One key finding is that Asian family businesses are more prevalent in traditional sectors such as Financials, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Consumer Staples. This is because family-controlled management tends to be conservative in innovation and investment in high-risk new businesses. However, South Korea, Taiwan, and India have a higher concentration of technology-related family businesses due to their technology-driven industrial structure.

The study also highlights that Asian family businesses have limited exposure to capital-intensive sectors such as energy, telecom services, and utilities. This is mainly due to the lack of access for family businesses to gain control over these highly regulated and state monopolized industries. Additionally, family firms tend to be more risk-averse in their investment strategies, which contributes to their cautious approach in considering opportunities in these sectors.

The analysis reveals that family businesses represent about 50 percent of all listed companies in the study universe, making them a significant backbone of the Asian economies. South Asia has a higher concentration of family businesses compared to North Asia, with India being home to the largest number of family businesses. However, as a percentage of the total labor force, family businesses contribute only a small portion, indicating that the majority of employment in Asia is accounted for by the public sector, unlisted firms, and self-employment.

In Singapore, family businesses play a prominent role in the domestic economy and capital market. They account for a majority of listed companies, total market capitalization, and total corporate hirings. However, historically, non-family businesses have been larger contributors to total fixed asset investments in Singapore. In 2009, investment outlays by family businesses surged due to investments in integrated resorts.

The funding behavior of family businesses differs from non-family businesses, with family businesses relying more on bank lending rather than issuing bonds. In South Asia, the share of family businesses' bond issuances has been rising, while in North Asia, family businesses have stagnated in this area due to abundant liquidity. Credit ratings also differ between family businesses and non-family businesses, with family businesses in North Asia having lower ratings compared to their non-family counterparts.

Asian family businesses share common characteristics with their western peers, as they act as committed stakeholders with long-term investment horizons. They prioritize long-term financial management and well-being over short-term share price performance. This long-term commitment allows them to implement investment strategies that maximize long-term firm value, including investments in brand building, research and development, and human capital development.

Despite facing challenges such as the internet bubble crisis in 2002-2003 and the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, Asian family businesses have performed well. The study shows that their total return during 2000-2010 was higher than the local benchmarks in seven out of the ten Asian markets analyzed. This outperformance is driven by above-market average earnings growth and profitability, indicating the family businesses' capability to create shareholder value.

In conclusion, the study highlights the significant role of Asian family businesses in the region's economy. They have experienced substantial growth, particularly in traditional sectors, and have outperformed local benchmarks in terms of total return. Their long-term commitment and strategic investment decisions contribute to their success and value creation.
