This news article discusses three possible scenarios for the future of the European Monetary Union (EMU).

The first scenario, labeled "Volatility 3," suggests that the crisis in the EMU could worsen to the point of a potential break-up. In this scenario, joint fiscal policies would be implemented, including automatic transfers from stronger to weaker regions, joint guarantees for member governments' bonds, and central supervision of budgetary policies. The EMU would also need to adhere strictly to the Maastricht deficit and debt rules to ensure stability and growth. Financial markets would likely respond positively to these measures, with a decrease in volatility and an increase in risk appetite. This scenario would result in a rally in all risky assets, such as stocks and bonds, with interest rates remaining unchanged. German, Swiss, and US government bond yields would increase, while yields for countries like Italy and Spain would decline. The US dollar and Swiss franc would depreciate, while the euro would appreciate.

The second scenario, known as "Muddling through," describes a controlled Greek debt restructuring and a slow recovery of confidence in the EMU. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would undergo changes and fiscal consolidation plans would be implemented in highly indebted countries. The European Central Bank (ECB) would provide continued support through liquidity provision and possibly interest rate cuts. Although the EMU's growth would slow due to tighter fiscal policies, a recession could be avoided thanks to easier monetary policies and strong emerging market economic growth. In this scenario, market volatility would gradually decrease, but periodic spikes could occur. While government bond yields for countries like Germany and Italy would remain low, credit spreads would persistently be elevated. US and emerging market stocks would outperform, while bank stocks would underperform until re-capitalizations are implemented. Currencies would generally remain within a specific trading range, and cyclical commodities would yield low returns.

The third and least desirable scenario involves a major crisis, potentially triggered by the exit of a country from the EMU, such as Greece. This scenario would lead to a collapse of trust in Europe, a credit crunch, and a global recession. Weaker Eurozone countries would default, and deposit freezes might occur to prevent bank runs. The "risk-off" scenario would cause a surge in market volatility, European stocks to decline significantly, and government bond yields to rally. Credit spreads would widen, liquidity stress and counterparty risk would increase, and implementing derivatives and structured strategies would become difficult. The Swiss franc, US dollar, and Japanese yen would strengthen, while the euro would depreciate until its membership in the EMU is clarified. Cyclical commodities would experience a sharp decline.

The article concludes that the most favorable scenario, a full fiscal union and the introduction of a Eurobond market, is unlikely to occur. The least desirable scenario, a major global crisis, is also unlikely. The reality is likely to fall somewhere in between these two extremes, with the EMU navigating its way through its debt and currency challenges.

In summary, the article explores three possible scenarios for the future of the European Monetary Union, highlighting the potential impact on financial markets, currencies, and commodities.
