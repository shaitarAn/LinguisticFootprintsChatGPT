This news article discusses the issue of food waste in Switzerland and introduces a new packaging system developed by a start-up company called innveri. The article highlights that a significant amount of food, worth approximately four billion Swiss francs, ends up in domestic waste each year in Switzerland. Additionally, more than 50% of household garbage consists of food packaging that is often used for decorative or advertising purposes.

In response to this problem, innveri has created a new packaging system that aims to protect food from germs and bacteria while also maintaining its visual appeal and quality. This innovative packaging system allows food to have an extended shelf life compared to conventional preservation methods. As a result, the food is more likely to be consumed rather than thrown away, contributing to waste reduction.

What sets innveri's packaging system apart is its accessibility for households and its sustainability features. The active packaging technology used was previously only available in the industry but can now be easily used by consumers at home. Furthermore, this solution does not generate any additional waste or require electricity consumption.

The article emphasizes that innveri's product concept focuses on providing customers with familiar elements and an easy-to-use system solution rather than just an individual product. The founder of innveri, Manfred Jüni, drew inspiration for this idea during his university years when he frequently consumed pre-packaged meals and wondered if it would be possible to reseal opened packages or package fresh/cooked foods attractively.

After six years of development, innveri now has its headquarters in Murten on the Roland bakery site. The company employs four people and shares office space with MJ2B Architekten AG owned by Manfred Jüni's brother.

Throughout their journey, innveri received support from various organizations such as the Institute for Value-based Enterprise (IVE) in Fribourg and Noventa AG based in Diepoldsau - their main production partner. However, the founder highlights the challenges faced in terms of funding and the need for increased government support for early-stage firms to promote entrepreneurship and job creation.

In addition to their packaging system, innveri is also involved in a pilot project with the city of Berne aimed at reducing disposable packaging used in takeaways. The long-term objective is to address litter problems and waste mountains across urban areas in Switzerland.

Overall, this news article introduces innveri's innovative packaging system as a solution to reduce food waste by extending shelf life and providing sustainable packaging options. It highlights the company's journey, challenges faced, and their involvement in initiatives beyond just product development.
