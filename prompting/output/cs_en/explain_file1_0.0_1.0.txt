This news article discusses a study that focuses on Asian family businesses and their impact on the region's economies. The study reveals that Asian family businesses have experienced significant growth in market capitalization between 2000 and 2010, largely due to their early stage of development and the less-developed capital markets in Asia compared to Europe and the USA.

The study finds that Asian family businesses are more prevalent in traditional sectors such as Financials (banks and real estate), Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Consumer Staples. This is because family-controlled management tends to be conservative when it comes to innovation and investment in high-risk new businesses. However, countries like South Korea, Taiwan, and India have a higher concentration of technology-related family businesses due to their technology-driven industrial structures.

The analysis also highlights that Asian family businesses have limited exposure to capital-intensive industries such as energy, telecom services, and utilities. This is mainly because these industries are highly regulated or state monopolized, making it difficult for family businesses to gain control over them. Additionally, the risk-averse investment strategy of family firms contributes to their cautious approach towards investing in these sectors.

Family businesses play a significant role in the Asian economies as they represent about 50 percent of all listed companies included in the study. South Asia has a higher concentration of family businesses compared to North Asia. India has the largest number of family businesses reviewed in the study while China has the lowest percentage due to its state-owned economic structure.

In terms of employment, family businesses account for a substantial portion of hired employees by listed companies but contribute only a small percentage compared to the total labor force. This reflects that most employment opportunities in Asia come from public sector jobs or unlisted firms.

Singapore stands out as having a prominent role for family businesses within its domestic economy and capital market. Family business ownership accounts for 63 percent of listed companies in Singapore with their total market capitalization representing 54 percent of the market total and 140 percent of nominal GDP.

The study also compares the funding behavior of family businesses and non-family businesses. It finds that family businesses rely more on bank lending rather than issuing bonds to finance their activities. However, in South Asia, the share of family businesses issuing bonds has been increasing significantly in recent years.

Asian family businesses share common characteristics with their western counterparts, as they prioritize long-term investment horizons over short-term earnings boosts. Family ownership provides stability and continuity in business ownership and management structure, allowing for long-term investment strategies that maximize firm value.

Despite facing challenges such as bear markets during the internet bubble crisis in 2002-2003 and the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, Asian family businesses have performed well. The study shows that total return for Asian family businesses was a cumulative 261 percent between 2000 and 2010, outperforming local benchmarks in seven out of ten Asian markets.

In conclusion, this study highlights the growth and significance of Asian family businesses in the region's economies. It emphasizes their prevalence in traditional sectors, limited exposure to capital-intensive industries, funding behavior differences compared to non-family businesses, and their long-term investment focus. Despite challenges faced over the past decade, Asian family businesses have demonstrated strong performance relative to local benchmarks.
