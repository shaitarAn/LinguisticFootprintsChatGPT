This news article discusses a study that focuses on Asian family businesses and their role in the region's economy. The study reveals several key findings about these businesses, including their market capitalization, sector distribution, regional concentration, employment contribution, funding behavior, and performance.

According to the study, Asian family businesses with a market capitalization of over 50 million US dollars were mostly listed after 2000. This is attributed to the early stage of their lifecycles and the less-developed capital markets in Asia compared to Europe and the USA. Many family businesses in Asia are first-generation businesses, which contributes to a growth bias among them.

The total market capitalization of Asian family businesses increased approximately six-fold between 2000 and 2010. This growth can be attributed to their entrepreneurial drive to seek growth opportunities through fundraising in the capital markets. Additionally, the rapid development of Asian capital markets since the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98 has facilitated this growth.

The study finds that Asian family businesses are more prevalent in traditional sectors such as Financials (banks and real estate), Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Consumer Staples. Family-controlled management tends to be conservative when it comes to innovation and investment in high-risk new ventures. However, South Korea, Taiwan, and India have a higher concentration of technology-related family businesses due to their technology-driven industrial structures.

Asian family businesses have limited exposure to energy-intensive sectors like telecom services and utilities due to restricted access for gaining control over highly regulated industries dominated by state monopolies. Their risk-averse investment strategy also plays a role in avoiding investments in these sectors.

Family businesses represent about 50 percent of all listed companies studied across Asia. South Asia has a higher concentration of family-owned companies at 65 percent compared to North Asia at 37 percent. India has the largest number of family-owned companies reviewed (67 percent), while Chinese family-owned companies account for the lowest percentage (13 percent) due to the country's state-owned economic structure.

As employers, family businesses account for 57 percent and 32 percent of all employees hired by listed companies in South Asia and North Asia, respectively. However, as a percentage of the total labor force, their contribution is relatively small due to the dominance of public sector employment, unlisted firms, and self-employment.

Family businesses are heavily concentrated in the Consumer Discretionary sector when it comes to employment. They account for 64.6 percent of employees in that sector, followed by the Financial sector at 32 percent and the Industrial sector at 30.7 percent.

The study highlights Singapore as a prominent hub for family businesses in terms of their presence in the domestic economy and capital market. Family businesses represent 63 percent of listed companies in Singapore with a total market capitalization accounting for 54 percent of the market total and 140 percent of nominal GDP.

In terms of funding behavior, family businesses across Asia rely more on bank lending than issuing bonds compared to non-family businesses. However, there has been an increasing trend among South Asian family businesses to issue bonds since 2006. In North Asia, family business bond issuances have stagnated due to abundant liquidity available to them.

Asian family businesses share common characteristics with their western counterparts as committed stakeholders with long-term investment horizons rather than focusing on short-term earnings boosts. Their long-term commitment translates into well-considered business strategies that prioritize long-term financial management over short-term share price performance.

Despite facing two severe bear markets during the internet bubble crisis (2002-2003) and global financial crisis (2008-2009), Asian family businesses achieved a cumulative total return rate of 261% between 2000 and 2010 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.7%. They outperformed local benchmarks in seven out of ten Asian markets, with China, Malaysia, Singapore, and South Korea achieving the strongest relative outperformance.

Throughout the last decade, Asian family businesses also delivered a higher average dividend yield spread compared to the market average. This indicates their capability to create shareholder value and contributes to firm valuation.

In conclusion, this study sheds light on the significant role of Asian family businesses in the region's economy. Despite facing challenges such as limited access to certain sectors and less-developed capital markets, these businesses have shown resilience and strong performance over time. Their long-term commitment and strategic decision-making contribute to their success in creating shareholder value.
