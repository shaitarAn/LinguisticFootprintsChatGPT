in the study had equity market histories of less than 10 years, while only 12 percent had histories of more than 30 years.

Despite their shorter equity market histories, the study also revealed that Asian family businesses have outperformed various market indices. The research focused on three different time periods - one year, five years, and ten years - and compared the performance of Asian family businesses with that of key regional and global indices.

In terms of one-year returns, Asian family businesses achieved an average return of 10.6 percent, significantly outperforming both regional and global indices. The MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index returned just 2.9 percent during the same period, while the MSCI World Index recorded a negative return of -3.1 percent.

The outperformance continued over a five-year time horizon as well. Asian family businesses generated an average annual return of 11.5 percent compared to the MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index which returned only 4 percent annually over the same period. Similarly, on a global scale, Asian family businesses yielded higher returns in contrast to the negative annual returns (-0.1 percent) produced by the MSCI World Index.

Over ten years, Asian family businesses maintained their strong performance trend with an annualized return of 7.8 percent. This once again surpassed both regional (3 percent) and global (5 percent) indices' returns during this time frame.

These findings indicate that despite their relatively shorter presence in equity markets compared to their Western counterparts, Asian family businesses are adept at creating value for their shareholders even in tumultuous economic times.

A key driver behind this consistent outperformance is believed to be due to characteristics unique to family-run enterprises such as long-term vision and commitment towards sustainability rather than focusing solely on short-term gains.

Furthermore, many successful Asian family firms operate within industries where they possess deep domain expertise or hold influential positions within local economies due to their long-standing presence. This provides them with a competitive advantage which allows them to navigate through challenging market conditions more effectively than their competitors.

Additionally, the ability of Asian family businesses to quickly adapt and respond to changing business landscapes is another contributing factor to their success. Their hierarchical decision-making structures help in faster implementation of strategic changes compared to larger corporations burdened by complex organizational structures.

It should be noted that the research study did not delve into the reasons behind the outperformance, but rather focused on highlighting its existence. Future studies could explore the specific strategies and practices adopted by Asian family businesses that contribute to their superior performance.

In conclusion, Asian family businesses have proven themselves as resilient and profitable players in regional and global markets. Despite being relatively underresearched, these businesses have consistently outperformed market indices in terms of returns over one-year, five-year, and ten-year periods. With their unique characteristics such as long-term vision, industry expertise, adaptability, and quick decision-making processes; it is no wonder that they continue to thrive and deliver value for their shareholders in an ever-evolving business landscape.
