This news article discusses three possible scenarios for the future of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and their potential impact on financial markets.

The first scenario, referred to as a "break-up of EMU," describes a worsening crisis that could potentially lead to the dissolution of the monetary union. In this scenario, joint fiscal policies would be implemented, including automatic transfers from stronger regions to weaker ones. There would also be joint guarantees for bonds issued by member governments, with up to 60 percent of GDP being guaranteed initially. Budgetary policies would be centrally supervised and strict enforcement of deficit and debt rules would be in place. This scenario is seen as positive for financial markets and risky assets, leading to a decrease in volatility and an increase in risk appetite. It is expected that there would be a rally in stocks and credits, with narrowing spreads on corporate bonds as well as emerging market and high yield bonds.

The second scenario described is called "muddling through." This scenario involves controlled Greek debt restructuring in stages, along with a slow recovery of confidence over time. Changes to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would be approved during autumn, fiscal consolidation plans implemented in high-debt countries, and potential international participation added to EFSF at a later stage. The European Central Bank (ECB) would provide continued support through liquidity provisions and modest purchases of sovereign peripheral bonds while possibly cutting interest rates. In this scenario, market volatility gradually decreases but periodic spikes may occur due to bad news. Liquidity and counterparty risks decline over time.

The third scenario discussed is considered the least desirable outcome: a major crisis resulting from one country or even Germany exiting EMU. This situation could lead to an acute collapse of trust in Europe causing credit crunches globally. Weaker Eurozone countries may default on their debts while deposit freezes are imposed by banks trying to avoid runs similar to what happened in Argentina years ago. The introduction of a "new D-Mark" would cause it to appreciate sharply, while the remaining euro would depreciate significantly. Central banks, including the ECB, would need to provide massive liquidity support. This scenario is considered unfavorable for risky assets and could lead to increased market volatility, falling European stocks, widening credit spreads, and liquidity stress.

The article concludes by stating that the reality is likely to be somewhere between these extreme scenarios. It suggests that a full fiscal union and the introduction of a Eurobond market (Scenario 1) is the most favorable but unlikely outcome. On the other hand, Scenario 3, which could lead to a major global crisis, is also relatively unlikely. The expectation is that Europe will muddle through its debt and currency challenges.

Overall, this article provides an analysis of different scenarios for the future of EMU and their potential impact on financial markets. It highlights the importance of joint fiscal policies and central supervision in addressing the crisis while acknowledging that there are risks involved in each scenario.
