This news article discusses the benefits and risks of using Big Data approaches to gather and analyze large quantities of data. It highlights how traditional methods of data collection can be slow, expensive, and limited, while Big Data technologies make it faster, cheaper, and easier to gather and analyze data. However, it also warns about the potential risks to personal privacy that come with the use of Big Data.

The article notes that Big Data can lead to privacy concerns, ranging from minor annoyances, such as people knowing more about you than necessary, to more harmful consequences, like people drawing incorrect conclusions about you based on your data. It suggests that privacy issues could be a significant barrier to the adoption of Big Data solutions in the long run.

The article further explains that the concept of a legal right to privacy is relatively recent in the United States. While privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the US Constitution, there are sector-specific laws governing privacy, such as the Privacy Act of 1974. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is responsible for enforcing these laws and has fined companies that violated privacy regulations, such as Path and Google.

In contrast, Europe takes a more comprehensive approach to privacy protection. The 1950 European Convention on Human Rights explicitly guarantees respect for one's private and family life. The European Union requires its member states to ensure citizens' right to privacy, and the EU is currently revising its Data Protection Directive to create a single law for all member states.

The article mentions that the data technology landscape is rapidly evolving, with researchers developing systems that can collect data from various sources, such as custom camera-based systems in advertisements and integrated systems with TV sets. Additionally, smartphones can collect a wide range of data, including location, sound, browsing history, and more.

The article discusses how companies' attitudes towards privacy vary depending on the industry and their business models. Financial firms place a high priority on data protection, while younger industries, like social networks, encourage users to share more information to enhance their networks. Companies that rely on advertising revenue have a strong incentive to collect as much data as possible to target ads effectively, which can conflict with privacy concerns.

Consumers are becoming more aware of privacy issues, as shown by a survey that found 57% of mobile app users have uninstalled or refused to install apps due to privacy concerns. However, it is also noted that very few people read privacy policies before installing apps due to their length and complexity.

The article mentions a research group that combines Big Data techniques with crowdsourcing to examine privacy issues with smartphone apps. Their findings show that people often do not know what data their apps are collecting and are least comfortable when the use of their data is unexpected. It suggests that providing users with easily understandable explanations of data collection purposes can help alleviate privacy concerns.

The article concludes by suggesting that individuals can be more selective about what they share online and periodically delete web browser cookies to protect their privacy. It also mentions potential business opportunities in helping consumers manage their privacy, both online and with smartphones. However, it warns about the challenge of data collection in the physical world through sensors, such as wearable devices, smart cars, and aerial drones, and emphasizes the need for better privacy laws to protect personal data in such scenarios.
