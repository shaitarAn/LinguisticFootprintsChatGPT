This news article discusses three possible scenarios for the future of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and their potential impact on financial markets. The article refers to these scenarios as "volatility 1," "muddling through," and "worsening crisis."

In "volatility 1," the EMU would implement joint fiscal policies, such as automatic transfers from strong to weak regions, joint guarantees for member governments' bonds, and central supervision of budgetary policies. This scenario is considered positive for financial markets and risky assets. It is expected to result in a decrease in volatility, an increase in risk appetite, and a rally in stocks and credits. The euro would appreciate while the US dollar and Swiss franc would depreciate.

In the "muddling through" scenario, there would be controlled Greek debt restructuring over several stages. Confidence would slowly recover with setbacks occurring over an extended period due to unresolved underlying debt problems. This scenario involves changes approved for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), fiscal consolidation plans implemented by high-debt countries, bank sector re-capitalizations where needed, continued support from the European Central Bank (ECB), and potentially lower interest rates. While market volatility gradually decreases in this scenario with periodic spikes on bad news, credit spreads remain elevated.

The third scenario is described as a "worsening crisis" that could potentially lead to a break-up of EMU. In this case, there could be a significant increase in risk aversion as bank stocks come under pressure due to Greek debt restructuring beyond current levels. Bank sector re-capitalizations may become necessary with potential participation from foreign entities. Liquidity stress increases along with counterparty risks due to pricing-in of bank collapses. Market volatility intensifies while credit spreads widen sharply because of rising default risks.

The article highlights that these scenarios are not static or fixed but may change over time based on sequential developments within Europe's debt and currency challenges. It acknowledges that the most favorable scenario, a full fiscal union with the introduction of a Eurobond market, is unlikely. The least desirable outcome, which could lead to a major global crisis, is also considered relatively unlikely. The reality is expected to lie somewhere between these two extreme outcomes.

Overall, this article provides a description of potential scenarios for the future of EMU and their implications for financial markets. It highlights the importance of ongoing developments and emphasizes that the eventual outcome will likely entail some level of uncertainty and volatility in the coming weeks and months.
