This news article highlights the growth and characteristics of Asian family businesses. The study focuses on family businesses with a market capitalization of over 50 million US dollars, which were listed after the year 2000.

One key reason for the significant number of relatively young Asian family businesses is the less-developed capital markets in the region compared to Europe and the USA. In Asia, many family businesses are first-generation, while in Europe and the US, there are many that have been passed down through multiple generations. This early stage of development often results in a growth-oriented mindset among Asian family businesses.

The total market capitalization of Asian family businesses grew around six times between 2000 and 2010. This can be attributed to their entrepreneurial drive to seek growth opportunities by raising funds through capital markets, as well as the rapid development of Asia's capital market since the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98.

The study finds that Asian family businesses are more prevalent in traditional sectors such as financials (banks and real estate), industrials, consumer discretionary, and consumer staples. Family-controlled management tends to be conservative when it comes to innovation and investing in high-risk ventures. However, countries like South Korea, Taiwan, and India have higher concentrations of technology-related family businesses due to their technology-driven industrial structures.

Asian family businesses have limited exposure to energy-intensive sectors like telecom services and utilities due to restricted access or control over highly-regulated state monopolies. Additionally, their risk-averse investment strategies contribute to their cautious approach towards these industries that require significant investment.

Family businesses represent about 50 percent of all listed companies studied here but account for only a small percentage of employment when compared with public sector jobs or self-employment opportunities. They tend to focus heavily on hiring within sectors like consumer discretionary (64.6 percent), followed by financials (32 percent) and industrials (30.7 percent).

In Singapore specifically, family businesses play a significant role in the domestic economy and capital markets. They account for 63 percent of listed companies and their total market capitalization represents 54 percent of the market total and 140 percent of nominal GDP. Family businesses also contribute to job creation, with 61 percent of total corporate hirings occurring within industrial sectors.

Funding behavior differs between family businesses and non-family businesses across Asia. Family businesses rely more on bank lending rather than issuing bonds for financing, with South Asian family businesses increasing their share of bond issuances from 19 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2011. Non-family businesses tend to have higher credit ratings than family businesses in North Asia.

Asian family businesses demonstrate long-term commitment and investment horizons, rather than focusing solely on short-term profitability. They prioritize creating long-term firm value over short-term results by considering strategies that ensure financial management, stability, continuity, brand building, research and development, and human capital development.

Despite two severe bear markets (dot-com bubble crisis in 2002-2003 and the global financial crisis in 2008-2009), Asian family businesses achieved a cumulative return of 261 percent during the period from 2000 to 2010 at a compound annual growth rate of about13.7 percent. Family firms outperformed local benchmarks in seven out of ten Asian markets due to above-average earnings growth and profitability.

Throughout the last decade (excluding the internet bubble crisis), Asian family firms consistently delivered higher average dividend yields compared to the market average.

In conclusion, this study highlights the growth potential and characteristics of Asian family businesses. Their early-stage development leads to a growth-focused mindset while operating primarily within traditional sectors due to conservative management styles. Despite challenges faced by highly regulated industries or limited access to funding sources like bonds issuance, these firms still play a vital role in Asia's economies by contributing significantly through capitalization as well as job creation and long-term value creation.
