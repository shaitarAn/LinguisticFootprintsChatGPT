This news article discusses a study that focuses on family businesses in Asia and their role in the region's economies. It highlights the growth and characteristics of Asian family businesses, their sector distribution, regional concentration, and funding behavior.

The study states that the market capitalization of Asian family businesses listed in the study has increased six-fold between 2000 and 2010. This growth can be attributed to the entrepreneurial drive of early-stage family businesses, seeking growth opportunities through fundraising in the capital markets. It also highlights the rapid development of the Asian capital market since the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98.

Asian family businesses are found to be more prevalent in traditional sectors such as Financials (banks and real estate), Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Consumer Staples. This is because family-controlled management tends to be more conservative in terms of innovation and investment in high-risk new businesses. Only South Korea, Taiwan, and India have a higher concentration of technology-related family businesses due to their technology-driven industrial structure.

The article also mentions that Asian family businesses have limited exposure to capital-intensive sectors like energy, telecom services, and utilities. This is mainly because they face challenges in gaining control over highly regulated and state monopolized industries. Additionally, family firms tend to be more risk-averse in these capital-intensive industries.

Family businesses represent about 50% of all listed companies in the study. South Asia has a higher concentration of family businesses compared to North Asia. India has the largest number of family businesses, while China has the lowest percentage due to its state-owned economic structure. However, as a percentage of the total labor force, family businesses only contribute a small percentage, reflecting the dominance of the public sector, unlisted firms, and self-employment in Asian employment.

When it comes to the market in Singapore, family businesses play a prominent role. They account for a significant portion of listed companies, total market capitalization, and total corporate hirings. The article states that historically, non-family businesses have been larger contributors to fixed asset investments in Singapore. However, in 2009, investment outlays by family businesses surged, primarily due to investments in the two integrated resorts.

The funding behavior of family businesses differs from non-family businesses in Asia. Family businesses rely more on bank lending to finance their activities and are generally less able or willing to issue bonds. However, there has been an increasing trend of family businesses in South Asia issuing bonds in recent years.

The article highlights that Asian family businesses share common characteristics with their western peers. They tend to have a long-term investment horizon and focus on the firm's long-term financial management and well-being rather than short-term share price performance. This approach allows them to implement long-term investment strategies that maximize firm value.

In terms of performance, Asian family businesses have outperformed their local benchmarks in seven out of the ten Asian markets. This is attributed to their above-market average earnings growth and profitability. Throughout the last decade, Asian family businesses have also delivered a higher average dividend yield spread compared to the market average.

Overall, the study emphasizes the significant role that family businesses play in the Asian economies, their growth potential, and their unique characteristics compared to non-family businesses in the region.
