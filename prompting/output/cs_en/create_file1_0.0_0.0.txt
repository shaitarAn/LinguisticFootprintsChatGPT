Title: Asian Family Businesses: A Driving Force in the Global Economy

Introduction:
Despite their significant contributions to local economies, Asian family businesses have long been overlooked in research due to a lack of official and systematic data. However, a groundbreaking study conducted by the Credit Suisse Emerging Market Research Institute has shed light on the remarkable performance of these businesses, revealing their potential as key players in the global market. This article explores the findings of the study and highlights the unique characteristics that have propelled Asian family businesses to outperform market indices.

The Rise of Asian Family Businesses:
Asian family businesses have played a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape of the region for centuries. However, their achievements have often gone unnoticed, overshadowed by the dominance of multinational corporations. The Credit Suisse study, which aimed to bridge this knowledge gap, analyzed the financial performance of over 3,600 family businesses across Asia.

Key Findings:
One of the most striking findings of the study is the relatively short equity market history of Asian family businesses compared to their European and American counterparts. Out of the 3,600 family businesses analyzed, 38 percent, or 1,371, had a history of less than two decades in the equity market. This suggests that Asian family businesses have achieved remarkable success in a relatively short span of time.

Outperforming Market Indices:
The study revealed that Asian family businesses consistently outperformed market indices, defying conventional wisdom. Over a five-year period, these businesses achieved an average annual return of 12.7 percent, surpassing the MSCI Asia Pacific Index by a significant margin. This exceptional performance can be attributed to several factors unique to Asian family businesses.

Long-Term Vision and Stability:
Asian family businesses are known for their long-term vision and stability, which sets them apart from their non-family counterparts. By focusing on sustainable growth rather than short-term gains, these businesses have been able to weather economic downturns and emerge stronger. Their commitment to preserving family legacies and values has allowed them to build enduring relationships with customers, suppliers, and employees.

Adaptability and Innovation:
Another key factor contributing to the success of Asian family businesses is their ability to adapt to changing market dynamics and embrace innovation. Unlike large corporations burdened by bureaucracy, family businesses can swiftly respond to emerging trends and capitalize on new opportunities. This agility has enabled them to stay ahead of the curve and maintain a competitive edge.

Strong Corporate Governance:
Contrary to popular belief, Asian family businesses have demonstrated a strong commitment to corporate governance. The study found that 80 percent of these businesses had established formal governance structures, ensuring transparency and accountability. By implementing best practices and professionalizing their operations, Asian family businesses have gained the trust of investors and stakeholders, further fueling their growth.

Conclusion:
The Credit Suisse study has unveiled the hidden potential of Asian family businesses, showcasing their remarkable financial performance and resilience. As these businesses continue to evolve and expand, they are poised to become major players in the global economy. Recognizing their unique strengths and contributions is crucial for policymakers, investors, and the wider business community. By supporting and nurturing Asian family businesses, we can unlock their full potential and drive sustainable economic growth in the region and beyond.
