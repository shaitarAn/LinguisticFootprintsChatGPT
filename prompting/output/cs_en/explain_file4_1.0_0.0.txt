The article discusses various aspects of data centers, specifically focusing on their cooling, power demand, backup systems, energy efficiency, and location. 

Data centers are large facilities that house a significant number of servers and other computing equipment. These centers are responsible for storing and processing vast amounts of data, which requires a massive amount of power and generates a significant amount of heat. Therefore, it is crucial to cool data centers effectively to prevent overheating and damage to the equipment inside. The article mentions that these centers are often located in areas with inexpensive electricity and surplus power.

To ensure the security and uninterrupted operation of data centers, both from physical and virtual threats, measures are taken to protect them from intrusions. This includes securing the facility from physical attacks, such as someone driving through the front door, as well as protecting it from cyber attacks over the internet.

Data centers also have backup power supplies in case of power outages. These backup systems typically involve rooms filled with batteries that can provide power for a few minutes before shutting down. Additionally, diesel generators are often utilized to support the facility for a few hours during power restoration. The article emphasizes the importance of diversifying the connection to utility companies to avoid complete data center failure in the event of a power line being cut, for example.

The energy efficiency of data centers is a significant concern due to the high power demands. PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) is a measure used to compare the total energy consumed by a data center to the energy consumed solely by the IT equipment. The article notes that leading-edge data centers typically have PUEs of 1.2 or 1.25, meaning the electrical overhead is only 25% above the energy consumed by the IT equipment. This marks a significant improvement compared to five years ago when PUEs were around 4 or 5, signifying a 400% energy overhead.

The article also mentions the importance of reducing the footprint of servers themselves to further improve efficiency. It argues that servers should be designed to consume very little power when not actively in use, similar to mobile phones and laptop computers that can go into low-power states when idle. The article brings attention to the fact that data centers are constantly running even when not fully utilized, with only around 30% of their capacity being used at any given time.

When it comes to choosing the location for data centers, factors like internet connectivity, electricity cost, and customer base are considered. The article mentions that good connectivity is often found along national highway systems. Additionally, areas with cheap and renewable power sources, such as hydroelectric power, are attractive for data center deployment. The fastest growing region for internet access currently is Africa, which the article suggests could benefit from the establishment of data centers in locations like South Africa or Kenya.

In conclusion, the article provides an overview of the challenges and considerations related to data centers, including cooling, security, power demands, backup systems, energy efficiency, and location. It emphasizes the importance of optimizing resource usage and reducing environmental impact while meeting the growing demand for data processing and storage.
