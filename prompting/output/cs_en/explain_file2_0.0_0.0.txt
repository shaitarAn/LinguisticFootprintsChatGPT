This news article discusses three possible scenarios for the future of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and their potential impact on financial markets.

The first scenario, referred to as the "Worsening crisis possibly leading to a break-up of EMU," describes a situation where joint fiscal policies are implemented to support weaker regions. This includes automatic transfers from stronger to weaker regions and joint guarantees for bonds issued by member governments. The share of guaranteed bonds would be determined, with an initial proposal of up to 60 percent of GDP. Additionally, there would be central supervision of budgetary policies and strict enforcement of deficit and debt rules outlined in the Maastricht Treaty. In this scenario, the EMU would experience a return to growth, leading to a decrease in volatility and an increase in risk appetite in financial markets. This would result in a rally in risky assets such as stocks and credits, with narrowing spreads on corporate and emerging market bonds. The euro would appreciate, while the US dollar and Swiss franc would depreciate.

The second scenario, referred to as "Muddling through," describes a controlled debt restructuring for Greece and a slow recovery of confidence in the EMU. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would undergo changes, and fiscal consolidation plans would be implemented in high-debt countries. The European Central Bank (ECB) would provide continued support through liquidity provisions and potential interest rate cuts. In this scenario, market volatility would gradually decrease, but periodic spikes could occur. Liquidity and counterparty risks would decline over time. Government bond yields would remain low, and Italian and Spanish yields would slightly decline. Credit spreads would remain elevated, and bank stocks would underperform until re-capitalizations are implemented. Currencies would remain range-bound, with the euro and US dollar trading within a broad range. Cyclical commodities would have low single-digit returns, and gold would offer moderate upside. Derivatives strategies would be more complicated due to difficulties in hedging and structuring.

The third scenario, referred to as a "Major crisis," describes a more severe outcome, such as the exit of a country from the EMU or a major collapse of trust in Europe. This scenario would lead to a credit crunch, global recession, and default of weaker Eurozone countries. Market volatility would increase significantly, and European stocks would fall to or below 2009 levels. Government bond yields would rally, credit spreads would widen sharply, and liquidity stress and counterparty risk would surge. Implementing derivatives and structured strategies would become challenging. The Swiss franc would appreciate against the euro, and the US dollar and Japanese yen would strengthen. Cyclical commodities would experience a sharp decline.

The article concludes that the most favorable scenario would be a full fiscal union and the introduction of a Eurobond market, but this outcome is considered unlikely. The least desirable outcome would be a major crisis, which could lead to a global crisis and is also relatively unlikely. The reality is expected to be somewhere in between these two extremes, with Europe navigating its way through its debt and currency challenges.

Overall, the article highlights the potential impact of different scenarios on financial markets and provides insights into the possible outcomes for the future of the EMU.
