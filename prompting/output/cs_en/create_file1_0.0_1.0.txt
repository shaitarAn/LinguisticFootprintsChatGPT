Title: Asian Family Businesses: A Rising Force in the Global Economy

Introduction:
Despite their significant contributions to local economies, Asian family businesses have long been underresearched due to a lack of official and systematic data. Recognizing this gap, the Credit Suisse Emerging Market Research Institute has embarked on a groundbreaking research project aimed at shedding light on key trends, economic contributions, and financial performance of these influential entities. The initial findings are not only fascinating but also challenge conventional wisdom about the role of family businesses in Asia.

The Rise of Asian Family Businesses:
Asian family businesses have historically played a pivotal role in driving economic growth across the region. However, until now, their impact has largely gone unnoticed by global investors and researchers alike. The Credit Suisse study aims to rectify this oversight by providing comprehensive insights into these often-overlooked powerhouses.

Short Equity Market History:
One notable finding from the study is that Asian family businesses have a relatively short equity market history compared to their European and American counterparts. Out of 3,600 surveyed companies across Asia, 38 percent (1,371) were identified as family-owned enterprises with limited exposure to public markets. This suggests that there is immense untapped potential for these firms to expand their reach and influence within global financial markets.

Outperformance Against Market Indices:
Contrary to popular belief that publicly traded companies outperform privately held ones over time, the Credit Suisse study reveals an intriguing trend among Asian family businesses. Despite limited access to public markets for capital raising purposes or liquidity events such as IPOs or M&A transactions, these enterprises consistently outperformed market indices over extended periods.

The reasons behind this phenomenon are multifaceted but can be attributed primarily to factors such as long-term strategic planning driven by familial values and intergenerational continuity. By focusing on sustainable growth rather than short-term gains demanded by public shareholders or quarterly earnings reports pressures faced by listed firms – Asian family businesses have been able to weather economic downturns and emerge stronger.

Resilience in Times of Crisis:
The study also highlights the resilience of Asian family businesses during times of crisis. Whether it be the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, or more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic, these enterprises have demonstrated their ability to adapt and thrive amidst adversity. Their nimble decision-making processes and conservative financial management practices have allowed them to navigate turbulent waters with relative ease.

Driving Innovation and Social Impact:
Asian family businesses are not only focused on financial success but also on driving innovation and creating a positive social impact. Many of these enterprises are at the forefront of technological advancements, sustainable business practices, and philanthropic initiatives. By leveraging their deep-rooted connections within local communities, they are able to address societal challenges while simultaneously generating long-term value for stakeholders.

Conclusion:
The Credit Suisse study has shed much-needed light on Asian family businesses' significant contributions to regional economies and global markets. These entities possess unique characteristics that set them apart from their Western counterparts – a combination of long-term vision, resilience in times of crisis, commitment to innovation, and dedication towards social responsibility. As investors increasingly recognize the potential offered by these often-overlooked powerhouses, it is clear that Asian family businesses will continue to shape the future landscape of global commerce.
