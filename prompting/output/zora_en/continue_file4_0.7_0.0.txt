Imitation is a fundamental aspect of human development, and its relevance for language acquisition has been extensively studied in infants. Previous research has shown that infants as young as 9 to 20 months old are capable of imitating both object-based actions and language-based behaviors (Meltzoff, 1995). These early imitation skills have been found to be predictive of later language development, with infants who demonstrate stronger imitation abilities showing more advanced language skills in toddlerhood (Carpenter et al., 1998).

While much research has focused on the importance of early imitation for language development, there has been limited exploration of the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors later on in development, particularly in preschool-aged children. This correlational study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between multimodal imitation skills, object-based imitation skills, and two important aspects of language development in preschoolers: narrative abilities and sociopragmatic abilities.

Narrative abilities refer to a child's ability to construct and communicate a coherent and meaningful story. It involves the use of language skills, such as vocabulary, syntax, and discourse markers, as well as the ability to organize and structure information in a logical sequence (Berman & Slobin, 1994). Sociopragmatic abilities, on the other hand, encompass a child's understanding and use of social and pragmatic aspects of language, such as turn-taking, requesting, and repairing communication breakdowns (Bates et al., 1975).

Thirty-one typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children participated in this study. They were assessed on four tasks: multimodal imitation, object-based imitation, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities. The multimodal imitation task required children to imitate a series of actions that included both gestural, prosodic, and lexical components. The object-based imitation task involved imitating a set of actions involving objects, such as stacking blocks or pouring water. The narrative task required children to construct and tell a story based on a series of pictures, while the sociopragmatic task assessed their ability to use language in social interactions.

Results of the study revealed a significant relationship between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool children. Children who demonstrated stronger multimodal imitation skills also exhibited more advanced narrative and sociopragmatic abilities. Interestingly, there was no significant relationship found between object-based imitation skills and either narrative or sociopragmatic abilities.

These findings suggest that preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues, including gestures, prosody, and verbal linguistic patterns, plays a crucial role in their language and sociocommunicative development. The integration of these different modalities of imitation may provide children with a richer and more comprehensive understanding of how language is used in social interactions.

These results have important implications for the field of language development. They highlight the need to broaden the conceptualization of imitation behaviors beyond simple object-based actions and incorporate the imitation of multimodal cues. By doing so, researchers and practitioners can gain a better understanding of how imitation skills contribute to language and sociocommunicative development in preschool children.

In conclusion, this correlational study provides evidence for the link between multimodal imitation skills and narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children. The findings suggest that preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is strongly related to their language and sociocommunicative skills. These results emphasize the importance of considering the role of multimodal imitation in understanding language development and highlight the need for further research in this area.
