1. Introduction

In recent decades, climate change has emerged as one of the most pressing global challenges, requiring urgent attention from scientists, policymakers, and the general public alike. The complex nature of this issue necessitates effective communication strategies that can help bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and public awareness. Framing has been recognized as a crucial concept in communication research for understanding how messages are constructed and interpreted in various contexts (Entman, 1993). Drawing on its potential to bridge perspectives across different frame locations (i.e., frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects), this paper seeks to examine how framing can enhance climate change communication.

While considerable research exists on the framing of climate change in recent years due to its escalating importance (Zaccagnini & Sigala , 2017), there remains a lack of consensus regarding the definition and operationalization of framing concepts and methods. This limitation presents challenges in synthesizing theoretical insights into meaningful frameworks for both academic scholars and practitioners engaged in climate change communication efforts.

The aim of this paper is thus twofold: first, to review trends within climate change framing research; secondly, to explore ways in which framing's bridging potential can be harnessed more effectively within the context of climate change communication. By conducting a rigorous systematic review based on 25 years' worth of peer-reviewed literature on climate change framing (n = 275), this study seeks to identify gaps in current understandings while proposing directions for future research.

2. Research Question

Building upon existing scholarship concerning the role of framing in communications related to climate change issues (Cook et al., 2018; Nisbet & Mooney ,2007 ), our study aims to address the following research question: How can we optimize the use of framing as a bridging concept for effective climate change communication?

3. Importance of Study

Effective science communication is vital in tackling complex problems such as climate change. While previous studies have explored various aspects of framing in the context of climate change (Boykoff & Boykoff, 2007; Leiserowitz, Maibach, Roser-Renouf, Smith, & Dawson, 2010), there is a need to consolidate and synthesize these diverse findings into a unified framework.

By conducting a systematic review of literature spanning over two decades and encompassing diverse methodologies (content analysis), we aim to provide an overview of trends in the framing of climate change communication. This knowledge will enable us to examine how different frames are employed across different frame locations and identify potential gaps or inconsistencies between them. By recognizing these gaps within existing research on framing within the domain of climate change communication, we can propose avenues for future research that seek to optimize framing's bridging potential.

Moreover, this study contributes to expanding theoretical understanding in the field by drawing upon insights from not only communication research but also cultural studies or related fields where framing has been explored. In doing so, we aim to foster interdisciplinary dialogue that acknowledges how socio-cultural factors shape messages about climate change and can influence public attitudes and behaviors.

4. Outline

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a comprehensive review of literature on framing theory in both general communication research and specific studies related to climate change communication. Section 3 presents our methodological approach for conducting the systematic review based on content analysis techniques applied to peer-reviewed articles identified through extensive database searches.

Section 4 reports our findings regarding trends within the existing literature on framing within the realm of climate change communication. We highlight areas where significant progress has been made as well as identifying key knowledge gaps that exist between different frame locations.

In Section 5, we discuss implications arising from these findings with respect to maximizing framingâ€™s bridging potential for effective climate change communication efforts.

Finally, Section 6 concludes by summarizing key takeaways from this study and suggesting directions for future research. By leveraging the bridging potential of framing within climate change communication, we can hope to better inform and engage a wider audience about the urgent need for collective action in response to this global challenge.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, this paper provides a comprehensive examination of framing as a bridging concept for climate change communication. Through reviewing trends in literature from both general communication research and climate change-specific studies, we aim to enhance our understanding of how framing can be effectively utilized within this important domain.

By identifying gaps and inconsistencies between different frame locations, we open up new avenues for future research that seeks to optimize the use of framing techniques in order to maximize their bridging potential. Ultimately, by improving our ability to communicate about climate change issues effectively, we hope to inspire meaningful action and collaboration towards mitigating its adverse effects.

Overall, this study contributes valuable insights into the field of climate change communication by providing theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence that can guide practitioners, researchers, policymakers working towards more effective engagement with diverse audiences.
