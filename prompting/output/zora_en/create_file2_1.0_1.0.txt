Title: Exploring the Role of Framing in Climate Change Debates: A Fresh Approach

Abstract:
In recent years, the field of climate change communication has witnesseda surge of studies focusing on how this pressing global issue is framed. However, the lack of clear definitions and a coherent framework for analyzing framing strategies presents a challenge to understanding and synthesizing theoretical and empirical findings. This systematic review aims to address this critical gap by examining trends in framing within climate change communication research and comparing it with broader reviews on communication research as a whole. By leveraging framing's potential as a bridging concept, we analyze frames across various frame locations including frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects within the larger cultural framing repository.

Drawing upon an extensive body of peer-reviewed literature spanning 25 years (n = 275), we utilize both quantitative and qualitative methods to conduct a comprehensive content analysis. Our findings reveal that despite widespread engagement with the subject matter, existing research has failed to fully harness framing's potential as an effective tool for perspective integration. Consequently, we explore the underlying conceptual mismatches across different frame locations in order to shed light on this missed opportunity for cross-disciplinary synthesis.

Building upon the insights gained from our analysis, we highlight significant avenues for future research exploration within this unexplored terrain. In particular, our study underscores the need for greater emphasis on utilizing framing techniques that encourage dialogue between divergent perspectives on climate change. By doing so, researchers can foster a more nuanced understanding that transcends disciplinary boundaries while facilitating constructive conversations about potential solutions.

1. Introduction:

Climate change continues to dominate political agendas worldwide due to its far-reaching implications for societies and ecosystems alike (IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report). As scientific consensus solidifies around anthropogenic causes underlying changing climatic patterns (Stocker et al., 2014), effective communication becomes paramount in mobilizing collective action towards sustainable development (Hulme & Mahony, 2010). However, the complex nature of this issue presents significant challenges for effective communication and engagement at both individual and societal levels (Leiserowitz et al., 2010).

Effective climate change communication requires careful selection and framing of messages to shape public perceptions, beliefs, and subsequent behavioral responses (Nisbet & Myers, 2007). Framing theory has emerged as a powerful tool in understanding how different aspects of an issue are emphasized or downplayed to influence public opinion. By analyzing the construction of communication messages within differing social contexts, framing research offers insights into the mechanisms that shape public attitudes on climate change.

Despite the increased attention paid to framing theory within climate change scholarship in recent years, there remains a lack of conceptual clarity regarding its definitions and operationalization across different frame locations. This deficiency complicates attempts at synthesizing theoretical models and empirical findings from diverse perspectives such as sociology, psychology, media studies,and political science (Dunlap & McCright, 2008; O'Neill & Nicholson-Cole,S.2020). Therefore,the fundamental aimof this study is to provide a comprehensive review that bridges these disciplinary divides by employing framing as a bridging concept for understanding climate change communication.

In this paper,classical framing theories will be critically examined,and we will propose fresh approaches that consider multiple perspectives beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. By exploring new pathways for integrating frame locationsthroughout the cultural framing repository,this research aims tobetter understand how frames are constructed,sustained,challenged,and ultimately impact public debates on climate change.This explorationwill shed light on areas where current efforts have missedkey opportunitiesfor collaborative synthesis,discussthe reasons behind these gaps,and offer directions for future research endeavors.It is through embracing this interdisciplinary perspective that we hope to contribute towards more inclusive,nuanced,and effective strategies for communicating aboutclimatechangeacrossdisciplines,between stakeholdersandwith diverse audiencegroups.

This introduction sets the stage for our imaginary research question, exploring innovative approaches to framing climate change communication that transcend disciplinary boundaries. By studying and integrating perspectives from sociology, psychology, media studies, and political science, we aim to uncover new understanding and strategies that stimulate meaningful dialogue and engagement on this critical global issue.
