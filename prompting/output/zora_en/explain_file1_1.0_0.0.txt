This introduction discusses the phenomenon of reference in conversation and how it changes over the course of an interaction. Reference is the act of speakers referring to entities or objects that are relevant to their conversation. In this context, a referring expression is a noun phrase that serves as a form of reference, such as pronouns, definite and indefinite descriptions, or proper nouns.

The first change-in-interaction that is commonly observed in the use of referring expressions is that interlocutors tend to become more similar in their choice of words and grammatical constructions. This convergence in expression has been linked to the cognitive process of aligning linguistic representations, which is explained by the Interactive Alignment Model.

The second change-in-interaction observed is that interlocutors tend to shorten their contributions, a phenomenon known as referential contraction. This chapter focuses primarily on this process of change-in-interaction, although it acknowledges that both processes often occur simultaneously.

The main objective of the chapter is to describe the structural changes that occur in referring expressions over multiple rounds of interactive dialogue. The chapter specifically addresses two research questions: 1) To what extent do speakers shorten their referring expressions during dialogic interaction, and which elements of the expression are subject to shortening? 2) What structural changes can be observed in the production of referring expressions over four rounds of interaction?

To investigate these questions, a referential communication task was designed to elicit spoken dialogues over four rounds of interaction. In this task, interlocutors repeatedly referred to the same visual stimuli. An example from the resulting corpus shows a typical shortening process, where the initial referring expression in the first round becomes shorter and converges to a preferred expression (e.g., "the green dress shirt") over the course of the interaction.

The focus of the study is on how speakers change their preferred grammatical structure for referring expressions as they converge on forms of expression and shorten their expressions. The aim is to describe general tendencies regarding the types and forms of modifying and descriptive elements in the construction of referring expressions throughout the interaction.

The trajectory of change observed in this study involves a shift from the initial presence of post-head clausal elements (e.g., "it's green") to a greater frequency of phrasal modification (e.g., "green") in later rounds of interaction. This change is referred to as "compression" and covers both the shortening process and the changes in structural preferences.

The introduction also provides a brief overview of the previous research on change-in-interaction, specifically regarding compression in referring expressions. Theoretical approaches, such as the Interactive Alignment Model and discussions of familiarity and accessibility, are contextualized within the findings from experimental referential communication task studies.

The experimental setup used to elicit a corpus of spoken English dialogues is introduced in Section 3, and the analysis of the structural changes in referring expressions over the course of the interactions is presented in Section 4. The analysis demonstrates that as referring expressions are shortened, particularly in terms of the length of post-head elements, their structure changes from more elaborated, clausal forms to more compressed, phrasal forms in later rounds of interaction.

Finally, the findings are discussed in Section 5 with regard to Biber and Clark's notion of compression as a change that occurs in response to a need to convey a large amount of information efficiently.
