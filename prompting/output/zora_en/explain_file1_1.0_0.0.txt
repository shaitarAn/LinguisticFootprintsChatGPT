This introduction discusses the phenomenon of reference in conversation, specifically focusing on referring expressions with noun phrases (NP REs). It explains that during interactive communication, there are two observed changes-in-interaction in the use of NP REs. Firstly, there is lexical and grammatical convergence, where speakers align on their linguistic representations. This is supported by the Interactive Alignment Model and psycholinguistic research. Secondly, there is referential contraction, where interlocutors tend to shorten their contributions. The chapter primarily focuses on the process of referential contraction, although both processes occur simultaneously.

The introduction outlines the research questions addressed in the chapter, which involve examining the degree of shortening and the structural changes in NP REs during multiple rounds of interactive dialogue. To investigate these changes, a referential communication task was designed, which involved repeated references to visual stimuli. An example is provided to illustrate the typical shortening process observed. The study aims to describe general tendencies in the types and forms of modifying and descriptive elements in the NP RE construction preferred throughout the interaction.

The concept of "compression" is introduced to describe the observed changes in the structure of NP REs, from post-head clausal elements to phrasal (pre-)modification. Previous research on change-in-interaction, compression in NP REs, the Interactive Alignment Model, and familiarity and accessibility are discussed in Section 2. The experimental set-up used to collect spoken dialogues is described in Section 3, and the analysis of structural changes in NP REs is presented in Section 4. The findings show that as NP REs get shortened, their structure changes from more elaborated, clausal forms to more compressed, phrasal forms. Finally, in Section 5, the findings are discussed in relation to the notion of compression as a response to conveying large amounts of information efficiently.
