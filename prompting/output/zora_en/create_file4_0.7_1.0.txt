1. Introduction

In recent years, scholars and researchers have devoted considerable attention to examining the role of imitation skills in early language development among infants and young children. Extensive research has been conducted on the relevance of object- and language-based imitation in infants aged 9 to 20 months, highlighting its impact on their linguistic abilities. However, there remains a dearth of systematic investigations comparing the joint significance of these imitative behaviors as children progress through later stages of development.

This paper aims to address this gap by exploring the link between multimodal imitation skills (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components) and narrative performance as well as sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children. Building upon previous literature that has focused primarily on object-based imitation, our study seeks to expand understanding by examining how children's ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues relates to their language use and sociocommunicative skills.

To investigate this research question empirically, we conducted a correlational study involving thirty-one typically developing 3- to 4-year-old preschoolers. These participants were assessed across four distinct tasks: multimodal imitation assessment, object-based imitation assessment, evaluation of narrative abilities, and measurement of sociopragmatic competencies. By analyzing the relationships between these variables, we aimed to shed light on whether preschool-aged children who exhibit stronger multimodal imitation skills also demonstrate enhanced narrative performance and sociopragmatic abilities.

The implications of this research are significant for advancing our understanding of child language development beyond traditional conceptions centered solely around object-based imitation. By integrating prosodic features such as intonation patterns or vocal modulation with gestural elements alongside verbal linguistic patterns during early childhood interactions, we may gain deeper insights into how different dimensions of mimicry contribute synergistically toward shaping language acquisition processes.

In light of these considerations, this paper presents compelling evidence supporting a broader conceptualization that places emphasis on diverse forms of imitation behaviors within the context of language development. By elucidating the relationship between preschoolers' multimodal imitation skills and their language use, this study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between imitation, narrative abilities, and sociocommunicative competence in early childhood.
