The introduction of this Zora article discusses the uniqueness of the Insular Celtic languages, particularly in relation to their grammar and word structures. It mentions that these languages have been described in various ways, including as having a "sentence word" or "weakly polysynthetic" nature. These descriptions highlight the presence of phonologically and morphologically bound formatives within the languages, such as incorporated adjectives or adverbs, and significant phonological and morpho-phonological interaction within phrases.

However, the introduction points out that these broad characterizations lack specific criteria that define what constitutes a "word" or its "phonological autonomy." Even native grammars don't provide a clear definition for wordhood. For example, early Irish grammars did not have an equivalent concept of a modern "word," instead using focal to refer to any syntactic group. Middle Welsh grammars also lack explicit discussions on words, considering them as combinations of syllables.

The introduction goes on to explain that recent typological research has shown that languages can lack a unified word domain and may have multiple conflicting domains instead. Based on this background information and current work on the topic, the study aims to investigate the potential characteristics of Middle Welsh prose's verbal complex during the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.

The introduction highlights that poetry will be used alongside prose to illustrate interesting differences between genres or provide additional insights not found in prose alone. The study focuses specifically on finite verbal structures based on observations by Dixon and Aikhenvald about variations in wordhood patterns across different parts of speech within a language.

To provide an example for analysis, it presents a Middle Welsh verbal complex consisting of eight markers alongside elements like subordinating conjunctions and negative markers all attached to the lexical root wel- 'to see'. The presence of these markers demonstrates how complex verb formations can be in Middle Welsh.

The structure of this study is then outlined: Section 2 explains the study's approach, Section 3 delves into the morphological structuring of the verbal complex, and Section 4 explores the phonological and prosodic processes within this complex and their mapping onto its morphological structure. Finally, Section 5 summarizes and discusses the findings of the study while also suggesting potential future research directions.
