1. Introduction

The phenomenon of structural change in interactive communication has been a subject of extensive research, particularly with regards to the production of referring expressions with noun phrases (NP REs) at their centre. Previous studies have highlighted the tendency for language users to converge on linguistic forms and establish routines during a communicative interaction (Smith, 2008; Johnson et al., 2014). These convergent processes often involve shortening NP REs as interlocutors gradually develop shared understanding and optimize their communication efficiency.

While existing research has primarily focused on the reduction in length or complexity of NP REs, this paper introduces a novel research question that examines how these changes impact the structural composition of NP REs. Specifically, we investigate whether post-head compression occurs in NP REs over the course of an interactive dialogue and what types of structural modifications are involved in this process.

To address this research question, we present findings from an experimentally elicited corpus comprised of spoken English recorded during referential communication tasks. Conversational dyads were instructed to repeatedly refer to visual stimuli within specific contexts. This setup allowed us to examine any observable changes in NP RE structures across successive references.

Our analysis is centered around two main hypotheses. Firstly, we hypothesize that as interlocutors become more familiar with each other's communicative strategies and shared context develops, there will be a tendency for shorter post-head elements within NP REs over time. This hypothesis is based on previous research demonstrating speakers' inclination towards linguistic convergence through routine establishment and shortening processes (Clark & Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Brennan & Clark, 1996).

Secondly, we propose that alongside the reduction in length or complexity observed within post-head elements after consecutive references occur within an interactive dialogue setting, there will also be a shift in the types of structural modification employed by speakers. More specifically, our hypothesis suggests that earlier references may exhibit greater reliance on clausal elements for structural elaboration, while later references may involve a relative increase in phrasal modification as a result of structural compression. This hypothesis is motivated by the notion that as interlocutors become more efficient in their communication, they are likely to opt for less elaborate structures that convey the same referential information.

The implications of our research extend beyond understanding the dynamics of interactive communication. By identifying and characterizing post-head compression in NP REs, we contribute to theoretical debates concerning linguistic production processes and provide insights into how language users adapt their expression choices within specific conversational contexts. Furthermore, this research has practical applications in fields such as natural language processing and dialogue system design, where efficient generation and comprehension of referring expressions play crucial roles.

In the subsequent sections of this paper, we will provide an overview of relevant literature on linguistic convergence and the reduction strategies observed in previous studies. We will then detail our experimental methodology before discussing our findings related to changes in NP REs' structural composition over time. Lastly, we will engage with theoretical implications drawn from these findings and discuss avenues for future research.

Overall, this investigation aims to shed light on the process of post-head compression within NP REs during interactive communication by examining how structural changes manifest themselves over successive referential exchanges. By uncovering patterns and exploring potential motivations underlying these modifications, we aim to contribute new insights into the nature of referential expression production and its implications for effective interactive communication.
