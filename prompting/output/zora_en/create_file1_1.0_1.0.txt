1. Introduction

In the realm of communication, language users often generate referring expressions centered around noun phrases (NP REs). As individuals engage in interactive communication, research has noted a notable tendency for interlocutors to converge on linguistic forms and gradually abbreviate their NP REs [REF]. The aim of this paper is to explore this shortening process and examine the accompanying structural changes within NP REs. To achieve this, we analyze data collected from an experimentally elicited corpus consisting of spoken English conversations between conversational dyads engaged in a referential communication task involving repetitive references to visual stimuli.

Previous studies have established that interlocutors progressively shorten their NP REs over the course of dialogues [REF]. Notably, our investigation aims to unravel how these alterations manifest in terms of structural modifications within NP REs. We hypothesize that speakers initially utilize longer clausal post-head elements associated with structural elaboration, gradually transitioning towards using premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification as the interaction unfolds.

To investigate these hypotheses, we conducted an experimental study wherein conversational dyads engaged in a referential communication task involving repeated references to visual stimuli. Through meticulous analysis and comparison of responses at different points during the interaction, we examined changes in the syntactic complexity and structure employed by participants when constructing their referring expressions.

Understanding how referencing structures evolve throughout communicative interactions has important implications for various fields. For instance, it could shed light on how individuals develop shared routines or establish mutual understanding during conversation. Additionally, insights into this phenomenon can enhance natural language processing systems by facilitating the design of algorithms that better comprehend dynamically changing syntax patterns in real-time interactions.

This paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of previous research regarding convergence on linguistic forms during interactive communication; Section 3 outlines our experimental methodology; Section 4 presents our findings on shifts within NP RE structures over time; finally leading to a discussion of the implications of our results in Section 5, followed by a conclusion in Section 6.
