The article begins by highlighting the prevalence of imitation in humans and its significance in human culture, language development, and cognitive skills. The study aims to expand on previous research by examining different types of imitation skills, specifically language-based multimodal imitation and object-based imitation, which have not been extensively studied together. The focus is on preschoolers, an age group undergoing important linguistic and social developmental advances that have not been extensively studied in terms of imitation abilities.

The article reviews previous literature on the relationship between imitative behaviors and language and sociopragmatic abilities. It emphasizes the role of imitation skills in language production and comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and social communication behaviors such as requesting or greeting. Multiple studies are cited, including the correlation between vocal imitation and language production and comprehension in infants, the relationship between motor imitation behaviors and language comprehension skills, and the positive association between the imitation of arbitrary actions involving objects and the use of referential language.

The article also discusses the link between imitative behaviors and sociopragmatic skills, specifically how imitative behaviors contribute to the prediction of social communication outcomes in late talkers and the potential of body movement imitation measures to identify preschoolers at risk of social communication and language problems. Studies examining the imitation abilities of children with language impairment and Autism Spectrum Disorder are also referenced.

The article highlights the importance of considering both language-based and object-based imitation skills and suggests that language-based imitation may have stronger links to language abilities than object-based imitation. Different studies are referenced, indicating that the imitation of socially relevant body movements is associated with expressive language skills, while the imitation of actions on objects is associated with play skills. The social function of gestures is emphasized as a significant factor influencing imitation patterns.

The article acknowledges the limitations of previous studies in terms of not incorporating an integrative multimodal view of language-based imitation that includes gestural, prosodic, and verbal/lexical components. It argues that analyzing the relationship between multimodal language-based imitation and object-based imitation in preschoolers is essential, as imitation continues to be a key component of social communication during this stage of development.

The article concludes by stating that young preschoolers' abilities to perform multimodal imitation of socially relevant events may be correlated with language and sociopragmatic skills. This developmental period, when children are delving into complex language, is crucial for understanding the intersection between social cognition and language. The article proposes that investigating imitation from an integrated multimodal perspective is necessary, as numerous studies have shown the parallel development and close relationship between prosody, gesture, and verbal content in language processing.

Overall, the introduction sets the stage for the study by highlighting the importance of imitation in human development and language acquisition and identifying the research gap that the study aims to fill. It provides a comprehensive overview of the existing literature and establishes the main hypothesis and objectives of the study.
