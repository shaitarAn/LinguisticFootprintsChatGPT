1. Introduction

The phonetic properties of Swiss Standard German (SSG) have been a subject of limited research, despite its status as one of the official languages in Switzerland. While some studies have explored the consonantal aspects of Alemannic (ALM) dialects, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of vowel quality within these dialects and their influence on the respective varieties of SSG. This study aims to address this research gap by investigating the long-vowel inventories in four ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties, with a particular focus on vowel quality.

The primary objective of this study is twofold: firstly, to provide a comprehensive comparative acoustic analysis of ALM and SSG vowels; secondly, to examine the extent to which interference from ALM dialects shapes vowel qualities in SSG varieties. By examining these aspects, we aim to shed light on the intricate relationship between ALM dialects and SSG varieties.

To achieve our research objectives, we recorded speech samples from eight speakers (four male and four female) representing four different regions: Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Each speaker produced three repetitions for each vowel sound under investigation. This resulted in a corpus comprising 1,632 tokens for analysis.

Our findings reveal that there is substantial transfer of ALM vowel quality into two specific regions: Chur and Brig. In contrast, Bern and Zurich exhibit variations where certain vowel qualities do not align with those found in ALM dialects. Notably, both Bern and Zurich demonstrate fronting tendencies for <a> within their respective SSG varieties. Furthermore,<ä> exhibits variation between [ɛː] and [æː] in Bern's SSG variety while <o> tends to be realized more towards backness.

These results highlight intriguing patterns regarding how vowel qualities are influenced by regional variations within Switzerland's linguistic landscape. The observed transfer of ALM vowel quality in Chur and Brig suggests a strong influence of the respective dialects on the SSG varieties spoken in these regions. Conversely, Bern and Zurich exhibit deviations from ALM vowel qualities, indicating potential linguistic divergence or other external influences shaping their SSG varieties.

Understanding the intricate relationship between ALM dialects and SSG varieties is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it contributes to our knowledge of Swiss German phonetics by providing a comprehensive analysis of vowel quality within these dialects. Secondly, it sheds light on how regional variations influence the development and maintenance of SSG varieties across different areas in Switzerland. Lastly, this research has implications for language planning and education policies as it provides insights into how regional dialectal features are integrated into standardized forms of German.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of relevant literature on Swiss German phonetics with a focus on previous studies investigating consonantal aspects rather than vowels. Section 3 outlines our methodology including data collection procedures and acoustic analysis techniques employed in this study. Section 4 presents our findings regarding the transfer of ALM vowel quality to SSG varieties across different regions in Switzerland. Finally, Section 5 discusses the implications of our findings and offers suggestions for future research directions.

In conclusion, this study aims to fill a significant research gap by examining vowel quality within Alemannic dialects and its influence on respective varieties of Swiss Standard German (SSG). By conducting a comparative acoustic analysis between ALM vowels and their corresponding SSG counterparts, we aim to contribute to our understanding of Swiss German phonetics while shedding light on how regional variations shape standardized forms such as SSG.
