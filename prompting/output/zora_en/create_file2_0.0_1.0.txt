1. Introduction

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time, with far-reaching implications for human societies and the natural environment. As the scientific consensus on the reality and urgency of climate change has solidified over the past few decades, there has been a growing recognition of the need for effective communication strategies to engage diverse audiences and foster collective action. In this context, framing has emerged as a key concept in climate change communication research.

Framing refers to how information is presented and interpreted within a particular context, shaping individuals' understanding and perception of an issue (Entman, 1993). It involves selecting certain aspects of an issue while downplaying or omitting others, thereby influencing how people think about and respond to that issue (Nisbet & Mooney, 2007). The power of framing lies in its ability to shape public opinion by influencing what issues are salient, how they are understood, and what actions are deemed appropriate (Gamson & Modigliani, 1989).

While studies on framing have proliferated in recent years across various domains including politics, health communication, and social movements (Chong & Druckman, 2007; Nelson et al., 2018; Snow et al., 1986), research specifically focused on framing climate change remains relatively limited. This gap is surprising given the urgency and complexity of climate change as an environmental problem that requires widespread public engagement.

The existing literature on framing climate change communication has primarily examined frame production (i.e., who frames the issue), frame content (i.e., what aspects are emphasized or neglected), audience frames (i.e., how different groups interpret frames), and framing effects (i.e., how frames influence attitudes or behaviors) (Boykoff & Boykoff, 2004; Nisbet et al., 2010). However, despite these valuable contributions to our understanding of framing in the context of climate change, there remains a lack of consensus and clarity regarding the definitions and operationalization of framing concepts.

This paper aims to address this gap by conducting a systematic review of the literature on framing climate change communication over the past 25 years. By synthesizing theoretical and empirical insights from a wide range of studies, we seek to identify trends in framing research specific to climate change and compare them with broader trends observed in communication research overall. Furthermore, we aim to harness framing's potential as a bridging concept by examining how frames are constructed and interpreted across different frame locations.

To achieve these objectives, we employ both quantitative and qualitative approaches through content analysis. Our review draws on an extensive dataset comprising 275 peer-reviewed articles that have examined various aspects of framing climate change. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to shed light on the current state of knowledge in this field while also identifying areas where further research is needed.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the theoretical foundations underlying framing theory and its relevance for understanding climate change communication. Section 3 outlines our methodology for conducting the systematic review, including data collection procedures and analytical techniques employed. Section 4 presents our findings, highlighting key trends in framing research specific to climate change communication. In Section 5, we discuss implications arising from our findings, including conceptual (mis)fits between frame locations within existing literature. Finally, Section 6 concludes with directions for future research aimed at advancing our understanding of how framing can be effectively utilized as a bridging concept in climate change communication.

In summary, this paper contributes to existing scholarship by providing a comprehensive synthesis of literature on framing climate change communication over the past quarter-century. By examining frame production, content analysis audience frames ,and effects across different frame locations within the wider cultural repository framework ,we aim to bridge perspectives between various stakeholders involved in addressing one of humanity's most pressing challenges - climate change.
