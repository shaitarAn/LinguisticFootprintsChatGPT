This introduction to the Zora article discusses the concept of framing in communication research and highlights the need for a systematic review on the framing of climate change. The author begins by explaining that framing is a popular theoretical approach in communication research, but there is a lack of consensus on its definition and scope. This makes it challenging to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights in the field.

The article argues that existing systematic reviews on framing have not fully utilized its bridging potential. Framing has unique characteristics that allow it to consider various aspects of the communication process, including strategic communication, journalistic cognitions, audience frames, framing effects, and cultural contexts. By systematically reviewing how framing has been applied across these different "frame locations," researchers can gain insights into the cultural framing repository.

To conduct an effective review and assess this cultural framing repository, the authors choose climate change as their specific topic due to its importance as a global problem. They note that audiences rely on multiple sources of information about climate change but find it difficult to engage with or understand. Frames play a role in influencing audience perceptions and actions related to climate change.

Furthermore, climate change is described as an exceptional topic because of its complexity, scientific uncertainty, and interconnectedness between experts, policymaking processes, sources of information, and audiences. Framing is seen as a valuable tool for breaking through communication barriers related to these challenges.

The authors also highlight that there is ongoing research on various aspects of framing within climate change communication: communicator's frames, journalist's frames frame content (most salient frames), audience frames,and framing effects.Through conducting a systematic review across these frame locations,the study aims at revealing possible conceptual misfit among them - which refers t whether subsequent studies identified or related to similar fames- thus potentially impacting closing gaps in climate changrcommunication

Moreover ,the authors acknowledge that while there are limited systematic reviews available for overall communications research involving framing,a few field-specific applications have been explored, such as in health communication. Therefore, the study will not only contribute to existing literature on framing in climate change communication but also aim to bridge insights from these field-specific applications and from reviews covering framing in communication research overall.

The study will use both quantitative and qualitative approaches of content analysis, drawing on 25 years of published literature on climate change framing. Ultimately, the researchers hope that by identifying the most salient frames across frame locations and examining their conceptual fit or misfit, they can provide valuable insights into the cultural framing repository of climate change communication.

In summary, this introduction sets the stage for a systematic review on how framing has been applied within different aspects of climate change communication. It emphasizes the importance of understanding framing across various frame locations and its potential for integrating perspectives in order to inform effective strategies for addressing climate change.
