Swiss Standard German (SSG) is one of the official languages in Switzerland, but its phonetic properties have received limited attention in research. In particular, the vowel qualities of SSG and their relationship to Alemannic (ALM) dialects have not been extensively studied. Most existing phonetic studies on ALM dialects have focused on consonants rather than vowels. Therefore, this study aims to fill this research gap by investigating the long-vowel inventories of four ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties.

The study has two main objectives. Firstly, it seeks to provide a comparative acoustic analysis of ALM and SSG vowels. By examining the acoustic properties of these vowels, we can gain insights into the similarities and differences between the dialects and the standard variety. Secondly, the study aims to determine the extent to which ALM dialects influence the vowel qualities of SSG varieties. This investigation will shed light on the potential interference from dialects in shaping the vowel system of the standard language.

To achieve these objectives, eight speakers, four male and four female, from four different dialect regions were recorded. The dialect regions include Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Each speaker produced each vowel three times, resulting in a total corpus of 1,632 tokens. The recordings were then analyzed acoustically to measure vowel quality.

The results of the analysis reveal interesting patterns of vowel quality in the ALM and SSG varieties. In the Chur and Brig dialect regions, the vowel qualities of the ALM dialects were largely transferred to the corresponding SSG varieties. This suggests a strong influence of the dialects on the standard language in these regions. However, in the SSG varieties spoken in Bern and Zurich, certain vowel qualities deviated from those in the ALM dialects. Notably, the vowel <a> was fronted in the SSG varieties of both dialects. Additionally, the SSG vowel <ä> in Bern was produced as both [ɛː] and [æː], indicating variation in vowel realization. Moreover, the vowel <o> in the Bern SSG variety was realized further back in the mouth.

These findings contribute to our understanding of the phonetic properties of SSG and its relationship to ALM dialects. The study demonstrates that vowel quality in ALM dialects is largely transferred to the corresponding SSG varieties in Chur and Brig, indicating a strong dialectal influence. However, in Bern and Zurich, certain vowel qualities in the SSG varieties deviate from those in the dialects. This suggests the presence of other factors shaping vowel quality in these regions, such as socio-linguistic and individual variation.

Further research is needed to explore the underlying factors influencing vowel quality in SSG and its relationship to ALM dialects. Future studies could investigate the role of socio-linguistic factors, such as age, gender, and education, in shaping vowel qualities. Additionally, a larger sample size and a more diverse range of dialect regions could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between ALM dialects and SSG vowel quality.
