The introduction of this Zora article begins by highlighting the ubiquity and importance of imitation in human behavior, particularly in the context of human culture, language development, and cognitive skills. The study aims to build upon previous research on imitative abilities by investigating the role played by different types of imitation skills that have not been extensively studied together - language-based multimodal imitation and object-based imitation. Additionally, the study focuses on young preschoolers, a crucial age group for linguistic and social developmental advances that has not been actively studied in relation to imitation abilities.

The introduction then provides a literature review of previous studies examining the relationship between imitative behaviors and various language and sociopragmatic (social communication) skills. These studies have shown that imitative behaviors are important for language production, comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and social communication in infants and young children. The author also highlights studies that demonstrate how imitative behaviors contribute to predicting later social communication and language problems in atypical populations.

Furthermore, the introduction points out that while some studies have compared the relevance of language-based versus object-based imitation skills, there is limited research on their relationship. Previous studies suggest that language-based imitation may be more strongly linked to language abilities than object-based imitation.

The present study aims to fill this gap by analyzing the relationship between multimodal language-based imitation (integrating gestural, prosodic, verbal/lexical components) and object-based imitation during early preschool years. It is hypothesized that language-based imitation abilities will be related to complex measures of language (narration skills) as well as sociopragmatic measures in preschoolers.

The introduction concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating socially relevant imitation patterns during preschool years as children enter school with necessary sociopragmatic abilities and basic narration skills predictive of broader aspects of language development. Finally it explains why a multimodal perspective is crucial for understanding how speech-gesture integration influences learning dynamics from infancy onward.

Overall, the introduction sets up the research study by providing background information on imitation and its significance in human development, highlighting the gaps in knowledge that this study aims to address, and introducing the hypotheses and research goals of the current investigation.
