The introduction of this Zora article highlights the importance of imitation in human culture and its role in language and cognitive development. It mentions that previous research on imitation has not fully investigated different types of imitation skills together, specifically language-based multimodal imitation and object-based imitation. Additionally, the study aims to fill a gap in the literature by focusing on preschool-aged children, a group that has not been extensively studied regarding their imitation abilities.

The article then reviews previous research that supports the link between imitative behaviors and various language and sociopragmatic skills. For example, there is evidence that vocal imitation is strongly correlated with language production and comprehension in infants aged 9 to 13 months. Motor imitation behaviors at 15 to 18 months have also been shown to relate to language comprehension skills. Additionally, studies have found positive relationships between infants' ability to imitate actions involving objects and their later use of referential language.

In terms of vocabulary acquisition, research suggests that infants who imitate more novel words at 13 months tend to have larger lexicons later on. Moreover, vocal and gestural imitation abilities at 14 months have been significantly correlated with overall language skills at 20 months.

The introduction also discusses the relationship between imitative behaviors and sociopragmatic skills. Late talkers who demonstrated imitative behaviors at age 2 were found to have better social communication outcomes by age 4. Children with language impairment (LI) showed weaknesses in gesture accuracy imitation patterns compared to typically developing peers.

Furthermore, studies indicate differences between language-based and object-based imitation skills. Some suggest that the former has stronger links to expressive language skills while the latter is associated with play skills.

Despite these findings, none of the previous studies incorporated an integrative multimodal view of language-based imitation which includes gestural, prosodic, verbal/lexical content dimensions. Therefore, this present study aims to analyze the relationship between multimodal language-based (combining gestural, prosodic, and verbal/lexical aspects) and object-based imitation in preschool-aged children.

The introduction also highlights the importance of focusing on young preschoolers as they delve into complex areas of language during this developmental period. These skills are believed to be predictive of important aspects of language and academic development. Narrative and sociopragmatic skills are particularly crucial for understanding the acquisition of the intersection between social cognition and language.

In summary, while previous research has examined imitation behaviors in early infancy and among children with language disorders, more investigation is needed to fully comprehend socially relevant imitation patterns in preschool-aged children. The main hypothesis underlying this study is that language-based imitation abilities will be related to both complex language measures (such as narration skills) and sociopragmatic measures in preschoolers. Overall, studying imitation from an integrated multimodal perspective is essential given that language is used through face-to-face interactions involving multiple cues like speech, gesture, and prosody.
