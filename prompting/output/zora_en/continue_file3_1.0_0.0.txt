The study of wordhood in languages has always posed a challenge to linguists, and the Middle Welsh verbal complex is no exception. The purpose of this article is to examine the distribution of phonological and morphological domains within the verb in Middle Welsh, in order to determine whether the concept of the "word" is applicable in this language.

1. Introduction

The Middle Welsh verbal complex is known for its rich morphological structure and intricate phonological interactions. Previous research has suggested that the presence of numerous bound elements and the complexity of phonological processes within morphological and phrasal structures may indicate a diminished role of individual words in the grammar of the Insular Celtic languages, including Middle Welsh.

This study aims to build upon previous research by providing a comprehensive investigation of the morphological and phonological domains within the Middle Welsh verb. By examining these domains, we seek to determine whether the concept of the "word" can adequately capture the structure and function of the verb in this language.

2. Typological research on wordhood

Before delving into the specifics of Middle Welsh, it is important to consider the broader typological research on wordhood. Linguists have long debated the definition and boundaries of a word, and different languages may exhibit varying degrees of wordhood. Some languages have a clear distinction between individual words, while others favor a more agglutinative or fusional approach.

Recent typological studies have focused on identifying universal criteria for wordhood, such as phonological and morphological separability, syntactic autonomy, and semantic cohesion. However, the applicability of these criteria to languages with complex morphophonological structures, like Middle Welsh, remains uncertain.

3. Problems and limitations of studying wordhood in corpus languages

Studying wordhood in corpus languages can be challenging due to several factors. Firstly, the inherent limitations of the corpus itself may restrict the scope and depth of analysis. Corpus languages often lack comprehensive documentation and may contain incomplete or biased data.

Secondly, the nature of the morphological and phonological processes in a language can complicate the identification of individual words. Bound elements and intricate phonological interactions may blur the boundaries between words, making it difficult to discern word-like units.

Thirdly, synchronic analysis of wordhood in a historical language like Middle Welsh requires a careful consideration of diachronic changes. The properties of wordhood may have evolved over time, further complicating the identification and classification of words.

4. Morphological and phonological word-like domains in Middle Welsh

In this study, we examine the morphological and phonological structures within the Middle Welsh verbal complex. By analyzing the distribution of bound elements and the phonological interactions between these elements, we aim to identify word-like domains within the verb.

Preliminary findings indicate that there are several structures within the Middle Welsh verb that exhibit characteristics of a word. These structures possess a degree of phonological and morphological autonomy, which suggests that they can function as discrete units within the verbal complex.

5. Conclusion

Based on our investigation, it appears that the concept of the "word" is not particularly useful for the synchronic description of Middle Welsh. The presence of multiple word-like structures within the verb indicates a more complex organization of the language, where phonological and morphological boundaries are less clear-cut.

While this study contributes to our understanding of wordhood in Middle Welsh, further research is needed to fully grasp the intricacies of the verbal complex in this language. Future studies could explore the historical development of wordhood in Middle Welsh and compare it to other Insular Celtic languages, providing a more nuanced understanding of the role of the word in these grammars.
