The introduction to this Zora article provides an overview of the linguistic characteristics of the Insular Celtic languages, particularly their unique structures involving phonologically and morphologically bound formatives. The author notes that these languages have been described as having a "sentence word," a term used to describe the strong accentuation of groups of words, which results in individual words losing their "phonological autonomy." Additionally, the author mentions that the Insular Celtic languages are sometimes characterized as "weakly polysynthetic," indicating that they have a large number of morphologically and phonologically bound formatives, including incorporated adjectives or adverbs.

The author highlights the lack of specific criteria for defining "wordhood" or "phonological autonomy" in these languages. This lack of clarity aligns with the absence of a concept of the modern word in earlier grammars of Insular Celtic languages, such as Middle Welsh and Early Irish. In these grammars, the focal or geir, respectively, were used as units of description, referring to any kind of syntactic group or syllables that form correct utterances.

The introduction acknowledges recent typological research indicating that languages may lack a unified word domain and that different parts of speech within the same language can exhibit varying patterns of wordhood. Based on this understanding, the study focuses specifically on the verbal complex of Middle Welsh prose in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, excluding other parts of speech. This decision is justified by the observation that wordhood patterns can differ across different parts of speech.

The verbal complex in Middle Welsh prose is defined as the finite verb and its satellites. The author discusses an example of a verbal complex containing eight markers, including a subordinating conjunction, negative marker, object marker, resultative marker, lexical root, TAM marker, agreement, and TAM marker, and a bound pronoun. These markers will be explored in greater detail in Section 3 of the study.

The overall structure of the study is divided into three main parts. Section 2 introduces the approach taken in the study, Section 3 delves into the morphological structuring of the verbal complex, and Section 4 explores the phonological and prosodic processes within the verbal complex and how they relate to the morphological structure outlined in Section 3. The final Section 5 summarizes and discusses the findings of the study and suggests potential areas for further research.

In summary, the introduction of this Zora article provides background information on the Insular Celtic languages' distinctive linguistic characteristics, particularly focusing on the complex structures found in Middle Welsh prose. It also emphasizes the need for a clearer understanding of wordhood and phonological autonomy in these languages, highlighting the limitations of existing grammatical concepts.
