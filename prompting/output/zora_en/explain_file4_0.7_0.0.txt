This introduction sets the stage for the present study, highlighting the importance of imitation in human culture and its role in language and cognitive development. It emphasizes that previous research on imitation abilities has primarily focused on specific aspects of imitation and has not thoroughly examined the relationship between different types of imitation skills in young preschoolers.

The article mentions that imitation skills, which involve intentionally replicating others' behaviors or actions, play a fundamental role in language development and social communication. It cites various studies that have shown the link between imitation behaviors and language production, comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and sociopragmatic skills in infants and young children. Additionally, it discusses studies that have explored the relationship between imitation and language development in populations with language impairments or Autism Spectrum Disorder.

The introduction also highlights the limited research on the comparison of different types of imitation skills, specifically language-based imitation and object-based imitation. It mentions studies that suggest language-based imitation has stronger links to language abilities, while object-based imitation is associated with play skills. However, the article notes that these studies have not taken an integrated multimodal view of language-based imitation, which includes gestural, prosodic, and verbal/lexical components.

The article argues that young preschoolers' abilities to accurately perform multimodal imitation of socially relevant events may be positively correlated with language and sociopragmatic skills. It emphasizes the importance of studying this developmental period since children are delving into complex areas of language and acquiring school readiness skills. The article also highlights the need to investigate imitation from an integrated multimodal perspective, considering the parallel development and alignment of prosody, gesture, and verbal content in language.

Overall, the introduction introduces the research gap and the main hypothesis of the study, emphasizing the importance of studying the relationship between multimodal language-based imitation and object-based imitation skills in young preschoolers. It also provides a rationale for the study by citing previous research and highlighting the need for an integrated multimodal perspective on language-based imitation.
