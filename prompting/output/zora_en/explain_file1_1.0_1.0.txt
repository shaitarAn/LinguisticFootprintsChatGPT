The introduction to this Zora article discusses the concept of reference in conversation. The author explains that when people interact, they often refer to entities that are relevant to their conversation. This is typically done using referring expressions with noun phrases (NP REs) at their center, which can include pronouns, definite and indefinite descriptions, or proper nouns.

The introduction then introduces two types of changes-in-interaction that can be observed in NP REs during interactive communication. Firstly, it is noted that as speakers engage in conversation, their contributions tend to become more similar both lexically (in terms of the words used) and grammatically. This convergence on forms of expression has been linked to speakers aligning on their linguistic representations and has been well-documented in psycholinguistic research.

Secondly, it is mentioned that interlocutors also tend to shorten their contributions over the course of an interaction. This phenomenon is referred to as "referential contraction." While both processes generally occur in parallel during interaction, the focus of this chapter is primarily on the shortening process.

The chapter aims to describe central trends of structural change-in-interaction in NP REs produced over multiple rounds of interactive dialogue. The research questions addressed include: 1) To what degree do speakers' NP REs get shortened during a dialogic interaction? Which elements are subject to shortening? 2) What structural changes can be observed across four rounds of an interactive referential communication task?

To investigate these changes-in-interaction, a referential communication task was devised where participants engaged in spoken dialogue over four rounds while repeatedly referring to the same visual stimuli. An example from this corpus illustrates a typical trajectory where NP REs change from longer forms at the beginning (e.g., "it's green") to shorter forms later on (e.g., "green").

The focus then shifts towards describing how speakers change their preferred grammatical structure for NP REs as they converge on forms of expression and shorten their contributions. The aim is to examine general tendencies regarding the types and forms of modifying and descriptive elements in the NP RE construction throughout the interaction.

The study also relates its findings to previous research on change-in-interaction, particularly regarding compression in NP REs. The research is contextualized within theoretical approaches such as the Interactive Alignment Model (IAM) and discussions of familiarity and accessibility.

Section 3 introduces the experimental set-up used to elicit a corpus of spoken English dialogues, while Section 4 presents an analysis of structural changes in NP REs over the course of these interactions. The analysis reveals that as NP REs get shortened, their structure changes from more elaborated clausal forms to more compressed phrasal forms in later rounds.

Finally, Section 5 discusses these findings in relation to Biber and Clark's notion of compression as a change that occurs when there is a need to convey a large amount of information efficiently. This allows language users to be more efficient when communicating with an expert audience.

Overall, this introduction provides an overview of reference in conversation, discusses two types of changes-in-interaction observed in NP REs, outlines research questions for investigation, explains the experimental set-up used for data collection, and previews the subsequent sections that present analyses and discuss theoretical implications.
