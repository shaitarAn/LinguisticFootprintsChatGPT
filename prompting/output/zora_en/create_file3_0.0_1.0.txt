Title: The Role of Verb Morphology in Middle Welsh: A Comparative Analysis

Abstract: The - for European languages - large amount of bound elements in the older Insular Celtic languages and the array of phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures have lead several researchers to conclude that individual words play a lesser role in the grammars of those languages. Based on current typological research on wordhood and a thorough discussion of the problems and limitations of studying wordhood in corpus languages, this article gives an in-depth investigation of the morphological and phonological word-like domains in the Middle Welsh verbal complex. There are several structures that could be labelled ‘word’ on the basis of the findings presented here, which leads to the conclusion that the term is not very useful for the synchronic description of this language.

1. Introduction

The study of verb morphology has long been a topic of interest among linguists due to its crucial role in understanding language structure and organization. In particular, investigating how verbs are formed, inflected, and interact with other linguistic elements sheds light on various aspects such as syntax, semantics, phonology, and morphology.

Middle Welsh is an intriguing case study within this domain as it exhibits a rich array of bound elements within its verbal complex. These bound elements have raised questions regarding their impact on traditional notions surrounding individual words' significance within grammatical frameworks. Several researchers have argued that Middle Welsh challenges conventional assumptions about wordhood due to its intricate morphophonological patterns.

This paper aims to contribute to our understanding by conducting a comprehensive analysis focused specifically on verb morphology in Middle Welsh. By examining both phonological interactions within morphological structures as well as broader phrasal contexts, we seek to explore whether traditional notions surrounding individual words adequately capture linguistic phenomena observed within this language.

To achieve our research goals effectively, we will adopt an interdisciplinary approach drawing upon insights from typology research concerning wordhood across different languages. By considering the problems and limitations associated with studying wordhood in corpus languages, we aim to provide a robust framework for investigating the morphological and phonological word-like domains in Middle Welsh.

The primary research question guiding this study is: How do the morphological and phonological structures within the Middle Welsh verbal complex challenge or align with traditional notions of wordhood? To address this question, we will analyze a diverse range of linguistic data from Middle Welsh texts, employing both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our analysis will focus on identifying patterns of morphophonological interactions within verb forms as well as examining their distribution across different syntactic contexts.

By delving into these intricate linguistic phenomena, we hope to shed light on the nature of verb morphology in Middle Welsh and its implications for our understanding of language structure more broadly. Furthermore, our findings may contribute to ongoing debates surrounding wordhood typology by providing insights from a lesser-studied language.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of relevant literature on verb morphology and wordhood typology. Section 3 outlines our methodology for data collection and analysis. In Section 4, we present our findings regarding the distribution of phonological and morphological domains within the Middle Welsh verbal complex. Finally, Section 5 discusses the implications of our results for current theories on language structure and concludes with suggestions for future research directions.

In summary, this study aims to deepen our understanding of verb morphology in Middle Welsh by exploring its intricate relationship with traditional notions surrounding individual words' significance. Through an interdisciplinary approach that combines typology research insights with detailed analysis of linguistic data, we seek to contribute valuable insights into both Middle Welsh grammar specifically and broader discussions surrounding wordhood typology more generally.
