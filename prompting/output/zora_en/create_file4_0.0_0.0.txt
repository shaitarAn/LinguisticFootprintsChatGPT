1. Introduction

The role of imitation skills in language development has been extensively studied in infants, with a particular focus on object- and language-based imitation during the first two years of life. However, there is a paucity of research examining the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors in later stages of development, particularly during the preschool years. This gap in the literature calls for an investigation into the relationship between multimodal imitation, encompassing gestural, prosodic, and lexical components, and its association with narrative performance and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool children.

While previous studies have explored the impact of imitation on language development, few have systematically compared the influence of different types of imitation on narrative skills and sociopragmatics in preschoolers. Understanding the link between imitation and these socio-communicative abilities is crucial for gaining insights into the broader conceptualization of imitation behaviors within the context of language development.

The present study aims to address this research gap by examining the relationship between multimodal imitation and object-based imitation, and their respective associations with narrative abilities and sociopragmatic skills in typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children. By employing a correlational design, we seek to determine whether preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is strongly related to their language and sociocommunicative skills.

The findings of this study will contribute to our understanding of the role of imitation in language development beyond infancy, shedding light on the specific aspects of imitation that are most closely linked to narrative performance and sociopragmatic abilities. Moreover, the results will provide valuable insights for educators, clinicians, and researchers working with preschool children, informing interventions and strategies aimed at enhancing language and socio-communicative development.

In summary, this study aims to extend the existing literature on imitation and language development by investigating the relationship between multimodal imitation, object-based imitation, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool children. By elucidating the specific aspects of imitation that are most strongly associated with language and socio-communicative skills, this research will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of imitation in language development and inform future interventions in this domain.
