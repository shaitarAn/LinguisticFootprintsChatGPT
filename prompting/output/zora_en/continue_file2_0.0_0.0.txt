Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and effective communication about this issue is crucial for generating public awareness and action. Over the past few decades, there has been a significant increase in research on the framing of climate change communication. Framing refers to the way in which information is presented and interpreted, and it plays a key role in shaping public perceptions and attitudes towards climate change.

However, despite the growing body of literature on framing climate change, there is a lack of consensus on how to define and operationalize framing in this context. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to synthesize the theoretical and empirical insights from existing studies. In order to address this gap, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of framing in climate change communication, drawing on 25 years of peer-reviewed literature.

To conduct this review, a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches of content analysis were employed. A total of 275 peer-reviewed articles were included in the analysis, covering a wide range of topics related to the framing of climate change. These articles were analyzed based on their frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, in order to compare and contrast the different perspectives and approaches within the field.

One of the key findings of this review is that there has been a lack of utilization of framing's bridging potential in climate change communication research. Framing has the power to bridge different perspectives and bring together diverse stakeholders, but this potential has not been fully explored in the literature. This conceptual (mis)fit between frame locations is a significant gap in the current understanding of framing in climate change communication.

The review also highlights the need for further research in this area. While there has been a significant increase in the number of studies on framing climate change, there are still many unanswered questions and areas that require further exploration. For example, more research is needed on the role of cultural and societal factors in shaping frames, as well as the effectiveness of different framing strategies in different contexts.

In conclusion, this systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of framing in climate change communication, drawing on 25 years of literature. It highlights the lack of utilization of framing's bridging potential in this field and calls for further research to address this gap. By better understanding the role of framing in climate change communication, we can improve our ability to effectively communicate about this urgent issue and mobilize action at all levels of society.
