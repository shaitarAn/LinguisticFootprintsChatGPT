Swiss Standard German (SSG) is one of the official languages in Switzerland, but there has been limited research on its phonetic properties. Particularly, studies on Alemannic (ALM) dialects, which heavily influence SSG, have focused more on consonants than vowels. This study aims to address this research gap by investigating the long-vowel inventories of four ALM dialects and their respective SSG varieties in terms of vowel quality. The study also explores the extent to which interference from ALM dialects shapes the vowel qualities of SSG varieties.

In order to achieve these goals, eight speakers (four male and four female) from Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich were recorded producing each vowel three times. This resulted in a corpus of 1,632 tokens for analysis. Acoustic analysis was conducted to compare vowel qualities across these dialects.

The results indicate that ALM vowel quality is largely transferred to the SSG varieties in two dialect regions: Chur and Brig. In these regions, the vowel qualities observed in ALM dialects closely align with those found in their respective SSG varieties. However, there are variations when it comes to certain vowels.

In Bern and Zurich's SSG varieties, some vowel qualities did not match those found in their corresponding ALM dialects. Specifically, <a> was fronted in both Bern and Zurich's SSG varieties compared to their ALM counterparts. Additionally,<ä> was produced as both [ɛː] and [æː] by speakers from Bern's SSG variety.Furthermore,o tended to be pronounced further back as comparedto other regions.

Overall, this study provides the first comparative acoustic analysis of vowel qualities in ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties. It highlights the influence of ALM dialects on SSG vowel qualities, with variations seen across different regions. This research contributes to a better understanding of the phonetic properties of SSG and offers insights into how dialectal interference shapes the pronunciation of Swiss Standard German vowels. Further research could delve into other phonetic aspects and explore wider geographical areas to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Swiss Standard German phonetics.
