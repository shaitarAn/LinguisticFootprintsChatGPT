Imitation is a fundamental aspect of human development, particularly in the acquisition of language and social communication skills. Previous research has shown that infants as young as 9 to 20 months old demonstrate early imitation skills, both object-based and language-based, which are predictive of later language development. However, there is limited research on the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors in preschool-aged children.

The aim of this correlational study was to investigate whether preschoolers' multimodal imitation skills, including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components, as well as object-based imitation skills were related to their narrative abilities and sociopragmatic abilities. It was hypothesized that children who demonstrated stronger imitation skills would also exhibit better narrative and sociopragmatic abilities.

Participants in this study were 31 typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children. Four tasks were administered to assess their imitation skills (both multimodal and object-based), narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities. The multimodal imitation task involved observing an adult model performing a series of actions accompanied by gestures, prosody changes in speech patterns, and specific words or phrases. The object-based imitation task required the child to imitate a series of actions involving objects without any accompanying social cues.

Results from this study revealed a significant relationship between both narrative abilities and sociopragmatic abilities with multimodal imitation skills. However, there was no significant relationship found between these language-related outcomes with object-based imitation skills. This suggests that preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is strongly associated with their language development and sociocommunicative competence.

These findings support the notion that imitation behaviors should be conceptualized more broadly within the field of language development by incorporating not only verbal linguistic patterns but also prosodic features and gestural cues. By considering all these components together when assessing children's imitative behaviors, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how imitation relates to language and social communication skills.

The results of this study have important implications for early intervention programs targeting language and social communication difficulties in preschool-aged children. By focusing on enhancing children's multimodal imitation skills, professionals can potentially improve their narrative abilities and sociopragmatic competence. This could be achieved through interventions that provide opportunities for children to observe and imitate socially relevant gestures, prosody changes, and verbal linguistic patterns.

It is worth noting that this study had some limitations. The sample size was relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study only included typically developing children, so it is unclear whether similar relationships would be observed in children with developmental delays or disorders.

In conclusion, this correlational study provides evidence for the link between preschoolers' multimodal imitation skills and their narrative abilities as well as sociopragmatic competence. These findings highlight the importance of considering not only object-based imitation but also gestural, prosodic, and verbal linguistic patterns when assessing imitation behaviors in relation to language development. Future research should further explore these relationships in larger samples and include children with developmental delays or disorders to better understand the implications for clinical practice.
