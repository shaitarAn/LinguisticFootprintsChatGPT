Imitation is a fundamental aspect of human development, particularly in the acquisition of language and social communication skills. Previous research has shown that infants' early imitation skills, such as object- and language-based imitation, are predictive of later language development. However, there is limited research on the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors in preschool-aged children.

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between multimodal imitation skills (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components) and both narrative abilities and sociopragmatic abilities in preschoolers. It sought to determine whether preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is related to their language and sociocommunicative skills.

A total of thirty-one typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children participated in this correlational study. They were assessed on four tasks: multimodal imitation, object-based imitation, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities. The researchers hypothesized that there would be a significant relationship between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative abilities (the ability to construct coherent stories) and sociopragmatic abilities (the ability to use appropriate social communication strategies).

The results revealed that both narrative skills and sociopragmatic skills were significantly related to multimodal imitation but not object-based imitation. This suggests that preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant cues across multiple modalities (gestural, prosodic, lexical) is strongly associated with their language development as well as their ability to engage in effective social communication.

These findings have important implications for our understanding of the role of imitation in language development. Traditionally, research has focused primarily on object-based or verbal linguistic patterns when studying imitation behaviors. However, this study highlights the importance of considering a broader range of cues involved in social interaction.

By integrating prosodic features (such as intonation), gestural components (such as hand movements), and verbal linguistic patterns into our conceptualization of imitation, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how children acquire language and develop sociocommunicative skills. This broader perspective on imitation behaviors may inform interventions and educational practices aimed at promoting language development and social communication in preschool-aged children.

In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the link between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative abilities and sociopragmatic abilities in preschoolers. It emphasizes the importance of considering a wide range of cues involved in social interaction when studying imitation behaviors. Future research should further explore the specific mechanisms underlying this relationship and investigate potential interventions that can enhance multimodal imitation skills to support language development and sociocommunicative abilities in young children.
