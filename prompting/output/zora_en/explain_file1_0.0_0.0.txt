In this introduction, the author discusses the concept of reference in conversation and how it is commonly expressed through noun phrases (NP REs). They explain that during interactive communication, changes can be observed in the NP REs produced by speakers, which they refer to as changes-in-interaction. These changes include lexical and grammatical convergence, where speakers align their linguistic representations, as well as referential contraction, where interlocutors tend to shorten their contributions.

The author states that the focus of this chapter is on the process of referential contraction and describes the research questions that will be addressed. They want to understand the degree to which speakers' NP REs are shortened over the course of a dialogic interaction and which elements of the NP REs are subject to shortening. They also aim to observe structural changes in the production of NP REs across multiple rounds of interactive dialogue.

To investigate these changes, the author devised a referential communication task that involved spoken dialogic conversation over four rounds of interaction. The participants repeatedly referred to the same sets of visual stimuli. The author provides an example from the resulting corpus of spoken interactive dialogue to illustrate the shortening process and convergence on a particular NP RE.

The author explains that the study focuses on how speakers change in terms of their preferred grammatical structure for the NP REs they produce as they converge on forms of expression and shorten their contributions. They aim to describe general tendencies regarding the types and forms of modifying and descriptive elements in the NP RE construction throughout the interaction.

The author discusses the concept of compression, which refers to both the shortening process and the changes in structural preferences observed in the study. They explain that the structure of the NP REs changes from the initial presence of post-head clausal elements to a greater frequency of phrasal modification as the interaction progresses.

In the following sections, the author discusses previous research on change-in-interaction, contextualizes the findings within theoretical approaches related to the production of NP REs, and introduces the experimental set-up used to elicit a corpus of spoken English dialogues. They then present an analysis of the structural changes in NP REs over the course of the dialogical interactions.

The analysis shows that as NP REs get shortened, particularly in terms of the length of post-head elements, their structure changes from initially more elaborated, clausal forms to more compressed, phrasal forms in later rounds of interaction. The author discusses these findings in relation to the notion of compression as a change that occurs in response to the demand for conveying a large amount of information efficiently.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the study on changes-in-interaction in the use of NP REs and outlines the research questions, methodology, and expected findings.
