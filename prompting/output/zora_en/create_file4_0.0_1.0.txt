1. Introduction

The development of imitation skills in early childhood has long been recognized as a crucial factor in language acquisition and social communication. Previous research has extensively examined the relationship between infants' imitation abilities and their subsequent language development, particularly focusing on object- and language-based imitation skills (Smith, 2005; Meltzoff & Moore, 1977). However, there remains a paucity of systematic investigations into the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors later on in development.

This study aims to address this gap by exploring the association between preschool children's multimodal imitation skills (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components) and their narrative performance and sociopragmatic abilities. By examining how different forms of imitation relate to these important aspects of language development, we can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to children's linguistic competence.

Narrative abilities play a fundamental role in children's cognitive and linguistic development (Berman & Slobin, 1994). The ability to construct coherent narratives not only reflects children's comprehension and production skills but also demonstrates their capacity for organizing events temporally and causally (Bamberg & Damrad-Frye, 1991). Moreover, narratives serve as an essential tool for social interaction by allowing individuals to share experiences with others (Bruner, 1986). Therefore, investigating the relationship between preschoolers' narrative performance and multimodal imitation can shed light on how imitative behaviors contribute to their communicative competence.

In addition to narrative abilities, sociopragmatic skills are crucial for successful social interactions. Sociopragmatics refers to individuals' ability to use appropriate verbal or nonverbal communication strategies within specific social contexts (Tomasello et al., 2005). It encompasses understanding pragmatic cues such as turn-taking norms or using polite speech acts like requesting or thanking appropriately. Given that multimodal cues are integral components of sociocommunicative interactions, it is essential to examine the relationship between preschoolers' sociopragmatic abilities and their ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues.

To investigate these relationships, a correlational study was conducted with typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children. The study employed four tasks: assessing multimodal imitation, object-based imitation, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities. By examining the associations between these variables, we aimed to determine whether preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is strongly related to their language and sociocommunicative skills.

The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of imitation behaviors in the field of language development. By systematically integrating prosodic, gestural, and verbal linguistic patterns into our conceptualization of imitation skills, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how children acquire language and develop effective communication strategies.

In summary, this paper aims to explore the relationship between preschool children's multimodal imitation skills and their narrative performance as well as sociopragmatic abilities. By investigating these associations in a systematic manner, we hope to contribute valuable insights into the role of imitation behaviors in language development.
