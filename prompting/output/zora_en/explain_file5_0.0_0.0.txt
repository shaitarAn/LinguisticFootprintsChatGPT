The introduction of this Zora article provides background information on the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland, specifically focusing on the use of two varieties of German: Alemannic dialects (ALM) for oral communication and Swiss Standard German (SSG) for written communication. It explains that while everyone in German-speaking Switzerland is a native speaker of a local dialect, SSG is learned in school. The article mentions that both ALM and SSG can be used in each other's domains to some extent, and Swiss people often code-switch between the two. The introduction also highlights that there have been previous studies reporting interferences between the two varieties on various linguistic levels.

Regarding the specific topic of the study, which is vowels, the introduction mentions that there have been limited acoustic studies on ALM dialects and SSG vowels. It states that only one study has compared ALM and SSG vowels in specific locations, but only the SSG vowels were transcribed auditorily. Therefore, the current study aims to systematically investigate the vowel qualities of four ALM dialects and their respective SSG varieties using an instrumental phonetic approach. It also mentions that the study will analyze the extent to which SSG vowel qualities are influenced by the speakers' dialect.

The introduction further provides information on the ALM dialects in German-speaking Switzerland, dividing them into three subgroups: Low ALM, High ALM, and Highest ALM. The study focuses on High and Highest ALM, which are defined by multiple isoglosses that divide German-speaking Switzerland into a northern and southern half. The most well-known isogloss is hiatus diphthongisation, where the northern half has developed a diphthong in certain positions, while the southern half maintains a monophthong. The introduction also mentions the existence of an east-west divide based on phonetic, lexical, and morphosyntactic isoglosses, with examples such as /l/-vocalisation separating the western and eastern parts.

In conclusion, the introduction provides an overview of the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland, introduces the research topic of vowels in ALM dialects and SSG, and outlines the specific objectives of the study.
