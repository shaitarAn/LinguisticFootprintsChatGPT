This introduction is discussing the concept of framing in communication research and the need for a systematic review of how framing has been applied across different aspects of communication. The article highlights the unique characteristic of framing in its ability to consider the entire communication process and bridge different perspectives. The author argues that previous systematic reviews have not fully utilized framing's bridging potential. The article then focuses on the framing of climate change as the specific topic for the systematic review. The importance of studying framing in climate change communication is emphasized due to the topic's global significance and the challenges associated with communicating it, such as complexity and scientific uncertainty. The author also mentions the normative expectation of studying framing to develop communication strategies and support actions to address climate change. The article further highlights the growing research on framing in climate change communication and the limited number of systematic reviews available in communication research overall. The study aims to conduct a systematic review that compares findings in climate change framing with findings in framing research in general. The focus will be on identifying the most salient frames across various aspects of communication to gain insights into the cultural framing repository and address any conceptual misfits. The study plans to use a combination of quantitative and qualitative content analysis based on 25 years of published literature on climate change framing.
