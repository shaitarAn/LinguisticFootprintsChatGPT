The introduction of this Zora article begins by highlighting framing as a popular theoretical approach in communication research. It acknowledges that although many studies refer to framing, there is a lack of consistent definitions, resulting in a variety of phenomena being classified under this concept. This diversity makes it challenging to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights in communication research, leading to the need for systematic reviews.

The article suggests that existing reviews on framing have not fully utilized one of its unique characteristics, which is its ability to bridge different perspectives within the communication process. Framing can encompass strategic communication by various actors, journalistic cognitions and reporting, audience frames, framing effects, and the broader cultural contexts in which frames emerge and compete for attention.

The article argues that by systematically reviewing how framing has been applied across these different aspects of the communication process, researchers can gain insights into the cultural framing repository. This repository refers to the environment in which salient and culturally/cognitively available frames compete.

The authors state that conducting such a review is best done by selecting a specific topic with a wealth of available studies. In this case, they choose to focus on the framing of climate change. They justify this choice by noting that climate change is a crucial global problem and that understanding its communication is highly relevant. The complexity and uncertainty surrounding climate change also make it a unique topic that requires framing to effectively break through communication barriers.

The authors suggest that studying framing in climate change communication can also contribute to developing communication strategies, building consensus, and supporting actions to fight climate change. They argue that as research on framing in climate change communication is steadily growing, conducting a systematic review can help take stock of existing knowledge and guide future research in this field.

Additionally, they point out the limited number of systematic reviews available for framing in communication research overall, and how understanding field-specific applications in climate change communication can inform framing research more broadly. The article states that researching framing across different subtopics, such as health communication, can provide valuable insights that contribute to the knowledge gap in systematic reviews.

The authors state that their study will conduct a systematic review on the framing of climate change, comparing findings to reviews covering framing in communication research overall. They aim to connect research on frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects to identify the conceptual fit or misfit across different aspects of framing. This analysis will help determine whether subsequent studies in climate change communication are building on and contributing to existing frames, thereby closing the communication cycle on this pressing issue.

The study will utilize a combination of quantitative and qualitative content analysis, drawing on 25 years of published literature on climate change framing.

Overall, the introduction highlights the importance of framing as a theoretical approach in communication research and proposes conducting a systematic review on framing in climate change communication to bridge gaps in existing literature and provide insights into the cultural framing repository.
