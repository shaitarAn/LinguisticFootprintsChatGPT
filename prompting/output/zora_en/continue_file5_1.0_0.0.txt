Swiss Standard German (SSG) is one of the official languages in Switzerland, but its phonetic properties have not been extensively studied. Among the Alemannic (ALM) dialects, most research has focused on consonants rather than vowels. This study aims to address this research gap by investigating the long-vowel inventories of four ALM dialects and their respective SSG varieties with a focus on vowel quality. 

The study has two main objectives. Firstly, it aims to provide a comparative acoustic analysis of ALM and SSG vowels. By analyzing the recordings of four male and four female speakers from Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich, the study collected a corpus of 1,632 vowel tokens. Each speaker produced each vowel three times to ensure reliability of the results.

The analysis of the data revealed interesting findings regarding vowel quality in ALM and SSG varieties. In the dialects of Chur and Brig, the vowel qualities observed in ALM were largely transferred to the SSG varieties. This suggests a strong influence of the dialects on the vowel qualities of SSG spoken in these regions. 

However, the SSG varieties spoken in Bern and Zurich exhibited some deviations from the vowel qualities observed in the corresponding ALM dialects. These deviations were most prominent in the fronting of the vowel <a> in the SSG varieties of both dialects. Instead of matching the ALM pronunciation, the SSG varieties in Bern and Zurich featured a fronted <a>. 

Furthermore, the study found that the SSG variety in Bern exhibited variation in the pronunciation of the vowel <ä>. It was produced as both [ɛː] and [æː], indicating potential dialectal variation within the SSG variety spoken in Bern. Additionally, the vowel <o> was realized further back in the Bern SSG variety compared to the ALM dialect.

Overall, the findings of this study suggest that the vowel qualities of ALM dialects have influenced the vowel qualities of SSG varieties, albeit to different extents. In some dialect regions, such as Chur and Brig, the ALM vowel qualities were largely transferred to the SSG varieties. However, in other regions, such as Bern and Zurich, certain vowel qualities did not match those of the corresponding ALM dialects.

These findings contribute to a better understanding of the phonetic properties of SSG and the influence of ALM dialects on its vowel qualities. Further research can build upon this study by investigating other phonetic properties of SSG and exploring the factors that contribute to the variation in vowel qualities observed in different dialect regions.
