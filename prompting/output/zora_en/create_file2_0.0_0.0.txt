1. Introduction

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time, with far-reaching implications for the environment, society, and the economy. As the scientific consensus on the causes and consequences of climate change has solidified over the past few decades, there has been a growing recognition of the need for effective communication strategies to engage the public and policymakers in addressing this complex issue. 

While numerous studies have examined various aspects of climate change communication, there remains a need for a comprehensive understanding of how different frames are used to shape public discourse and influence attitudes and behaviors. Framing, as a theoretical concept, offers a valuable lens through which to analyze and interpret the diverse range of messages and narratives surrounding climate change.

The concept of framing, rooted in social psychology and communication theory, refers to the process by which individuals and groups construct meaning and interpret information within a particular context. It involves selecting certain aspects of an issue and emphasizing them while downplaying or omitting others, thereby influencing how the issue is understood and evaluated by different audiences. In the context of climate change, framing can play a crucial role in shaping public perceptions, policy debates, and individual actions.

Despite the growing body of literature on framing in climate change communication, there remains a lack of consensus on its conceptualization and operationalization. This lack of clarity hampers the synthesis of theoretical and empirical insights, limiting our ability to draw meaningful conclusions and inform effective communication strategies. Therefore, this paper aims to address this gap by conducting a systematic review of the framing literature on climate change, spanning a period of 25 years.

Building on the work of previous reviews on framing research, this study seeks to examine the trends and patterns of framing in climate change communication and compare them to broader trends observed in communication research overall. By adopting a comprehensive approach that considers frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of how framing operates in the context of climate change.

To achieve this, we employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative content analysis of peer-reviewed literature on the framing of climate change. By analyzing a diverse range of studies, encompassing different disciplines, methodologies, and theoretical perspectives, we aim to capture the breadth and depth of framing research in this field.

Through this systematic review, we aim to shed light on the current state of framing research in climate change communication and identify gaps and opportunities for future research. Specifically, we will explore the extent to which framing has been utilized as a bridging concept, capable of integrating diverse perspectives and facilitating dialogue among stakeholders with differing views on climate change.

By critically examining the conceptual (mis)fit between frame locations and identifying potential avenues for future research, this study seeks to contribute to the development of more effective communication strategies that can bridge divides and foster constructive engagement on climate change. Ultimately, our findings aim to inform policymakers, practitioners, and researchers on how to effectively frame climate change messages to promote understanding, engagement, and action.
