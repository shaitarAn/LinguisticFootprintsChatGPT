Narrative Performance and Sociopragmatic Abilities in Preschool Children are Linked to Multimodal Imitation Skills

1. Introduction

Language development in early childhood is a complex process that involves a multitude of cognitive, social, and linguistic factors. One crucial aspect of language development is the ability to imitate various communicative behaviors, both object-based and language-based, which has been widely examined in research focused on infants and toddlers. However, more studies are needed to explore the long-term implications of these early imitation skills in later stages of development, particularly in the preschool years.

Imitation plays a fundamental role in language acquisition as it provides children with opportunities to observe, internalize, and reproduce the communicative behaviors that they encounter in their social environment. Early research has primarily focused on infants and toddlers, demonstrating the importance of early imitation skills in relation to language development (e.g., Bates, Benigni, Bretherton, Camaioni, & Volterra, 1979; Meltzoff, 1988). However, there is a lack of systematic investigations exploring the joint relevance of both object-based and multimodal imitation behaviors in preschool-aged children.

This study aims to fill this research gap by exploring the relationship between preschool children's multimodal imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities. Multimodal imitation refers to the ability to imitate various aspects of communication, such as gestural, prosodic, and lexical components, while object-based imitation pertains to the imitation of object-related actions. By examining both types of imitation, this study seeks to understand the specific contributions of each to language development and sociocommunicative skills in the preschool years.

Narrative skills, which involve the ability to construct coherent and meaningful stories, are highly important for language development and social interaction. Previous research has shown correlations between narrative abilities and language development (e.g., Dickinson & Tabors, 2001; Sénéchal & LeFevre, 2002). However, the link between narrative skills and imitation behaviors, particularly multimodal imitation, remains underexplored in the preschool context.

Moreover, sociopragmatic abilities, encompassing a child's understanding and use of social norms in communication, are essential for successful social interactions. These abilities involve the comprehension and production of pragmatically appropriate language, turn-taking, understanding nonverbal cues, and adapting to different socio-cultural contexts. While sociopragmatic abilities have been recognized as vital for effective communication (e.g., Milligan, Astington, & Dack, 2007; 2012), their specific associations with different types of imitation behaviors in preschool-aged children need further investigation.

This correlational study addresses these research gaps by examining a sample of typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children. By administering tasks to assess multimodal imitation, object-based imitation, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities, this study aims to explore the associations between imitation skills, narrative performance, and sociopragmatic abilities.

Understanding the relationships between imitation behaviors, narrative skills, and sociopragmatic abilities in the preschool years can provide valuable insights into the development of language and social communication skills. Additionally, this study contributes to a broader conceptualization of imitation behaviors in the field of language development, highlighting the importance of considering not only object-based imitation but also socially relevant multimodal cues encompassing prosodic, gestural, and verbal linguistic patterns.

In conclusion, this study addresses the need for further exploration of the joint relevance of multimodal and object-based imitation behaviors in preschool children. By investigating the associations between imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities, this research aims to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the role of imitation in language development and sociocommunicative skills during the crucial preschool years. The findings from this study have significant implications for educational and clinical interventions aimed at promoting language development and improving social communication skills in young children.
