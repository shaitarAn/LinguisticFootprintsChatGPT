Title: The Role of Multimodal Imitation Skills in the Development of Social-Emotional Competence in Preschool Children

Abstract: This article investigates the importance of multimodal imitation skills in the development of social-emotional competence in preschool children. Previous research has extensively explored the significance of early imitation skills, such as object-based and language-based imitation, in relation to language development in infants. However, little attention has been given to examining the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors as children progress in their development. Hence, this study aims to explore whether preschoolers' ability to imitate multimodal cues, including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components, is linked to their narrative performance and sociopragmatic abilities.

In the present correlational study, thirty-one typically developing children aged 3 to 4 years participated in four distinct tasks designed to assess their multimodal imitation skills, object-based imitation abilities, narrative aptitude, and sociopragmatic competencies. Through the analysis of the obtained results, we strive to determine whether there exists a significant relationship between narrative and sociopragmatic skills and the capacity to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues, while also assessing the potential differential impact of object-based imitation on these abilities.

The findings of this study will shed light on the interplay between imitation skills, language development, and sociocommunicative competence in preschool children. Moreover, the results will contribute to a broader conceptualization of imitation behaviors within the field of language development, emphasizing the importance of integrating not only verbal linguistic patterns but also prosodic and gestural components. This research holds implications for educational practitioners, speech and language therapists, and caregivers, providing valuable insights into the connection between imitation skills and social-emotional development, thus promoting effective intervention strategies to enhance children's overall communicative abilities. 

2. Introduction

Human language acquisition is a complex and multifaceted process that encompasses various cognitive, social, and linguistic factors. Researchers have long been intrigued by the role of imitation skills in language development, recognizing its significance in the early stages of infancy (Meltzoff & Moore, 1977). Early studies have primarily focused on object-based imitation, wherein infants mimic the actions of others with specific objects (Barr et al., 1996). However, recent investigations have expanded beyond object-based imitation alone, highlighting the importance of language-based imitation, wherein infants imitate vocalizations and phonetic patterns produced by caregivers or peers (Fenson et al., 2000).

While the role of imitation skills, both object-based and language-based, in early language development has been extensively explored, few studies have examined the joint relevance of these imitation behaviors as children progress in age and cognitive development. It remains unclear how preschool children's ability to imitate multimodal cues, including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components, impacts their narrative performance and sociopragmatic abilities.

Narrative performance, a crucial aspect of language development, enables individuals to construct coherent and meaningful stories, showcasing their understanding of narrative structure, sequencing, and perspective-taking (Bambini et al., 2018). Additionally, sociopragmatic abilities encompass an individual's capacity to utilize verbal and nonverbal communicative cues appropriately within social interactions (Peterson & McCabe, 1983). Understanding the relationship between these language-related skills and preschoolers' imitation abilities can provide valuable insights into the broader mechanisms underlying language acquisition and sociocommunicative development.

Therefore, the present study seeks to investigate whether preschoolers' multimodal imitation skills, encompassing gestural, prosodic, and lexical elements, are significantly related to their narrative abilities and sociopragmatic competencies. By assessing the interplay between these variables, we hope to enhance our understanding of the complex relationships between imitation skills, language development, and social-emotional competence in preschool children. Furthermore, this study aims to contribute to a holistic conceptualization of imitation behaviors, advocating for the integration of prosodic, gestural, and verbal linguistic patterns in the field of language development.

Ultimately, the findings of this research will have practical implications for educators, speech and language therapists, and parents by informing evidence-based intervention strategies to foster children's narrative and sociocommunicative skills. By uncovering the significance of multimodal imitation in preschoolers, this study addresses a crucial gap in the existing literature, advancing our current understanding of the factors shaping language acquisition and social-emotional development in early childhood.
