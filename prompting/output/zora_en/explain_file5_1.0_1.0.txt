The introduction of this Zora article begins by introducing the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland, which is often used as an example of "diglossia". Diglossia refers to a situation where two different varieties of a language are used in different contexts. In this case, the two varieties are Alemannic (ALM) dialects, commonly known as Swiss German or Mundart, used for oral communication, and Swiss Standard German (SSG), also called Schriftdeutsch, used for written communication.

The author explains that everyone in German-speaking Switzerland is a native speaker of a local dialect (ALM), while SSG is learned at school. However, both ALM and SSG can be used to some extent in each other's domains, and Swiss people generally code-switch between the two varieties quickly. This indicates that we are not dealing with a standard-dialect continuum.

Due to the inevitable contact between these two varieties, research has reported interferences on various linguistic levels such as phonetics, morphology, syntax, and lexicon. The author notes that there have been only four acoustic studies on ALM dialects specifically focusing on vowels. Regarding SSG vowels, previous studies have provided formant charts based on acoustic measurements but only one study has compared ALM and SSG vowels in certain regions.

The purpose of this current study is then introduced. It aims to systematically investigate the vowel qualities of four ALM dialects (from Bern (BE), Chur (GR), Brig (VS), and Zurich (ZH)) and their respective SSG varieties using instrumental phonetic methods. The study will provide a comparative acoustic analysis of long vowels produced by the same speakers from these regions. Additionally, it seeks to determine how much SSG vowel qualities are influenced by speakers' dialect.

Next comes a brief description of ALM dialects and the SSG varieties spoken in German-speaking Switzerland. The ALM dialects can be categorized into three subgroups: Low ALM found in Basel, High ALM in the northern half, and Highest ALM spoken in the alpine southern half. The study will primarily focus on High and Highest ALM as they make up the majority of dialects in German-speaking Switzerland.

The author explains that High and Highest ALM are defined by multiple isoglosses (lines marking linguistic boundaries) that tend to divide German-speaking Switzerland into a northern and southern half. One well-known isogloss is hiatus diphthongisation, where High ALM developed a diphthong while Highest ALM maintained a monophthong. Other phonetic phenomena, such as /l/-vocalisation, also contribute to an east-west divide within these dialect groups.

However, it is noted that the divisions between north-south and east-west are not always clear-cut and there exist multiple variants for certain words or sounds. Despite this complexity, there tends to be grouping along these two axes.

In conclusion, German-speaking Switzerland consists of four broad dialect regions when considering overlapping averaged isogloss divisions. It should be noted that this does not include Basel (which has its own Low ALM dialect) or Samnaun (where Bavarian dialect is spoken).

Overall, this introduction provides an overview of the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland with regards to diglossia and introduces the research aims of investigating vowel qualities in different dialects using instrumental phonetic methods.
