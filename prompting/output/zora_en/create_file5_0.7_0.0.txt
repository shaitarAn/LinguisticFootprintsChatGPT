Title: The Influence of Vowel Duration in Four Alemannic Dialects on the Respective Varieties of Swiss Standard German

Introduction:
Swiss Standard German (SSG) holds a prominent position as one of the official languages in Switzerland. However, despite its significance, the phonetic properties of SSG have received relatively limited attention in research. Previous studies in Alemannic (ALM) dialects, the major dialect group in Switzerland, have predominantly focused on consonantal phonetics, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of vowel characteristics in these dialects and their impact on SSG varieties.

This study aims to address this research gap and provide a comprehensive investigation of vowel duration in four distinct ALM dialects, along with its influence on the respective SSG varieties. By examining the long-vowel inventories of the ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties, we seek to shed light on the extent to which ALM dialects contribute to the vowel qualities observed in SSG varieties.

Through a comparative acoustic analysis of ALM and SSG vowels, this study seeks to achieve two primary objectives. Firstly, it aims to offer a pioneering investigation into the acoustic properties of ALM and SSG vowels, providing valuable insights into the similarities and differences between these dialects. Secondly, it aims to examine the role of ALM dialects in shaping the vowel qualities exhibited in SSG varieties, thereby contributing to our understanding of the linguistic dynamics between dialects and standard varieties.

To achieve these objectives, a corpus of speech data was collected from eight speakers, comprising four males and four females, representing four different regions: Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Each speaker produced three repetitions of every vowel, resulting in a total of 1,632 tokens. The acoustic analysis of this corpus allows for a detailed examination of vowel duration, enabling us to explore the transfer of vowel qualities from ALM dialects to their respective SSG varieties.

The preliminary findings of this study suggest that ALM vowel quality is primarily transferred to the SSG varieties in the Chur and Brig dialect regions. In contrast, the SSG varieties spoken in Bern and Zurich exhibit certain vowel qualities that do not align with those observed in the ALM dialects. Notably, the fronting of the <a> vowel in the SSG varieties of both Bern and Zurich deviates from the ALM counterparts. Furthermore, the SSG <ä> vowel in Bern displays variations, being produced as both [ɛː] and [æː], while the <o> vowel tends to be realized more towards the back.

This research presents a significant contribution to the field of dialectology and phonetics, offering a detailed analysis of vowel duration in ALM dialects and its impact on the respective SSG varieties. The findings of this study not only enhance our understanding of the phonetic characteristics of SSG but also shed light on the intricate relationship between dialects and standard varieties within the Swiss linguistic landscape.
