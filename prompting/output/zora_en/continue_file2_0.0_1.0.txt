Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. As such, it has garnered significant attention from researchers and scholars in various fields, including communication studies. The concept of framing has emerged as a valuable tool for understanding how climate change is communicated and perceived by different audiences.

Framing refers to the way in which information is presented and interpreted. It involves selecting certain aspects of an issue and highlighting them while downplaying or omitting others. By framing climate change in a particular way, communicators can shape public opinion and influence policy decisions.

In recent years, there has been a surge in research on the framing of climate change. However, this body of literature lacks clear definitions and conceptual frameworks, making it difficult to synthesize the findings into meaningful insights. This systematic review aims to address this gap by examining trends in framing research specifically related to climate change communication.

To conduct this review, we analyzed 25 years' worth of peer-reviewed literature on the framing of climate change, totaling 275 articles. We employed both quantitative and qualitative approaches to content analysis to identify common themes and patterns across these studies.

One key finding from our review is that researchers have not fully utilized framing's potential as a bridging concept. Framing can serve as a bridge between different perspectives by comparing frames across various locations: frame production (who creates the frames), frame content (what elements are emphasized), audience frames (how different groups interpret the frames), and framing effects (the impact of frames on attitudes and behaviors).

By examining these different frame locations together, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how climate change is framed within society. For example, we can compare how scientists frame climate change with how politicians or activists frame it. We can also explore how different audiences interpret these frames based on their values, beliefs, or political affiliations.

This approach allows us to identify areas where there may be misalignment between frame locations. For instance, if scientists are framing climate change in a way that is not resonating with the general public, it may be necessary to reframe the issue in a more accessible and relatable manner.

Furthermore, by examining framing effects, we can assess the impact of different frames on public opinion and behavior. For example, does framing climate change as an economic opportunity lead to greater support for renewable energy policies? Or does framing it as a national security threat increase public concern and willingness to take action?

Overall, our review highlights the need for more research that takes advantage of framing's bridging potential. By examining frame locations holistically and considering their interplay, we can gain deeper insights into how climate change is communicated and understood by different audiences.

Moving forward, we recommend that researchers adopt a more interdisciplinary approach to studying framing in climate change communication. This could involve collaborating with experts from fields such as psychology or sociology to better understand how frames are interpreted and internalized by individuals.

Additionally, future research should explore innovative methods for studying framing effects. Traditional survey-based approaches may not capture the full complexity of how frames influence attitudes and behaviors. Incorporating experimental designs or qualitative interviews could provide richer insights into this process.

In conclusion, this systematic review provides an overview of trends in framing research related to climate change communication. It emphasizes the importance of utilizing framing's bridging potential to gain a comprehensive understanding of how this issue is framed within society. By doing so, researchers can contribute valuable insights that inform effective communication strategies and policy interventions aimed at addressing climate change.
