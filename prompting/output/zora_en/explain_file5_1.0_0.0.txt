This introduction provides an overview of the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland and sets the context for the study being discussed in the article. It explains that diglossia, the use of two varieties of a language in different contexts, is present in this region. The two varieties are Alemannic dialects (ALM) for oral communication and Swiss Standard German (SSG) for written communication.

The introduction also mentions that in German-speaking Switzerland, everyone is a native speaker of a local dialect while SSG is learned at school. The two varieties can be used to some extent in each other's domains, and Swiss people often code-switch between them. This suggests that there is not a simple continuum between a standard language and a dialect.

The article highlights that previous research has reported interferences between ALM and SSG at the phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and lexical levels. However, there have been limited acoustic studies on the vowels of ALM dialects, and most previous research has focused on SSG vowels only.

Therefore, the current study aims to systematically investigate the vowel qualities of four ALM dialects and their respective SSG varieties using an instrumental phonetic approach. It specifically analyzes how SSG vowel qualities are influenced by the speakers' dialects. The introduction briefly describes the ALM dialects and SSG varieties spoken in German-speaking Switzerland and mentions that the study will focus on the High and Highest ALM dialects.

The introduction also mentions the existence of isoglosses, which are linguistic boundaries separating different dialect features. The most famous isogloss mentioned is the hiatus diphthongisation, where the northern half of German-speaking Switzerland has developed a diphthong in certain positions, while the southern half has maintained a monophthong. However, the dialect groups are not entirely homogeneous, and there are additional east-west divisions based on phonetic, lexical, and morphosyntactic features.

In conclusion, the introduction provides an overview of the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland and explains the research gap that the current study aims to fill. It also briefly mentions the dialect regions of German-speaking Switzerland and the isogloss divisions.
