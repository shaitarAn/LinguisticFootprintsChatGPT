Imitation is a fundamental aspect of human development and plays a crucial role in language acquisition. Previous research has focused primarily on the imitation skills of infants, particularly their ability to imitate objects and gestures. However, there has been limited investigation into the joint importance of these imitation behaviors later on in development. In this correlational study, we aimed to explore whether preschool children's abilities to imitate multimodal cues (including gestures, prosody, and lexical components) and object-based imitation are related to their narrative and sociopragmatic skills.

1. Narratives are an essential skill for effective communication as they allow individuals to organize events into meaningful sequences and convey information coherently. Sociopragmatic abilities refer to the understanding and appropriate use of social conventions in communication, such as turn-taking or maintaining eye contact.

2. We recruited thirty-one typically developing 3-4-year-old children for this study. Each child participated in four tasks designed to assess their multimodal imitation skills, object-based imitation abilities, narrative capabilities, and sociopragmatic skills.

3. The first task assessed multimodal imitation by presenting children with videos depicting various actions accompanied by appropriate gestures, prosody patterns (tone of voice), and verbal descriptions. The children were then asked to imitate these actions using the same combination of multimodal cues.

4.The second task evaluated object-based imitation by presenting children with a set of objects arranged in specific configurations that they were asked to replicate using similar objects.

5.The third task focused on narrative abilities by asking children to recount a familiar story or event in their own words.

6.The fourth task assessed sociopragmatic skills by observing how well children adhered to social conventions during a conversation with an adult examiner (e.g., maintaining eye contact or taking turns).

7.Our results revealed that both narrative abilities and sociopragmatic skills were significantly related to multimodal imitation but not correlated with object-based imitation. This suggests that preschoolers' ability to imitate social cues encompassing gestures, prosody, and verbal patterns strongly influences their language development and sociocommunicative abilities.

8. These findings highlight the importance of considering the broader concept of imitation behaviors in the field of language development. By integrating prosodic, gestural, and verbal linguistic patterns into our understanding of imitation skills, we gain a more comprehensive view of how children acquire language and navigate social interactions.

9. It is possible that children who are adept at imitating multimodal cues are better able to understand and produce complex narrative structures, as well as engage effectively in communicative exchanges by incorporating appropriate social conventions. Future research should explore whether intervention programs targeting multimodal imitation skills can enhance narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool children.

10.In conclusion, this study demonstrated that preschoolers' capacity to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is significantly linked to their narrative abilities and sociopragmatic skills. By broadening our perspective on imitation behaviors beyond object-based tasks to include prosodic, gestural, and verbal components, we can improve our understanding of how children develop language proficiency and succeed in social interactions.
  Overall,the findings suggest that promoting multimodal imitation skills may have important implications for supporting language development in early childhood
