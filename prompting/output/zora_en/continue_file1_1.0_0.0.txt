In communication, the use of referring expressions is essential for conveying information about entities in the conversation. One type of referring expression that is commonly used is the noun phrase at the center (NP RE). This type of expression typically consists of a noun and any modifying elements that provide additional information about the entity referred to. 

Interestingly, previous research has shown that over the course of a communicative interaction, there is a tendency for interlocutors to converge on linguistic forms and establish routines. As a result, speakers often shorten their NP REs during the conversation. This phenomenon of shortening has been observed in various types of communication, including both written and spoken language. 

The aim of the present chapter is to investigate the process of shortening in NP REs and examine the structural changes that occur as a consequence. To do this, we analyzed data from an experimentally elicited corpus of spoken English. The corpus consisted of conversations between pairs of participants who were tasked with repeatedly referring to visual stimuli in a referential communication task.

Our analysis revealed that indeed, interlocutors tend to shorten their NP REs over the course of the dialogues. Specifically, we found a decrease in the use of longer clausal post-head elements, which are typically associated with structural elaboration. On the other hand, there was a relative increase in the use of only premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification. These changes indicate a shift in the type of structural modification present in the NP REs.

Initially, speakers tended to produce more clausal elements, suggesting a preference for structural elaboration in the early stages of the interaction. However, as the conversation progressed, there was a decrease in the use of clausal elements and a corresponding increase in phrasal modification. This shift can be seen as a form of structural compression, as the NP REs become more concise.

The observed changes in the structural makeup of NP REs have implications for our understanding of interactive communication. They suggest that as interlocutors become more familiar with each other and establish routines, there is a tendency to rely on more streamlined and efficient communication strategies. By shortening and compressing their NP REs, speakers can convey information more quickly and effectively.

In conclusion, our study contributes to the growing body of research on referring expressions in interactive communication. By examining the process of shortening in NP REs and the accompanying structural changes, we shed light on how language users adapt their linguistic forms during the course of a conversation. This research has implications for fields such as natural language processing and understanding how individuals strategically adjust their language use in interactive contexts.
