Title: The Role of Lexical Bound Elements in Middle Welsh Verbal Complex: A Comparative Analysis

Abstract: The presence of numerous bound elements in the older Insular Celtic languages, including Middle Welsh, poses intriguing questions regarding the distribution of phonological and morphological domains within the verbal complex. These languages exhibit a rich array of phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures, prompting some scholars to question the significance of individual words in their grammars. Drawing upon current typological research on wordhood and considering the challenges associated with studying wordhood in corpus languages, this article aims to provide a comprehensive investigation into the role of lexical bound elements within the Middle Welsh verbal complex.

1. Introduction

The study of linguistic boundaries has long been a central focus for researchers seeking to understand language structure and organization. One particular area that has captured significant attention is determining whether individual words hold primacy or if other linguistic units play a more prominent role in certain languages.

Middle Welsh, an Insular Celtic language spoken during the medieval period, presents an intriguing case study due to its extensive use of bound elements within its verbal complex. These bound elements - encompassing both phonological and morphological domains - give rise to intricate patterns that challenge traditional notions surrounding wordhood.

Previous research has suggested that Middle Welsh exhibits features which deviate from those observed in European languages. Specifically, scholars have argued that there exists a substantial presence of bound elements accompanied by diverse phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures. Consequently, these findings have led some researchers to propose alternative frameworks for understanding language organization beyond traditional lexical units.

Drawing upon recent advances in typology research on wordhood as well as acknowledging the inherent limitations associated with studying wordhood in corpus-based investigations, this article aims to delve into an extensive examination of lexical boundaries within the Middle Welsh verbal complex. By scrutinizing various structures that could potentially be labeled as "words" based on our findings, we seek to evaluate the utility of the term "word" in providing a synchronic description of this ancient language.

In light of these considerations, this study identifies an alternate research question that aims to investigate the role and significance of lexical bound elements within the Middle Welsh verbal complex. By adopting a comparative approach and engaging with a variety of linguistic phenomena, this research intends to shed new light on the intricate patterns underlying wordhood in Middle Welsh.

The subsequent sections will present a comprehensive analysis of our findings, offering valuable insights into the nature and distribution of lexical boundaries within Middle Welsh. We will explore various linguistic structures within the verbal complex that exhibit characteristics suggestive of word-like domains, thereby contributing to our understanding of language organization in this particular context.
