Title: The Impact of Phonological and Morphological Domains on Verbhood in Middle Welsh: A Comparative Study

Abstract:
The prevalence of bound elements and the intricate phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures in older Insular Celtic languages have raised questions about the role of individual words in their grammars. This article aims to address these concerns by investigating the distribution of phonological and morphological domains within the context of verbhood in Middle Welsh. Drawing upon current typological research on wordhood, it critically examines the limitations and challenges associated with studying wordhood in corpus languages. 

1. Introduction

Language is a complex system that encompasses various levels of analysis, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics. At its core lies the concept of words - fundamental units that carry meaning and serve as building blocks for linguistic communication. However, recent scholarship has challenged this notion by suggesting that certain languages may exhibit a diminished reliance on individual words as primary grammatical units.

One such language family is Insular Celtic, which includes Middle Welsh among its members. This ancient group is known for its rich inventory of bound elements - affixes or particles that attach to other linguistic units - leading some researchers to question whether traditional notions of wordhood adequately capture their linguistic structure (Smithson et al., 2017). Moreover, Insular Celtic languages exhibit intricate phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures (Jones & Davies, 2015), further complicating our understanding of word boundaries.

The present study aims to shed light on these issues by investigating verbhood in Middle Welsh through an extensive examination of both morphological and phonological domains within its verbal complex. By analyzing existing typological research on wordhood alongside a meticulous discussion concerning corpus-based studies' inherent problems and limitations when studying this phenomenon (Williams & Evans 2018; Thomas & Roberts 2020), we aim to provide a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the word-like domains within the Middle Welsh verb.

The research question addressed in this study is whether the term "word" is a suitable descriptor for synchronic descriptions of verbhood in Middle Welsh. By examining the distribution and behavior of phonological and morphological elements within the verbal complex, we seek to identify structures that exhibit characteristics commonly associated with words. This investigation will contribute to our understanding of how Middle Welsh conceptualizes verbhood and challenges existing assumptions about word boundaries in Insular Celtic languages.

To achieve this, our study will adopt a comparative approach, drawing on data from available Middle Welsh texts compiled into corpora. A thorough examination of these sources will allow us to identify patterns and regularities within the linguistic system under investigation. Additionally, we will critically assess methodological approaches used in previous studies on wordhood, particularly those focused on corpus linguistics (Davies & Thomas 2019; Evans et al., 2020). This critical evaluation aims to refine our methodologies and ensure their applicability for investigating verbhood in Middle Welsh.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of relevant literature on wordhood theories across different languages, including discussions surrounding bound elements and phonological interactions. Section 3 outlines our methodology for data collection from corpora as well as strategies employed for analyzing morphological and phonological domains within verb complexes. Section 4 presents our findings by exploring various structures that could potentially be labeled as "words" based on empirical evidence gathered during our investigation. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a discussion on the implications of these findings for synchronic descriptions of Middle Welsh verbhood.

In summary, this empirical study seeks to contribute to ongoing debates surrounding word boundaries by investigating how phonological and morphological domains intersect within the context of verbhood in Middle Welsh. Through an extensive analysis informed by typology research alongside critical reflection on corpus-based approaches, we aim to refine our understanding of word-like structures in this language and provide valuable insights into the nature of linguistic units in Insular Celtic languages.
