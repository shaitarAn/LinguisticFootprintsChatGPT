The study of wordhood in languages has always been a complex and challenging task. In the case of Middle Welsh, a language known for its intricate verbal complex and rich morphological system, this task becomes even more daunting. This article aims to shed light on the distribution of phonological and morphological domains within the Middle Welsh verb, and to question the usefulness of the term "word" in describing this language.

2. Background

Insular Celtic languages, including Middle Welsh, are known for their extensive use of bound elements. These bound elements, such as prefixes and suffixes, often interact phonologically with the rest of the word, creating intricate morphological and phrasal structures. This has led many researchers to argue that individual words play a lesser role in the grammars of these languages compared to other European languages.

3. Typological research on wordhood

Before delving into the specifics of Middle Welsh, it is important to consider the current typological research on wordhood. This research has shown that the concept of a "word" is not universal across languages. Different languages have different criteria for what constitutes a word, and these criteria can vary greatly.

4. Problems and limitations of studying wordhood in corpus languages

Studying wordhood in corpus languages, such as Middle Welsh, presents its own set of challenges. Corpus languages are often incomplete and fragmented, making it difficult to determine the boundaries of individual words. Additionally, the lack of native speakers and the historical nature of the language further complicate the analysis.

5. Investigation of Middle Welsh verbal complex

In light of these challenges, this article presents an in-depth investigation of the morphological and phonological word-like domains in the Middle Welsh verbal complex. By analyzing various linguistic features, such as affixation patterns, phonological interactions, and syntactic structures, we aim to identify structures that could be labeled as "words" within the Middle Welsh verb.

6. Findings and conclusion

The findings of this study reveal that there are indeed several structures within the Middle Welsh verbal complex that could be considered as "words" based on traditional criteria. However, the complex nature of the language and the extensive use of bound elements make it difficult to define clear boundaries for these "words."

Therefore, we argue that the term "word" is not very useful for the synchronic description of Middle Welsh. Instead, a more nuanced approach that takes into account the intricate morphological and phonological interactions within the language is necessary.

In conclusion, this study highlights the challenges of studying wordhood in languages with complex morphological systems, such as Middle Welsh. By questioning the usefulness of the term "word" and providing a detailed analysis of the morphological and phonological domains within the Middle Welsh verb, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of this fascinating language.
