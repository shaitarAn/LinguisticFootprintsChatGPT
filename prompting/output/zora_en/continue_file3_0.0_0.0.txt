The study of wordhood in languages has always been a complex and challenging task. In the case of the older Insular Celtic languages, such as Middle Welsh, the presence of a large number of bound elements and the intricate phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures have further complicated this issue. This article aims to provide a philological study of the distribution of phonological and morphological domains in the Middle Welsh verb, with the goal of determining the role of individual words in the grammar of this language.

Before delving into the specifics of Middle Welsh, it is important to establish a framework for understanding wordhood. Typological research on wordhood has shown that the concept of a discrete, independent word is not universal across languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, have a high degree of morphological fusion, where words are not easily separable. On the other hand, languages like English have a greater degree of morphological transparency, allowing for clearer word boundaries.

In the case of Middle Welsh, the presence of bound elements and the phonological interactions within the verbal complex make it difficult to define what constitutes a word. Bound elements are morphemes that cannot stand alone as independent words and must be attached to other morphemes. In Middle Welsh, these bound elements include prefixes, suffixes, and infixes, which can alter the meaning and function of the verb.

Furthermore, the phonological interactions within the verbal complex add another layer of complexity. Middle Welsh exhibits phenomena such as consonant mutation, vowel alternation, and assimilation, which can occur within and across morphemes. These phonological processes blur the boundaries between morphemes and make it challenging to identify discrete word units.

To investigate the distribution of phonological and morphological domains in the Middle Welsh verb, a corpus-based approach is employed. The corpus consists of a wide range of Middle Welsh texts, including prose, poetry, and legal documents. The analysis focuses on the verbal complex, examining the various morphological and phonological structures present.

The findings of this study reveal that there are several structures within the Middle Welsh verbal complex that could be considered as "words" based on traditional definitions. However, the term "word" is not particularly useful for the synchronic description of Middle Welsh. Instead, it is more appropriate to describe the language in terms of morphological and phonological domains.

The morphological domains in Middle Welsh can be identified based on the presence of bound elements and their interactions with the verb stem. These bound elements can be categorized into prefixes, suffixes, and infixes, each serving a specific grammatical function. The phonological domains, on the other hand, are determined by the phonological processes that occur within and across morphemes.

In conclusion, the study of wordhood in Middle Welsh is a complex task due to the presence of bound elements and the intricate phonological interactions within the verbal complex. The findings of this study suggest that the term "word" is not particularly useful for the synchronic description of Middle Welsh. Instead, it is more appropriate to analyze the language in terms of morphological and phonological domains. This study contributes to our understanding of the grammatical structure of Middle Welsh and highlights the importance of considering the specific linguistic features of a language when studying wordhood.
