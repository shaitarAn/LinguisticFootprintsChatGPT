Title: Assessing the Influence of Framing Techniques on Public Perception of Climate Change Policies: A Comprehensive Review

Abstract: In recent years, the urgency of addressing climate change has prompted an upsurge in research focused on understanding how this complex issue is framed in communication efforts. However, despite the proliferation of studies on framing in the context of climate change, a lack of clear definitions and theoretical frameworks has hindered the synthesis of empirical insights. This systematic review aims to bridge this gap by exploring the influence of framing techniques on public perception of climate change policies. Drawing on 25 years of peer-reviewed literature on the framing of climate change, the review employs a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches to content analysis.

Given the significance of climate change and the need for effective communication strategies to engage the public in supporting policy initiatives, it is essential to critically examine the role of framing in shaping public perception. While framing research has been widely explored across various domains of communication, the specific application of framing techniques in climate change communication has not been adequately explored. By assessing the influence of framing techniques on public perception of climate change policies, this study seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the potential of framing as a strategic tool in addressing this global challenge.

2. Introduction

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, with far-reaching environmental, social, and economic consequences. Addressing this complex challenge requires not only scientific advancements and policy interventions but also effective communication strategies that engage and mobilize the public. Communication plays a pivotal role in shaping public perception, attitudes, and behaviors towards climate change, affecting the adoption of policies crucial for mitigating its impacts.

Framing, as a theoretical concept, offers a valuable lens through which to understand and analyze how messages are constructed and delivered in climate change communication efforts. Framing refers to the strategic selection and presentation of information that influences how individuals perceive and interpret an issue, thereby shaping their attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions (Entman, 1993; Scheufele & Tewksbury, 2007). By employing different frames, communicators can emphasize certain aspects of climate change, highlight specific causes or solutions, and evoke particular emotions or values in their target audiences.

While framing research has been widely explored in various domains of communication, including politics, health, and social issues, its application in the context of climate change communication remains relatively understudied. Previous studies have primarily focused on identifying the dominant frames used by different actors, examining the effects of specific frames on public opinion, or assessing the role of media in shaping climate change narratives. However, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews that systematically analyze the influence of framing techniques on public perception of climate change policies.

To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic review of the literature, drawing on 25 years of peer-reviewed research on the framing of climate change. By adopting a multidimensional approach, this review examines framing in terms of frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, contributing to the wider cultural framing repository. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative content analysis, the review aims to identify patterns, gaps, and opportunities in existing framing research, ultimately providing directions for future studies.

In the following sections, we will present the theoretical foundations of framing, discuss the relevance of framing in climate change communication, and outline the objectives and methodology of this systematic review. By critically analyzing the existing literature, this study seeks to enhance our understanding of the influence of framing techniques on public perception of climate change policies, informing the development and implementation of effective communication strategies in addressing this global challenge.
