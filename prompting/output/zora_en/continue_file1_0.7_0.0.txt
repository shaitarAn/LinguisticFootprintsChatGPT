In the realm of communication, language users often employ referring expressions with noun phrases at their center (NP REs). These NP REs can undergo changes over the course of an interaction, as previous research has shown speakers' tendency to converge on linguistic forms and shorten their NP REs in the process. This chapter aims to explore this shortening phenomenon and examine the structural changes that accompany it.

To investigate these changes, a corpus of spoken English data was collected from an experimental task where conversational dyads repeatedly referred to visual stimuli. The interlocutors' NP REs were analyzed over the course of the dialogues, revealing a noticeable shortening trend. Specifically, there was a decrease in longer clausal post-head elements, while the use of only premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification showed a relative increase.

The observed changes in NP REs indicate a shift in the type of structural modification employed. Initially, speakers produced more clausal elements, which are associated with structural elaboration. However, as the interaction progressed, there was a decrease in clausal modification and a relative increase in phrasal modification, suggesting structural compression.

This shift from elaboration to compression in NP REs can be seen as a result of speakers' convergence on linguistic forms. As interlocutors strive to establish routines and streamline their communication, they may opt for shorter and more efficient NP REs. This choice of structural compression allows for a reduction in cognitive load and facilitates smoother communication between participants.

The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of how referring expressions evolve in interactive communication. By examining the structural changes in NP REs, we gain insights into the dynamics of language use in real-time interactions. This research also highlights the adaptability of language users in optimizing their communication strategies, as they adjust their linguistic forms to better suit the interactive context.

Understanding the mechanisms behind the shortening and structural changes in NP REs has practical implications for various fields. In natural language processing, this knowledge can inform the development of algorithms and models that generate more natural and efficient referring expressions. In education, it can guide language instruction by emphasizing the importance of concise and effective communication. Additionally, in fields such as human-computer interaction and dialogue systems, the findings can contribute to the design of more user-friendly and efficient interfaces.

In conclusion, this chapter investigates the shortening process and structural changes in NP REs that occur in interactive communication. Through the analysis of a corpus of spoken English data, it is observed that speakers tend to shorten their NP REs over the course of an interaction, with a shift from clausal elaboration to phrasal compression. These findings shed light on the dynamic nature of referring expressions in real-time communication and have practical implications for various domains.
