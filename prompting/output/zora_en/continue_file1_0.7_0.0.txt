Referring expressions play a crucial role in effective communication as they allow language users to identify and distinguish entities in the discourse. In particular, noun phrases (NPs) serve as the central component of referring expressions (REs), providing the necessary information to identify the referent. However, previous research has shown that the use of NP REs is not static but rather undergoes changes over the course of an interactive communication.

This chapter aims to investigate the process of shortening NP REs and the associated structural changes that occur during interactive communication. To achieve this, a corpus of spoken English data was collected from a referential communication task, where conversational dyads produced repeated references to visual stimuli. By analyzing this corpus, we can gain insights into the dynamics of NP REs in interactive communication.

The findings of this study reveal a clear pattern of shortening in NP REs over the course of the elicited dialogues. Specifically, there is a significant decrease in longer clausal post-head elements as the interaction progresses. This suggests that speakers tend to rely less on elaborate clausal elements and instead opt for more concise forms.

In addition to the decrease in clausal modification, there is a relative increase in the use of premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification. These changes indicate a shift towards structural compression in the NP REs. Initially, speakers may produce NP REs with more elaborate clausal elements, which provide additional information about the referent. However, as the interaction unfolds, there is a tendency to simplify and compress the structure of the NP REs, resulting in shorter and more streamlined forms.

The observed structural changes in NP REs reflect the adaptive nature of interactive communication. As interlocutors engage in repeated references, they develop linguistic routines and converge on shared linguistic forms. This convergence is facilitated by the process of shortening NP REs, which allows for more efficient and streamlined communication.

Overall, this chapter sheds light on the dynamic nature of NP REs in interactive communication. It highlights the tendency of speakers to shorten their NP REs over the course of an interaction and the structural changes that accompany this process. By understanding these patterns, we can gain a deeper understanding of how language users adapt their referring expressions in real-time communication.
