Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and effective communication about this issue is crucial. Framing, as a concept in communication research, has gained attention in recent years as a way to understand how different perspectives on climate change are constructed and communicated. However, there is still a lack of consensus on what framing actually means in the context of climate change communication.

This systematic review aims to address this gap by examining trends in framing research specifically focused on climate change. By comparing these trends to those observed in reviews of communication research overall, we can gain a better understanding of how framing operates within the context of climate change.

To achieve this goal, we utilize framing as a bridging concept that allows us to compare frames across different locations: frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects. By analyzing these different aspects of framing using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, we can provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on climate change framing over the past 25 years.

Our review includes an analysis of 275 peer-reviewed articles that focus on the framing of climate change. Through this analysis, we aim to identify patterns and gaps in current research on climate change framing. One notable finding from our review is that there has been limited exploration or utilization of framing's potential for bridging perspectives.

The lack of integration between different frame locations suggests a conceptual misfit within current literature on climate change communication. This misfit limits our ability to fully understand how frames are constructed and their impact on audiences' perceptions and behaviors regarding climate change.

In light of these findings, we will discuss potential directions for future research that can help bridge this gap between different frame locations. By taking advantage of framing's bridging potential, researchers can better understand how frames are created at various stages (production), what they consist (content), how they are received (audience frames), and their effects (framing effects). This holistic approach will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of climate change communication and inform strategies for effective public engagement and action on this critical issue.

In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the importance of framing as a bridging concept in climate change communication research. By comparing framing trends in climate change communication to those observed in broader communication research, we can identify gaps and potential avenues for future exploration. By harnessing framing's power to bridge perspectives, researchers can enhance our understanding of how frames shape public perceptions and behaviors related to climate change.
