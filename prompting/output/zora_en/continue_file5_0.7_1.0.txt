Swiss Standard German (SSG) is one of the official languages in Switzerland, yet there has been a lack of research on its phonetic properties. In particular, studies on vowel quality in Alemannic (ALM) dialects, which heavily influence SSG varieties, are scarce. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comparative acoustic analysis of ALM and SSG vowels and exploring the extent to which ALM dialects shape vowel qualities in SSG varieties.

To achieve these goals, the study recorded 4 male and 4 female speakers from four ALM dialect regions: Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Each speaker produced each vowel three times resulting in a corpus of 1,632 tokens. The recordings were then analyzed acoustically to examine the vowel qualities present.

The results revealed that there is a strong influence of ALM dialects on the vowel qualities found in SSG varieties spoken in Chur and Brig. In these regions, the transfer of ALM vowel quality to SSG was evident. However, variations were observed in Bern and Zurich where certain vowels did not match their corresponding ALM counterparts.

In Bern's SSG variety, for example,<a> was fronted compared to its pronunciation in the ALM dialect. Similarly,<ä> had multiple realizations as both [ɛː] and [æː], suggesting further variation within this specific region's standard variety. Furthermore,<o> was realized more towards the back compared to its original pronunciation.

In Zurich's SSG variety,<a> also exhibited fronting compared to its corresponding vowel sound found in ALM.<e>, however had no significant variation from its original form while<o> showed slightly more back realization than its counterpart.

The findings indicate that while some aspects of vowel quality are transferred from ALM dialects into their respective SSG varieties (Chur and Brig), others display variation or deviation from the original ALM vowel qualities (Bern and Zurich). This suggests that the influence of ALM dialects on SSG is not uniform across all regions.

Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the phonetic properties of SSG and its relationship with ALM dialects. The findings highlight the importance of considering regional variations when studying Swiss Standard German, as different dialect regions may exhibit distinct vowel qualities in their respective SSG varieties. Further research could explore other phonetic properties of SSG and investigate whether similar patterns are observed in other Swiss German dialects.
