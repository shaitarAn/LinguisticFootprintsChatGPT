Title: The Role of Multimodal Imitation Skills in Facilitating Theory of Mind Development in Preschool Children

1. Introduction

Theory of mind (ToM) refers to the ability to understand and attribute mental states to oneself and others, enabling the prediction and interpretation of behavior based on these mental states. The development of ToM is a crucial milestone in early childhood as it is closely linked to the acquisition of socio-communicative and language skills. Previous research has primarily focused on the relationship between early imitation skills and language development in infants. However, there remains a gap in our understanding of how multimodal imitation skills, encompassing gestural, prosodic, and lexical components, are related to ToM development in preschool children.

The ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues, such as gestures, intonations, and verbal linguistic patterns, plays a vital role in the acquisition of language and sociocommunicative skills during the preschool years. While previous studies have demonstrated the association between multimodal imitation and language development, little attention has been given to its potential role in the development of ToM abilities. Understanding the relationship between multimodal imitation and ToM development could provide valuable insights into the cognitive and socio-emotional processes involved in the emergence of ToM in early childhood.

The current study aims to fill this gap by examining the extent to which preschool children's multimodal imitation skills are related to the development of ToM. By investigating the joint relevance of multimodal imitation and ToM, we seek to determine whether the ability to imitate social cues in multiple modalities is associated with enhanced ToM abilities in preschoolers. Furthermore, this study will explore the potential mediating role of language and sociocommunicative skills in the relationship between multimodal imitation and ToM development.

To address these research questions, a correlational design will be employed, allowing for the examination of the associations between preschool children's multimodal imitation skills, ToM abilities, and language and sociocommunicative skills. Participants will consist of typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children, as this age range represents a critical period for the development of ToM and the consolidation of language skills. Multiple measures, including standardized tasks and caregiver reports, will be utilized to assess multimodal imitation, ToM abilities, and language and sociocommunicative skills.

The findings from this study have important implications for our understanding of the role of multimodal imitation in the development of ToM. By expanding our knowledge of the relationship between multimodal imitation and ToM, this research can inform intervention programs aimed at promoting ToM development in preschool children. Furthermore, this study contributes to the broader conceptualization of imitation behaviors in the field of language development by highlighting the significance of multimodal imitation skills encompassing prosodic, gestural, and verbal linguistic patterns.

In summary, this study aims to investigate the association between preschool children's multimodal imitation skills and the development of ToM, while also exploring the potential mediating role of language and sociocommunicative skills. By examining these relationships, this research seeks to shed light on the cognitive and socio-emotional processes that underlie the emergence of ToM in early childhood.
