1. Introduction

The development of imitation skills in early childhood has been widely recognized as a crucial factor in language acquisition and social communication abilities (Meltzoff, 1990; Tomasello, 1999). Previous research has primarily focused on the relevance of infants' object- and language-based imitation skills during the first two years of life. However, little attention has been given to investigating the joint significance of these imitative behaviors in later stages of development. This study aims to address this research gap by examining the relationship between multimodal imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children.

Imitation plays a fundamental role in the acquisition of linguistic and social skills, as it allows children to learn and replicate the behaviors and gestures of others (Meltzoff, 2007). Previous studies have shown that infants' early imitation skills are associated with their later language development (Meltzoff & Moore, 1983; Carpenter et al., 1998). However, the majority of these studies have focused on object-based imitation, neglecting the potential impact of multimodal imitation, which encompasses gestural, prosodic, and lexical components.

Multimodal imitation refers to the ability to imitate not only the actions and objects, but also the social cues and communicative behaviors exhibited by others (Nadel, 2013). It involves mimicking facial expressions, prosody, and gestures, as well as verbal linguistic patterns. This broader conceptualization of imitation acknowledges the importance of considering the socio-communicative aspects of imitation in relation to language development and social interaction.

Narrative abilities, which involve the ability to construct and convey coherent and meaningful stories, play a critical role in children's language development (Berman & Slobin, 1994). Successful narrative performance requires the integration of various linguistic and cognitive skills, such as vocabulary knowledge, grammar, and theory of mind (Boudreau & Hedberg, 1999). Previous research has highlighted the correlation between narrative abilities and language development in preschool-aged children (Haden et al., 1996). However, to date, little is known about the potential influence of multimodal imitation skills on narrative performance.

Sociopragmatic abilities encompass the understanding and use of social communication skills, such as turn-taking, maintaining eye contact, and using appropriate gestures and intonation in conversation (Tager-Flusberg, 2006). These abilities are crucial for successful social interactions and establishing meaningful relationships with peers and adults. While previous research has emphasized the link between sociopragmatic abilities and language development (Adams et al., 2002), the association between sociopragmatic skills and multimodal imitation remains unexplored.

Therefore, the present study aims to examine the relationship between preschool-aged children's multimodal imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities. By assessing these domains simultaneously, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the joint significance of these imitative behaviors in language development and social communication. This research will contribute to existing literature by providing insights into the broader conceptualization of imitation behaviors and their implications for language acquisition and sociocommunicative skills in preschool-aged children.

In summary, this study aims to investigate the association between multimodal imitation, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children. By examining the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors, we can gain a deeper understanding of the role of imitation in language development and social communication. The findings from this research will contribute to the existing body of knowledge and inform interventions aimed at promoting optimal language and socio-communicative development in early childhood.
