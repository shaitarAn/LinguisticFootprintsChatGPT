The introduction of this Zora article begins by highlighting the ubiquity of imitation in humans and its importance in human culture, language development, and cognitive skills. The study aims to expand on previous research by investigating the role of different types of imitation skills (language-based multimodal imitation vs. object-based imitation) that have rarely been assessed together. Additionally, the study focuses on young preschoolers, an age group that undergoes significant linguistic and social developmental advances but has not been actively studied in terms of imitation abilities.

The article reviews previous literature on the relationship between imitative behaviors and language and sociopragmatic abilities. It emphasizes that imitation skills, which involve intentionally replicating others' behaviors or actions, play a fundamental role in language development and social communication. Various studies have shown that spontaneous and elicited imitative behaviors in infancy are crucial for language production, comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and social communication behaviors.

The introduction cites specific studies that demonstrate the relationship between imitation and language development. For example, vocal imitation in infants between 9 and 13 months has been strongly linked to language production and comprehension. Motor imitation behaviors in infants between 15 and 18 months have a unique relationship to language comprehension skills. The age at which infants begin to imitate arbitrary actions involving physical objects has been positively correlated with the age at which they begin to use referential language. Infants who imitate more novel words at 13 months tend to have larger lexicons later on. Vocal and gestural imitation abilities at 14 months have been significantly correlated with language skills at 20 months.

The introduction also discusses the relationship between imitation and sociopragmatic skills. Longitudinal studies have shown that imitative behaviors contribute significantly to the prediction of social communication outcomes in preschoolers. In non-typically developing populations, children with language impairment and Autism Spectrum Disorder have shown weaknesses in gesture accuracy imitation patterns and imitation of words and simple syntactic structures, respectively.

The article highlights that previous studies have rarely compared the relevance of language-based and object-based imitation skills. Some studies suggest that language-based imitation has stronger links to language abilities, while object-based imitation is associated with play skills. However, none of these studies have incorporated an integrative multimodal view of language-based imitation that includes gestural, prosodic, and verbal/lexical components.

The present study aims to fill this gap by analyzing the relationship between multimodal language-based imitation and object-based imitation in early preschool years. The researchers believe that this developmental period is crucial because children are delving into complex areas of language and developing school readiness skills. Narrative and sociopragmatic skills are particularly important during this period, as they are predictive of language and academic development.

The introduction concludes by stating the main hypothesis of the study, which is that language-based imitation abilities, integrating gestural, prosodic, and verbal/lexical dimensions, will be related to complex language measures and sociopragmatic measures in preschoolers. The article argues that it is crucial to investigate imitation from an integrated multimodal perspective, as language is learned and evolved through face-to-face interactions that involve speech, gesture, and prosody. The parallel development of these multimodal cues and their alignment with speech highlight the need to assess their value together.

Overall, the introduction sets the stage for the study by emphasizing the importance of imitation in human development, reviewing relevant literature, and highlighting the gaps that the present study aims to address.
