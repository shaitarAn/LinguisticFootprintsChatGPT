1. Introduction

The study of dialectal variation and its influence on standard languages has been a prominent topic in sociolinguistics. In particular, research on the phonetic properties of various dialects and their impact on the respective varieties of standard languages has provided valuable insights into language contact phenomena.

While much attention has been given to the consonantal features of Alemannic (ALM) dialects, there remains a notable gap in our understanding of vowel quality in these varieties and their influence on Swiss Standard German (SSG). Given that SSG is one of the official languages in Switzerland, it is surprising that there have been limited investigations into its phonetic properties. Consequently, this study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by examining vowel inventories in four ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties.

The primary objective of this research is twofold: firstly, it seeks to provide a comparative acoustic analysis of ALM and SSG vowels; secondly, it investigates the extent to which interference from ALM dialects shapes the vowel qualities found within SSG varieties across different regions.

To attain these objectives, we recorded 4 male and 4 female speakers from four key Swiss cities - Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich - producing each vowel three times. This methodology resulted in a comprehensive corpus consisting of 1,632 tokens for analysis.

Preliminary results reveal intriguing patterns concerning the transferability of vowel quality between ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties. Notably, two distinct regions - Chur and Brig - demonstrate significant similarities between ALM vowels and those found within their respective SSG variations. However, contrasting trends emerge when examining Bern and Zurich's usage. In these regions' SSG varieties specifically for <a>, we observe fronting that deviates from its corresponding sound in ALM dialects. Moreover,<ä> exhibits varied realizations as [ɛː] and [æː] in the Bern SSG variety, while <o> tends to be realized more posteriorly.

Given these initial findings, it becomes evident that there are regional discrepancies in vowel quality and transferability within ALM dialects and their influence on SSG varieties. By exploring these differences alongside the underlying phonetic principles, we can gain deeper insights into the complexities of dialectal variation and its impact on standard language forms.

To achieve a comprehensive understanding of these complicated interrelationships between ALM dialects and SSG varieties, this study will employ both quantitative acoustic analysis techniques as well as comparative qualitative methodologies. By combining acoustic measurements with auditory perceptual analyses, we will explore not only the physical properties of vowels but also their subjective interpretations by native speakers.

In conclusion, this research proposes to investigate vowel quality in four Alemannic dialects and its subsequent influence on Swiss Standard German. Through a comprehensive analysis of vowel inventories in these dialects alongside corresponding SSG variations across multiple regions, we aim to shed light on the transferability patterns and divergences present within different geographical areas. Moreover,this study emphasizes both quantitative measurements and qualitative perception analyses to ensure a holistic understanding is achieved.
