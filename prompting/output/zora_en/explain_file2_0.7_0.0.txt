The introduction of this Zora article begins by discussing the concept of framing, which is a popular theoretical approach in communication research. It notes that while many studies refer to framing, there is a lack of clear definitions, resulting in a variety of phenomena being grouped under this concept. This diversity of understanding makes it difficult to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights in communication research.

The article mentions that systematic reviews can help overcome this problem by identifying common trends, research gaps, and guiding future research. However, previous reviews on framing have not fully utilized one of the unique characteristics of framing: its ability to bridge different perspectives and consider the entire communication process.

The introduction then introduces the concept of frame locations within the communication process, such as the communicator, the message, the receiver, and the culture. It argues that by systematically reviewing how framing has been applied across these frame locations and identifying the most salient frames at each location, researchers can gain insights into the cultural framing repository.

The article explains that the focus of the study is on the framing of climate change for several reasons. Firstly, climate change is a significant global problem, and understanding its communication is highly relevant. Frames play a role in shaping audience understanding and support for actions related to climate change. Additionally, climate change communication is challenging due to its complexity and scientific uncertainty, requiring connections between experts, policy, information sources, and audiences. Framing can help overcome these communication barriers.

The introduction also highlights the growing research on framing in climate change communication and the need for a systematic review to take stock of the field. It notes that there are limited systematic reviews available for framing in communication research overall and that attention should be given to field-specific applications. The article aims to compare findings from the review on climate change framing to those from reviews covering framing in communication research overall.

The study intends to focus on the most salient frames across frame locations to harness framing's potential as an integrative bridging concept. This involves connecting research on frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects to identify the conceptual fit or misfit across frame locations. The article concludes by mentioning that the study will use quantitative and qualitative approaches to analyze 25 years of published literature on climate change framing.
