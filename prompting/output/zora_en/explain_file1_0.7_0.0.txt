In this introduction, the author discusses the phenomenon of reference in conversation and focuses on a specific type of referring expression called NP REs (noun phrase referring expressions). The author explains that as interlocutors engage in interactive communication, they tend to produce NP REs that become more similar over time in terms of both lexical choices and grammatical constructions used. This convergence in expression is linked to the cognitive process of aligning linguistic representations and has been extensively studied in psycholinguistics, particularly in terms of lexical convergence.

The author also highlights another observed change-in-interaction related to NP REs, which is the tendency for interlocutors to shorten their contributions. This phenomenon, referred to as "referential contraction," occurs alongside the process of convergence. The author states that the chapter will primarily focus on this process of change-in-interaction, although both convergence and contraction typically occur in parallel.

To investigate these changes, the author describes a referential communication task that was designed to elicit dialogic conversation over four rounds of interaction. Participants were asked to refer to the same sets of visual stimuli repeatedly. The author provides an example from the resulting corpus of interactive dialogue to illustrate the shortening process observed. The initial NP RE for a stimulus is longer and gradually gets shortened over the course of the interaction, with interlocutors converging on a specific NP RE, such as "the green dress shirt."

The main focus of the study is on how speakers change their preferred grammatical structure for NP REs as they converge and shorten their expressions. The author aims to describe general tendencies regarding the types and forms of modifying and descriptive elements in the NP RE construction throughout the interaction. The example given shows a typical trajectory of change, where the structure of the NP RE shifts from the initial presence of post-head clausal elements to a greater frequency of phrasal (pre-)modification in later rounds.

The author mentions that these changes in NP REs are indicative of what Biber and Clark (2002) term "compression," which encompasses both the shortening process and the changes in structural preferences observed. The introduction also provides an overview of the subsequent sections of the chapter. Section 2 discusses previous research on change-in-interaction, specifically related to compression in NP REs. The findings from experimental referential communication task studies are contextualized within theoretical approaches, including the Interactive Alignment Model and discussions of familiarity and accessibility.

Section 3 introduces the experimental set-up used to collect a corpus of spoken English dialogues, while Section 4 presents an analysis of the structural changes in NP REs over the course of the dialogical interactions. The analysis reveals that as NP REs are shortened, their structure shifts from more elaborate, clausal forms to more compressed, phrasal forms in later rounds. Finally, Section 5 discusses these findings in relation to Biber and Clark's notion of compression as a change that occurs in response to the need to convey a large amount of information efficiently.
