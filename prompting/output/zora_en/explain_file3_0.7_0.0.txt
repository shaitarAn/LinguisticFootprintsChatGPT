This introduction discusses the linguistic characteristics of the Insular Celtic languages, specifically focusing on the concept of "wordhood" or "phonological autonomy" within these languages. It mentions that previous characterizations of these languages have described them as having a "sentence word" or a strong group accent that leads to individual words losing their phonological autonomy. Additionally, it notes that the Insular Celtic languages have a large number of phonologically and morphologically bound formatives, such as incorporated adjectives or adverbs, and exhibit phonological and morpho-phonological interactions within phrases.

The introduction highlights that previous descriptions of these languages lack specific criteria for defining "wordhood" or "phonological autonomy" and do not provide detailed studies of the morphological and phonological boundaries, interdependencies, and processes that could define a "word" in these languages. It references early Irish and Middle Welsh grammars, stating that they did not have corresponding concepts for the modern notion of a "word." Instead, the focal (in early Irish) or geir (in Middle Welsh) were used to refer to syntactic groups or parts of correct utterances, respectively.

The introduction then mentions that recent typological research has shown that languages may lack a unified word domain and that having no or several conflicting domains is possible. Based on this background, the study aims to investigate the potential word-like properties of the verbal complex in Middle Welsh prose, specifically focusing on manuscripts from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. It also mentions that poetry will be used to compare and gain additional insights that may not be found in prose.

The introduction explains that the study will focus on finite verbal structures, as different parts of speech may exhibit varying patterns of wordhood within the same language. It defines the Middle Welsh verbal complex as the finite verb and its satellites, which can include various grammatical markers such as conjunctions, polarity markers, and P- and T-markers. An example of a Middle Welsh verbal complex is provided, illustrating the presence of multiple markers.

The introduction outlines the organization of the study into three main sections: Section 2 explains the study's approach, Section 3 discusses the morphological structuring of the verbal complex, and Section 4 discusses the phonological and prosodic processes within the verbal complex and how they correspond to the morphological structure outlined in Section 3. Finally, Section 5 summarizes and discusses the findings of the study and suggests potential future avenues of research.
