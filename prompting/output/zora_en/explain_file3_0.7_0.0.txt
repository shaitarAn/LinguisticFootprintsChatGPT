This introduction provides an overview of the topic of study, which is the word-like properties of the verbal complex in Middle Welsh prose. It begins by mentioning various characterizations of the Insular Celtic languages, including their "sentence word" nature and their phonological and morphological bound formatives. However, it points out that these characterizations lack a clear definition of "wordhood" or "phonological autonomy." The introduction also highlights that early Irish and Middle Welsh grammars did not have a concept of the modern word.

The introduction then mentions that recent typological research has shown that languages may lack a unified word domain and that wordhood patterns can vary between different parts of speech within the same language. Based on this, the study focuses on the verbal complex in Middle Welsh prose, specifically in manuscripts from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. The study also notes that poetry will be used to compare and gain additional insights that may not be found in prose.

The restriction to finite verbal structures in Middle Welsh is justified by the observation that wordhood patterns can differ between different parts of speech. The verbal complex in Middle Welsh is defined as the finite verb and its satellites, which can include various grammatical markers such as conjunctions, polarity markers, and P- and T-markers. The example provided in the introduction illustrates a verbal complex consisting of eight markers and a lexical root.

The study is then divided into three main parts: Section 2 explains the approach taken in the study, Section 3 discusses the morphological structuring of the verbal complex, and Section 4 explores the phonological and prosodic processes within the verbal complex. Finally, Section 5 summarizes and discusses the findings of the study, as well as suggests future avenues of research.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the study by providing context, highlighting the lack of a clear definition of wordhood in the Insular Celtic languages, and explaining the focus and organization of the research.
