The introduction of this Zora article highlights the importance of imitation in human development and culture. It explains that imitation is a fundamental capacity for human beings, contributing to language acquisition, cognitive skills, and social communication. The study aims to expand on previous research by investigating the role of different types of imitation skills that have not been assessed together before: language-based multimodal imitation and object-based imitation.

The article emphasizes that the study focuses on young preschoolers, an age group where significant linguistic and social developmental advances occur but have not been actively studied in relation to imitation abilities. The researchers state that this is the first time the relationship between different types of imitation is investigated in relation to linguistic and pragmatic skills in preschool children.

To support their hypothesis, the authors provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on how imitative behaviors are associated with language development and sociopragmatic abilities. They cite studies showing strong links between vocal imitation and language production/comprehension during infancy, as well as associations between motor imitations (such as clapping hands) and later language comprehension skills.

The authors also highlight studies demonstrating positive relationships between infants' imitative actions involving physical objects (like hitting or patting) with referential language use. Additionally, they mention research indicating correlations between vocal/gestural imitation abilities at 14 months with later language skills at 20 months.

Regarding sociopragmatic skills, a longitudinal study showed that imitative behaviors made a significant contribution to predicting social communication outcomes in late-talking toddlers. Another study involving children with language impairment revealed weaknesses in gesture accuracy imitations compared to typically developing peers.

The article further discusses studies highlighting differences between socially relevant body movement imitations associated with expressive language skills versus object-related action imitations linked to play skills. Findings suggest that gestures with communicative significance are more accurately imitated than non-communicative movements or facial expressions without interpersonal engagement.

Despite these valuable contributions from previous research, the authors argue that none of them have incorporated an integrative multimodal view of language-based imitation, which includes gestural, prosodic, and verbal/lexical components. Therefore, the present study aims to fill this gap by analyzing the relationship between multimodal language-based imitation and object-based imitation in early preschool years.

The authors explain that although imitative learning behaviors tend to decrease after two years of age, imitation continues to be vital for social communication in preschoolers. They stress the importance of investigating whether young preschoolers' abilities to accurately perform multimodal imitations are positively correlated with language and sociopragmatic skills. This developmental period is considered crucial because children are delving into complex areas of language acquisition before entering school.

The article concludes by stating that further research is needed to fully understand the role of socially relevant imitation patterns during the preschool stage. The main hypothesis is that language-based imitation abilities will be related to complex language measures (such as narration skills) and sociopragmatic measures in preschoolers. The authors argue for an integrated multimodal perspective considering speech, gesture, and prosody together since these cues develop parallelly and align closely with speech.

Overall, this introduction sets up the rationale for conducting a study on different types of imitations in relation to linguistic and pragmatic skills in young preschoolers while highlighting gaps in previous research and emphasizing the significance of a multimodal perspective on language-based imitation.
