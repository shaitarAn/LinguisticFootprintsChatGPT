Imitation is a fundamental aspect of human development, particularly in the acquisition of language and social communication skills. Previous research has shown that infants as young as 9 to 20 months old demonstrate early imitation skills, both object-based and language-based, which are predictive of later language development. However, there is a lack of systematic comparisons between these imitative behaviors and their joint relevance in later stages of development.

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between multimodal imitation skills, object-based imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children. Multimodal imitation refers to the ability to imitate various components of communication, including gestures, prosody, and lexical patterns. Object-based imitation, on the other hand, involves imitating actions with objects.

A total of 31 typically developing children aged 3 to 4 years old participated in the study. They were assessed on four tasks: multimodal imitation, object-based imitation, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities. The multimodal imitation task involved imitating a series of gestures, prosodic patterns, and lexical phrases. The object-based imitation task required the children to imitate actions with objects, such as stacking blocks or using a toy hammer. The narrative task involved telling a story based on a series of pictures, while the sociopragmatic task assessed the children's ability to understand and use appropriate social communication skills.

The results of the study revealed a significant relationship between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children. However, there was no significant relationship between object-based imitation skills and these language and sociocommunicative skills. This suggests that the ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues, such as gestures, prosody, and verbal linguistic patterns, is strongly related to language and sociocommunicative development in preschoolers.

These findings support a broader conceptualization of imitation behaviors in the field of language development. Traditionally, imitation has been primarily associated with object-based imitation, such as copying actions with objects. However, this study highlights the importance of considering multimodal imitation, which encompasses a range of communication components. By integrating prosodic, gestural, and verbal linguistic patterns, children are able to imitate and learn the social and communicative aspects of language.

The implications of these findings are significant for both researchers and practitioners in the field of language development. Understanding the relationship between imitation skills and language development can inform interventions and strategies aimed at promoting language and sociocommunicative abilities in preschool-aged children. By targeting and enhancing multimodal imitation skills, educators and therapists can potentially facilitate the development of narrative and sociopragmatic abilities.

In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the link between multimodal imitation skills and narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children. The findings suggest that preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is strongly related to their language and sociocommunicative development. These results support a broader conceptualization of imitation behaviors in the field of language development, highlighting the importance of considering prosodic, gestural, and verbal linguistic patterns. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and processes involved in the relationship between imitation and language development, as well as to investigate the potential benefits of interventions targeting multimodal imitation skills in preschool-aged children.
