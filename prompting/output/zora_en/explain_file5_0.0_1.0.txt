The introduction of this Zora article provides an overview of the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland, focusing on the concept of "diglossia." Diglossia refers to a situation where two distinct varieties of a language are used in different contexts. In this case, the two varieties are Alemannic dialects (ALM) and Swiss Standard German (SSG).

ALM dialects, also known as Swiss German or Mundart, are primarily used for oral communication, while SSG is used for written communication. This means that everyone in German-speaking Switzerland is a native speaker of a local dialect but learns SSG at school. However, there is some overlap between the two varieties, and Swiss people often code-switch between them.

The contact between ALM and SSG inevitably leads to interferences on various linguistic levels such as phonetics, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary. The article mentions that there have been limited studies on ALM dialects' vowels and more research on SSG vowels based on acoustic measurements.

The current study aims to systematically investigate the vowel qualities of four ALM dialects (from Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich) along with their respective SSG varieties using an instrumental phonetic approach. It will analyze how much the vowel qualities in SSG are influenced by speakers' dialect.

The article then provides some background information about ALM dialects and SSG varieties spoken in German-speaking Switzerland. It explains that ALM can be divided into three subgroups: Low ALM found only in Basel city; High ALM spoken in the northern half; and Highest ALM spoken in the alpine southern half.

High and Highest ALM differ based on multiple isoglosses (linguistic boundaries) that divide German-speaking Switzerland into northern and southern halves. One well-known isogloss relates to hiatus diphthongisation â€“ High ALMs developed diphthongs while Highest ALMs maintained monophthongs. However, both dialect groups are not entirely homogeneous, and there are additional east-west divisions based on phonetic, lexical, and morphosyntactic isoglosses.

The article concludes by stating that German-speaking Switzerland consists of four broad dialect regions when considering the overlap of these averaged isogloss divisions. It also mentions that the study excludes Basel (where Low ALM is spoken) and Samnaun (where a Bavarian dialect is spoken).

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the study by providing necessary background information about diglossia in German-speaking Switzerland and highlighting the specific focus on vowel qualities in ALM dialects and SSG varieties.
