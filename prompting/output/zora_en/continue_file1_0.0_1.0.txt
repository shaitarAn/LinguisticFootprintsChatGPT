In the realm of communication, language users often employ noun phrases at the core of their referring expressions (NP REs). These NP REs have been found to undergo changes throughout a communicative interaction. Previous research has demonstrated that speakers tend to converge on specific linguistic forms, establishing routines, and in doing so, they also tend to shorten their NP REs. This chapter aims to explore this shortening process and examine the structural changes that accompany it.

To investigate this phenomenon, data from an experimentally elicited corpus of spoken English was analyzed. The corpus consisted of conversational dyads engaging in a referential communication task where they repeatedly referred to visual stimuli. The analysis revealed that interlocutors indeed shortened their NP REs over the course of the dialogues.

Specifically, there was a noticeable decrease in longer clausal post-head elements as the interaction progressed. Initially, speakers tended to include more clausal elements in their NP REs, which are associated with structural elaboration. However, as the conversation unfolded, there was a shift towards shorter phrasal postmodification and an increase in only premodified NP REs.

These findings suggest that there is a change in the type of structural modification present within the NP REs. At first, speakers employ more elaborate clausal elements for modification purposes. These clauses provide additional information about the referent but also contribute to lengthening the expression itself.

As interlocutors become more familiar with each other's linguistic preferences and establish routines during their interaction, they begin to compress these structures by reducing or eliminating clausal post-head elements. Instead, they rely on shorter phrasal modifications or opt for only premodified NPs.

This shift towards compression can be seen as an adaptive strategy employed by speakers during interactive communication. By shortening their expressions and simplifying their structures over time, interlocutors facilitate smoother and more efficient communication.

The observed changes in structural modification within NP REs have important implications for our understanding of referential communication. They highlight the dynamic nature of language use and the role of interactive processes in shaping linguistic forms.

Furthermore, these findings contribute to our understanding of how speakers adapt their language production to accommodate their interlocutors' preferences. By converging on linguistic forms and shortening their NP REs, speakers demonstrate a willingness to align with each other's communication styles, ultimately enhancing mutual understanding.

In conclusion, this chapter provides evidence for the shortening process that occurs within NP REs during interactive communication. The observed structural changes indicate a shift from elaboration towards compression as interlocutors establish routines and converge on linguistic forms. These findings shed light on the adaptive strategies employed by speakers in order to facilitate efficient and effective communication.
