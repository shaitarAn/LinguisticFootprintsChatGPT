Title: The Role of Verb Morphology in Middle Welsh: A Comparative Analysis of Phonological and Morphological Domains

Abstract: The - for European languages - large amount of bound elements in the older Insular Celtic languages and the array of phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures have lead several researchers to conclude that individual words play a lesser role in the grammars of those languages. Based on current typological research on wordhood and a thorough discussion of the problems and limitations of studying wordhood in corpus languages, this article gives an in-depth investigation of the morphological and phonological word-like domains in the Middle Welsh verbal complex. There are several structures that could be labelled ‘word’ on the basis of the findings presented here, which leads to the conclusion that the term is not very useful for the synchronic description of this language.

1. Introduction

The study of verb morphology has long been a topic of interest in linguistics, as it provides valuable insights into the structure and organization of languages. In particular, the examination of phonological and morphological domains within verb complexes has shed light on the intricate nature of language systems. However, the role of individual words within these domains has been a subject of debate, especially in the context of older Insular Celtic languages.

The Middle Welsh language, with its rich verbal complex and numerous bound elements, presents a unique opportunity to explore the distribution and significance of word-like structures. Previous research has suggested that the grammars of Insular Celtic languages, including Middle Welsh, may not rely heavily on individual words as the primary unit of analysis. Instead, these languages exhibit a complex interplay of morphological and phonological interactions within larger structures.

This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the role of wordhood in Middle Welsh by conducting a comprehensive investigation of the morphological and phonological domains within the verbal complex. Drawing on typological research on wordhood and considering the challenges associated with studying wordhood in corpus languages, we seek to provide a nuanced understanding of the nature of word-like structures in Middle Welsh.

The research question that guides this study is as follows: To what extent can the concept of wordhood be applied to the analysis of the Middle Welsh verbal complex? By examining the distribution and behavior of bound elements, as well as the phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures, we aim to determine whether the term "word" is a useful construct for the synchronic description of Middle Welsh.

To address this research question, we will employ a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Our analysis will be based on a carefully curated corpus of Middle Welsh texts, ensuring a representative sample of the language's verbal complex. We will also draw on existing linguistic theories and frameworks to guide our analysis and interpretation of the data.

The significance of this study lies in its potential to enhance our understanding of the structure and organization of Middle Welsh, as well as its implications for the broader field of linguistics. By examining the role of wordhood in a language with a complex verbal complex, we can contribute to the ongoing theoretical discussions on the nature of language and the units of analysis employed in linguistic research.

In the following sections, we will provide a comprehensive review of relevant literature, discuss the methodological approach employed in this study, present our findings, and conclude with a discussion of the implications of our research. Through this investigation, we aim to shed light on the intricate nature of the Middle Welsh verbal complex and contribute to the broader understanding of language structure and organization.
