Swiss Standard German (SSG) is one of the official languages in Switzerland, yet there has been a lack of research on its phonetic properties. In particular, studies on Alemannic (ALM) dialects, which are spoken in various regions of Switzerland, have focused more on consonants than vowels. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the long-vowel inventories of four ALM dialects and their respective SSG varieties, with a specific focus on vowel quality.

The study has two main objectives. Firstly, it aims to provide a comparative acoustic analysis of ALM and SSG vowels, shedding light on the similarities and differences between the two. Secondly, it seeks to explore the extent to which ALM dialects influence the vowel qualities of SSG varieties. By examining these aspects, the study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the phonetic properties of SSG and its relationship with ALM dialects.

To achieve these objectives, recordings were made of 4 male and 4 female speakers from four different regions: Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Each speaker produced each vowel three times, resulting in a corpus of 1,632 tokens. These recordings were then analyzed acoustically to determine the vowel qualities present in each dialect and SSG variety.

The results of the study reveal interesting patterns in vowel quality across the different dialects and SSG varieties. In the Chur and Brig dialects, the vowel qualities were found to be largely transferred to the respective SSG varieties. This suggests a strong influence of the ALM dialects on the vowel qualities of SSG in these regions. However, in the Bern and Zurich dialects, certain vowel qualities did not match those of the ALM dialects. Specifically, the <a> vowel was fronted in the SSG varieties of both dialects. Additionally, the <ä> vowel in the Bern SSG variety was produced as both [ɛː] and [æː], indicating some variation in vowel quality. Furthermore, the <o> vowel was realized more in the back in both Bern and Zurich SSG varieties.

These findings highlight the complex relationship between ALM dialects and SSG varieties in terms of vowel quality. While some dialect regions show a strong influence of the ALM dialects on SSG, others exhibit variation and divergence from the ALM vowel qualities. This suggests that factors such as geographical location and historical linguistic developments may play a role in shaping the vowel qualities of SSG varieties.

Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the vowel quality of ALM dialects and their influence on the respective SSG varieties. By examining the long-vowel inventories of these dialects and SSG, the study contributes to a better understanding of the phonetic properties of SSG and its relationship with ALM dialects. Further research in this area could explore other phonetic aspects of SSG and ALM, as well as investigate the influence of other dialect regions on SSG vowel quality.
