Swiss Standard German (SSG) is one of the official languages in Switzerland, yet there has been a lack of research on its phonetic properties. In particular, studies on Alemannic (ALM) dialects, which are spoken in various regions of Switzerland, have focused more on consonants than vowels. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the long-vowel inventories and vowel quality in four ALM dialects and their respective SSG varieties.

The study focuses on four ALM dialects: Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. These dialects were chosen to represent different regions within Switzerland where Alemannic is spoken. The aim is to compare the vowel qualities in these dialects with those found in their corresponding SSG varieties.

To conduct this investigation, recordings were made of 4 male and 4 female speakers from each dialect region producing each vowel three times. This resulted in a corpus of 1,632 tokens for analysis. Acoustic analysis was then performed to examine the vowel qualities present in both the ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties.

The results reveal interesting patterns regarding vowel quality transfer from ALM to SSG varieties. In the Chur and Brig regions, there was a high degree of similarity between the vowel qualities found in both the ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties. This suggests that interference from these ALM dialects strongly influences the vowel qualities present in their respective SSG varieties.

However, differences were observed when comparing Bern and Zurich's SSG varieties with their corresponding ALM dialects. In these cases, certain vowel qualities did not match those found in the ALM counterparts. One notable difference was observed with <a>, which was fronted in both Bern and Zurich's SSG varieties compared to its pronunciation in the respective ALM dialects.

Furthermore,<ä> exhibited variation within Bern's SSG variety, being produced as both [ɛː] and [æː]. This suggests that there may be dialectal variation within the SSG variety spoken in Bern. Additionally, <o> was realized more in the back in both Bern and Zurich's SSG varieties compared to their ALM counterparts.

These findings highlight the influence of ALM dialects on the vowel qualities present in their corresponding SSG varieties. The transfer of vowel quality from ALM to SSG is particularly strong in Chur and Brig, while Bern and Zurich exhibit some deviations from the vowel qualities found in their respective ALM dialects.

Overall, this study provides a comparative acoustic analysis of vowel quality in four ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties. It sheds light on how interference from ALM dialects influences the vowel qualities present in SSG varieties. These findings contribute to a better understanding of Swiss Standard German phonetics and its relationship with Alemannic dialects.
