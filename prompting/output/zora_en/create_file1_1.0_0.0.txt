1. Introduction

The field of linguistics has long been interested in studying the dynamic nature of language use, particularly in the realm of communication. Language users often employ referring expressions as a means of effectively conveying specific information to their interlocutors. These referring expressions, which commonly feature noun phrases (NPs) at their center, have been the subject of much research due to their role in interactive communication.

Previous studies have revealed that the use of NP referring expressions tends to evolve and change over the course of a communicative interaction. One prominent finding in this area of research is the phenomenon of speakers' convergence on linguistic forms, which establishes routine and predictability in communication (REF). Additionally, researchers have observed that speakers tend to shorten their NP referring expressions over time (REF).

The present paper aims to investigate this process of shortening NP referring expressions and its associated structural changes. By examining a corpus of spoken English, particularly data obtained from an experimentally elicited referential communication task, this study seeks to shed light on the alterations that occur within NP referring expressions during interactive communication. Specifically, it will explore the way in which interlocutors modify the structure of their NP referring expressions as the conversation progresses.

The dataset used in this study consists of conversational dyads engaged in the referential communication task, in which they repeatedly referred to visual stimuli. By analyzing the changes in NP referring expressions over the course of these dialogues, this research aims to provide insights into the underlying processes involved in the shortening and modification of NP structure.

The preliminary analysis of the dataset reveals a clear pattern of shortening in NP referring expressions as the interaction unfolds. Specifically, a decrease in the occurrence of longer clausal post-head elements is observed, while the use of premodified NP referring expressions and shorter phrasal postmodification shows a relative increase. These findings suggest a shift in the modifying structures within the NP referring expressions. Initially, speakers tend to utilize more clausal elements, which are associated with structural elaboration. However, as the interaction progresses, there is a noticeable decrease in clausal modification, accompanied by a relative increase in phrasal modification, indicating structural compression (REF).

Understanding the processes and patterns underlying the modification of NP referring expressions is crucial for comprehending the mechanisms behind effective interactive communication. By examining the changes that occur within these referring expressions, this study aims to contribute to our understanding of how language users adapt and modify their language production to facilitate effective communication.

The subsequent sections of this paper will delve deeper into the specific changes observed in the structural modification of NP referring expressions. By analyzing the dataset in greater detail and exploring potential explanations for these findings, this research seeks to broaden our knowledge of the dynamics of referential communication. Ultimately, the insights gained from this study may inform future research and contribute to the development of more comprehensive theories of interactive language use.
