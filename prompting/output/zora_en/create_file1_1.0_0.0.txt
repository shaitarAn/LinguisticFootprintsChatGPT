1. Introduction 

Language plays a vital role in human communication, enabling individuals to convey their thoughts, ideas, and intentions. Within the realm of communication, noun phrases (NP) often serve as the central unit for producing referring expressions (REs). These NP REs undergo significant changes over the course of interactive communication, with previous research highlighting two prominent trends: the convergence on linguistic forms and the tendency to shorten NP REs. Convergence is characterized by the establishment of routines, whereby interlocutors align their linguistic choices to facilitate efficient communication. This aligning process is often accompanied by the shortening of NP REs.

While significant research has been conducted on the phenomenon of shortening in NP REs, there remains a dearth of studies that examine the structural changes that accompany this process. The present paper addresses this research gap by investigating the structural modifications of NP REs in interactive communication. By employing a corpus of spoken English, specifically acquired through a referential communication task, we aim to analyze the changes in NP RE structures that occur over the course of communicative interactions.

Our primary research goal is to identify the specific structural elements that undergo modification during the shortening process of NP REs. To achieve this, we will examine the experimental data collected from conversational dyads engaged in a directed communication task involving repeated references to visual stimuli. By analyzing the structural changes in the NP REs produced by the interlocutors, we hope to shed light on the linguistic phenomena underlying the shortening process.

In particular, we will focus on two aspects of structural modification within NP REs. Firstly, we will investigate the presence and usage patterns of clausal post-head elements, which are often associated with structural elaboration. Secondly, we will explore the shift towards the employment of premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification as the shortening process progresses. These shifts in structural modification will provide insights into how interlocutors restructure their language to optimize communication efficiency.

By examining these structural changes, our study seeks to contribute to our understanding of the cognitive and linguistic processes involved in interactive communication. Furthermore, our findings may have implications for various fields, including psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and discourse analysis, as they shed light on how communication participants dynamically adapt their language choice to facilitate effective communication.

The subsequent sections of this paper will provide a comprehensive analysis of the shortening process in NP REs, with particular emphasis on the observed shifts in structural modification. Additionally, we will discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and offer directions for future research. Through this investigation, we aim to enhance our understanding of how individuals adapt their language use during interactive communication, contributing to a broader understanding of the complexities of human linguistic behavior.
