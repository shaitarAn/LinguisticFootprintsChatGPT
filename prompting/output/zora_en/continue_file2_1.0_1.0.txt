Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing humanity today, with far-reaching and potentially catastrophic consequences. In response to this urgent problem, there has been a surge in research on how climate change is framed in communication efforts. Framing refers to the process of selecting certain aspects of an issue and making them more salient in order to shape public opinion and policy responses.

However, despite the abundance of research on framing climate change, there remains a lack of consensus on what exactly framing entails and how it should be studied. This lack of clarity hinders our ability to synthesize and build upon existing theoretical and empirical insights.

To address this gap, this systematic review aims to analyze trends in framing research specifically within the context of climate change communication. Drawing on 25 years of peer-reviewed literature (totaling 275 studies), we adopt a multidimensional approach that considers frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects. By comparing frames across these different dimensions, we aim to harness framing's bridging potential - its ability to bring together diverse perspectives - in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of climate change communication.

Our findings reveal that despite the proliferation of research on framing climate change over the past two decades, little attention has been paid to framing's bridging potential per se. Instead, studies have tended to focus narrowly on individual aspects or locations within the overarching frameworkof cultural meaning-making processes.

This conceptual (mis)fit between frame locations represents an important avenue for future research. By exploring how various dimensions interact with each other - for example, how frame production influences audience frames or how frame content shapes framing effects - we can gain valuable insights into how different aspects contribute towards shaping public perception and action regarding climate change.

Furthermore,the role played by different stakeholders in shaping frames also merits further exploration.Studies have predominantly focused on media frames produced by journalists or scientists rather than other important actors such as policymakers or interest groups.The perspective of various stakeholder groups can greatly influence the framing of climate change, and understanding these dynamics is crucial for effective communication strategies.

Additionally, our review highlights the need for a more integrated and multifaceted approach to framing research. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods of content analysis can provide a more nuanced understanding of how frames operate in climate change communication, complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses.

In conclusion,this systematic review emphasizes the importance of framing as a bridging concept in climate change communication. By considering frame production, content, audience frames, and framing effects as part of a wider cultural framing repository, we can better understand how different dimensions interact with each other to shape public perception and action regarding climate change. This review also identifies areas for future research, including exploring the bridging potential of framing more explicitly,and investigating the role played by various stakeholders in shaping frames.Furthermore,it underscores the need for an integrated approach that combines quantitative and qualitative methods to gain a deeper understandingof this complex phenomenon.
