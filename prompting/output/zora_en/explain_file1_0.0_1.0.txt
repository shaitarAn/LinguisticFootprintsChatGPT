This introduction discusses the phenomenon of reference in conversation, specifically focusing on referring expressions with noun phrases (NP REs). It explains that as interlocutors engage in interactive communication, two changes can typically be observed in the NP REs they produce: convergence and shortening. Convergence refers to the tendency for speakers' contributions to become more similar lexically and grammatically, while shortening refers to the phenomenon of interlocutors reducing the length of their contributions.

The chapter primarily focuses on the process of shortening NP REs during interaction. It aims to describe central trends of structural change-in-interaction in NP REs produced over multiple rounds of dialogue. The research questions addressed include: 1) To what degree do speakers shorten their NP REs over the course of a dialogic interaction? Which elements are subject to shortening? 2) What structural changes can be observed in the production of NP REs across four rounds of an interactive referential communication task?

To investigate these changes, a referential communication task was designed that elicited spoken dialogues over four rounds. The study analyzes a corpus resulting from this task and provides examples illustrating typical trajectories of change.

The focus is on how speakers converge on forms of expression and shorten their NP REs, specifically examining preferred grammatical structures throughout the interaction. The study observes a shift from post-head clausal elements to phrasal (pre-)modification as NP REs get shortened.

Section 2 discusses previous research on change-in-interaction, particularly related to compression in NP REs. This is contextualized within theoretical approaches such as Interactive Alignment Model (IAM) and discussions on familiarity and accessibility.

Section 3 introduces the experimental set-up used to collect spoken English dialogues for analysis. Section 4 presents an analysis of structural changes in NP REs over the course of interactions, showing a shift towards more compressed phrasal forms as they get shortened.

Finally, in Section 5, the findings are discussed in relation to the concept of compression as a response to conveying a large amount of information efficiently.
