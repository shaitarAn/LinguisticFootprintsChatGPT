In the realm of communication, language users often employ noun phrases at the core of their referring expressions (NP REs). These NP REs, which serve to identify and refer to specific entities or concepts, undergo changes throughout the course of a communicative interaction. Previous research has demonstrated that speakers have a tendency to converge on certain linguistic forms, establishing routines, and in the process, they also tend to shorten their NP REs.

The purpose of this chapter is to delve into this process of shortening and examine the structural changes that occur within NP REs as a result. To accomplish this, data from an experimentally elicited corpus of spoken English is analyzed. The corpus consists of conversational dyads engaging in a referential communication task, where they repeatedly refer to visual stimuli. By observing the changes in NP REs over the course of these dialogues, we can gain insights into the structural modifications that take place.

The findings of the study reveal that interlocutors do indeed shorten their NP REs as the dialogues progress. Specifically, there is a noticeable decrease in longer clausal post-head elements, which are elements that occur after the head noun in the NP RE. Conversely, there is a relative increase in the use of only premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification.

These changes in the structure of NP REs indicate a shift in the type of modification employed. Initially, speakers tend to produce more clausal elements, which are associated with structural elaboration. However, as the interaction unfolds, there is a decrease in the use of clausal modification and a corresponding increase in phrasal modification. This shift signifies a move towards structural compression.

The implications of these findings are significant for understanding the dynamics of interactive communication. The observed structural changes in NP REs suggest that as speakers become more familiar with each other and establish routines, they tend to streamline their language production. This streamlining process involves reducing the complexity of NP REs by eliminating clausal elements and opting for shorter, more concise modifications.

The reasons behind this structural compression can be attributed to several factors. One possibility is that as interlocutors become more attuned to each other's linguistic preferences and abilities, they adjust their language production accordingly. By shortening their NP REs, speakers may facilitate comprehension and reduce cognitive load for their conversation partners.

Additionally, the use of shorter and more streamlined NP REs may also serve pragmatic purposes. In interactive communication, efficiency and effectiveness are crucial, and concise expressions can help achieve these goals. By compressing the structure of NP REs, speakers can convey their intended meaning more quickly and directly, allowing for smoother and more efficient communication.

In conclusion, this chapter highlights the phenomenon of post-head compression in NP REs during interactive communication. The analysis of data from a corpus of spoken English reveals that interlocutors tend to shorten their NP REs over the course of a dialogue, with a decrease in clausal elements and an increase in phrasal modification. These structural changes reflect a move towards streamlining language production and optimizing communication efficiency. Understanding these processes can contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of interactive communication and the ways in which language adapts to facilitate effective and efficient information exchange.
