Auto(game)-Poiesis: An Exploration of Gendered Strategies in Wilhelm von Humboldt's 'Geschlechter-Aufsätzen'

Abstract: The role of Wilhelm von Humboldt's 'Geschlechter-Aufsätzen' (1795) in the gender discourse has been well-documented, yet the poetological masculinization strategies employed within them have received little attention. This article seeks to analyze the implications of gender that accompanied the description of poetic and biological production during the dawn of modernity. All three aspects - biological and poetic production, as well as their modes of description - have been intricately intertwined ever since. Humboldt's work, therefore, transforms the description of production into a male-autogamous practice: Poiesis becomes a male affair.

Introduction

Gender and its relationship with the creative process have been a topic of extensive scholarly investigation. The examination of Wilhelm von Humboldt's 'Geschlechter-Aufsätzen' (1795) has shed light on the significance of these texts in shaping the discourse surrounding gender. While previous research has focused on the broader implications of these essays, this study aims to delve deeper into the poetological strategies employed by Humboldt and their impact on the gendered understanding of creative production during the emergence of modernity.

The intertwining of biological and poetic production has long been acknowledged, with scholars recognizing the complex connections between the two realms. However, the gendered implications of these connections have often been overlooked. By examining Humboldt's 'Geschlechter-Aufsätzen,' this article seeks to explore the ways in which the description of production became entangled with notions of masculinity, ultimately transforming poiesis into a male-autogamous practice.

The term "auto(game)-poiesis" is introduced here to encapsulate the multifaceted nature of this investigation. Drawing on the concept of autopoiesis, which refers to the self-creation and self-maintenance of living systems, this study aims to explore how the creative process becomes intertwined with gendered ideologies. The addition of "game" to the term signifies the performative aspect of gender, highlighting the ways in which societal norms and expectations shape the production and reception of creative works.

By focusing on Humboldt's 'Geschlechter-Aufsätzen,' this study aims to shed light on the poetological strategies employed to masculinize the description of production. It seeks to uncover the implicit gendered implications within these texts and their lasting impact on the understanding of creative practices. Furthermore, this article aims to contribute to the broader discussion on gender and creativity by highlighting the ways in which the description of production becomes entangled with societal expectations of masculinity.

To achieve these objectives, this article will begin by providing an overview of the existing research on gender and creativity. It will then delve into an analysis of Humboldt's 'Geschlechter-Aufsätzen,' examining the poetological strategies employed to portray creative production as a male-autogamous practice. The study will also consider the broader societal context in which these texts were written, taking into account the prevailing gender norms and expectations of the time.

In conclusion, this study aims to contribute to our understanding of the gendered dynamics within the creative process. By analyzing Humboldt's 'Geschlechter-Aufsätzen' and the poetological strategies employed within them, this article seeks to demonstrate the lasting impact of these texts on the gendered understanding of creative production. Ultimately, it is hoped that this research will stimulate further discussion and exploration of the complex relationship between gender and creativity in the context of modernity.
