Auto(game)-Poiesis: A Critical Analysis of Video Game Creation

Abstract: The role of video games in contemporary society has been widely studied, with a particular focus on their cultural, social, and psychological implications. However, the process of video game creation, or "auto(game)-poiesis," has received relatively little attention in academic research. This article aims to explore the intricate relationship between gender and the act of video game creation, drawing inspiration from Wilhelm von Humboldt's 'Geschlechter-Aufsätze' (1795) and his masculinization strategies in the realm of poetics.

1. Introduction

In recent years, the popularity of video games has grown exponentially, solidifying their position as a dominant form of entertainment and cultural expression. Scholars from various disciplines have explored the impact of video games on society, investigating their influence on identity formation, social interaction, and cognitive processes. However, one aspect of video games that has been largely overlooked is the creative process behind their development.

The act of video game creation, or "auto(game)-poiesis," refers to the production of video games by their own internal mechanisms. This self-generative process encompasses the design, programming, and implementation of various elements within a game, including characters, narratives, and gameplay mechanics. While the study of video games has often focused on their reception and consumption, understanding the complexities of their creation is crucial for a comprehensive analysis of the medium.

Drawing inspiration from Wilhelm von Humboldt's 'Geschlechter-Aufsätze' (1795), this paper aims to explore the gendered implications of video game creation. Humboldt's work has previously been recognized for its contribution to the gender discourse, yet the specific strategies employed to masculinize the realm of poetics have received limited attention. By examining the ways in which video game creation is intertwined with gender, this research seeks to shed light on the underlying assumptions and power dynamics that shape the production of digital interactive experiences.

In order to achieve this objective, the paper will employ a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on theories from gender studies, media studies, and game studies. By analyzing the representation of gender within video game creation processes, the study will contribute to a broader understanding of how notions of masculinity and femininity are constructed and reinforced within the medium.

The subsequent sections of this paper will delve into the historical and cultural contexts of video game creation, examining the ways in which gender has shaped the practice. Furthermore, the analysis will explore the implications of gendered assumptions on the representation of characters, narratives, and gameplay mechanics within video games. By critically engaging with the gendered dimensions of video game creation, this research aims to spark further discussion and contribute to the ongoing discourse surrounding gender representation in the medium.

In conclusion, this paper seeks to fill a gap in the current literature by examining the gendered implications of video game creation. By drawing on Wilhelm von Humboldt's 'Geschlechter-Aufsätze' (1795) and his strategies of masculinization, the study aims to shed light on the complex relationship between gender and the act of video game creation. Through a multidisciplinary approach, this research aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the power dynamics and assumptions that shape the production of video games.
