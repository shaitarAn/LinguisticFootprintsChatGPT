Auto(game)-poiesis in Wilhelm von Humboldt's Writings

Abstract: The role of Wilhelm von Humboldt's "Gender Essays" (1795) in the discourse on gender has been widely acknowledged; however, their masculinization strategies from a poetics standpoint have received little attention. This article seeks to explore the implications of gender ascribed to descriptions of poetic and biological creation during the advent of modernity. These three aspects - biological and poetic creation, as well as their modes of description - have since become intertwined. In effect, Humboldt argues that the description of creation becomes a male-autogamous practice: poiesis becomes a male affair.

1. Introduction

The exploration of gendered discourses has been central to literary and cultural studies for decades. Scholars have investigated various forms through which gender is constructed, performed, and represented in literature, highlighting the ways in which these constructions shape societal norms and values. However, one aspect that has received comparatively less attention is how gendered descriptions intersect with notions of creativity and artistic production.

In this paper, I aim to address this gap by examining Wilhelm von Humboldt's writings on poetry and biological reproduction within the context of emerging modernity. While much scholarly work has focused on Humboldt's "Gender Essays" due to their significance for understanding early 19th-century perceptions of femininity and masculinity, little attention has been given to his poetics.

Humboldt's writings offer valuable insights into how descriptions of creative processes became intertwined with ideas about gender during this transformative period. By analyzing his texts through a theoretical lens informed by contemporary theories on auto(game)-poiesis – understood here as self-generative creative practices – we can gain new perspectives on how notions of masculinity were constructed within artistic realms.

Drawing upon an interdisciplinary approach that combines literary analysis with insights from cultural history and philosophy, this study will explore how Humboldt's notion that poetic creation is a masculine-autogamous practice influenced the discourse surrounding creative processes. By examining Humboldt's descriptions of both biological and poetic creation, we will uncover how these realms were interconnected and mutually influential.

The research questions guiding this study are as follows: How did Humboldt's writings on poetic creation contribute to the construction of gendered identities during the transition to modernity? What strategies did he employ to masculinize poiesis and create a male-dominated realm of artistic production? How do these constructions intersect with prevailing cultural understandings of gender during this period?

By investigating these questions, this paper aims to shed light on a neglected aspect of Wilhelm von Humboldt's work while contributing to our understanding of how ideas about creativity, gender, and autonomy were intertwined in early 19th-century Europe. This research will enrich our broader understanding of the intersections between literature, culture, and gender dynamics during a crucial period in European intellectual history.

In the following sections, I will provide an overview of relevant theoretical frameworks that inform this study before delving into an analysis of Humboldt's texts. By engaging with his writings through a multidisciplinary lens, we can gain new insights into the ways in which notions of creativity and masculinity shaped societal perceptions during this transformative era.
