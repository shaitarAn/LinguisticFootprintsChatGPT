This introduction provides an overview of the current situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, with a focus on the disproportionate impact on marginalized and underserved populations. It begins by stating that as of June 2022, the U.S. has experienced a significant number of infections and deaths from COVID-19, particularly affecting historically marginalized groups such as minorities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals.

The introduction highlights that Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations have experienced higher infection and death rates compared to non-Latinx White groups. Specifically, it mentions that death rates from COVID-19 are approximately twice as high in Black and Latinx populations than in White groups. The introduction also notes that while vaccines have been developed and proven effective in reducing transmission, hospitalization, and deaths from COVID-19, vaccination rates have been lower in Black and Latinx communities compared to the national average. The reasons for this lower vaccination rate are attributed to factors such as mistrust in the healthcare system and research enterprise, language barriers, immigration issues, and lack of health insurance in low-paying jobs.

The introduction emphasizes that the health disparities observed during the COVID-19 pandemic are not random but result from longstanding racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities caused by structural racism and discriminatory policies. It acknowledges that access to healthcare has improved following the passage of the Affordable Care Act but notes that millions of people remain uninsured, compromising the capacity of the healthcare system to deliver equitable care during a health crisis like the pandemic.

The introduction also mentions that hospitals predominantly serving Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities have been overwhelmed during the pandemic, exacerbating already strained, low-resourced health systems and limiting access to advanced treatments and critical care services.

To provide a framework for understanding the root causes of health disparities, the introduction references the World Health Organization (WHO) Conceptual framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health (WHO CSDH). This framework suggests that structural bases such as social class impact the socioeconomic and political context, which in turn influence structural determinants such as policies, socioeconomic status, and racism. These structural determinants shape exposure to intermediary social determinants like healthcare access, occupational and housing conditions, and psychosocial stress, ultimately influencing an individual's unique social circumstances that impact behavior and disease risk. The introduction emphasizes the importance of evaluating both the immediate circumstances of living and the broader context that influenced COVID-19 outcomes.

The introduction concludes by mentioning that the article aims to discuss the challenges faced by marginalized and underserved populations during the COVID-19 pandemic and share lessons learned. It also highlights that the article will focus on structural determinants as key drivers of health disparities during the pandemic.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the article by providing a comprehensive overview of the impact of COVID-19 on marginalized populations, the underlying social determinants of health, and the intentions of the article to address these issues.
