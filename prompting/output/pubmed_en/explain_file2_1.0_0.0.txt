In this introduction, the authors provide an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic and its disproportionate impact on marginalized populations in the United States. They highlight key statistics, such as the number of infections and deaths among historically marginalized groups. These include minorities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals.

The authors also emphasize the higher infection and death rates among Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations compared to non-Latinx White groups. They note that younger people from these marginalized groups have approximately double the death rates compared to White groups.

The introduction goes on to discuss the development and initial rollout of COVID-19 vaccines as an effective tool to reduce transmission, hospitalization, and deaths. However, vaccination rates have been lower in Black and Latinx communities compared to the national average. The authors attribute this to factors such as mistrust in the healthcare system and research enterprise, language barriers, immigration issues, and lack of health insurance.

The authors then discuss the underlying structural and social determinants of health that have contributed to the disparities observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. They reference the World Health Organization (WHO) Conceptual framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health to highlight the impact of factors such as social class, government policies, socioeconomic status, and racism on health outcomes.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the rest of the article by providing an overview of the disparities faced by marginalized and underserved populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the authors' intent to explore the structural determinants that contributed to these disparities.
