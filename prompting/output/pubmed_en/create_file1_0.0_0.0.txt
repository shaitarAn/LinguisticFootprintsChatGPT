Introduction

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a global health concern, with the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on the rise. Hemodialysis is the primary renal replacement modality for patients with ESRD, and the choice of vascular access plays a crucial role in the success of this treatment. Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts (AVGs) are preferred over central venous catheters due to their lower risk of hospitalization and mortality. However, maintaining the patency of these long-term vascular accesses requires frequent interventions, which not only strain healthcare resources but also impact patients' quality of life and overall outcomes.

Thrombosis is the leading cause of access loss in AVFs and AVGs, accounting for a significant percentage of cases. Thrombosis rates for AVFs and AVGs are reported to be 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days and 0.2 events per patient during a 2-year follow-up, respectively. Access thrombosis is commonly caused by underlying venous or arterial anastomotic stenoses, with systemic factors such as hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications further increasing the risk. Thrombosed access not only leads to delays and omissions in hemodialysis treatment but also necessitates inpatient admissions and, in some cases, the abandonment of access, requiring the placement of dialysis catheters.

Traditionally, surgical thrombectomy was the standard treatment for thrombosed AV access, but with the advancement of intravascular techniques, endovascular thrombectomy has become the preferred approach. Endovascular thrombectomy involves the mechanical removal of thrombus using various devices, such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms. Additionally, adjunctive methods like cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement are employed to treat stenoses in the AV circuit. Thrombolysis, the dissolution of thrombus using fibrinolytic agents, is another approach used in these interventions.

This narrative review aims to provide an overview of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. By synthesizing the available literature from electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, we aim to enhance the understanding of these techniques and their implications in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access. It is crucial for healthcare professionals involved in the care of ESRD patients to be familiar with these techniques to ensure timely and effective treatment, thereby minimizing the impact of access thrombosis on patient outcomes.
