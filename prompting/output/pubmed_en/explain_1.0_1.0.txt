This article is a narrative review that discusses the use of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

The abstract provides an overview of the topic, explaining that AV access is important for ESRD patients to receive hemodialysis. When thrombosis occurs in the AV access, it can lead to delays in hemodialysis treatment or require the placement of a dialysis catheter. The article describes how endovascular approaches have become the preferred treatment option over surgery for managing thrombosed access.

The introduction provides additional context and explains that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing globally and contributing to overall disease burden. Hemodialysis is commonly used as a renal replacement therapy for ESRD patients, and AVF and AVG are preferred over central venous catheters due to better outcomes. However, maintaining patency of long-term vascular accesses often requires frequent interventions, which can impact both healthcare resources and patients' quality of life.

Thrombosis is identified as the leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG cases, accounting for 65-85% of instances. The prevalence rate per patient is provided for both AVFs and AVGs during specific follow-up periods. Various systemic factors are mentioned that increase the risk of access thrombosis, such as hypercoagulability or low ejection fraction.

The consequences of thrombosed access are discussed further, including hemodialysis treatment delays, omissions, hospitalizations, or abandonment requiring catheter placement. Descriptions about different types of clots found in arteriovenous accesses are given.

The article then highlights how traditional surgical approaches have been replaced by endovascular techniques with imaging guidance. The success rates reported from prior studies range from 70-90%. There has been a significant increase in the number of endovascular access thrombectomy procedures over the past 20 years.

The overall aim of this review article is to summarize current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for treating thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. It concludes by stating that the review article was written based on a literature search conducted using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar.
