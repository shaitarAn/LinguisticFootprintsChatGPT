End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition in which the kidneys are no longer able to function properly, requiring patients to undergo hemodialysis for the removal of waste products and excess fluid from the body. Arteriovenous (AV) access, in the form of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) or fistulas (AVFs), is crucial for hemodialysis, as it provides a site for blood to be removed and returned during the procedure. However, thrombosis, or the formation of blood clots, can occur in AV access, leading to complications and potentially requiring the placement of a dialysis catheter.

Traditionally, surgical intervention was the primary treatment option for thrombosed AV access. However, over the years, endovascular approaches have gained popularity due to their minimally invasive nature and improved outcomes. Endovascular thrombectomy techniques involve the removal of thrombus from the AV circuit and the treatment of any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to thrombosis, such as stenosis at the anastomotic site.

Thrombolysis, the process of dissolving thrombus, is one of the main techniques used in endovascular thrombectomy. This can be achieved by using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices to administer fibrinolytic agents directly into the thrombus. Thrombolysis has shown promising results in restoring patency to thrombosed AV access, but it is not without risks. Complications such as vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain can occur during or after the procedure.

Another technique used in endovascular thrombectomy is thrombectomy itself, which involves the mechanical removal of thrombus. This can be achieved using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms. These devices are designed to physically break up and remove the thrombus from the AV circuit. Thrombectomy has shown to be effective in restoring patency to thrombosed AV access, with lower rates of complications compared to thrombolysis. However, it is important to note that the choice of thrombectomy technique may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the thrombus and the AV access.

In addition to thrombectomy, adjunctive methods such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement can be used to treat stenoses in the AV circuit. These techniques aim to address any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to thrombosis and improve long-term patency rates. However, the use of these adjunctive methods should be carefully considered, as they may also carry their own risks and complications.

In conclusion, endovascular thrombectomy techniques have become the preferred treatment option for thrombosed AV access in patients with ESRD. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy are effective in restoring patency to thrombosed AV access, with thrombectomy showing lower rates of complications. However, it is important for healthcare providers to have a thorough understanding of these techniques and their potential complications in order to provide optimal care for patients with thrombosed AV access. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of these techniques in the ESRD population.
