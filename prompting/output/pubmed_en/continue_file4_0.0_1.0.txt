Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a significant public health concern among older adults. It is associated with increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality. Nutritional interventions have been proposed as a potential strategy to prevent or manage sarcopenia.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential nutrients that play important roles in various physiological processes, including muscle metabolism and inflammation. Omega-3 PUFAs, such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and may promote muscle protein synthesis.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The study used baseline data from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial, which is a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

The results showed that the total omega-3 intake of participants was below the recommended intake levels for both men and women. This suggests that older adults with sarcopenia may not be consuming enough omega-3 PUFAs through their diet alone. Interestingly, there was no correlation between dietary PUFA intake and nutritional PUFA status in this population.

When examining associations between PUFA intake/status and sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, mass, physical performance), physical activity (step count), and quality of life scores (SF-36, SarQoL), some interesting findings emerged. Higher ALA status was inversely associated with appendicular lean mass (aLM), while higher DHA status was positively associated with aLM. These findings suggest that specific PUFAs may have differential effects on muscle mass in older adults with sarcopenia.

Furthermore, some PUFA intake and status markers were positively associated with physical activity levels and quality of life scores. This suggests that adequate PUFA intake/status may have beneficial effects beyond muscle health, potentially improving overall well-being in this population.

It is important to note that this study is exploratory in nature and the sample size was relatively small. Therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution. However, they provide valuable insights into the potential role of PUFAs in sarcopenia outcomes among older adults.

In conclusion, this study highlights the need for further research to better understand the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Ultimately, optimizing PUFA intake/status may be a promising strategy for preventing or managing sarcopenia in older adults.
