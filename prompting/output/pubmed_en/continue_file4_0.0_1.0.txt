Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a significant health concern in older adults. It is associated with increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality. Nutritional interventions have been proposed as a potential strategy to prevent or manage sarcopenia. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3 PUFAs, have been suggested to play a role in muscle health.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The study utilized baseline data from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial, which is an ongoing randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

A total of 29 participants (9 males and 20 females) with a mean age of 76.3 years were included in the analysis. Dietary intake of PUFAs was assessed using 4-day food records, while nutritional status was determined by measuring red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles.

The results showed that the total omega-3 intake among participants was below the recommended levels for both males and females. This suggests that there may be inadequate consumption of omega-3 PUFAs among older adults with sarcopenia.

Interestingly, there was no correlation observed between dietary intake and nutritional status of PUFAs. This suggests that factors other than diet may influence PUFA status in this population.

When examining associations between PUFA intake/status and sarcopenia outcomes, it was found that higher levels of alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 PUFA) were associated with lower appendicular lean mass (a measure of muscle mass). On the other hand, higher levels docosahexaenoic acid (another omega-3 PUFA) were associated with higher appendicular lean mass. These findings suggest that different PUFAs may have varying effects on muscle mass in older adults with sarcopenia.

Furthermore, some markers of PUFA intake/status were positively associated with physical activity levels, quality of life scores, and overall well-being. This suggests that adequate PUFA intake/status may have beneficial effects beyond muscle health in this population.

It is important to note that this study is exploratory in nature and the sample size was small. Therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution and further research is needed to confirm these associations.

In conclusion, this exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for potential correlations between PUFA intake/status and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The findings suggest that specific PUFAs may influence muscle mass and other aspects of health in this population. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms underlying these associations and explore the potential benefits of targeted nutritional interventions for sarcopenia management.
