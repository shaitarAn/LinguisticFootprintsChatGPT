Introduction

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound impact on global health, with the United States being one of the most affected countries. Since its emergence in late 2019, COVID-19 has exposed and exacerbated existing health disparities within the United States healthcare system. Specifically, it has disproportionately affected historically marginalized populations such as Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals.

Health disparities refer to differences in health outcomes between different population groups that are systematic and avoidable. These disparities are often rooted in structural, institutional, and socioeconomic inequities that have persisted for generations. The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on these deep-rooted inequalities by revealing stark differences in infection rates, hospitalization rates, and mortality rates among various racial and ethnic groups.

Historically marginalized populations face unique challenges that contribute to their increased vulnerability to COVID-19. For instance, many individuals from these communities are employed in low-wage jobs without access to adequate healthcare coverage or paid sick leave. This lack of financial security forces them to continue working even when they may be at risk of contracting or spreading the virus.

Furthermore, mistrust in the healthcare system is prevalent among historically marginalized populations due to a long history of systemic racism and discrimination within medical institutions. This mistrust stems from past unethical medical practices such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted on African American men without their informed consent. Such historical events have created a deep-seated skepticism towards medical interventions within these communities.

Language barriers also pose significant challenges for minority populations during public health crises like COVID-19. Limited English proficiency can hinder access to accurate information about preventive measures or vaccination campaigns. Additionally, cultural beliefs surrounding illness may differ across diverse communities leading to varying perceptions about disease transmission and prevention strategies.

Limited health literacy further compounds these challenges faced by historically marginalized populations during the pandemic. Health literacy refers to an individual's ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Low health literacy levels are more prevalent among minority populations due to educational disparities and limited access to healthcare resources.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for targeted interventions that address these underlying factors contributing to health disparities. Efforts must be made to dismantle systemic barriers that perpetuate inequities in healthcare access, delivery, and outcomes. This requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses policy changes, community engagement, culturally sensitive healthcare practices, and improved access to education and resources.

In this article, we aim to explore the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to health disparities among historically marginalized populations in the United States. By examining existing research and data on COVID-19's impact on Black, Latinx, Indigenous communities as well as immigrants and economically disadvantaged individuals, we will identify key areas for improvement moving forward. Additionally, we will discuss strategies for mitigating these disparities through targeted interventions aimed at addressing structural inequalities within the healthcare system.

By understanding the unique challenges faced by historically marginalized populations during public health crises like COVID-19, policymakers can develop evidence-based strategies that promote equity in healthcare delivery. It is crucial that lessons learned from this pandemic inform future policies and interventions aimed at reducing health disparities not only during times of crisis but also in everyday healthcare practices.
