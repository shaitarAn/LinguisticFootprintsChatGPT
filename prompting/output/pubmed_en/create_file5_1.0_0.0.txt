Introduction

The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to over 500 million reported cases worldwide. As the number of infections continues to rise, there is a growing concern about the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly referred to as long COVID. PASC is characterized by prolonged and relapsing symptoms that occur after the acute phase of the infection, lasting for at least four weeks. These symptoms can affect various organ systems and have a significant impact on the overall health and well-being of individuals.

The severity and outcomes of both the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent PASC are believed to be influenced by exaggerated immune responses. Studies have demonstrated that immune dysregulation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of acute COVID-19, as well as the systemic and tissue-specific manifestations of PASC. However, the specific immune mechanisms underlying PASC and its heterogeneity remain poorly understood.

This review aims to examine the current literature on the mechanisms of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 and the emerging data on the immunopathology of PASC. While there may be some shared mechanisms between the acute and post-acute phases of the disease, it is important to acknowledge that PASC immunopathology is likely distinct and heterogeneous. Therefore, large-scale longitudinal analyses are needed to identify specific molecular signals and immune cell populations that contribute to the pathogenesis of PASC in patients with and without the condition.

To address the knowledge gaps in PASC immunopathology, our review will provide a comprehensive overview of current understanding while also highlighting the need for novel research directions. The ultimate goal is to identify specific pathways and targets for precision therapies that can restore healthy immune function in PASC patients.

The NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, involving over 100 researchers across the United States, is actively investigating PASC through new studies and leveraging existing long-term cohort studies. With the generation of a large SARS-CoV-2 recovery cohort and the collection of comprehensive data, including biospecimens, the aim is to develop preventive and therapeutic treatments for the significant public health impact of COVID-19 and its associated post-acute sequelae.

In this article, we bring together researchers with expertise in adult and pediatric medicine to review the role of the innate and adaptive immune systems in the pathogenesis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC. Our focus on immune mechanisms will shed light on the dysregulation of immune processes intertwined with viral persistence and tissue-specific pathologies. We will also explore potential hypotheses for PASC-related immune dysregulation and suggest studies that can address these critical questions.

While there may be important differences between immune mechanisms during acute COVID-19 and those involved in PASC, the understanding of acute immunopathology can serve as a foundation for investigating candidate pathways in PASC. By outlining the established knowledge on acute COVID-19 as well as the limited data on the immunopathology of chronic PASC, we hope to identify new avenues for research that will advance our understanding of PASC immunopathology.

In conclusion, understanding the immune mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathology and PASC is essential for the development of preventive and treatment strategies. Through collaboration, data collection, and innovative research, we aim to identify the specific immune dysregulation pathways and targets that will ultimately lead to precision therapies for PASC.
