The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide and contributing to the global burden of disease. Hemodialysis is the most common renal replacement modality for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Compared to central venous catheters, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) are the preferred access for chronic hemodialysis treatment due to lower hospitalization risk and mortality [REF]. Poorer outcomes in catheter-dependent patients are associated with increased risk of sepsis and bacteremia [REF]. However, long-term vascular accesses typically require frequent interventions to maintain access patency, which is not only a significant burden on health care resources, but also impacts patients’ quality of life with implications on morbidity and mortality.Thrombosis is the leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG, accounting for 65–85 of the cases [REF]. Thrombosis rate for AVF is 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days [REF], and AVG thrombosis occurs 0.2 events per patient during 2 years follow-up [REF]. Access thrombosis is commonly caused by underlying venous or arterial anastomotic stenoses. Systemic factors that can increase the risk of access thrombosis include hypercoagulability [REF], low ejection fraction [REF], hypotension and hemoconcentration [REF]. Cannulation complications resulting in hematomas can also lead to access thrombosis [REF].Thrombosed access leads to hemodialysis treatment delays, treatment omissions, inpatient admissions and abandonment of access requiring dialysis catheter placement [REF]. Thrombus formed in arteriovenous (AV) access is comprised of two components: soft, friable clot that disintegrates easily in the venous outflow and a firm fibrin plug near the anastomosis [REF]. To date, no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies can prevent access thrombosis. The long-term effect of anti-platelet therapy and warfarin on access patency remains unclear [REF]. Thrombosed access should be treated as soon as possible to avoid delay on dialysis treatment and catheter placement. When fresh thrombus hardens into adherent thrombus in the native vein of an AVF, thrombectomy becomes less likely to be successful [REF]. As a result, thrombectomy in AVF should be performed within days, whereas thrombectomy in AVG can still be successful up to a week. Early experiences with thrombosed AV access required surgical thrombectomy, which usually requires hospitalization and operation room resources. However, with the development of intravascular techniques, endovascular thrombectomy has become the standard of care for thrombosed access. Under imaging guidance, not only can the thrombus be removed, underlying anatomical abnormalities (such as stenoses) can also be treated. As reported by prior studies, procedure success rates for thrombosed fistula or graft by endovascular approach have a range of 70–90% [REF]. Compared to 20 years ago, the number of endovascular access thrombectomy procedure has doubled for AVF and tripled for AVG [REF]. This article aims to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs.
