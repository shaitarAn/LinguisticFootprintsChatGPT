The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction. While most individuals recover from the acute phase of the illness, a significant proportion continue to experience persistent symptoms and disabilities long after the resolution of their initial infection. This condition has been termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or more commonly known as long COVID.

The underlying mechanisms driving PASC are still not well understood. However, emerging evidence suggests that dysregulated immune responses play a crucial role in both the severity of acute COVID-19 and the development of PASC. During the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, an exaggerated immune response characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, also known as a cytokine storm, can contribute to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.

In severe cases, this dysregulated immune response can lead to widespread inflammation throughout the body affecting multiple organs. The lungs are particularly affected due to direct viral invasion and subsequent damage caused by infiltrating immune cells. The inflammatory cascade can trigger endothelial dysfunction and coagulation abnormalities leading to microthrombi formation in various organs.

The adaptive immune response also plays a critical role in COVID-19 pathology and potentially in PASC development. Studies have shown that lymphopenia is associated with disease severity during acute infection, indicating impaired T cell function or depletion. Additionally, there is evidence suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies may persist for an extended period after initial infection but might not confer complete protection against reinfection or prevent PASC development.

Understanding the immunopathology underlying PASC requires comprehensive analyses at both molecular and cellular levels. Numerous unanswered questions remain regarding specific molecular signals involved in perpetuating chronic inflammation in affected individuals. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of PASC suggests that different immune cell populations may contribute to distinct manifestations and symptoms experienced by patients.

Longitudinal studies comparing individuals with and without PASC are essential to unravel the complex immunopathological mechanisms at play. These investigations should include comprehensive profiling of immune cell subsets, analysis of cytokine profiles, and evaluation of tissue pathology in affected organs. Large-scale collaborative efforts will be necessary to obtain robust data that can guide the development of precision therapies targeting specific immune dysregulations observed in PASC.

In conclusion, while there is still much to learn about the immunopathology underlying both acute COVID-19 and PASC, evidence points towards dysregulated immune responses as key drivers of disease severity and persistent symptoms. Future research focusing on identifying specific molecular signals and immune cell populations involved in promoting PASC pathogenesis is crucial for developing targeted therapies that restore healthy immune function in affected individuals.
