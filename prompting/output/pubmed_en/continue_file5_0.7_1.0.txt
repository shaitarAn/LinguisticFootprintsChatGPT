The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a significant impact on global health. While the majority of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience mild to moderate symptoms, a subset of patients develop severe disease characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and even death. However, even among those who recover from the acute phase of infection, there is growing recognition of persistent symptoms and functional impairments that can last for months after the initial infection. This condition is referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or long COVID.

Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulated immune responses play a crucial role in both the severity of acute COVID-19 and the pathogenesis of PASC. During the acute phase, SARS-CoV-2 triggers an inflammatory response characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). These cytokines can lead to endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular permeability, and recruitment of immune cells to sites of infection.

In severe cases, this exaggerated immune response can result in a cytokine storm syndrome known as macrophage activation syndrome or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. This hyperinflammatory state contributes to tissue damage not only in the lungs but also in other organs such as the heart, kidneys, liver, and brain.

While these immunopathological processes are well-described during acute COVID-19, our understanding of PASC immunopathology remains limited. Preliminary studies suggest that PASC may involve persistent immune dysregulation leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. However, it is important to note that PASC appears to be heterogeneous with various clinical manifestations ranging from neurological symptoms such as brain fog and fatigue to cardiovascular abnormalities, respiratory impairments, and musculoskeletal pain.

To unravel the immunopathology of PASC, longitudinal studies are needed to compare immune responses in patients with and without persistent symptoms. These studies should include comprehensive assessments of both innate and adaptive immune cells as well as analysis of specific molecular signals involved in immune dysregulation.

One hypothesis is that persistent viral reservoirs may contribute to chronic immune activation in PASC. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in various tissues beyond the respiratory tract, including the heart, brain, kidney, and gastrointestinal system. Viral persistence may trigger ongoing inflammation and tissue damage even after clearance of the initial infection.

Another potential mechanism underlying PASC immunopathology is autoimmune dysregulation. It has been observed that some individuals develop autoantibodies targeting various self-antigens following SARS-CoV-2 infection. These autoantibodies can lead to tissue damage through complement activation or direct binding to target cells.

Furthermore, alterations in T cell responses have also been implicated in PASC pathogenesis. Studies have shown that individuals with long COVID exhibit aberrant T cell profiles characterized by reduced numbers of central memory T cells and increased levels of exhausted T cells. These dysfunctional T cell responses may contribute to impaired viral clearance and perpetuation of chronic inflammation.

In conclusion, understanding the immunopathology underlying both severe acute COVID-19 and PASC is crucial for developing targeted therapies for patients with persistent symptoms. Longitudinal studies combining detailed immune profiling with clinical data will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving PASC pathogenesis. Identifying specific molecular signals as well as immune cell populations involved will pave the way for precision therapies aimed at restoring healthy immune function in patients with long COVID.
