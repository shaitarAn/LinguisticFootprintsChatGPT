The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented number of infections worldwide. While the majority of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover fully within a few weeks, a significant proportion develop more severe disease requiring hospitalization. Moreover, there is increasing recognition of a subset of individuals who experience persistent symptoms and functional impairments long after the resolution of the acute infection. This condition, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID, has become a major concern for both patients and healthcare providers.

The underlying mechanisms driving PASC are not yet well understood but emerging evidence suggests that dysregulated immune responses play a crucial role. In severe cases of COVID-19, excessive activation of both innate and adaptive immune responses leads to widespread inflammation throughout the body. This hyperinflammatory state can result in multiorgan damage and contribute to poor outcomes.

Similar immune dysregulation may also be implicated in PASC. However, it is important to recognize that while some aspects of immunopathology may overlap between acute COVID-19 and PASC, there are likely distinct mechanisms at play during the post-acute phase. Understanding these differences is essential for developing targeted therapies for PASC patients.

In this review, we aim to summarize the current understanding of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 and explore emerging evidence on the immunopathology specific to PASC. We will discuss key molecular signals involved in promoting inflammation during acute infection as well as potential drivers of chronic inflammation in PASC. Additionally, we will delve into specific immune cell populations that have been implicated in both acute and post-acute phases.

One challenge in studying PASC is its heterogeneity - patients present with varying combinations and severity of symptoms making it difficult to identify common pathways or biomarkers associated with disease progression or resolution. Thus, large-scale longitudinal studies involving diverse patient populations are necessary to unravel the complexities of PASC immunopathology.

By identifying the knowledge gaps in our understanding of PASC immunopathology, we hope to highlight areas for future research. Ultimately, a comprehensive understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying PASC will pave the way for precision therapies that target specific pathways or immune cell populations to restore healthy immune function in affected individuals.
