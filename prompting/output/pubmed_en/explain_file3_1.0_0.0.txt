This introduction provides background information on the role of adenosine (ADO) in cellular metabolism and its function as a signaling molecule in various biological processes. It starts by explaining that ADO is a metabolic intermediate involved in the breakdown of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and the synthesis of important signaling molecules like cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).

The introduction emphasizes the role of extracellular nucleotides, including purines and pyrimidines, as signaling molecules in several physiological systems such as blood pressure regulation, platelet activation, cardiovascular system remodeling, neurotransmission, anti-cell death, promotion of cell growth, and immunoregulation. It states that under normal physiological conditions, both ATP and ADO are present in low levels in the extracellular space.

However, the introduction highlights that certain cellular conditions and stresses, such as cell membrane damage, ischemia, inflammation, and cancer, can trigger the massive release of ATP in various controlled and non-controlled ways. This leads to the accumulation of extracellular ATP (eATP), which acts as a danger signal or Danger-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP), attracting phagocytic cells to inflammatory sites and alerting the immune system about the presence of pathogens or cell/tissue damage.

The introduction further explains that the inflammatory response triggered by eATP is mediated through P2 purinergic receptors, specifically the ligand-gated receptors (P2X) and metabotropic nucleotide-selective receptors (P2Y). It also mentions that while most P2Y receptors promote oncogenic processes directly in tumor cells, P2Y receptors in immune cells regulate these processes indirectly.

Recent studies have suggested that eATP activates the P2X7 receptor expressed on various immune cells to promote the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of inflammatory cytokines, enhancing anti-tumor immunity. However, the introduction notes that eATP in the tumor microenvironment is rapidly hydrolyzed to extracellular adenosine (eADO) due to the higher levels of ectonucleotidases in solid tumors compared to non-tumor tissues.

The metabolic pathways for eADO production, degradation, and signaling are discussed in detail. The canonical pathway involves the sequential hydrolysis of eATP to extracellular ADP and AMP by CD39 (ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1) and CD73 (5'-nucleotidase), respectively. However, it is noted that eAMP can also be phosphorylated back to eATP by other enzymes.

Additionally, the introduction mentions a non-classical eADO production pathway mediated by CD38 and CD203a, involving the hydrolysis of extracellular NAD to ADP-ribose and further breakdown to eADO. Other enzymes like prostatic acid phosphatase and tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase are also reported to contribute to the hydrolysis of eAMP to eADO.

The brief section on the intracellular metabolism of adenosine highlights that it can be further metabolized into inosine or hypoxanthine through the actions of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), respectively. It also mentions the transport of eADO into cells via specific nucleoside transporters and the various metabolic pathways inside cells.

The introduction concludes by noting that although the half-life of eADO is short in the extracellular space, its concentration can remain high in the tumor microenvironment due to ATP release from cancer cells, Treg (regulatory T) cell deaths, and the expression of CD73 by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This leads to adenosine signaling regulation in all cell types within the tumor microenvironment, ultimately supporting tumor cell growth.

Overall, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the role of adenosine and extracellular ATP in cellular metabolism, signaling, and their involvement in cancer and inflammation within the tumor microenvironment.
