This article discusses the role of the adenosinergic machinery in cancer, specifically focusing on the production and signaling of extracellular adenosine (eADO) and its impact on immune responses and tumor immunity.

The abstract provides an overview of the main findings and conclusions of the article. It states that eADO is primarily produced from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP), which is released into the extracellular space following cell death or cellular stress triggered by factors such as hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation. The pro-inflammatory role of eATP is mediated through the activation of P2 purinergic receptors, while eADO has been found to mediate immunosuppression by activating P1 purinergic receptors in various immune cells. The alteration of eATP to eADO not only reduces eATP levels but also enhances adenosine receptor signaling, thus affecting immunosurveillance in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The authors also mention that the effects of both P1 and P2 purinergic receptors are not limited to immune cells.

In the introduction, the authors provide more background information on adenosine metabolism and its involvement in various physiological processes, such as ATP catabolism, synthesis of signaling molecules like cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and its role as a signaling molecule in systems like blood pressure regulation, platelet activation, cardiovascular system remodeling, neurotransmission, anti-cell death, promotion of cell growth, and immunoregulation. They explain that under normal conditions, both ATP and adenosine are usually present at low levels in the extracellular space. However, conditions and stresses like cell membrane damage, ischemia, inflammation, and cancer can lead to the massive release of ATP, serving as a danger signal to attract phagocytic cells to the inflammatory sites and alert the immune system. The activation of inflammation by eATP is mediated through P2 purinergic receptors. The authors also discuss recent studies suggesting that eATP can activate specific receptors expressed on immune cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity. However, eATP is rapidly hydrolyzed to eADO in the TME due to the high levels of ectonucleotidases in solid tumors. The production, degradation, and signaling pathways of eADO are explained in more detail, including the involvement of various ectonucleotidases and the fate of eAMP. The authors also note that eADO can be transported into cells via specific transporters and has various metabolic pathways inside the cells.

The authors then discuss how the concentration of eADO can remain high in the TME due to ATP release from cancer cell death and the contribution of Treg cell deaths and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to eADO production. The role of eADO in balancing immune system activation and overreaction under physiological conditions is mentioned, but in the TME, all cell types are regulated by adenosine signaling and contribute to eADO production, ultimately supporting tumor cell growth.

Overall, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the adenosinergic machinery in cancer, from the basic mechanisms of production and degradation of eATP and eADO to the impact on immune responses and potential therapeutic implications in immuno-oncology.
