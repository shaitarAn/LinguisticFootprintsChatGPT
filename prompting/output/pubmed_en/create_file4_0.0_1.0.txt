Introduction

Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function with aging, is a major public health concern among older adults (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). It is associated with increased risk of falls, fractures, disability, and mortality (Landi et al., 2018). The prevalence of sarcopenia is estimated to be around 10-40% in community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and above (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019).

Dietary factors play a crucial role in the development and progression of sarcopenia. Adequate intake of macronutrients such as protein has been widely recognized as essential for maintaining muscle mass and function in older adults (Bauer et al., 2013). However, emerging evidence suggests that specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may also have an impact on sarcopenia outcomes.

PUFAs are essential fatty acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through dietary sources. They are classified into two main groups: omega-3 PUFAs (e.g., alpha-linolenic acid [ALA], eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and omega-6 PUFAs (e.g., linoleic acid [LA], gamma-linolenic acid [GLA]). Omega-3 PUFAs have been extensively studied for their anti-inflammatory properties and potential benefits on various health outcomes including cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and inflammatory diseases (Calder et al., 2020). However, their role in sarcopenia remains unclear.

Previous studies investigating the association between dietary intake or nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes have yielded inconsistent results. Some studies have reported positive associations between omega-3 PUFA intake or status and muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in older adults (Smith et al., 2015; Robinson et al., 2018). Conversely, other studies have found no significant associations or even inverse relationships (Maggio et al., 2013; Beasley et al., 2020).

To date, most of the research on PUFAs and sarcopenia has focused on individual PUFAs or their ratios. Limited studies have examined the comprehensive profile of PUFAs intake and nutritional status in relation to sarcopenia outcomes. Furthermore, the majority of existing studies have been conducted in clinical settings or specific populations such as institutionalized older adults or those with chronic diseases. There is a paucity of data regarding the association between PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults.

Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. By utilizing baseline data from an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will investigate whether there are any correlations between PUFAs intake/status and muscle strength, mass, physical performance, physical activity levels, and quality of life among older adults with sarcopenia.

Understanding the potential role of specific PUFAs in sarcopenia outcomes may provide valuable insights into dietary interventions for preventing or managing sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. This knowledge could contribute to the development of targeted nutritional strategies aimed at optimizing muscle health and functional capacity among this vulnerable population.

In conclusion, this study seeks to address a critical research gap by examining the association between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with various aspects of sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults. The findings from this study may have important implications for public health policies targeting nutrition interventions for preventing or managing age-related muscle loss and functional decline.
