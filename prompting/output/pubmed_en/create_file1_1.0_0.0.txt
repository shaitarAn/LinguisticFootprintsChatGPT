Introduction:

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a chronic and progressive condition characterized by the irreversible loss of renal function. The prevalence of ESRD has been steadily increasing worldwide, with an estimated 2.62 million patients currently receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) globally (Liyanage et al., 2015). Hemodialysis, a widely used form of RRT, relies on the establishment and maintenance of adequate vascular access to facilitate the repeated removal and return of blood for purification. Arteriovenous (AV) grafts and fistulas, collectively referred to as arteriovenous access, have become the preferred options for long-term hemodialysis due to their improved patency rates and lower risk of infection compared to central venous catheters (Lok et al., 2012).

However, thrombosis, the formation of blood clots, remains a significant complication in the management of AV access. Thrombotic occlusion can lead to the sudden loss of functional access, causing delays in hemodialysis or necessitating the insertion of dialysis catheters, which pose an increased risk of infection and thromboembolic events. The incidence of thrombosed AV access varies widely, with reported rates ranging from 10% to 77% depending on the type of access and patient characteristics (Dixon et al., 2016; Roy-Chaudhury et al., 2006).

Over the years, the management of thrombosed AV access has evolved, with advances in endovascular techniques playing a pivotal role in improving clinical outcomes. Endovascular thrombectomy, the mechanical or chemical removal of thrombus, has emerged as the preferred treatment option, replacing surgical interventions in many cases. This narrative review aims to comprehensively evaluate the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for thrombosed AV grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) in patients with ESRD.

1. Purpose of the Study:

The primary objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature on endovascular thrombectomy techniques employed in the treatment of thrombosed AV access in patients with ESRD. By synthesizing the available evidence, we aim to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and long-term outcomes associated with different thrombectomy approaches while identifying potential complications and their management. Furthermore, this study seeks to highlight the importance of understanding thrombectomy techniques to optimize the management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

2. Research Question:

The focal research question of this study is as follows:

"What are the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques used in the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients?"

3. Significance of the Study:

Thrombosed AV access remains a complex clinical challenge in the management of patients with ESRD. By elucidating the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques, this study holds significant clinical relevance. Improved understanding of these techniques can aid healthcare providers in making informed decisions, facilitating timely interventions, and optimizing patient outcomes. Furthermore, this study may identify areas for further research and development of novel strategies to prevent and manage thrombosis in AV access.

In summary, this review aims to contribute to the existing body of knowledge by providing a comprehensive assessment of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for thrombosed AV access in patients with ESRD. By systematically evaluating the literature, we aim to offer evidence-based insights that can inform clinical practice, improve patient outcomes, and drive future research endeavors in this field.
