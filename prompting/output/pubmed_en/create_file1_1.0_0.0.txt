Introduction

Thrombosis of arteriovenous access, including arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), remains a significant challenge in the management of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving hemodialysis. Access thrombosis frequently leads to delays in the initiation of crucial hemodialysis sessions or abandonment of the access altogether, necessitating the placement of temporary dialysis catheters. The incidence and impact of access thrombosis are substantial, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality rates in this patient population.

In recent years, endovascular thrombectomy techniques have emerged as the preferred treatment option for thrombosed arteriovenous access, offering several advantages over surgical intervention. Endovascular approaches involve the removal of thrombi from the access circuit while simultaneously addressing any underlying anatomical abnormalities such as anastomotic stenosis. These techniques encompass a range of interventions, including thrombolysis and thrombectomy, with various adjunctive methods for treating stenoses within the arteriovenous circuit.

Thrombolysis, the dissolution of thrombi, is typically achieved through the infusion of fibrinolytic agents using specialized catheters or pulse injector devices. On the other hand, thrombectomy involves the mechanical removal of thrombi utilizing embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms. Additionally, cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement often serve as adjunctive methods to address stenotic lesions within the arteriovenous circuit.

While endovascular thrombectomy techniques have demonstrated promising outcomes in the treatment of thrombosed access, several complications may arise during or after the procedures. These complications include vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain. Understanding the various thrombectomy techniques available, their efficacy, and the associated risks and benefits is crucial for guiding the optimal management of patients with thrombosed arteriovenous access.

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques in the context of managing thrombosed arteriovenous access among ESRD patients. Drawing upon extensive literature search from electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, this article will critically evaluate the existing body of evidence, highlight gaps in knowledge, and identify potential areas for future research and clinical advancements in the field. By doing so, we aim to contribute to the improved management and outcomes of patients with thrombosed arteriovenous access, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of care provided to this vulnerable population.
