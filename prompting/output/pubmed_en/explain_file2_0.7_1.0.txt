This article discusses the health disparities that have been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, specifically among Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals. These historically marginalized groups are more likely to be employed in low-wage jobs without health insurance and have higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 compared to non-Latinx White individuals.

The article highlights several factors that contribute to these disparities. Mistrust in the healthcare system, language barriers, and limited health literacy have hindered vaccination rates among minorities. These issues are rooted in structural inequities such as racism, discriminatory policies regarding access to education, employment, housing, and healthcare.

The authors discuss the lessons learned from the first two years of the pandemic and propose strategies to mitigate these health disparities moving forward. They emphasize that addressing social determinants of health is crucial in reducing these disparities. The World Health Organization's Conceptual Framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health is used as a guide to understand how structural determinants such as social class impact socioeconomic and political contexts which ultimately shape exposure to intermediary social determinants.

The article provides evidence that minorities living in hotspot counties were disproportionately affected by COVID-19 compared to their representation in the population. For example, Black populations had 30.2% more cases than expected based on their proportion of the population. Similar trends were observed for Latinx populations.

Overall, this article underscores the urgent need for addressing systemic inequities that contribute to health disparities during pandemics like COVID-19. It emphasizes the importance of understanding social determinants of health when developing interventions aimed at reducing these disparities.
