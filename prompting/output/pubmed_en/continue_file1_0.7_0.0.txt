End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects millions of individuals worldwide, requiring them to undergo hemodialysis for survival. Arteriovenous (AV) access, in the form of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) or fistulas (AVFs), is crucial for the successful delivery of hemodialysis. However, thrombosis of AV access remains a common complication, leading to significant morbidity and potential loss of access.

Traditionally, surgical intervention was the mainstay of treatment for thrombosed AV access. However, with advancements in endovascular techniques, the endovascular approach has emerged as the preferred treatment option. Endovascular thrombectomy involves the removal of thrombus from the AV circuit and the treatment of any underlying anatomical abnormalities that contribute to thrombosis, such as anastomotic stenosis.

One method of thrombolysis, the dissolution of thrombus, is achieved by using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices to administer fibrinolytic agents directly into the thrombosed segment. Thrombectomy, on the other hand, involves the mechanical removal of thrombus using various devices such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, and rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms. These devices allow for the effective removal of thrombus, restoring blood flow in the AV access.

In addition to thrombectomy, adjunctive methods can be employed to treat stenoses in the AV circuit. Cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement are commonly used to address anatomical abnormalities contributing to thrombosis. These techniques aim to restore patency in the AV access and prevent future thrombotic events.

Despite the advantages of endovascular thrombectomy, it is important to acknowledge the potential complications associated with these procedures. Vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain are among the possible complications. Therefore, careful patient selection, meticulous technique, and appropriate post-procedural monitoring are essential to minimize these risks.

To provide a comprehensive overview of current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy techniques, a narrative review was conducted. A literature search was performed using electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar. The review aimed to consolidate existing knowledge and identify any gaps in the literature, ultimately facilitating better management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

In conclusion, endovascular thrombectomy has revolutionized the treatment of thrombosed AV access in patients with ESRD. Understanding the various techniques available, as well as their potential complications, is crucial for clinicians involved in the management of these patients. This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of thrombectomy approaches for access maintenance in the end-stage renal disease population. By staying abreast of the latest advancements in this field, clinicians can optimize patient outcomes and improve the quality of care provided to individuals with thrombosed AV access.
