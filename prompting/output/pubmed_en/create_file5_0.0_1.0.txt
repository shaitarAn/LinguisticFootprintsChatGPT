Introduction

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 500 million cases worldwide. Alongside the acute phase of infection, there is growing concern about the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly referred to as long COVID. PASC is characterized by prolonged symptoms and detrimental health effects that persist for four or more weeks after the initial infection. The underlying mechanisms driving PASC are still largely unknown, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding to develop effective preventive and treatment strategies.

Immune dysregulation has been identified as a key pathogenic feature of both acute COVID-19 and PASC manifestations. However, the specific causal mechanisms responsible for immune dysfunction in PASC remain undefined. It is likely that immune dysregulation varies depending on clinical phenotypes, severity of initial infection, and specific tissues involved. Therefore, well-designed studies are necessary to elucidate the role of immune mechanisms in PASC.

To address these knowledge gaps, the National Institutes of Health-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative was launched in February 2021. This initiative involves over 100 researchers across the United States who are conducting studies on PASC using standardized protocols. The generation of a large SARS-CoV-2 recovery cohort within RECOVER aims to collect data from individuals across different age groups through electronic health records and patient-completed surveys, along with biospecimens such as blood samples and nasal swabs.

Within RECOVER, the Mechanistic Pathways Committee focuses on three priority areas: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage as potential mechanisms underlying various clinical phenotypes of PASC. This perspective article aims to provide an overview of current knowledge while raising important questions and hypotheses related to immune dysregulation in both acute COVID-19 and chronic PASC.

By reviewing the role of innate and adaptive immune systems in the pathogenesis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC, this article emphasizes the dysregulation of immune processes intertwined with viral persistence and tissue-specific pathologies. The identification of different PASC subtypes by RECOVER investigators highlights the need to address a range of immune dysregulation mechanisms. Potential hypotheses for PASC-related immune dysfunction are discussed, along with suggestions for future studies to answer these crucial questions.

While there may be distinct differences between immune mechanisms during acute COVID-19 and those involved in PASC, understanding the immunopathology of acute infection can serve as a starting point for investigating candidate pathways in PASC. Therefore, this article outlines established knowledge on acute COVID-19 immunopathology while also highlighting limited data on chronic PASC immunopathology to identify important research avenues.

In conclusion, unraveling the complex immune mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathology and post-acute sequelae is essential for developing precision therapies that restore healthy immune function in individuals with PASC. Through comprehensive analyses and large-scale longitudinal studies within initiatives like RECOVER, we can gain valuable insights into specific molecular signals and immune cell populations driving PASC pathogenesis. Ultimately, this knowledge will contribute to improved preventive measures and therapeutic interventions against both acute COVID-19 and long-term complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
