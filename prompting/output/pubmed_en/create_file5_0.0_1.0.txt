Introduction

The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 500 million confirmed cases worldwide. While the majority of individuals experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover within a few weeks, a significant proportion of patients continue to experience persistent symptoms long after the acute phase of infection has resolved. This condition, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or more commonly referred to as long COVID, has emerged as a major concern for public health.

PASC is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that can affect multiple organ systems, including the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, nervous system, and immune system. Common manifestations include fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, cognitive impairment ("brain fog"), joint pain, and mood disorders. The exact mechanisms underlying PASC are not yet fully understood but are thought to involve complex interactions between viral persistence and dysregulated immune responses.

Recent studies have highlighted the role of exaggerated immune responses in determining both the severity and outcomes of initial SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as subsequent PASC development. During acute infection, an uncontrolled inflammatory response can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction. However, it remains unclear how these immune responses evolve during the transition from acute infection to PASC.

Understanding the immunopathology underlying PASC is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies that target specific molecular signals or immune cell populations involved in disease progression. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the mechanisms driving immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 and explore emerging data on immunopathology associated with PASC.

While there may be shared mechanisms between acute COVID-19 immunopathology and PASC development during post-acute phases, it is likely that distinct processes contribute specifically to PASC pathogenesis. Thus far limited research has been conducted on this topic due to its recent emergence and the challenges associated with studying a heterogeneous condition. Therefore, large-scale longitudinal analyses are necessary to comprehensively characterize the immunopathology of PASC in patients with and without persistent symptoms following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

By identifying the knowledge gaps in PASC immunopathology, this study aims to provide a foundation for future research directions that will ultimately lead to precision therapies targeting immune dysregulation in PASC patients. Such therapies have the potential to restore healthy immune function and alleviate persistent symptoms, improving the quality of life for individuals affected by long COVID.

In conclusion, PASC represents a significant public health challenge as it affects a substantial number of individuals recovering from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The underlying mechanisms driving immune dysregulation in PASC remain poorly understood but are likely multifactorial. This study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by examining current literature on severe COVID-19 immunopathology and emerging data on PASC immunopathology. By elucidating these mechanisms, we hope to pave the way for targeted therapeutic interventions that can effectively manage long COVID symptoms and improve patient outcomes.
