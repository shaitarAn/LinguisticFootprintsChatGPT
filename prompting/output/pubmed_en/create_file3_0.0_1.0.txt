Introduction

The adenosinergic machinery has emerged as a critical regulator of immune responses, particularly in the context of tumor immunity. Extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling, which is primarily derived from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP), plays a pivotal role in modulating immune cell function within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The interplay between eATP and eADO levels influences immunosurveillance and can have profound implications for cancer progression.

While eATP acts as a pro-inflammatory molecule by binding to and activating P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y), eADO has been shown to mediate immunosuppression through its interaction with P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) on various immune cells. This dynamic balance between eATP hydrolysis to eADO not only reduces the levels of pro-inflammatory signals but also enhances adenosine receptor signaling within the TME.

Although much research has focused on understanding the role of adenosine signaling in immune cells, it is important to recognize that both tumor cells and stromal cells within the TME also contribute significantly to this complex network. The interactions between these different cell types further shape the adenosinergic system's influence on cancer progression.

In this article, we aim to provide an updated overview of our current understanding regarding the involvement of various cell types in shaping the tumor adenosinergic system. Specifically, we will explore how immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells collectively contribute to altering immunosurveillance within the TME through modulation of extracellular ATP hydrolysis into adenosine. Furthermore, we will discuss potential novel directions for therapeutic interventions targeting this intricate network in immuno-oncology.

By comprehensively examining these aspects of adenosine signaling in cancer biology, we hope to shed light on the potential for developing innovative adenosinergic therapies that can effectively modulate immune responses within the TME. Such advancements hold promise for improving cancer treatment outcomes and enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between tumor cells, immune cells, and stromal cells in the context of cancer immunology.
