1. Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis. Thrombosis of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), which are essential for providing vascular access during hemodialysis, can lead to devastating complications such as delayed or missed dialysis sessions, increased healthcare costs, and even access abandonment requiring the placement of dialysis catheters. 

While surgical interventions were traditionally employed for treating thrombosed AV access, the endovascular approach has emerged as the preferred treatment option in recent years due to its minimally invasive nature and promising outcomes. Endovascular techniques encompass both thrombolysis, which involves using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices for administering fibrinolytic agents to dissolve the clot, as well as thrombectomy, which entails mechanical removal of the thrombus using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms.

Although previous studies have highlighted the efficacy and safety of endovascular approaches in managing thrombosed AV access among patients with ESRD, there remains a need to explore specific aspects related to these techniques that may further enhance their utility while mitigating associated complications. One area that requires further investigation is identifying an optimal approach for maintaining long-term access patency following successful intervention.

Therefore, this paper aims to review current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy techniques specifically related to achieving long-term access maintenance in patients with ESRD who have experienced clotting events within their AVGs or AVFs. By systematically examining relevant literature from electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, this narrative review article seeks to provide an updated understanding of available methods while highlighting potential complications associated with these procedures.

The findings from this study will contribute valuable insights into optimizing management strategies for thrombosed AV access in the ESRD population, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. Additionally, this research will lay the foundation for future investigations by identifying gaps in knowledge and potential avenues for further exploration.
