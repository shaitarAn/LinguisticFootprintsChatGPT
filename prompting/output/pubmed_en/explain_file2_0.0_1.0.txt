The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marginalized populations in the United States. It begins by stating that as of June 2022, there have been 84.2 million infections and over 1 million deaths in the US due to COVID-19. It highlights that historically marginalized populations, including minorities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals, have borne a disproportionate burden of hospitalizations and deaths.

The introduction further emphasizes that Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations have higher infection and death rates compared to non-Latinx White groups. It mentions that younger people from these marginalized communities have approximately twice as high death rates from COVID-19 compared to White groups.

The introduction then discusses the development and effectiveness of vaccines in reducing transmission, hospitalization, and deaths from COVID-19. However, it points out that vaccination rates have been lower in Black and Latinx communities compared to the national average. This is attributed to factors such as mistrust in the healthcare system and research enterprise among these communities, language barriers, immigration issues, lack of health insurance in low-paying jobs.

The article goes on to highlight that health disparities during the pandemic are not random but are rooted in longstanding racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities caused by structural racism and discriminatory policies regarding access to education, employment housing,and healthcare. It mentions that although access to healthcare improved with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), millions remain uninsured which compromises equitable care delivery during a health crisis.

Additionally,the introduction notes how hospitals predominantly serving Black,Latinx,and Indigenous communities were overwhelmed during the pandemic,resulting in limited access to advanced treatmentsand critical care services for these populations.

To provide a framework for understanding these disparities,the article introducesthe World Health Organization (WHO) Conceptual Framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health (WHO CSDH). This framework helps evaluate both immediate circumstances impacting individuals' lives as well as the broader context that influenced COVID-19 outcomes. The article focuses on structural determinants as essential drivers of health disparities during the pandemic.

Finally, the introduction mentions that minorities living in hotspot counties have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 since the early phases of the pandemic. It provides examples from California and various cities across the US where cases were higher in less-advantaged neighborhoods compared to more advantaged ones.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for discussing the challenges faced by marginalized and underserved populations during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights how structural and social determinants of health contribute to racial and ethnic disparities.
