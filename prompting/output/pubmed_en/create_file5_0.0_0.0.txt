Introduction

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 500 million cases worldwide. Alongside the acute phase of infection, there is growing recognition of a condition known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or long COVID, which is characterized by persistent symptoms and detrimental health effects that extend beyond the initial infection. The underlying mechanisms driving PASC are still largely unknown, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of the immune dysregulation involved in this condition.

Immune dysregulation has been identified as a key pathogenic feature of acute COVID-19, and it is also believed to play a role in the development of systemic and tissue-specific manifestations of PASC. However, the specific causal mechanisms of immune dysfunction in PASC remain to be defined. It is likely that the mechanisms of immune dysregulation vary depending on the clinical phenotype of PASC, the severity of the initial COVID-19 infection, and the specific tissues involved. Therefore, well-designed studies are necessary to elucidate the role of immune mechanisms in PASC.

To address these knowledge gaps, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative was launched in February 2021. This initiative involves a collaboration of over 100 researchers across the United States, conducting studies on PASC using standardized protocols. The generation of a large SARS-CoV-2 recovery cohort, comprising individuals of all ages, will provide valuable data through electronic health records, patient-completed surveys, and biospecimen collection. The ultimate goal of the RECOVER Initiative is to develop preventive and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and PASC, considering their significant public health impact.

Within the RECOVER consortium, the Mechanistic Pathways Committee focuses on three priority areas: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage. This perspective article, alongside companion papers on viral persistence and PASC tissue damage, aims to provide an overview of current knowledge and raise important questions and hypotheses in these areas. By identifying gaps in understanding the mechanisms of disease severity and sequelae of COVID-19, this article aims to stimulate new thoughts and ideas that will guide future research efforts.

In this article, a multidisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in adult and pediatric medicine review the role of the innate and adaptive immune systems in the pathogenesis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC. Emphasizing the dysregulation of immune processes intertwined with viral persistence and tissue-specific pathologies, the focus on immune mechanisms aims to address the diverse range of PASC subtypes recently defined by RECOVER investigators. The article discusses potential hypotheses for PASC-related immune dysregulation and suggests studies that can help answer these vital questions. While there are likely differences between immune mechanisms during acute COVID-19 and those involved in PASC, the acute immunopathology of COVID-19 serves as a starting point for examining candidate pathways involved in the immunopathology of PASC. Therefore, this article outlines the established knowledge on acute COVID-19 and the limited data on the immunopathology of chronic PASC, highlighting important new avenues for research on PASC immunopathology.

The severe acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is believed to be driven by an exaggerated and dysregulated innate immune response, coupled with poor adaptive immune responses. The initial infection triggers a type I interferon response, which can effectively suppress the infection in most individuals. However, delayed or impaired type I responses, as well as autoimmune neutralizing responses, have been associated with severe disease. During acute infection, viral RNA and dsRNA replication intermediates are recognized by pattern recognition receptors, leading to the activation of various immune responses. The virus, in turn, antagonizes these responses through the activity of virally encoded genes. Severe disease is characterized by dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and elevated chemokines. The extent to which elevated cytokines are characteristic of PASC is still unclear. Additionally, the presence of viral RNA in plasma has been identified as an early factor in severe disease.

In conclusion, understanding the immune mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathology and PASC is crucial for the development of preventive and treatment strategies. By addressing the knowledge gaps in PASC immunopathology, this article aims to guide future research efforts and pave the way for precision therapies that restore healthy immune function in PASC patients.
