Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a major health concern in older adults. It is associated with increased risk of falls, frailty, and decreased quality of life. Diet plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle health and function, and specific nutrients such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been implicated in the development and progression of sarcopenia.

The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The study utilized baseline data from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial, which is a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial examining the effects of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

A total of 29 participants were included in the analysis, with an average age of 76.3 years. The results showed that the participants' intake of omega-3 PUFAs was below the recommended daily intake for both males and females. There was no correlation between dietary PUFA intake and nutritional status. However, certain PUFA statuses were found to be associated with sarcopenia-defining parameters.

Specifically, higher levels of Î±-linolenic acid status were inversely associated with appendicular lean mass (aLM), indicating that lower levels may be related to greater muscle loss. On the other hand, higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid status were positively associated with aLM, suggesting that higher levels may be protective against muscle loss.

Interestingly, some markers of omega-3 PUFA intake and status were positively correlated with physical activity levels as measured by step count. This suggests that adequate consumption or presence of certain PUFAs may promote greater engagement in physical activity among individuals with sarcopenia.

Additionally, higher PUFA intake and status were associated with better scores on quality of life measures, as assessed by the SF-36 and SarQoL questionnaires. This indicates that PUFAs may have a positive impact on overall well-being in sarcopenic older adults.

However, it is important to note that this study was exploratory in nature and had a small sample size. Therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution and further research is needed to confirm these associations. Additionally, the study only examined PUFAs, and other nutrients may also play a role in sarcopenia outcomes.

In conclusion, this exploratory study provides initial insights into the potential relationships between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The findings suggest that specific PUFAs may be associated with muscle mass, physical activity levels, and quality of life. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms behind these associations.
