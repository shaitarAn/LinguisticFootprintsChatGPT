1. Introduction

Sarcopenia, characterized by age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and physical performance, poses a significant health challenge for older adults (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). It has been well-established that dietary intake plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle health and preventing the progression of sarcopenia (Beaudart et al., 2014). Among various dietary components, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential role in modulating muscle function and preserving muscle mass (Gray et al., 2020).

While previous studies have explored the association between overall dietary intake and sarcopenia outcomes, limited research has investigated the specific role of PUFAs in the context of sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia.

Understanding the potential correlation between dietary intake and nutritional status of PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes is of paramount importance for developing effective interventions to prevent or delay the progression of sarcopenia in this population. By identifying specific PUFAs that may be associated with improved muscle strength, mass, physical performance, physical activity, and quality of life, clinicians and researchers can tailor nutritional interventions to optimize muscle health and functional outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia.

To address this research gap, the current study will leverage the baseline data from the ongoing Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial. ENHANce is a comprehensive randomized controlled trial that investigates the combined effect of anabolic interventions, including protein supplementation, omega-3 supplementation, and exercise, on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults (> 65 years). The secondary, exploratory, cross-sectional analysis of the baseline data will allow us to delve deeper into the association between PUFAs intake, nutritional status, and sarcopenia-defining parameters, physical activity, and quality of life in this population.

By elucidating the potential correlations between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes, this study seeks to provide valuable insights into the dietary management of sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, the findings from this study may contribute to the development of targeted nutritional interventions aimed at improving muscle health and functional outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia, thereby enhancing their overall quality of life.

In conclusion, this paper presents an introduction to an imaginary research question that explores the correlation between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults. By investigating this research question, we aim to contribute to the existing literature on dietary management strategies for sarcopenia and provide evidence-based recommendations for optimizing muscle health and functional outcomes in older adults.
