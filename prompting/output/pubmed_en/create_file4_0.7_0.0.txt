Introduction

Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, is a major concern in aging populations worldwide. It is associated with increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality in older adults (1, 2). Therefore, there is a growing interest in identifying modifiable factors that can help prevent or mitigate sarcopenia in this vulnerable population.

One potential modifiable factor that has received increasing attention is the role of dietary intake and nutritional status of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in sarcopenia outcomes. PUFAs are a class of essential fatty acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through the diet. They are known to play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including inflammation, immune function, and cell membrane integrity (3).

Emerging evidence suggests that PUFAs, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, may have beneficial effects on muscle health and function. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties and can modulate muscle protein synthesis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function (4, 5). These mechanisms may contribute to the preservation of muscle mass and function, thus potentially preventing or delaying the onset of sarcopenia.

However, the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia remains poorly understood. Previous studies have primarily focused on the general population or specific patient groups, such as those with chronic diseases or institutionalized individuals (6, 7). Therefore, there is a need for further investigation specifically targeting community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia to better understand the potential impact of PUFAs on muscle health in this population.

The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between dietary PUFAs intake, nutritional PUFAs status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. We will utilize data from the ongoing Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial, a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial aiming to assess the effect of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

By examining the dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs in relation to sarcopenia-defining parameters, such as muscle strength, mass, and physical performance, we can gain insights into their potential role in the pathogenesis and progression of sarcopenia. Additionally, we will explore the association between PUFAs and other relevant factors, including physical activity levels and quality of life, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of PUFAs on overall muscle health in this population.

The findings from this study will have important implications for the development of targeted interventions aimed at preventing or managing sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. If specific PUFAs are found to be associated with improved sarcopenia outcomes, dietary recommendations and interventions could be tailored to optimize their intake and status, potentially leading to better muscle health and functional outcomes in this population.

In conclusion, investigating the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults is crucial for understanding the potential role of PUFAs in the prevention and management of sarcopenia. The present study aims to address this research gap by utilizing data from the ENHANce trial. The findings will contribute to the growing body of evidence on the importance of PUFAs in muscle health and inform future interventions and guidelines for sarcopenia management.
