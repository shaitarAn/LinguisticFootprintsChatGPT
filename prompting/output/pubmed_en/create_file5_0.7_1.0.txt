Introduction

The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 500 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date. While the majority of individuals experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover within a few weeks, there is growing concern about the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID. PASC refers to a range of persistent symptoms that continue for weeks or months after the acute phase of COVID-19 has resolved.

Recent studies have highlighted the role of immune dysregulation in both the severity and outcomes of initial SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as in PASC development. Exaggerated immune responses, characterized by an excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and dysregulated immune cell activation, have been implicated in driving tissue damage and contributing to disease pathogenesis during acute COVID-19. However, our understanding of the underlying immunopathological mechanisms driving PASC remains limited.

This paper aims to explore an alternative research question concerning immune dysregulation in PASC. Specifically, we seek to investigate whether specific molecular signals or distinct immune cell populations are involved in promoting PASC pathogenesis. By elucidating these mechanisms, we hope to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for restoring healthy immune function and alleviating persistent symptoms experienced by patients with long COVID.

The innate and adaptive immune systems play critical roles in orchestrating antiviral defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upon viral entry into host cells, pattern recognition receptors recognize viral components and initiate downstream signaling cascades that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), and interferons (IFNs). These cytokines recruit immune cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and T lymphocytes to the site of infection, where they collaborate to eliminate the virus.

In severe cases of COVID-19, however, this immune response becomes dysregulated. Excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, often referred to as a cytokine storm, can lead to tissue damage and multiorgan dysfunction. Moreover, dysfunctional adaptive immune responses characterized by impaired T cell function and dysregulated B cell activation have been observed in severe COVID-19 patients. These immunopathological features have been associated with worse clinical outcomes including respiratory failure and death.

While some similarities may exist between the immunopathology observed during acute COVID-19 and that which underlies PASC development, it is likely that PASC represents a distinct and heterogeneous entity with unique immunological characteristics. Longitudinal studies involving comprehensive assessments of both innate and adaptive immune responses are necessary to better understand the pathogenesis of PASC.

This review aims to examine current literature on mechanisms driving immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 as well as emerging data on the immunopathology of PASC. We will critically analyze existing knowledge gaps in our understanding of PASC immunopathology and propose future research directions aimed at elucidating specific molecular signals or immune cell populations involved in promoting persistent symptoms after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

By addressing these knowledge gaps through innovative research approaches such as large-scale longitudinal analyses involving patients with and without PASC, we hope to pave the way for precision therapies targeting immune dysregulation in long COVID. Ultimately, our findings may contribute towards personalized treatment strategies that restore healthy immune function in individuals experiencing persistent symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
