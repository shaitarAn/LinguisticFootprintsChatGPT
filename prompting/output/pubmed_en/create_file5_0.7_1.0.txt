Introduction:

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 500 million reported cases worldwide. While the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection is well-documented, there is a growing concern regarding the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly referred to as long COVID. PASC refers to a diverse range of persistent symptoms and health issues experienced by individuals even after recovery from the initial infection.

Recent studies have suggested that exaggerated immune responses play a critical role in determining the severity and outcomes of both initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent PASC. The intricate interplay between innate and adaptive immune responses during the acute phase, as well as their dysregulation during the post-acute period, necessitates an in-depth mechanistic understanding to identify specific molecular signals and immune cell populations involved in promoting PASC pathogenesis.

While mechanisms underlying immunopathology during severe COVID-19 have been extensively investigated, limited emerging data exists regarding the immunopathology specifically associated with PASC. Although there may be some overlap in immunopathological mechanisms between the acute and post-acute phases, it is plausible that PASC exhibits distinct heterogeneity requiring large-scale longitudinal analyses among patients with and without PASC following an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This paper aims to review current literature on immune dysregulation mechanisms observed in severe COVID-19 cases while also addressing knowledge gaps related to immunopathology specific to PASC. By exploring these key areas, we hope to highlight avenues for novel research directions that will ultimately facilitate the development of precision therapies aimed at restoring healthy immune function among individuals experiencing long-term effects after recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Overall, understanding immune mechanisms underlying both COVID-19 pathology and post-infection sequelae such as PASC is crucial for devising effective therapeutic strategies and improving the long-term outcomes of individuals affected by this global pandemic.
