Title: Thrombectomy approach for access maintenance in the end stage renal disease population: a narrative review.

Abstract: This article provides a review of current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), which are used for hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The endovascular approach has become the preferred treatment option for thrombosed access, as it involves the removal of thrombus from the AV circuit and treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities. Various techniques such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy are used, along with adjunctive methods like cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon angioplasty, and stent placement. Complications of these procedures are also discussed.

Introduction: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide, leading to a greater burden of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hemodialysis is the most common renal replacement modality for ESRD patients, and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) are preferred access options due to lower risks and better outcomes compared to central venous catheters. However, maintaining the patency of these accesses requires frequent interventions, impacting healthcare resources and patient quality of life. Thrombosis is the leading cause of access loss in AVFs and AVGs, and various factors contribute to the risk of thrombosis. Thrombosed access leads to treatment delays, inpatient admissions, and the need for dialysis catheter placement. Current pharmacological therapies have limited effectiveness in preventing access thrombosis, making timely treatment crucial. Surgical thrombectomy used to be the standard treatment but has been replaced by endovascular thrombectomy, which offers higher success rates and the ability to treat underlying anatomical abnormalities. This article aims to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for thrombosed AVGs and AVFs.
