The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the use of hemodialysis as a common treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It highlights the importance of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) as preferred access options for chronic hemodialysis due to lower hospitalization risk and mortality compared to central venous catheters. However, it also discusses the challenges associated with maintaining access patency, including thrombosis as the leading cause of access loss. The introduction mentions various factors that contribute to access thrombosis, such as underlying stenoses and systemic risk factors. It emphasizes that currently no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies exist to prevent access thrombosis.

The consequences of thrombosed access are discussed, including delays in dialysis treatment, treatment omissions, hospital admissions, and the need for catheter placement. The composition of thrombus in AV accesses is explained along with uncertainties around the long-term effects of anti-platelet therapy and warfarin on access patency. Timely intervention is highlighted as crucial for successful thrombectomy procedures.

The introduction further mentions how endovascular techniques have replaced surgical thrombectomy over time due to advancements in intravascular procedures. This shift has resulted in increased procedure success rates for removing thrombus from AVFs and AVGs. Lastly, it states that this article aims to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications related to endovascular thrombectomy techniques for treating thrombosed AVGs and AVFs based on a literature search from electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar.

Overall, the introduction provides context about CKD prevalence and its impact on healthcare systems globally. It explains why AVF/AVG accesses are preferred over central venous catheters but highlights challenges like maintaining patency due to frequent interventions needed. Additionally, it introduces how thrombosis is a significant problem with various causes and discusses the evolution of endovascular techniques as a standard of care for treating thrombosed accesses.
