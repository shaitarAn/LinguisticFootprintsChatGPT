The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on the rise worldwide, contributing to the overall burden of disease. When CKD progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hemodialysis is a common treatment method. Hemodialysis involves using a renal replacement therapy to filter waste products and remove excess fluids from the blood. Patients with ESRD typically require a vascular access for hemodialysis, and two main options are arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or graft (AVG). Compared to central venous catheters, AVFs and AVGs have been shown to have lower risks of hospitalization and mortality.

Patients who rely on catheters for vascular access experience poorer outcomes, such as an increased risk of sepsis and bacteremia. However, while AVFs and AVGs are preferred due to their better outcomes, they come with their own challenges. Long-term use of these vascular accesses often necessitates frequent interventions to maintain their patency (openness). Not only does this place a significant burden on healthcare resources, but it also affects patients' quality of life and has implications for morbidity and mortality.

Thrombosis refers to the formation of blood clots in the AVF or AVG, leading to blocked blood flow and subsequent loss of access functionality. Thrombosis is responsible for 65-85% of cases where access fails. The thrombosis rate for AVFs is reported at approximately 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days, whereas AVG thrombosis occurs at a rate of around 0.2 events per patient during two years follow-up.

Several factors increase the risk of access thrombosis; these include underlying venous or arterial stenoses at the point where vessels connect in an anastomosis formation within the access site itself.Systemic factors like hypercoagulability (increased propensity towards clotting), low ejection fraction (the amount of blood pumped out of the heart), hypotension (low blood pressure), and hemoconcentration (high concentration of components in the blood) also contribute to thrombosis risk. Additionally, complications arising from cannulation procedures, such as hematomas, can lead to access thrombosis.

Thrombosed access not only causes delays and omissions in hemodialysis treatment but can also result in hospitalizations and eventually necessitate the placement of a dialysis catheter. Thrombus within an AV access typically consists of two components: a soft, easily disintegrating clot that forms within the venous outflow, and a firm fibrin plug located near the anastomosis site.

Currently available pharmacological therapies have not been approved by the FDA for preventing access thrombosis. The long-term effects of anti-platelet therapy (which inhibits platelets' ability to form clots) and warfarin (an anticoagulant) on access patency remain uncertain. Prompt treatment for thrombosed accesses is crucial to avoid delays in dialysis treatment or the need for catheter placement.

The success rate for removing fresh thrombus from an AVF decreases as time passes because it hardens into adherent thrombus within the native vein. Therefore, it is recommended that thrombectomy be performed earlier for AVFs compared to AVGs - ideally within days of identifying the clot location - although successful removal can still be achieved up to a week after formation in AVGs.

Intravascular techniques have replaced surgical thrombectomy as the standard approach for treating thrombosed accesses due to their lower resource requirements and hospitalization rates. This minimally invasive endovascular method involves using imaging guidance during procedures; not only can clots be removed with precision but any underlying anatomical abnormalities like stenoses can also be addressed simultaneously.Clinical studies have reported success rates ranging from 70-90% for endovascular thrombectomy techniques in restoring functionality to thrombosed AVFs or AVGs. In the past two decades, there has been a significant increase in the utilization of endovascular access thrombectomy procedures, with twice as many AVF cases and triple as many AVG cases being treated.

This article aims to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The authors conducted a literature search using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar to gather relevant information. The article follows the Narrative Review reporting checklist provided by AME Medical Journal.

Overall, this article provides an overview of the increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease worldwide and its impact on patients requiring hemodialysis. It underscores why AVFs and AVGs are favored over catheters but acknowledges that these vascular accesses come with their own set of challenges related to frequent interventions to maintain patency. The primary focus is on access thrombosis as a major issue affecting dialysis patients, exploring various risk factors contributing to its occurrence while highlighting newer minimally invasive treatment options like endovascular thrombectomy techniques.
