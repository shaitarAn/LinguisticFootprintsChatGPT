This PubMed article explores the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, which can significantly impact the daily life of older adults.

The study, called ENHANce, is an ongoing randomized controlled trial that aims to assess the effect of combined interventions (protein, omega-3 supplement, and exercise) on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults. In this secondary analysis using baseline data, the researchers examined dietary PUFA intake using 4-day food records and assessed PUFA status through red blood cell membrane fatty acids profiles.

The results showed that participants had a total omega-3 intake below recommended levels. The intake and status of PUFAs were not correlated with each other. However, certain specific PUFAs showed associations with sarcopenia-defined parameters such as muscle strength and mass. For example, Î±-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with appendicular lean mass (aLM), while docosahexaenoic acid status was positively associated with aLM.

Additionally, some omega-3 PUFA markers were positively associated with physical activity levels and quality of life scores. On the other hand, gamma-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with SF-36 physical component summary score.

Although the intake of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs was low in this exploratory study population, these findings suggest potential correlations between PUFA intake/status and sarcopenia outcomes among older adults with sarcopenia.

The introduction section provides background information on sarcopenia as an age-related health concern affecting older individuals' muscle mass and function. Malnutrition and low protein intake contribute to its onset or progression. While protein intake is commonly considered in treatment strategies for sarcopenia, the role of PUFAs, particularly omega-3 PUFAs, in muscle physiology and sarcopenia progression is also suggested. Omega-3 PUFAs are believed to have beneficial effects on muscle health compared to omega-6 PUFAs with pro-inflammatory properties. Therefore, increasing omega-3 PUFA intake could be a potential treatment approach for sarcopenia.

The study aimed to assess both dietary PUFA intake using food records and the objective biomarker of PUFA status through red blood cell membrane fatty acids composition in well-defined sarcopenic older adults according to specific criteria. The researchers hypothesized that omega-3 PUFA intake would be low in this population and would correlate with its status. Furthermore, they expected higher omega-3 intake to be associated with improved muscle strength and mass, as well as better quality of life and increased physical activity.

The results from this study provide insight into the relationship between PUFA intake/status and sarcopenia outcomes among older adults with sarcopenia.
