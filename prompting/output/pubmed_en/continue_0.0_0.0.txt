Thrombectomy techniques have become the preferred approach for maintaining access in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who require hemodialysis. This article aims to review the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs).

Arteriovenous (AV) access is crucial for patients with ESRD to receive hemodialysis. However, thrombosis of AV access can lead to delays in hemodialysis or even the abandonment of access, necessitating the placement of a dialysis catheter. In recent years, the endovascular approach has emerged as the preferred treatment option for thrombosed access, surpassing surgical interventions.

Endovascular interventions for thrombosed AV access involve the removal of thrombus from the AV circuit and the treatment of any underlying anatomical abnormalities, such as anastomotic stenosis. Thrombolysis, the process of dissolving thrombus, is typically performed using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices to administer fibrinolytic agents. On the other hand, thrombectomy, the mechanical removal of thrombus, is achieved using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms.

In addition to these techniques, adjunctive methods like cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement are also employed to treat stenoses in the AV circuit. These approaches aim to restore blood flow and maintain the patency of the access.

However, it is important to note that these procedures are not without risks. Complications can arise, including vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the thrombectomy techniques and their potential complications is essential for the effective management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

To gather information for this narrative review, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. The findings from various studies and articles were analyzed to provide an overview of the current practices and outcomes of thrombectomy techniques in the end-stage renal disease population.

In conclusion, endovascular thrombectomy techniques have become the preferred approach for maintaining access in patients with thrombosed AV grafts and fistulas. These techniques, along with adjunctive methods, offer effective treatment options for restoring blood flow and preserving the patency of AV access. However, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to be aware of the potential complications associated with these procedures to ensure safe and successful management of patients with thrombosed AV access.
