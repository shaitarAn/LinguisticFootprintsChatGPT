The success of hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) relies heavily on the patency of their arteriovenous (AV) access. Thrombosis, or the formation of blood clots, in AV grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) can greatly impact the functionality of these accesses, leading to delayed or abandoned hemodialysis sessions. As such, effective techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AV access are of great importance.

In recent years, the endovascular approach has emerged as the preferred method for managing thrombosed AV access over surgical intervention. This approach involves the use of various techniques to remove the thrombus from the AV circuit and address any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to the thrombosis.

Thrombolysis, the process of dissolving the thrombus, is typically achieved through the use of infusion catheters or pulse injector devices that deliver fibrinolytic agents directly into the clot. This method has shown promise in restoring patency to thrombosed accesses.

Another method, known as thrombectomy, involves mechanical removal of the thrombus. This can be achieved using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms. These tools are carefully maneuvered within the AV circuit to physically break up and remove the clot.

In addition to thrombolysis and thrombectomy, adjunctive techniques such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement are frequently employed to treat any stenoses or narrowing in the AV circuit that may be contributing to clot formation.

While these techniques have revolutionized the management of thrombosed AV access, they are not without risks. Potential complications include vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain. It is crucial for healthcare providers to be aware of these complications and take appropriate measures to mitigate them.

To compile this narrative review, a thorough literature search was conducted using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. The aim was to gather current information on thrombectomy techniques and outcomes to provide healthcare professionals with a comprehensive understanding of the field.

In conclusion, the endovascular management of thrombosed AV access has become the preferred approach in patients with ESRD. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy techniques, as well as adjunctive measures, have significantly improved access maintenance and the success of hemodialysis. However, it is important to remain vigilant about the potential complications associated with these procedures to ensure the safety and well-being of patients with thrombosed AV access.
