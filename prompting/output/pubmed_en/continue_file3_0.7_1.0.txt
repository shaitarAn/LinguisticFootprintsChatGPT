The immune system plays a crucial role in recognizing and eliminating cancer cells. However, tumors have developed various strategies to evade immune detection and destruction. One such strategy involves the adenosinergic machinery, which utilizes extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling to suppress immune responses.

Extracellular adenosine is mainly produced from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP). eATP is released into the extracellular space following cell death or cellular stress triggered by conditions such as hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation. In normal physiological conditions, eATP acts as a danger signal, binding and activating P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y) on immune cells to induce pro-inflammatory responses. However, in the tumor microenvironment (TME), excessive accumulation of eATP can have detrimental effects on anti-tumor immunity.

The conversion of eATP to eADO through the action of ectonucleotidases alters the immunosurveillance in TME by reducing eATP levels and enhancing adenosine receptor signaling. Adenosine binds to four subtypes of P1 purinergic receptors - A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 - present on various immune cells including T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells etc., leading to immunosuppression.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in targeting the adenosinergic machinery for cancer therapy. Various approaches are being explored to disrupt this immunosuppressive pathway and enhance anti-tumor immunity. One approach involves blockade or inhibition of adenosine receptors using selective antagonists or antibodies. This prevents binding of adenosine molecules to their respective receptors and restores immune cell function within TME.

Another approach focuses on inhibiting ectonucleotidases responsible for converting ATP into adenosine. By reducing the production of eADO, the immunosuppressive effects can be attenuated, allowing for enhanced anti-tumor immune responses. Several inhibitors targeting ectonucleotidases have shown promising results in preclinical studies and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.

Furthermore, strategies to increase the availability of ATP in TME are also being explored. This can be achieved by using compounds that enhance ATP release from tumor cells or by promoting ATP synthesis within the tumor microenvironment. Increased levels of eATP would stimulate pro-inflammatory responses through P2 purinergic receptors and counteract the immunosuppressive effects mediated by adenosine.

In addition to immune cells, adenosine signaling also impacts tumor cells and stromal cells within TME. Activation of adenosine receptors on tumor cells has been shown to promote cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Targeting these receptors on tumor cells may offer an additional therapeutic approach for cancer treatment.

The role of stromal cells such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells in modulating the adenosinergic machinery is another area of active investigation. These non-immune cell types contribute to shaping TME and their interaction with immune cells through paracrine signaling involving eATP and eADO is important for maintaining a suppressive microenvironment. Understanding these interactions could provide new targets for therapies aimed at disrupting immunosuppression within TME.

In conclusion, targeting the adenosinergic machinery holds great potential for improving cancer therapy by enhancing anti-tumor immunity. The complex interplay between extracellular ATP and adenosine signaling pathways within TME involves multiple cell types including immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells. Future research should focus on gaining a deeper understanding of these interactions to develop effective therapeutic strategies that can overcome immunosuppression mediated by eADO signaling in cancer.
