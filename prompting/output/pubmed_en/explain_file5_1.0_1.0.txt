This article discusses the immune mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathology and post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, also known as long COVID or PASC (post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection). The authors highlight the importance of understanding immune dysregulation in both acute COVID-19 and long COVID to develop appropriate preventive and treatment strategies.

The authors start by mentioning that exaggerated immune responses play a significant role in determining the severity and outcomes of initial SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as subsequent long COVID. They emphasize that in-depth mechanistic analyses are needed to identify specific molecular signals and immune cell populations involved in promoting PASC pathogenesis.

The introduction section provides an overview of PASC, which refers to ongoing, relapsing, or new symptoms that occur after 4 or more weeks following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The causes behind why some individuals develop long COVID are still largely unknown. Immune dysregulation has been established as a key pathogenic feature of acute COVID-19, but the causal mechanisms contributing to immune dysfunction in PASC need further investigation. Different clinical phenotypes of PASC may exhibit different causes for immune dysregulation depending on factors such as the severity of the initial infection and specific tissues involved.

The article mentions the NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which involves over 100 researchers conducting studies on PASC using consistent protocols across different research sites. The goal is to collect data from individuals across different age groups using electronic health records, surveys, and biospecimens for further analysis. This initiative aims to develop preventive and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and its long-term effects.

The Mechanistic Pathways Committee within RECOVER focuses specifically on three priority areas: immunopathology (immune system-related pathological processes), viral persistence (how virus persists in infected individuals), and tissue damage. This perspective article, along with companion papers on viral persistence and PASC tissue damage, aims to provide an overview of current knowledge and identify gaps in understanding the mechanisms of disease severity and sequelae of COVID-19. The authors emphasize the importance of generating new thoughts, ideas, and research directions to address these knowledge gaps.

The article concludes by outlining that multiple researchers with expertise in adult and pediatric medicine came together to review the role of innate and adaptive immune systems in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC. They highlight that dysregulation of immune processes is intertwined with viral persistence and tissue-specific pathologies seen in PASC. The article outlines established knowledge on acute COVID-19 immunopathology but acknowledges limited data on immunopathology specifically related to chronic PASC.

Overall, this article emphasizes the need for more research on immune dysregulation underlying both acute COVID-19 pathology and long COVID/PASC. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers hope to develop precision therapies that can restore healthy immune function in individuals experiencing long-term effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
