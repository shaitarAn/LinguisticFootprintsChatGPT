Introduction:

The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in an unprecedented number of infections, reaching over 500 million cases worldwide. As the number of individuals recovering from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to rise, there is increasing concern regarding the long-term consequences known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly referred to as "long COVID". PASC is characterized by a range of persistent symptoms and organ dysfunction that can significantly impact the quality of life for affected individuals.

Recent studies have highlighted that immune dysregulation plays a critical role in both the severity and outcomes of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent pathogenesis of PASC. Exaggerated immune responses, including dysregulated cytokine production and immune cell dysfunction, have been implicated in driving tissue damage observed during acute infection. However, our understanding of the complex interplay between host immune response and disease progression remains incomplete.

While some parallels may exist between immunopathological mechanisms observed during acute COVID-19 and those underlying PASC, it is increasingly clear that distinct mechanisms may contribute to the heterogeneity observed in PASC patients. Consequently, there is an urgent need for comprehensive mechanistic analyses focusing on understanding specific molecular signals and immune cell populations involved in PASC pathogenesis.

This paper aims to review current literature on the immunopathology underlying severe COVID-19 disease as well as limited emerging data related specifically to PASC. By highlighting knowledge gaps in our understanding of PASC immunopathology, we aim to underscore the importance of further research efforts aimed at characterizing immunological signatures associated with post-acute complications following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Furthermore, this study will emphasize the necessity for large-scale longitudinal analyses incorporating patients with both acute infection and subsequent development or absence of PASC symptoms. It is through these innovative research directions that we can ultimately uncover precise therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring healthy immune function in individuals suffering from PASC.

In summary, this paper seeks to address a significant knowledge gap by comprehensively examining the current understanding of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 disease and exploring the limited available data on immunopathology associated with PASC. The exploration of novel research avenues will undoubtedly offer essential insights for developing targeted therapies and improving the long-term prognosis for individuals experiencing post-acute sequelae following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
