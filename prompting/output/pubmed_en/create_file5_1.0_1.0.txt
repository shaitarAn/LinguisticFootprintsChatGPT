Introduction:

The ongoing global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections has resulted in a staggering number of cases, with over 500 million reported to date. With the increasing recognition of the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID, there is a growing concern regarding the extended effects and complications experienced by individuals even after recovering from the acute phase of infection.

Recent studies have highlighted that immune responses play a crucial role in determining the severity and outcomes not only during the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection but also in subsequent PASC. It is becoming increasingly evident that an exaggerated immune response contributes to the pathogenesis and persistence of both acute COVID-19 and PASC. However, understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in these conditions requires comprehensive analysis to identify specific molecular signals and immune cell populations involved in promoting PASC.

This review aims to examine current literature on immunopathology mechanisms associated with severe COVID-19 as well as emerging data on PASC. While it is possible that some parallel mechanisms may exist between acute and post-acute phases, it is likely that PASC immunopathology exhibits distinctive heterogeneity. Therefore, large-scale longitudinal studies involving patients with and without PASC after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are necessary to gain a deeper understanding.

By highlighting knowledge gaps in our understanding of PASC immunopathology, this article aims to provide insight into potential novel research directions. The ultimate goal is to develop precision therapies that restore healthy immune function among individuals experiencing post-COVID symptoms. 

To facilitate such advancements, initiatives like the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative have been launched globally under National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding support. RECOVER involves collaboration from over 100 researchers across various institutions within the United States who are conducting studies specifically focused on PASC. By collecting vast amounts of data through electronic health records, patient surveys, and biospecimen samples, the initiative aims to develop preventative and therapeutic treatments to address the public health impact of COVID-19 and its prolonged effects.

Within RECOVER, the Mechanistic Pathways Committee is prioritizing three key areas - immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage - as potential mechanisms underlying different clinical PASC phenotypes. This article serves as a perspective review alongside companion papers focusing on viral persistence and PASC tissue damage. It aims to provide an overview of our current understanding while identifying critical questions that need to be addressed through extensive research efforts.

Collaborating researchers with diverse expertise in adult and pediatric medicine have joined forces to delve into the role of both innate and adaptive immune systems in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as PASC pathogenesis. Specifically emphasizing immune dysregulation intertwined with viral persistence and tissue-specific pathologies discussed in companion reviews, this article acknowledges distinct subtypes of PASC recently identified by RECOVER investigators. Potential hypotheses for immune dysregulation associated with PASC are explored along with suggested studies that can help answer these crucial questions.

While there may be notable differences between acute COVID-19 immunopathology and that observed in PASC patients, it is reasonable to utilize knowledge from acute infection as a foundation for investigating candidate pathways involved in PASC immunopathology. Therefore, this article outlines established knowledge regarding acute COVID-19 immunopathology while also highlighting limited data available on chronic PASC. This comprehensive review will shed light on key research avenues needed to enhance our understanding of immunopathological mechanisms driving post-COVID symptoms.

One pivotal feature observed during severe COVID-19 is an exaggerated innate immune response coupled with poor adaptive immune responses. The early sensing of SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers a robust type I interferon response; however, delayed or impaired responses have been associated with severe disease. Viral replication intermediates and viral RNA are recognized by pattern recognition receptors, including TLR3, TLR7, RIG-I, and MDA5. The virus itself employs various strategies to antagonize these responses through the activity of virally encoded genes. Dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) along with elevated chemokines further contributes to the severity of COVID-19.

The extent to which elevated cytokines are characteristic of PASC remains unclear; however, prolonged hospitalizations associated with elevated cytokine levels have been observed in severe cases. Early identification of viral RNA in plasma has also been considered as a predictive factor for disease progression.

In conclusion, understanding the immune mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathology and post-acute sequelae is crucial for developing effective preventive and treatment strategies. Collaborative efforts within initiatives like RECOVER are paving the way for extensive research on PASC immunopathology. By addressing knowledge gaps and exploring potential hypotheses, this article aims to guide future studies that will ultimately lead to precision
