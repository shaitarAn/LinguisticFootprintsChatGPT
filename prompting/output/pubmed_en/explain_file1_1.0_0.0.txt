Introduction: 

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health issue that contributes to the overall burden of disease. Hemodialysis is the primary treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts (AVGs) being the preferred vascular accesses compared to central venous catheters. These accesses have lower risks of hospitalization and mortality. Patients reliant on catheters face poorer outcomes, including a higher risk of sepsis and bacteremia. However, AVFs and AVGs require frequent interventions to maintain access patency, which imposes a significant burden on healthcare resources and affects patients' quality of life, with implications for morbidity and mortality.

One of the primary complications of AVF and AVG is access thrombosis, which accounts for the majority of cases of access loss. Thrombosis can occur as a result of venous or arterial anastomotic stenosis and is influenced by various systemic factors such as hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications leading to hematomas. Thrombosed accesses result in delays and omissions in hemodialysis treatment, unplanned hospital admissions, and may necessitate the use of temporary dialysis catheters. The thrombus formed in AV accesses consists of two components: a soft, friable clot that easily disintegrates in the venous outflow, and a firm fibrin plug near the anastomosis. Despite extensive research, no pharmacological therapies have been approved by the FDA to prevent access thrombosis, and the long-term effects of anti-platelet therapy and warfarin on access patency remain uncertain.

Timely intervention is crucial in the management of thrombosed accesses to prevent treatment delays and the need for catheter placement. Thrombectomy, the removal of the thrombus, is most successful when performed early in AVFs, ideally within days, whereas thrombectomy in AVGs can still be successful up to a week after thrombus formation. Traditionally, thrombosed AV accesses were managed through surgical thrombectomy, requiring hospitalization and the use of operating room resources. However, with advancements in intravascular techniques, endovascular thrombectomy has become the standard of care. This minimally invasive approach allows for the removal of the thrombus under imaging guidance, while also addressing any underlying anatomical abnormalities, such as stenoses.

Prior studies have reported success rates ranging from 70-90% for endovascular thrombectomy in thrombosed AVFs and AVGs. Over the past two decades, the number of endovascular access thrombectomy procedures has significantly increased, doubling for AVFs and tripling for AVGs. This article aims to provide an overview of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The authors conducted a literature search using electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, to gather relevant information for this review.

In summary, the increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease and the preferred use of AVFs and AVGs in hemodialysis treatment have led to a rise in access thrombosis cases. Thrombosed accesses negatively impact patient care, requiring prompt intervention to avoid treatment delays and the placement of dialysis catheters. Endovascular thrombectomy has emerged as the standard of care for managing thrombosed accesses, providing a minimally invasive approach with high success rates. This review article aims to synthesize the existing literature on endovascular thrombectomy techniques and their outcomes in the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs.
