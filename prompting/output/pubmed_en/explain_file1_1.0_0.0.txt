This article is a narrative review that discusses current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 

The introduction section provides background information on the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the use of arteriovenous access for hemodialysis in patients with ESRD. It highlights the advantages of using AVF and AVG over central venous catheters, such as lower hospitalization risk and mortality. However, maintaining the patency of these vascular accesses requires frequent interventions, which can impact patients' quality of life and healthcare resources. Thrombosis is the main cause of access loss in AVF and AVG, accounting for the majority of cases. The article also discusses the risk factors and consequences of access thrombosis, such as delays in hemodialysis treatment and the need for catheter placement. 

The introduction further explains the components of thrombus in AV access and the lack of FDA-approved pharmacological therapies to prevent access thrombosis. The timing of thrombectomy is emphasized, with AVF thrombectomy needing to be performed within days of thrombus formation, while AVG thrombectomy can still be successful up to a week later. The shift from surgical thrombectomy to endovascular thrombectomy is highlighted, which allows for the removal of thrombus and treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities using imaging guidance. The success rates of endovascular thrombectomy procedures are mentioned, indicating that they range from 70% to 90%.

Overall, this review article aims to provide an overview of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The findings of the article are based on a literature search from electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar.
