This introduction discusses the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide and its impact on global health. It emphasizes that hemodialysis is the most common treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and highlights the importance of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) as the preferred access for chronic hemodialysis due to lower risks of hospitalization and mortality compared to central venous catheters. However, it notes that maintaining these vascular accesses requires frequent interventions, which can burden healthcare resources and affect patients' quality of life. Thrombosis is identified as the leading cause of access loss in AVFs and AVGs, with underlying stenosis being a common cause. The introduction also highlights the lack of approved pharmacological therapies to prevent access thrombosis and the unclear effects of anti-platelet therapy and warfarin on access patency. It emphasizes the importance of timely treatment for thrombosed accesses to avoid treatment delays and catheter placement. Surgical thrombectomy used to be the standard approach but has been replaced by endovascular techniques, which can remove thrombus and treat anatomical abnormalities under imaging guidance. The success rates of endovascular thrombectomy are discussed, showing improvement over the years. Finally, it states that this article aims to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications of endovascular thrombectomy for thrombosed AVGs and AVFs, and it was based on a literature search of electronic databases.
