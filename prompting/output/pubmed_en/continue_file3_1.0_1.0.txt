The adenosinergic machinery plays a critical role in cancer progression and immune evasion. Adenosine, a purine nucleoside, is generated through the sequential degradation of extracellular ATP. Extracellular ATP is released into the tumor microenvironment (TME) by dying cells or cellular stress and acts as an immunostimulatory molecule by binding to P2 purinergic receptors on immune cells. In contrast, adenosine exerts immunosuppressive effects via binding to P1 purinergic receptors.

In recent years, the involvement of adenosine in regulating various aspects of tumor immunity has become increasingly recognized. Adenosine signaling modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses in the TME. Activation of adenosine receptors on different immune cell populations can suppress the antitumor activity of effector T cells while promoting regulatory T-cell function and myeloid-derived suppressor cell expansion. Adenosine can also directly act on tumor cells to promote their proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis.

Additionally, stromal cells within the TME contribute significantly to adenosinergic signaling. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells have been shown to express ectonucleotidases that catalyze ATP hydrolysis into adenosine. This localized generation of adenosine further enhances its concentration in the TME.

Understanding the intricate interactions between different cell types within the TME is crucial for developing effective targeting strategies against cancer. As such, there has been growing interest in targeting components of the adenosinergic system for cancer therapy. Numerous preclinical studies have explored various approaches aimed at either inhibiting ectonucleotidases responsible for generating adenosine or blocking its binding to specific receptors.

Several clinical trials are currently evaluating novel therapeutic interventions that target key elements of this machinery alone or in combination with other immunotherapy approaches like checkpoint inhibitors or adoptive cell therapies.

In conclusion, the adenosinergic system plays a prominent role in cancer immune evasion and tumor progression. Targeting this pathway holds significant promise for improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. Further elucidation of the mechanisms underlying adenosine-mediated immune regulation within the TME will aid in devising effective therapeutic interventions to enhance antitumor immunity and overcome immunosuppressive barriers in cancer treatment.
