Extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling has emerged as a key regulator of immune responses in the context of cancer. The adenosinergic machinery, which encompasses the production and signaling pathways of eADO, plays a critical role in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) and altering immune surveillance.

The primary source of eADO is the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP). Under conditions such as hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation, there is an accumulation of eATP in the extracellular space following cell death or cellular stress. This eATP acts as a pro-inflammatory molecule by binding to and activating P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y). In contrast, eADO mediates immunosuppression by binding to and activating P1 purinergic receptors (A1,A2A,A2B,and A3) expressed on various immune cells.

The balance between eATP-induced inflammation and eADO-mediated immunosuppression is crucial for determining the outcome of anti-tumor immune responses. Several studies have demonstrated that high levels of eATP promote pro-inflammatory responses by activating immune cells through P2 receptor signaling. On the other hand,eATO-mediated immunosuppression occurs when high levels are reached mainly because Tregs accumulate in tumor tissues where they robustly express ADO receptor A3  leading to localized immune depletion.

Notably,the effects mediated by both P1and P2 receptors are not limited to immune cells but also impact tumor cells themselves. For instance,intrinsic mechanisms within cancer cells can contribute to increasing adenosine levels through increased expression/activity/secretion rate/extracellular concentration levels due to upregulation ectonucleotidases like CD39 and CD73-associated with good prognosis-. The increased adenosine level locally shapes multiple phenotypes contributing iteratively into hypoxia which is well documented contributor to cancer development and growth.

Moreover, various stromal cells in the TME also express adenosine receptors, further influencing immune responses and tumor behavior. For instance, fibroblasts can modulate tumor progression through their interactions with cancer-associated fibroblast receptors that are modulated by adenosine receptor signaling. Additionally, endothelial cells in tumor vasculature express adenosine receptors which regulate vessel permeability and contribute to the immune-suppressed TME.

Understanding the intricate interplay between eATP-induced inflammation and eADO-mediated immunosuppression is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies in immuno-oncology. Manipulating this balance holds great promise for enhancing anti-tumor immune responses while overcoming immunosuppression within the TME.

Several approaches targeting the adenosinergic machinery are being explored as potential therapies. One strategy involves using small molecules or antibodies to specifically block or inhibit ADO receptor activation (antagonists), enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Another approach aims at boosting local ATP levels that would overwhelm ADO concentration(securing increases on CD8+ functionality). Furthermore,reducing ATP hydrolysis can help prevent excessive accumulation of eADO by blocking enzymes like CD73 thus increasing ATP concentrations nature of inhibitor may be either antibody-based ,or small molecule based . Additionally,cytotoxicity would  be done as an associative therapy exacerbating pro-inflammatory effects of dying cell's released DAMPS resulting from chemo-immunotherapy/re-irradiation/re-infection

In conclusion,the adenosinergic machinery drives a complex network of interactions between different cell types within the TME,and understanding these mechanisms is crucial for unlocking new therapeutic opportunities in immuno-oncology.The manipulation  The next generation of treatments will likely involve combination strategies that target multiple aspects within this network to enhance anti-tumor immunity and reprogram suppressive pathways induced by ectoenzymes expression such as enhanced ATP production/resistance and interference of immunosuppressor checkpoints(CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1).
