The adenosinergic machinery in cancer refers to the intricate network of signaling pathways involving adenosine and its receptors in the tumor microenvironment. Dysregulation of this system has been found to play a significant role in tumor immune evasion, making it an attractive target for novel therapeutic approaches.

In recent years, growing evidence has highlighted the crucial role of extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling in modulating immune responses within tumors. eADO is primarily produced through the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP). The release of eATP into the extracellular space is often triggered by cellular stressors such as hypoxia, inflammation, or nutrient deprivation. Once released, eATP binds and activates P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y), contributing to pro-inflammatory responses.

However, it is well-established that eADO mediates immunosuppressive effects by activating P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) on various immune cells. By interacting with these receptors, eADO inhibits effector T cell function and promotes regulatory T cell expansion. This ultimately creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that allows cancer cells to evade immune surveillance.

Importantly, not only does the hydrolysis of eATP to eADO reduce pro-inflammatory signals mediated by P2 receptors but also enhances immunosuppression via increased activation of P1 receptors. An understanding of these mechanisms is crucial when considering future therapeutic interventions targeting the adenosinergic system.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of our current understanding regarding the role of adenosine signaling in different cell types present within the tumor microenvironment. It examines how both immune cells and non-immune cells contribute to shaping this complex network. By studying diverse cellular components such as tumor cells and stromal cells alongside immune cells like infiltrating lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the adenosinergic system's influence on tumor immunity.

Furthermore, we discuss the potential implications of these findings in the development of novel adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology. Given the importance of eADO signaling in restraining anti-tumor immune responses, targeting adenosine receptors holds great promise for enhancing immunotherapy efficacy. Several preclinical and clinical studies are already exploring this avenue, evaluating both small molecule agonists and antagonists targeting adenosine receptors as potential therapeutic options.

In conclusion, unraveling the complexities of the tumor adenosinergic system has provided valuable insights into immune evasion mechanisms utilized by cancer cells. With an improved understanding of how different cell types contribute to eADO production and receptor activation within TME, new therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating this pathway are emerging. By harnessing our knowledge of the adenosinergic machinery in cancer, we may unlock novel avenues for improving immunotherapy outcomes and ultimately advancing precision medicine approaches to effectively treat cancer patients.
