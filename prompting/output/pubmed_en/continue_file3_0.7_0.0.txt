Adenosine is a purine nucleoside that has been recognized for its role in regulating various physiological processes, including immune responses. In recent years, the adenosinergic machinery, comprising both purinergic receptors and enzymes involved in adenosine metabolism, has emerged as a crucial regulator of immune cell function in cancer.

Extracellular adenosine (eADO) is mainly generated from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP) by the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73. eATP is released into the extracellular space following cell death or cellular stress, such as hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation. Once in the extracellular space, eATP can bind and activate P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y), leading to pro-inflammatory responses. On the other hand, eADO, generated from the hydrolysis of eATP, acts on P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) and has been shown to mediate immunosuppression in various immune cells.

The interplay between eATP and eADO has significant implications for tumor immunity. In the tumor microenvironment (TME), eATP can enhance anti-tumor immune responses by activating P2 receptors on immune cells, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of immune cells. However, the accumulation of eATP can also lead to immunosuppression through the generation of eADO. eADO signaling in the TME has been shown to inhibit the function of various immune cells, including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs), thereby promoting tumor immune evasion.

Notably, the effects of eADO are not limited to immune cells. Tumor cells themselves can also produce adenosine through the upregulation of CD39 and CD73, leading to the establishment of an immunosuppressive TME. Furthermore, stromal cells within the TME, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, can contribute to adenosine production and immunosuppression. The adenosinergic machinery in the TME thus involves complex interactions between immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells.

Given the critical role of the adenosinergic machinery in tumor immunity, targeting this pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in immuno-oncology. Several approaches have been explored to modulate adenosine signaling in the TME. For example, inhibitors of CD39 and CD73 have been developed to prevent the generation of eADO. Additionally, antagonists of adenosine receptors, particularly A2A and A2B receptors, have been investigated as potential immunotherapies to block the immunosuppressive effects of eADO.

In conclusion, the adenosinergic machinery plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses in the TME. The interplay between eATP and eADO, as well as the activation of specific purinergic receptors, can either enhance or suppress anti-tumor immune responses. Understanding the complexities of the adenosinergic system in different cell types within the TME is essential for the development of effective adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology. Targeting this pathway holds great promise for improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy and overcoming immune evasion mechanisms employed by tumor cells. Further research is needed to unravel the precise mechanisms underlying adenosine-mediated immunosuppression and to identify novel therapeutic targets within the adenosinergic machinery.
