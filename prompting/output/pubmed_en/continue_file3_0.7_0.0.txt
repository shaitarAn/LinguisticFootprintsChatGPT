The adenosinergic machinery in cancer refers to the complex network of signaling pathways involving extracellular adenosine (eADO) and its receptors in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This system plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and has garnered significant attention in the field of cancer immunotherapy.

Extracellular adenosine is primarily generated through the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP). Under conditions of cellular stress or damage, such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, or inflammation, eATP is released into the extracellular space. eATP can bind to and activate P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y), leading to pro-inflammatory responses. However, the subsequent hydrolysis of eATP to eADO by ectonucleotidases, such as CD39 and CD73, shifts the balance towards immunosuppression.

Studies have shown that eADO exerts its immunosuppressive effects by binding to and activating the P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) on various immune cells. This activation leads to the suppression of immune cell function and the promotion of an immunosuppressive TME. Consequently, the conversion of eATP to eADO not only reduces the pro-inflammatory effects of eATP but also enhances the immunosuppressive signaling mediated by adenosine receptors.

Notably, the adenosinergic system is not limited to immune cells. Tumor cells and stromal cells in the TME also contribute to the production and regulation of adenosine signaling. Tumor cells can upregulate the expression of ectonucleotidases, leading to increased eADO production. Additionally, stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, can also contribute to eADO production and receptor signaling.

Understanding the intricate interplay between the adenosinergic system and various cell types in the TME is essential for developing targeted therapies. Several strategies have been explored to modulate adenosine receptor signaling, including the use of small molecule antagonists or agonists, monoclonal antibodies, and gene therapy approaches. These approaches aim to either block the immunosuppressive effects of eADO or enhance the anti-tumor immune response by targeting specific adenosine receptors.

In conclusion, the adenosinergic machinery in cancer represents a complex network of signaling pathways that regulate immune responses in the TME. The manipulation of this system holds great potential for the development of novel immunotherapies in the field of oncology. Further research is needed to fully understand the intricacies of this system and to identify the most effective strategies for targeting the adenosinergic machinery in cancer.
