This introduction provides an overview of the topic of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as "long COVID." It explains that many adults and children experience prolonged symptoms after recovering from acute COVID-19, and these symptoms are referred to as PASC or long COVID when they persist for four or more weeks. The underlying mechanisms of PASC are still largely unknown, but immune dysregulation is believed to play a role.

The introduction highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying PASC in order to develop appropriate preventive and treatment strategies. It mentions that the NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative involves over 100 researchers who are conducting studies on PASC. The initiative aims to collect data from individuals across different age groups using electronic health records and surveys, as well as biospecimens.

The introduction also mentions that the Mechanistic Pathways Committee within the RECOVER consortium focuses on three priority areas: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage. This perspective article specifically focuses on immune mechanisms in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC.

It discusses how dysregulation of immune processes is intertwined with viral persistence and tissue-specific pathologies in PASC. The role of neutrophil activation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in severe acute COVID-19 is highlighted, but their potential role in long COVID or PASC is not well understood.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for discussing the role of immune mechanisms in both acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and long-term complications such as PASC. It emphasizes the need for further research to understand these mechanisms and develop effective treatments for individuals experiencing prolonged symptoms after recovering from COVID-19.
