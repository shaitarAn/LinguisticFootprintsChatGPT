This introduction provides an overview of the role of adenosine (ADO) in cellular metabolism and signaling, particularly in relation to extracellular ATP (eATP) and its conversion to extracellular adenosine (eADO). The article highlights the significance of eATP and eADO as signaling molecules involved in various physiological processes such as blood pressure regulation, platelet activation, neurotransmission, and immunoregulation.

Under normal conditions, extracellular levels of both ATP and ADO are low. However, certain cell conditions or stresses can lead to the release of ATP from cells through processes like regulated vesicular exocytosis or cell destruction. This accumulation of eATP serves as a danger signal for immune cells to migrate towards inflammatory sites and activate the immune system in response to tissue damage or the presence of pathogens.

The activation of inflammation by eATP is mediated through P2 purinergic receptors, specifically ligand-gated receptors (P2X) and metabotropic nucleotide-selective receptors (P2Y). While most P2Y receptors have been found to promote oncogenic processes directly in tumor cells, they indirectly regulate these processes in immune cells.

Recent studies suggest that eATP stimulates the expression of P2X7 purinoceptor on various immune cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, T cells, and B cells. This activation leads to the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome complexes within these immune cells and subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18. This process enhances anti-tumor immunity.

However, within tumor microenvironments (TME), rapid hydrolysis occurs where accumulating eATPs are converted into eADO due to high levels of ectonucleotidases present in solid tumors compared to non-tumor tissues. The canonical pathway involves sequential hydrolysis: first by CD39, also known as ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1, which converts eATP to extracellular ADP and then by CD73, known as 5′-nucleotidase, which hydrolyzes AMP to eADO.

An alternative pathway for eADO production involves the involvement of CD38 and CD203a. These enzymes mediate the hydrolysis of extracellular nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD) released via gap junctions into inorganic pyrophosphate and AMP, subsequently converted to eADO by CD73.

Apart from these enzymes, other factors like prostatic acid phosphatase and tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase have also been reported to participate in the conversion of eAMP to eADO.

The concentration of eADO can remain high within the tumor microenvironment due to cancer cell death, rapid growth or chemotherapy leading to ATP release. Additionally, Treg cell deaths provide ATP along with CD39/CD73 enzymes that contribute to immunosuppression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been found highly expressive of CD73 induced by A2B receptor activation in colorectal cancer thereby sustaining high levels of eADO concentration.

In conclusion, while adenosine normally plays a role in balancing immune system responses under physiological conditions, its function within the tumor microenvironment is more complex. Both immune cells and various cellular components influence adenosine signaling within TME contributing towards tumor cell growth support.
