1. Introduction

Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in muscle mass, strength, and physical performance, poses significant challenges to the health and well-being of older adults (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). With a rapidly aging global population, understanding the modifiable factors associated with sarcopenia outcomes is crucial for developing effective prevention and intervention strategies.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential nutrients that play diverse roles in maintaining optimal health. Specifically, certain PUFAs have been implicated in muscle biology and function (Gammone et al., 2018). Omega-3 PUFAs, such as Î±-linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have garnered considerable attention due to their potential anti-inflammatory properties and positive effects on muscle metabolism (Smith et al., 2020). On the other hand, omega-6 PUFAs have been suggested to possess both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties depending on their ratio with omega-3 PUFAs (Simopoulos et al., 2002).

While several studies have investigated the association between dietary PUFA intake and sarcopenia outcomes among older adults, limited research has explored whether nutritional PUFA status could also influence these outcomes. Understanding both dietary intake and nutritional status provides a comprehensive perspective on an individual's PUFA profile.

The aim of this study was to examine whether dietary PUFA intake and nutritional PUFA status are correlated with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial provided us with a unique opportunity to explore this relationship within an ongoing randomized controlled trial setting.

By investigating potential correlations between specific PUFAs' intake or status markers with parameters defining sarcopenia (muscle strength, mass), physical performance measures (step count), as well as quality of life indicators, such as SF-36 and SarQoL scores, this study aims to generate new hypotheses and insights into the role of PUFAs in sarcopenia outcomes among older adults.

Findings from this study could contribute to evidence-based dietary recommendations and intervention strategies targeting specific PUFAs for the prevention or management of sarcopenia in older adults. Ultimately, our research may pave the way for personalized nutritional interventions that consider both dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs to optimize muscle health and physical function in aging populations.

In this article, we present the exploratory results from our analysis utilizing baseline data from the ENHANce trial. We anticipate that our findings will provide a foundation for future research on PUFA-related interventions in sarcopenic older adults, eventually leading to improved clinical outcomes and enhanced quality of life for this vulnerable population.
