Introduction

The adenosinergic machinery has emerged as a crucial regulator of immune responses, particularly in the context of cancer. Adenosine, a metabolic intermediate involved in ATP catabolism, has been shown to play a significant role in immune modulation and tumor progression. Extracellular adenosine (eADO) is primarily produced from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP), which is released in response to various cellular stresses and damage. While eATP activates pro-inflammatory responses through P2 purinergic receptors, eADO has been reported to mediate immunosuppression by activating P1 purinergic receptors in immune cells.

The interplay between eATP and eADO in the tumor microenvironment (TME) has profound implications for tumor immunity. The hydrolysis of eATP to eADO not only reduces eATP levels but also enhances adenosine receptor signaling, thereby altering the immunosurveillance in the TME. This dynamic regulation of the adenosinergic system involves various cell types, including immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells.

In this review, we aim to provide an up-to-date understanding of the adenosinergic machinery in cancer, encompassing all cell types present in the TME. We will explore the production, degradation, and signaling pathways of eADO, highlighting the key enzymes involved in its metabolism. Additionally, we will discuss the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the adenosinergic system in immuno-oncology.

Understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying the adenosinergic machinery in cancer is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies that can modulate immune responses and enhance anti-tumor immunity. By elucidating the role of eADO in tumor progression and immune evasion, we can identify potential targets for intervention and pave the way for the development of adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology.

In conclusion, this review aims to provide comprehensive insights into the adenosinergic machinery in cancer, shedding light on the intricate interplay between eATP and eADO and their impact on tumor immunity. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, we can explore novel therapeutic avenues that target the adenosinergic system, ultimately improving the outcomes for cancer patients.
