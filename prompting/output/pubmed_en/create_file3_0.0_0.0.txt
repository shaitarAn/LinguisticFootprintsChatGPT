Introduction

The adenosinergic machinery has emerged as a critical regulator of immune responses, particularly in the context of tumor immunity. Extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling, which is primarily derived from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP), has been shown to play a pivotal role in modulating immune cell function within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The interplay between eATP and eADO, mediated by the activation of purinergic receptors, has been implicated in shaping the immunosurveillance within the TME.

While eATP acts as a pro-inflammatory molecule by binding and activating P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y), eADO has been reported to exert immunosuppressive effects by activating P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) in various immune cell populations. Consequently, the hydrolysis of eATP to eADO not only reduces eATP levels but also enhances adenosine receptor signaling, thereby altering the immune response within the TME.

Although the role of the adenosinergic system in immune cells has been extensively studied, its involvement in other cell types within the TME, such as tumor cells and stromal cells, remains less explored. Understanding the comprehensive landscape of the tumor adenosinergic system across different cell types is crucial for unraveling the complex interplay between immune cells, tumor cells, and the TME.

In this paper, we aim to provide an up-to-date review of the adenosinergic machinery in cancer, focusing on its role in immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells within the TME. By synthesizing the existing knowledge, we aim to shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying the adenosinergic signaling network and its impact on tumor immunity. Furthermore, we will discuss potential novel directions for adenosinergic therapies in the field of immuno-oncology.

Overall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the adenosinergic system in cancer, highlighting its diverse roles in different cell types within the TME. By elucidating the complex interplay between adenosine signaling and tumor immunity, this research will contribute to the development of innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the adenosinergic machinery for improved cancer treatment outcomes.
