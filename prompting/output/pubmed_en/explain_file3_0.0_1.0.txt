This introduction provides an overview of the role of adenosine (ADO) in various biological processes and its significance in the tumor microenvironment (TME). It begins by explaining that ADO is a metabolic intermediate involved in the breakdown of ATP and the synthesis of important signaling molecules like cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The introduction then highlights that extracellular nucleotides, including purines and pyrimidines, have been reported as signaling molecules involved in several systems such as blood pressure regulation, platelet activation, cardiovascular system remodeling, neurotransmission, anti-cell death, promotion of cell growth, and immunoregulation.

The passage goes on to explain that under normal physiological conditions, both ATP and ADO are present at low levels in the extracellular space. However, certain cell conditions and stresses such as cell membrane damage, ischemia (lack of oxygen), inflammation, and cancer can trigger the massive release of ATP. This release serves as a danger signal or Danger-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP) to attract immune cells to inflammatory sites and alert the immune system about pathogen-associated molecules or tissue damage.

The activation of inflammation by extracellular ATP (eATP) is mediated through P2 purinergic receptors. While most family members of these receptors promote oncogenic processes directly in tumor cells themselves, they regulate these processes indirectly in immune cells. Recent studies suggest that eATP activates a specific receptor called P2X7 expressed on various immune cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity.

However, eATP is rapidly hydrolyzed to extracellular adenosine (eADO) within the TME due to higher levels of enzymes called ectonucleotidases found in solid tumors. The passage explains two main pathways for eADO production: one involving sequential hydrolysis mediated by CD39 and CD73 enzymes acting on eATP; another non-classical pathway involving CD38 and CD203a enzymes. It also mentions other enzymes that can contribute to eADO production.

The passage further explains that the half-life of eADO in the extracellular space is short, but its concentration can remain high in the TME due to ATP release from cancer cell death or Treg cell deaths. Additionally, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) highly express CD73 induced by A2B receptor activation, leading to sustained high levels of eADO concentration in colorectal cancer.

Overall, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the role of adenosine and its metabolism in various biological processes and highlights its significance within the tumor microenvironment.
