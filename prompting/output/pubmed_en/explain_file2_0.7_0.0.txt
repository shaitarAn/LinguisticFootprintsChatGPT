The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marginalized and underserved populations in the United States. It starts by stating the number of infections and deaths caused by COVID-19 up to June 2022, emphasizing that historically marginalized populations have been disproportionately affected. Specifically, Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations have higher infection and death rates compared to non-Latinx White groups.

The introduction then highlights the development and effectiveness of vaccines in reducing transmission, hospitalization, and deaths from COVID-19. However, it notes that vaccination rates have been lower in Black and Latinx communities compared to the national average. Various factors contribute to this disparity, including mistrust in the healthcare system and research, language barriers, immigration issues, and lack of health insurance in low-paying jobs.

The introduction further explains that the health disparities observed during the COVID-19 pandemic are not random but rather a result of long-standing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities caused by structural racism and discriminatory policies. It mentions that while access to healthcare improved after the Affordable Care Act, millions of people remain uninsured, compromising the equitable delivery of care, especially during a health crisis.

The article then introduces the concept of structural and social determinants of health (SDOH), which are the circumstances in which people live and the systems and structures that influence their access to healthcare. It references the World Health Organization (WHO) Conceptual Framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health to examine the root causes of disparities and identify opportunities for action.

The introduction concludes by stating the focus of the article on structural determinants that were essential drivers of health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also includes a figure depicting the structural and social determinants of health and proposes areas for action based on the WHO framework.

Overall, the introduction sets the stage for discussing the challenges faced by marginalized and underserved populations during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lessons learned from it.
