This article discusses the health disparities that have been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, specifically among historically marginalized populations such as Black, Latinx, and Indigenous individuals, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals. These groups have experienced higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 compared to non-Latinx White individuals.

The authors highlight several factors that contribute to these disparities. Historically marginalized groups are more likely to be employed in low-wage jobs without health insurance, which increases their risk of exposure to the virus. Mistrust in the healthcare system, language barriers, and limited health literacy have also hindered vaccination rates in these communities, further exacerbating the disparities.

The article emphasizes that these health disparities are not random, but rather rooted in structural, institutional, and socioeconomic inequities, including structural racism and discriminatory policies. Despite improvements in access to healthcare following the passage of the Affordable Care Act, millions of people remain uninsured, impacting the capacity of the healthcare system to deliver equitable care.

The authors discuss the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges faced by marginalized and underserved populations. They also highlight the importance of considering the structural and social determinants of health, which include factors such as social class, government policies, socioeconomic status, and racism. A conceptual framework proposed by the World Health Organization is used to evaluate these determinants and identify opportunities for action.

The article concludes by emphasizing the need to address these structural determinants of health in order to mitigate health disparities during future health crises. It highlights the importance of focusing on areas such as access to healthcare, occupational and housing conditions, and psychosocial stress.

In summary, this article highlights the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on historically marginalized populations in the United States and discusses the underlying structural and social determinants of health that contribute to these disparities. It emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to address these determinants and promote equitable healthcare outcomes.
