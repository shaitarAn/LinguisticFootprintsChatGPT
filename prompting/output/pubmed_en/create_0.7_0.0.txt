Introduction:

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a global health concern, with chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence on the rise. Hemodialysis is the most common renal replacement therapy for individuals with ESRD, and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts (AVGs) are the preferred vascular accesses for chronic hemodialysis due to their lower risk of hospitalization and mortality compared to central venous catheters. However, maintaining the patency of these long-term vascular accesses poses a significant challenge, requiring frequent interventions that burden healthcare resources and impact patients' quality of life.

Thrombosis is the leading cause of access loss in AVFs and AVGs, accounting for the majority of cases. The thrombosis rate for AVFs is reported to be 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days, while AVG thrombosis occurs at a rate of 0.2 events per patient during a 2-year follow-up. Thrombosed access not only leads to delays and omissions in hemodialysis treatment but also necessitates inpatient admissions and, in some cases, the abandonment of the access, requiring the placement of dialysis catheters. Access thrombosis is commonly caused by underlying venous or arterial anastomotic stenoses, and systemic factors such as hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications can further increase the risk.

Traditionally, surgical thrombectomy was the primary treatment option for thrombosed AV access, but the development of endovascular techniques has revolutionized the management of these cases. Endovascular thrombectomy, performed under imaging guidance, not only allows for the mechanical removal of thrombus but also enables the treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities, such as stenoses. This approach has become the preferred method due to its higher success rates, reduced hospitalization, and the ability to address multiple issues in a single procedure. Studies have reported procedure success rates ranging from 70% to 90% for endovascular thrombectomy in thrombosed AVFs and AVGs.

In this narrative review, we aim to provide an overview of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVFs and AVGs. Through an extensive literature search of electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, we have compiled relevant information to enhance our understanding of these techniques and their implications in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access. By comprehensively exploring the available literature, we hope to contribute to the optimization of thrombectomy approaches for access maintenance in the ESRD population.
