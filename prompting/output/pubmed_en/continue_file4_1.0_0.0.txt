Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function, is a prevalent condition in older adults and is a major contributor to functional limitations, disability, and poor quality of life. Nutritional interventions, including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), have been suggested as potential strategies to mitigate the progression of sarcopenia and improve outcomes in older adults. PUFAs, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anabolic effects, which may be beneficial for muscle health.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between dietary PUFAs intake, nutritional PUFAs status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The study used baseline data from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) randomized controlled trial, which is investigating the effects of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

A total of 29 participants were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 76.3 years. The participants had a relatively low dietary intake of omega-3 PUFAs, below the recommended intake for both men and women. There was no correlation between dietary PUFAs intake and PUFAs status, indicating that dietary intake may not accurately reflect the nutritional status of PUFAs in the body.

In terms of the relationship between PUFAs intake and status with sarcopenia outcomes, the results were intriguing. Higher levels of alpha-linolenic acid status were associated with lower appendicular lean mass, while higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid status were associated with higher appendicular lean mass. These findings suggest that different types of PUFAs may have differential effects on muscle mass in older adults with sarcopenia.

Additionally, some markers of PUFAs intake and status were associated with physical activity, quality of life, and overall well-being. Higher intake and status of certain omega-3 PUFAs were associated with higher step counts, better scores on quality of life questionnaires, and improved physical component summary scores. However, one marker, gamma-linolenic acid status, was inversely associated with the physical component summary score, indicating a potential negative impact on physical health.

Although this study has several limitations, including its small sample size and cross-sectional design, it provides valuable exploratory findings on the relationship between PUFAs intake and status with sarcopenia outcomes in older adults. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms by which PUFAs may influence muscle health in sarcopenic individuals. Understanding the role of PUFAs in sarcopenia may inform future nutritional interventions aimed at preventing or managing this debilitating condition in older adults.
