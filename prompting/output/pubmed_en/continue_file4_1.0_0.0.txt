Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, has become a significant public health concern as the global population continues to age. It is associated with increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality in older adults. Therefore, identifying factors that contribute to sarcopenia and developing effective interventions is crucial.

One potential factor that may influence sarcopenia outcomes is dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). PUFAs, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anabolic effects on muscle tissue. Previous research suggests that low PUFA intake may be associated with muscle loss and impaired physical function in older adults. However, the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia is not well understood.

The current study, conducted as part of the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial, aimed to explore the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in sarcopenic older adults. The ENHANce trial is a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial that assesses the effect of combined anabolic interventions (protein, omega-3 supplement, and exercise) on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

Baseline data from the ENHANce trial were used for this exploratory, cross-sectional analysis. Dietary PUFA intake was assessed using 4-day food records, while nutritional PUFA status was determined by analyzing red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles. The researchers calculated Spearman's rho correlation coefficients to explore the associations between PUFA intake and status with various sarcopenia parameters, including muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical performance, as well as physical activity and quality of life.

In total, 29 participants (9 males and 20 females) with a mean age of 76.3 years were included in the analysis. The results showed that the total omega-3 intake of the participants was below the recommended intake for both males and females. This suggests that the overall intake of omega-3 fatty acids in the study population was insufficient. However, there was no correlation between PUFA intake and status, indicating that dietary intake may not accurately reflect nutritional status.

When examining the correlations between PUFA intake and status with sarcopenia outcomes, interesting findings emerged. Higher levels of alpha-linolenic acid status were inversely associated with appendicular lean mass, indicating that lower levels of this fatty acid may be detrimental to muscle mass. On the other hand, higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid status were positively associated with appendicular lean mass, suggesting a potential protective role of this fatty acid in sarcopenia.

Additionally, some markers of PUFA intake and status were positively correlated with physical activity, quality of life, and overall well-being. This suggests that higher PUFA intake and status may be associated with better physical function and overall quality of life in sarcopenic older adults. However, it's worth noting that gamma-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with the physical component summary score of the SF-36, indicating a potential negative impact on physical health.

Overall, while the study had limitations due to its small sample size and cross-sectional design, it generated new hypotheses regarding the potential correlations between PUFA intake and status and various sarcopenia outcomes. The findings highlight the importance of further research in this area to better understand the role of PUFAs in sarcopenia and to develop targeted interventions that can improve muscle health and function in older adults. Future studies with larger sample sizes and longitudinal designs would provide more robust evidence and help inform dietary recommendations for preventing and managing sarcopenia.
