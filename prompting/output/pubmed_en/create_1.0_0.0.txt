Introduction:

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent and growing global health issue, contributing significantly to the burden of disease. Hemodialysis is the most common renal replacement modality for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts (AVGs) being the preferred access for chronic hemodialysis due to lower risks of hospitalization and mortality. However, maintaining the patency of these long-term vascular accesses poses considerable challenges and can have significant implications for patients' quality of life, morbidity, and mortality.

Thrombosis is the leading cause of access loss in AVFs and AVGs, accounting for the majority of cases. Thrombosed access can result in delays in hemodialysis treatment, treatment omissions, inpatient admissions, and the need for dialysis catheter placement. Access thrombosis is commonly caused by underlying venous or arterial stenoses at the anastomotic site, with systemic factors such as hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications further increasing the risk.

Historically, surgical thrombectomy was the primary treatment option for thrombosed AV access, requiring hospitalization and operating room resources. However, with advancements in intravascular techniques, endovascular thrombectomy has emerged as the standard of care. Endovascular thrombectomy involves the mechanical removal of thrombus using various devices such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms. This approach not only allows for the successful removal of thrombus but also enables the treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities.

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the utilization of endovascular thrombectomy for thrombosed AVFs and AVGs compared to traditional surgical techniques. These procedures have reported success rates ranging from 70% to 90%, making them a favorable treatment option. However, it is important to understand the potential complications associated with these interventions, such as vessel rupture, arterial and pulmonary embolism, and paradoxical embolism to the brain.

This narrative review article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for treating thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. By reviewing the available literature from electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, we aim to enhance the understanding of thrombectomy approaches and contribute to the effective management of patients with thrombosed AV access.
