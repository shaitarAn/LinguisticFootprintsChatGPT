This article discusses the role of adenosine signaling in cancer, specifically focusing on its impact on immune responses and potential therapeutic applications. Adenosine is a metabolic intermediate involved in the breakdown of ATP and the synthesis of signaling molecules like cAMP. Under normal conditions, both ATP and adenosine are present at low levels in the extracellular space. However, various conditions and stresses such as cell damage, inflammation, and cancer can lead to the release of ATP into the extracellular space.

Extracellular ATP (eATP) functions as a danger signal, attracting immune cells to the site of inflammation and alerting the immune system to potential threats. eATP activates purinergic receptors, specifically P2X and P2Y receptors, which play a role in inflammation and oncogenic processes. Recent studies have shown that eATP can activate P2X7 receptors on immune cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity.

However, eATP is rapidly converted to extracellular adenosine (eADO) in the tumor microenvironment due to the presence of ectonucleotidases. eADO is primarily derived from the hydrolysis of eATP by CD39 and CD73 enzymes. The concentration of eADO in the tumor microenvironment can remain high due to cancer cell death, release of ATP by Treg cells, and the expression of CD73 by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).

The article also discusses the various metabolic pathways of eADO production, degradation, and signaling. It highlights the importance of the eATP-CD39-CD73 pathway in determining the concentration of eADO, but also mentions alternative ecto-enzymes that regulate eADO metabolism.

Overall, this article provides insights into the adenosinergic machinery in cancer, specifically its impact on immune responses and potential therapeutic applications. It emphasizes the role of eADO in mediating immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and discusses the potential for adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology.
