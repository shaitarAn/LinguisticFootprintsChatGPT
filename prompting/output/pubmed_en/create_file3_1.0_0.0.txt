Introduction

Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized the field of oncology by enhancing the body's immune response against cancer cells. Various immune-regulatory mechanisms have been identified, including the adenosinergic machinery, which plays a significant role in tumor immunity. Adenosine, an endogenous purine nucleoside, has been demonstrated to exert immunosuppressive effects by activating purinergic receptors in immune cells. Specifically, extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling has emerged as a crucial orchestrator of immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME).

The tumor microenvironment is a complex milieu consisting of not only tumor cells but also immune cells and stromal cells. This dynamic interplay between different cell types within the TME regulates tumor growth, invasion, and immune surveillance. In recent years, the tumor adenosinergic system, mediated by the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP) to eADO, has gained attention as a key regulator of these processes.

Extracellular ATP is released into the extracellular space following cell death or cellular stress induced by conditions such as hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation. This eATP, along with its receptors P2X and P2Y, plays a pro-inflammatory role by actively participating in immune responses. However, the hydrolysis of eATP gives rise to eADO, which in turn activates a distinct set of purinergic receptors, namely the P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) expressed on immune cells. Activation of these receptors results in immunosuppressive effects, ultimately dampening the anti-tumor immune response.

The underlying mechanisms through which the adenosinergic machinery influences tumor immunity have been extensively studied in immune cells. However, recent evidence suggests that the effects of adenosine signaling are not limited to immune cells but also extend to tumor cells and stromal cells present within the TME. The crosstalk between these diverse cell types plays a critical role in shaping the tumor immune landscape.

This review aims to provide an updated understanding of the adenosinergic system in the TME, encompassing all cell types involved, including immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells. By elucidating the intricate relationships between these cell populations, we can gain insights into the mechanisms through which adenosine signaling modulates tumor immunosurveillance. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential novel directions of future adenosinergic therapies in the field of immuno-oncology.

Understanding the adenosinergic machinery and its impact on tumor immunity is essential for developing effective cancer immunotherapies. By deciphering the signaling pathways involved in adenosine-mediated immunosuppression, we can potentially enhance the efficacy of existing immunotherapy strategies or develop new approaches to overcome immune evasion in cancer. Additionally, targeting the adenosine receptors expressed on tumor cells and stromal cells could potentially impact tumor growth and invasion.

In conclusion, the adenosinergic machinery acts as a potent regulator of immune responses within the TME. This complex interplay between extracellular ATP and adenosine signaling affects the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes, ultimately influencing tumor immune surveillance. By comprehensively understanding the tumor adenosinergic system and its consequences on different cell types within the TME, new opportunities for therapeutic intervention can be explored in the field of immuno-oncology.
