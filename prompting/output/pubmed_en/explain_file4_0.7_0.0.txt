The introduction of this PubMed article discusses the role of diet in the development and treatment of sarcopenia, which is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. The article highlights that sarcopenia is a growing concern in the aging population and can significantly impact the daily life of older adults, limiting their ability to perform physical tasks. It states that sarcopenia affects a significant proportion of older adults living in the community and nursing homes.

The article emphasizes the importance of nutrition in sarcopenia, particularly the role of malnutrition and low protein intake in its onset or progression. It mentions that nutritional supplementation, either alone or combined with exercise, is currently recommended as the treatment strategy for sarcopenia. However, besides protein intake, the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is also suggested to influence muscle physiology and sarcopenia progression.

The introduction explains that dietary fat intake is a major determinant of muscle structure and function. Fatty acids can serve as an energy source for the muscle and are also incorporated into different structures of the skeletal muscle, optimizing its structure and function. It suggests that omega-3 PUFAs have beneficial effects on muscle, while omega-6 PUFAs might have negative effects due to their pro-inflammatory properties. Therefore, a higher ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs intake is considered beneficial for musculoskeletal health and other health domains like cardiovascular health.

The article states that a high intake of omega-3 PUFAs is gaining attention as a potential treatment for sarcopenia due to its properties that are potentially beneficial for the muscle, such as improving muscle protein synthesis, reducing anabolic resistance, and reducing insulin resistance. However, detailed data on the usual dietary intake of PUFAs in well-defined sarcopenic older adults are lacking.

To address this gap, the authors aim to assess the dietary intake of PUFAs and PUFAs status in a sample of well-defined sarcopenic older adults using food records and the fatty acids composition of red blood cell (RBC) membranes as an objective biomarker. They highlight that RBC membrane composition reflects the nutritional PUFAs status based on intake over the past month or two.

The study aims to determine the correlation between intake and status of PUFAs and explore associations between dietary intake and PUFAs status with sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, muscle mass, physical performance), physical activity, and quality of life (QoL). The authors hypothesize that omega-3 PUFAs intake is low in sarcopenic older adults and is correlated with status. They also expect that higher intake of omega-3 PUFAs will be associated with improved muscle strength and mass, higher QoL scores, and more physical activity.

Overall, the introduction provides an overview of the importance of diet in sarcopenia and highlights the specific focus of the study on assessing PUFAs intake and status in sarcopenic older adults and their associations with various aspects of sarcopenia and overall well-being.
