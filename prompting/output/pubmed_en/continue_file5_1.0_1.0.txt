The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in millions of cases worldwide. While many individuals experience asymptomatic or mild infections, a significant proportion of patients develop severe disease, leading to hospitalization and death. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that a subset of individuals who recover from the acute phase of the infection continue to experience symptoms and impairment for several months, termed post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID.

The pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 is known to involve dysregulated immune responses characterized by excessive activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, often referred to as a "cytokine storm." This hyperinflammatory state can lead to tissue damage and multiorgan dysfunction. Several studies have identified specific innate immune pathways such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and inflammasomes that contribute to the initiation and progression of inflammation in severe COVID-19.

In addition to innate immune mechanisms, adaptive immune responses also play crucial roles in controlling viral infections. However, in some cases of severe COVID-19, there is an impaired adaptive immune response characterized by lymphopenia and dysfunctional T cell activation. These dysfunctional T cells not only fail to eliminate the virus but also contribute to excessive inflammation through aberrant cytokine production.

While our understanding of the immunopathology underlying severe COVID-19 has expanded rapidly over the past year, significantly less is known about PASC. It remains unclear why some individuals develop persistent symptoms after recovering from acute infection while others do not. It is postulated that PASC may result from persistent dysregulated immune responses triggered during the acute phase or ongoing viral replication at low levels.

Unlike acute infections where robust antiviral immunity is required for pathogen clearance, PASC may involve altered immunoregulatory networks leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. This hypothesis is supported by observations of persistent immune activation, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and the presence of immune cell subsets in the blood and tissues of PASC individuals.

Preliminary studies have suggested potential mechanisms driving PASC immunopathology. These include persistent viral reservoirs or antigen persistence, dysregulation of B cell responses leading to autoimmunity, impaired tissue repair mechanisms, and aberrant immune cell interactions. However, these findings are limited by small sample sizes and a lack of longitudinal analysis. Larger-scale studies utilizing multi-omics approaches combined with clinical data are needed to unravel the complex immunological landscape that drives PASC.

Understanding the heterogeneity within the PASC population is also crucial for tailoring precision therapies. It is likely that different individuals experience distinct immunopathological profiles based on factors such as age, sex, underlying comorbidities, initial disease severity, and genetic predisposition. Longitudinal studies following patients from acute infection through recovery into PASC will be essential to identify biomarkers predicting who will develop this condition and to uncover specific therapeutic targets for personalized interventions.

In conclusion, understanding the immune mechanisms underlying severe COVID-19 and its sequelae is vital for developing targeted therapies for both acute disease management and long-term symptom resolution in PASC individuals. More research focusing on large-scale longitudinal studies encompassing diverse patient populations is urgently needed to dissect the complex immunopathology driving both severe COVID-19 outcomes and post-acute sequelae. By unraveling these mechanisms at a molecular level, we can pave the way toward precision medicine approaches tailored to individual patients' immune profiles in this unprecedented global health crisis caused by SARS-CoV-2."
