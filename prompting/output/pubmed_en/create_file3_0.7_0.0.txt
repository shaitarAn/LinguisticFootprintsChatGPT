Introduction

The adenosinergic machinery has emerged as a critical regulator of immune responses, particularly in the context of cancer. Extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling, primarily derived from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP), has been shown to play a significant role in mediating immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). eATP, released following cellular stress or cell death triggered by factors such as hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation, functions as a pro-inflammatory molecule by activating P2 purinergic receptors. Conversely, eADO exerts immunosuppressive effects by activating P1 purinergic receptors in various immune cells.

The hydrolysis of eATP to eADO not only reduces eATP levels but also enhances adenosine receptor signaling, thereby altering the immunosurveillance in the TME. This dynamic interplay between the P1 and P2 purinergic receptors extends beyond immune cells and involves various cell types present in the TME, including tumor cells and stromal cells. Understanding the intricate adenosinergic system in all cell types within the TME is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies in immuno-oncology.

This review aims to provide an up-to-date understanding of the tumor adenosinergic system, elucidating the mechanisms underlying eADO production, degradation, and signaling. The canonical pathway involves the sequential hydrolysis of eATP to eADO by ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73. However, alternative ecto-enzymes, such as CD38, CD203a, prostatic acid phosphatase, and tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase, have also been implicated in regulating eADO metabolism. Moreover, adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase further metabolize eADO into inosine and hypoxanthine, respectively.

Despite the short half-life of eADO, its concentration remains high in the TME. Cancer cell death, either due to rapid growth or chemotherapy, contributes to ATP release and subsequent eADO accumulation. Treg cell deaths and the activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also contribute to eADO production, resulting in immunosuppressive effects within the TME. Understanding the role of eADO in promoting tumor cell growth and its regulation in various cell types within the TME is critical for the development of targeted adenosinergic therapies in the field of immuno-oncology.

In summary, the adenosinergic machinery plays a vital role in modulating immune responses in cancer. The interplay between eATP and eADO, mediated by P1 and P2 purinergic receptors, influences the immunosurveillance within the TME. This review will provide insights into the complex adenosinergic system in different cell types within the TME and discuss potential novel directions for adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology.
