Introduction:

Extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling has emerged as a key regulator of immune responses, playing a crucial role in the modulation of tumor immunity. The adenosinergic machinery, comprising purinergic receptors and enzymes responsible for the production and degradation of eADO, has been extensively studied in the context of cancer. However, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the specific mechanisms through which the adenosinergic system influences various aspects of tumor biology and the tumor microenvironment (TME).

While previous research has focused on the immunosuppressive effects of eADO mediated through the activation of P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) on immune cells, recent evidence suggests that the adenosinergic machinery may have broader implications in cancer beyond its immunomodulatory functions. The role of eADO and its precursor, extracellular ATP (eATP), in tumor progression, metastasis, and response to therapy remains to be fully elucidated.

Tumor cells are known to exhibit altered metabolism and increased reliance on glycolysis, leading to the accumulation of lactate and acidification of the TME. This acidic TME has been shown to promote the release of eATP from dying tumor cells, resulting in elevated levels of eATP in the extracellular space. While the pro-inflammatory effects of eATP through P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y) have been well-documented, the impact of eATP hydrolysis to eADO on tumor biology remains less understood.

Furthermore, the adenosinergic system is not restricted to immune cells and tumor cells. Stromal cells within the TME, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, have also been shown to contribute to the adenosinergic signaling cascade. The precise role of stromal cells in regulating eADO levels and adenosine receptor signaling in the TME is an area that requires further investigation.

In light of these knowledge gaps, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the adenosinergic machinery in cancer, encompassing all cell types present in the TME, including immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells. By synthesizing current literature, we aim to elucidate the complex interplay between eATP, eADO, and purinergic receptors in tumor biology and immunosurveillance. Moreover, this review will highlight the potential novel directions for adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology.

In conclusion, the adenosinergic machinery in cancer represents a multifaceted system that not only modulates immune responses but also influences various aspects of tumor biology. Understanding the intricate interactions between eATP, eADO, and purinergic receptors in different cell types within the TME is crucial for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. By unraveling the complexities of the adenosinergic system, this review aims to pave the way for future research and the development of innovative approaches to harness the therapeutic potential of adenosine signaling in immuno-oncology.
