Introduction

The adenosinergic machinery has been extensively studied for its role in cancer, particularly in the context of immune responses and tumor immunity. Adenosine, an important signaling molecule in the extracellular space, has been shown to modulate immune cell function and contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Extracellular adenosine (eADO) is predominantly generated from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP), which is released following cell death or cellular stress triggered by various factors such as hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation.

Adenosine and ATP exert their effects through activation of purinergic receptors, which are classified into two major subtypes: P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) and P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y). While eATP binding to P2 receptors promotes pro-inflammatory responses, eADO binding to P1 receptors mediates immunosuppression. This interplay between eATP and eADO signaling not only regulates immune cell function but also impacts tumor cell behavior and the surrounding stromal cells in the TME.

Understanding the complex adenosinergic system in cancer is crucial for the development of effective therapeutic strategies in immuno-oncology. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying adenosine-mediated immunosuppression and its impact on the TME, novel therapeutic approaches can be explored to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve patient outcomes.

In this article, we aim to review the current understanding of the tumor adenosinergic system in all cell types within the TME, including immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells. We will discuss the role of both P1 and P2 purinergic receptors in cancer and their implications for immune modulation and tumor progression. Additionally, we will explore potential novel directions for adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology, highlighting the prospects for targeting the adenosine signaling pathway to overcome immunosuppression and enhance anti-tumor immune responses.

By investigating the adenosinergic machinery in cancer from basic mechanisms to therapeutic strategies, this article aims to provide in-tandem insights into the complex interplay between eATP, eADO, and their respective purinergic receptors. The knowledge gained from this research will contribute to the development of personalized and targeted therapies that can effectively harness the immune system to combat cancer.
