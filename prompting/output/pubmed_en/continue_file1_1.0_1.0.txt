Arteriovenous (AV) access is a critical component in the management of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who require hemodialysis. The successful functioning of AV grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) is essential for delivering efficient dialysis treatment. However, thrombosis of AV access can occur and lead to significant complications such as delayed or missed hemodialysis sessions, increased morbidity, and the need for temporary dialysis catheter placement. With the advancement in endovascular techniques, thrombectomy has become the preferred treatment option over surgical intervention.

This narrative review aims to provide an overview of current practices and outcomes related to endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the management of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. In order to conduct this review, a comprehensive literature search was performed using electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar.

2. Management Strategies

The initial step in managing thrombosed AV access involves restoring patency to allow efficient blood flow during hemodialysis sessions. Endovascular techniques have evolved over time, providing several options for removing or dissolving blood clots within the vascular circuit.

Thrombolysis is an approach that involves infusion catheters or pulse injector devices to deliver fibrinolytic agents directly into the clot. Although effective at restoring patency in some cases, there are concerns regarding bleeding complications associated with systemic delivery of these agents.

Thrombectomy is a mechanical approach that involves physically removing or breaking up the clot within the vascular circuit using various devices such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic systems, and aspiration mechanisms.

In addition to addressing acute clot removal through both thrombolysis and thrombectomy approaches; underlying anatomical abnormalities contributing to reduced blood flow should also be evaluated during interventions. These may include stenoses at anastomotic sites or along other portions of the AV access circuit.

3. Complications

While endovascular thrombectomy techniques have revolutionized the management of thrombosed AV access, they are not without risks. Different procedures carry varying risks, and it is crucial for clinicians to weigh the potential complications against the benefits for each patient's specific situation.

Complications associated with these interventions include vessel rupture, arterial embolism (emboli becoming lodged in smaller vessels), pulmonary embolism (clots traveling to lung arteries), and paradoxical embolism to the brain through a patent foramen ovale. Appropriate pre-procedural evaluation and careful selection of patients should mitigate some of these risks.

4. Conclusion

In conclusion, endovascular thrombectomy techniques have emerged as the preferred treatment option for thrombosed AVGs and AVFs in patients with ESRD. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy approaches are employed to restore patency by removing or dissolving blood clots within the vascular circuit.

Despite their efficacy, clinicians must be aware of potential complications associated with these interventions including vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism, and paradoxical embolism. A thorough understanding of available techniques and their associated risks is essential in order to provide optimal care for patients with thrombosed AV access.

Further research is warranted to improve outcomes related to endovascular thrombectomy techniques, reduce procedural complications, assess long-term patency rates following intervention, and optimize patient selection criteria. Continued advancements in technology will likely further refine treatment strategies in this patient population.
