Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a major health concern in older adults. It is associated with increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality. Nutrition plays a crucial role in the development and progression of sarcopenia, and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been proposed as potential modulators of muscle health.

PUFAs are essential fatty acids that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet. They are classified into two main categories: omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3 PUFAs, such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are found in fatty fish, flaxseed, and walnuts. Omega-6 PUFAs, such as gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), are found in vegetable oils and nuts.

Previous studies have suggested that PUFAs, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, may have beneficial effects on muscle health. They have been shown to reduce inflammation, improve muscle protein synthesis, and enhance muscle function. However, the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia is not well understood.

The current study, conducted as part of the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial, aimed to explore the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in sarcopenic older adults. The ENHANce trial is a randomized controlled trial that assesses the effect of combined interventions (protein, omega-3 supplement, and exercise) on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

Baseline data from 29 participants (9 males and 20 females, mean age 76.3 years) were used for this exploratory analysis. Dietary PUFA intake was assessed using 4-day food records, and nutritional PUFA status was assessed using red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles. The researchers calculated Spearman's correlation coefficients to explore the associations between PUFA intake and status with sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, mass, and physical performance), physical activity (step count), and quality of life.

The results showed that the total omega-3 intake of the participants was below the recommended intake for both males and females. This suggests that older adults with sarcopenia may not be consuming enough omega-3 fatty acids in their diet. Interestingly, there was no correlation between PUFA intake and status, indicating that dietary intake may not accurately reflect nutritional status.

When examining the associations between PUFA intake and status with sarcopenia outcomes, the researchers found that ALA status was inversely associated with appendicular lean mass (aLM), while DHA status was positively associated with aLM. This suggests that higher levels of DHA may be associated with better muscle mass in sarcopenic older adults.

Additionally, some omega-3 PUFA intake and status markers were positively associated with physical activity, quality of life, and SarQoL scores. This indicates that higher intake and status of omega-3 PUFAs may be beneficial for overall physical function and well-being in older adults with sarcopenia. However, gamma-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with the physical component summary score of the SF-36 questionnaire, suggesting that higher levels of this omega-6 PUFA may be associated with poorer physical health.

In conclusion, this exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for potential correlations between PUFA intake and status with sarcopenia outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia. The findings suggest that higher levels of omega-3 PUFAs, particularly DHA, may be associated with better muscle mass and physical function. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Future interventions targeting PUFA intake and status in older adults with sarcopenia may help improve muscle health and overall well-being in this population.
