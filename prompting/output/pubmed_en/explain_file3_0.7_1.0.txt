This introduction provides an overview of the role of adenosine (ADO) and extracellular ATP (eATP) in various physiological and pathological processes, particularly in cancer. It explains that ADO is a metabolic intermediate involved in ATP catabolism and the synthesis of important signaling molecules like cyclic AMP. The article highlights that extracellular nucleotides, including purines and pyrimidines, have been identified as signaling molecules involved in various systems such as blood pressure regulation, platelet activation, cardiovascular system remodeling, neurotransmission, anti-cell death mechanisms, cell growth promotion, and immunoregulation.

Under normal conditions, both ATP and ADO are present at low levels in the extracellular space. However, certain cellular conditions or stresses like cell membrane damage, ischemia (restriction of blood supply), inflammation, and cancer can trigger the massive release of endogenous ATP through regulated vesicular exocytosis or direct cell destruction. This accumulation of eATP serves as a danger signal or Danger-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP), attracting phagocytic cells to inflammatory sites and alerting the immune system about pathogen-associated molecules or cell/tissue damage.

The activation of inflammation by eATP is mediated through P2 purinergic receptors called P2X receptors (ligand-gated) and P2Y receptors (metabotropic nucleotide-selective). While most members of the P2Y receptor family promote oncogenic processes directly in tumor cells themselves, P2Y receptors expressed on immune cells indirectly regulate these processes.

Recent studies suggest that eATP activates a specific receptor called P2X7 on various immune cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity by promoting the formation of an inflammasome called NLRP3 and releasing inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18. However,eATP is rapidly hydrolyzed to eADO within the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to higher levels of certain enzymes called ectonucleotidases in solid tumors. The canonical pathway for eADO production involves the sequential hydrolysis of eATP to extracellular ADP and AMP by CD39 (ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1), followed by the hydrolysis of AMP to eADO by CD73 (5′-nucleotidase). Additionally, other pathways mediated by enzymes like CD38 and CD203a contribute to eADO production.

The article also mentions that the half-life of eADO is short in the extracellular space. However, its concentration can remain high in the TME due to ATP release from cancer cell death caused by rapid growth or chemotherapy. Treg cell deaths also contribute to ATP release and subsequent eADO accumulation for immunosuppression in the TME. Furthermore, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) highly express CD73 induced by A2B receptor activation, leading to sustained high levels of eADO concentration in colorectal cancer.

Overall, this introduction sets up the context for understanding adenosine metabolism pathways, including production, degradation, signaling mechanisms,and their implications in tumor growth and immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment.
