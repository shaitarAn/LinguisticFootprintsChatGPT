This introduction provides an overview of the role of adenosine (ADO) in various biological processes and its involvement in tumor microenvironment (TME). It states that ADO is a metabolic intermediate involved in the ATP catabolism pathway and the synthesis of important signaling molecules such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). It also mentions that extracellular nucleotides, including purines and pyrimidines, have been reported as signaling molecules involved in various systems like blood pressure regulation, platelet activation, cardiovascular system remodeling, neurotransmission, anti-cell death, promotion of cell growth, and immunoregulation.

The introduction highlights that under normal physiological conditions, both ATP and ADO are present at low levels in the extracellular space. However, various cellular conditions and stresses such as cell membrane damage, ischemia, inflammation, and cancer can trigger the massive release of ATP. This release of ATP functions as a danger signal, attracting phagocytic cells to the inflammatory sites and alerting the immune system about the presence of pathogen-associated molecules and cell/tissue damage.

The introduction further explores the activation of inflammation by extracellular ATP (eATP) through P2 purinergic receptors, and the role of P2Y receptors in promoting oncogenic processes in tumor cells and regulating these processes indirectly in immune cells. It also discusses recent studies suggesting that eATP activates P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7) expressed on immune cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity.

Additionally, the introduction explains the rapid hydrolysis of eATP to extracellular adenosine (eADO) in the tumor microenvironment due to higher levels of ectonucleotidases in solid tumors. It describes the canonical pathway of eADO production from eATP, involving the sequential hydrolysis by CD39 and CD73. It also mentions the non-classical pathway mediated by CD38 and CD203a.

The introduction highlights that the half-life of eADO is short in the extracellular space, but its concentration can remain high in the TME due to cancer cell death, Treg cell deaths, and the expression of CD73 by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It concludes by stating that in the TME, adenosine signaling and eADO production play a role in tumor cell growth support.

Overall, the introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the role of adenosine and extracellular nucleotides in various biological processes and their implications in the tumor microenvironment.
