This article discusses the role of adenosine signaling in cancer, specifically its impact on immune responses and potential therapeutic applications. The authors start by explaining that extracellular adenosine (eADO) is primarily produced from extracellular ATP (eATP) hydrolysis. eATP is released into the extracellular space following cell death or cellular stress triggered by hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation. eATP activates the P2 purinergic receptors, promoting inflammation, while eADO mediates immunosuppression by activating the P1 purinergic receptors in immune cells.

The authors review the current understanding of the adenosinergic system in cancer, including its effects on immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). They highlight that both P1 and P2 purinergic receptors have effects beyond immune cells. The article also discusses the production, degradation, and signaling pathways of eADO, including the enzymes involved in its hydrolysis and alternative ecto-enzymes that regulate its metabolism.

The authors explain that the concentration of eADO remains high in the TME due to cancer cell death, release of ATP by Treg cells, and expression of CD73 by cancer-associated fibroblasts. They note that while ADO plays a role in balancing immune system activation under normal conditions, in the TME, it supports tumor cell growth.

Overall, this article provides insights into the adenosinergic machinery in cancer, highlighting its impact on immune responses and potential therapeutic targets. It emphasizes the complex interplay between eATP and eADO in the tumor microenvironment and suggests future directions for adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology.
