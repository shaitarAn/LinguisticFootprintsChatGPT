The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on the rise globally and is contributing to the overall burden of disease. Hemodialysis, a treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is most commonly performed using a method called hemodialysis. Compared to central venous catheters, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) are preferred access options for chronic hemodialysis because they have lower risks of hospitalization and mortality.

Patients who rely on catheters for dialysis have poorer outcomes and are at an increased risk of sepsis and bacteremia. However, long-term use of AVF and AVG requires frequent interventions to maintain access patency. This not only places a significant burden on healthcare resources but also impacts patients' quality of life, leading to implications for morbidity and mortality.

Thrombosis, or blood clot formation, is the primary cause of access failure in AVF and AVG cases, accounting for 65-85% of incidents. The rate of thrombosis in AVFs is 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days, while AVG thrombosis occurs at a rate of 0.2 events per patient during a two-year follow-up period. Access thrombosis usually occurs due to underlying stenoses in the veins or arteries where the connection is made.

Several systemic factors can increase the risk of access thrombosis, including hypercoagulability (increased tendency towards blood clotting), low ejection fraction (a measure indicating heart function), hypotension (low blood pressure), hemoconcentration (abnormal increase in red blood cell concentration), as well as complications during cannulation that result in hematomas.

When an access becomes thrombosed or clotted off, it leads to delays in hemodialysis treatment schedule disruption with potential hospital admissions due to treatment omissions or placement abandonment, necessitating the use of dialysis catheters. Thrombi formed in AV access typically consist of two components: a soft, friable clot that disintegrates easily in the venous outflow and a firm fibrin plug near the anastomosis (the connection site). 

Currently, there are no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies available for preventing access thrombosis. The long-term effects of anti-platelet therapy and warfarin on access patency remain uncertain. Therefore, it is crucial to promptly treat thrombosed accesses to avoid delays in dialysis treatment and catheter placement.

Thrombectomy, the removal of blood clots, becomes less likely to be successful when fresh thrombus hardens into an adherent clot within the native vein of an AVF. As a result, thrombectomy in AVFs should ideally be performed within days after clot formation, whereas thrombectomy in AVGs can still yield success up to a week later.

In the past, surgical thrombectomy requiring hospitalization and operating room resources was commonly used for treating thrombosed access cases. However, with advancements in intravascular techniques, endovascular thrombectomy has become the standard approach for treating these cases. Under imaging guidance (such as ultrasound or fluoroscopy), not only can the blood clot be removed but underlying anatomical abnormalities like stenoses can also be treated simultaneously.

Previous studies have reported procedure success rates ranging from 70% to 90% for endovascular approaches to treat fistulas or grafts with blood clots. Over time, there has been a significant increase in endovascular access thrombectomy procedures performed for both AVFs and AVGs compared to two decades ago.

This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of current practices regarding endovascular techniques used for treating blood clots in AVGs and AVFs. It will discuss outcomes and potential complications associated with these thrombectomy procedures. The review is based on a literature search of electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar.

In conclusion, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease continues to rise globally, leading to an increased burden of disease. Hemodialysis using AVF and AVG as access options is preferred due to lower risks compared to catheters. However, maintaining long-term access patency requires frequent interventions. Thrombosis is the major cause of access failure, and prompt treatment through endovascular techniques has become the standard approach. This article aims to provide insights into current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy for thrombosed AVGs and AVFs.
