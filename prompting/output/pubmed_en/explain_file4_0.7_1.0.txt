This introduction provides an overview of the importance of diet in the development and treatment of sarcopenia, which is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. It highlights that sarcopenia is a growing concern in the aging population and can significantly impact daily life activities. The article mentions that malnutrition and low protein intake contribute to sarcopenia, while nutritional supplementation, including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), is recommended for treatment. Specifically, omega-3 PUFAs are suggested to have beneficial effects on muscle health.

The introduction also emphasizes that there is a lack of detailed data on dietary PUFA intake in well-defined sarcopenic older adults. To address this gap, the study aims to assess both dietary PUFA intake through food records and PUFA status through red blood cell membrane fatty acid composition in a sample of sarcopenic older adults. The correlation between intake and status will be determined, along with associations between PUFA intake/status and various parameters related to sarcopenia (muscle strength/mass, physical performance), as well as physical activity levels and quality of life.

Overall, the introduction sets up the rationale for investigating PUFA intake/status in relation to sarcopenia outcomes in older adults and states specific hypotheses about low omega-3 PUFA intake among this population group.
