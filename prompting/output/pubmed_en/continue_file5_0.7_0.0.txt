The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. While the majority of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, a subset of patients develop severe disease with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan dysfunction, and even death. However, even among those who initially experience mild or moderate disease, a growing number of individuals are reporting persistent symptoms and functional impairments long after the acute phase of the infection has resolved. This condition, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID, is characterized by a wide range of symptoms including fatigue, dyspnea, cognitive impairment, chest pain, joint pain, and depression.

The underlying mechanisms driving the development of PASC are not yet fully understood. However, recent evidence suggests that dysregulated immune responses play a crucial role in both the acute phase of COVID-19 and the subsequent development of PASC. During the acute phase of infection, SARS-CoV-2 triggers a robust immune response characterized by the activation of innate immune cells such as macrophages and natural killer cells, as well as the recruitment and activation of adaptive immune cells including T cells and B cells. This immune response is critical for viral clearance and the resolution of infection in most individuals.

However, in severe cases of COVID-19, an excessive and dysregulated immune response, often referred to as a cytokine storm, can occur. This cytokine storm is characterized by the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). The excessive production of these cytokines can lead to tissue damage, vascular leakage, and organ dysfunction, contributing to the severity of COVID-19.

Importantly, it is now recognized that this dysregulated immune response can persist beyond the acute phase of infection and contribute to the development of PASC. Studies have shown that individuals with PASC have persistent immune activation, with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell dysregulation. Additionally, abnormalities in the adaptive immune response, such as altered T cell function and dysregulated antibody production, have also been observed in PASC patients.

Although the immunopathology of PASC is not yet fully understood, it is likely to be multifactorial and heterogeneous. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed, including persistent viral replication, viral reservoirs, autoimmunity, and dysregulated immune memory. Longitudinal studies following individuals with and without PASC are needed to better understand the immune mechanisms underlying this condition.

In conclusion, dysregulated immune responses play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of both severe COVID-19 and PASC. While the immune dysregulation in the acute phase of infection is well-characterized, the immunopathology of PASC remains poorly understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific immune mechanisms driving PASC and to develop targeted therapies to restore immune homeostasis in affected individuals. Understanding the immune mechanisms underlying PASC will not only contribute to the development of precision therapies but also aid in the identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis of this condition.
