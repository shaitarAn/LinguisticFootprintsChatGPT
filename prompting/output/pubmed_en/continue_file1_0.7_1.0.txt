End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition characterized by the loss of kidney function, requiring patients to undergo hemodialysis for waste removal. Arteriovenous (AV) access, such as arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), are created to provide a reliable means of vascular access for hemodialysis. However, thrombosis of AV access can occur, leading to significant complications.

Thrombosed AV access can result in the delay or interruption of hemodialysis treatments, which can have detrimental effects on patients' health. In some cases, the thrombosis may be so severe that the AV access needs to be abandoned altogether and replaced with a dialysis catheter. To avoid such scenarios and improve patient outcomes, endovascular thrombectomy techniques have become the preferred approach for treating thrombosed AV access.

The endovascular approach offers several advantages over traditional surgical interventions for thrombosed AV access. It is less invasive and associated with shorter recovery times and lower complication rates. The goal of endovascular interventions is twofold: removing the thrombus from the AV circuit and addressing any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to clot formation.

Thrombolysis is one method employed in endovascular procedures for dissolving blood clots within the AV circuit. This involves infusing fibrinolytic agents through catheters or using pulse injector devices at the site of clot formation. Thrombolysis has shown promising results in restoring patency to occluded vessels; however, it carries a risk of bleeding complications due to systemic fibrinolysis.

Another technique used in endovascular thrombectomy is mechanical removal of the clot through various devices. Embolectomy balloon catheters are commonly used tools that can be inflated within occluded vessels to dislodge and remove clots mechanically. Rotating baskets or wires are also utilized to capture and remove thrombi. Rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms can also be employed to mechanically disrupt and remove the clot.

In addition to thrombectomy, adjunctive methods such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, or stent placement may be necessary to address underlying stenoses in the AV circuit. These techniques aim to restore normal blood flow by dilating narrowed vessels or providing structural support with stents.

Despite the numerous benefits of endovascular thrombectomy techniques, they are not without risks. Complications can include vessel rupture during mechanical removal of clots, arterial embolism caused by dislodged debris, pulmonary embolism (PE) resulting from clot migration to the lungs, or paradoxical embolism leading to stroke if a clot passes through a patent foramen ovale.

To provide an overview of current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for AV access maintenance in patients with ESRD, we conducted a narrative review of relevant literature. A comprehensive search was performed using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar.

This narrative review aims to enhance understanding among healthcare professionals involved in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access. By familiarizing themselves with different thrombectomy techniques and potential complications associated with these interventions, clinicians can make informed decisions on treatment strategies that optimize patient outcomes while minimizing risks.
