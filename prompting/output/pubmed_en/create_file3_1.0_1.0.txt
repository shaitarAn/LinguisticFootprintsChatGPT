Title: The Role of Adenosine Receptors in Cancer-Associated Neuroinflammation: Implications for Novel Therapeutic Strategies

Abstract:
Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in multiple pathological conditions, including cancer. Mounting evidence suggests that the adenosinergic machinery, particularly the activation of adenosine receptors (ARs), is an essential regulatory mechanism involved in cancer-associated neuroinflammation. Adenosine receptors are widely expressed on various immune cells within the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). These receptors play a complex role in modulating immune responses and regulating cellular functions.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying how adenosine receptor signaling influences tumor immunity. Adenosine is generated through extracellular ATP hydrolysis under conditions such as tissue injury, inflammation, hypoxia, or nutrient deprivation. Extracellular ATP functions as a danger signal that activates pro-inflammatory pathways through binding to P2 purinergic receptors. Conversely, extracellular adenosine acts as an immunosuppressive molecule by activating P1 purinergic receptors.

While previous research has focused primarily on studying the immunomodulatory effects of adenosine in peripheral immune cells and tumor microenvironments outside the nervous system, relatively little attention has been paid to its role in cancer-associated neuroinflammation specifically. Given that neural tissue harbors a unique microenvironment with interactions between neurons and glial cells (astrocytes and microglia), it is plausible to suggest that neuroimmune crosstalk mediated by adenosine signaling may impact tumorigenesis.

The objective of this study is to shed light on the involvement of adeno
