Introduction

The adenosinergic machinery plays a critical role in cancer progression and therapy. Adenosine, a metabolic intermediate involved in ATP catabolism, acts as a signaling molecule involved in various physiological processes such as blood pressure regulation, platelet activation, neurotransmission, anti-cell death, promotion of cell growth, and immunoregulation. Under normal physiological conditions, adenosine levels are kept low in the extracellular space. However, cell stressors such as inflammation or cancer can lead to the release of large amounts of extracellular ATP (eATP). The accumulation of eATP functions as a danger signal that alerts the immune system to the presence of pathogen-associated molecules and tissue damage.

Activation of inflammation mediated by eATP occurs through P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y) expressed on immune cells. While most members of the P2Y receptor family promote oncogenic processes directly in tumor cells, P2Y receptors in immune cells regulate these processes indirectly. Recent studies have shown that eATP activates specific purinoceptors on macrophages and other immune cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity through the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome and release inflammatory cytokines.

However, within the tumor microenvironment (TME), eATP is rapidly hydrolyzed into extracellular adenosine (eADO) due to higher levels ectonucleotidases present in solid tumors compared to non-tumor tissues. The conversion from eATP into eADO alters immunosurveillance within TME by reducing eATP levels while enhancing adenosine receptor signaling.

The production of eADO primarily occurs through sequential hydrolysis mediated by enzymes CD39 and CD73. CD39 converts eATP into extracellular ADP and AMP sequentially while CD73 further metabolizes AMP into adenosine. Additionally, alternative ecto-enzymes such as CD38 and CD203a have been identified to contribute to eADO production through non-classical pathways.

Although the half-life of eADO is short, its concentration can remain high within TME due to cancer cell death, release of ATP from Treg cells, and expression of CD73 by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The sustained high concentration of eADO in TME promotes tumor growth and immunosuppression.

In this review article, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the adenosinergic machinery in cancer across various cell types including immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells within the TME. We will explore key mechanisms involved in extracellular ATP hydrolysis into adenosine and discuss how these mechanisms affect tumor immunity. Furthermore, we will highlight potential novel directions for targeting the adenosinergic system in immuno-oncology therapies.

By elucidating the intricate roles of adenosine signaling in cancer biology, this review aims to contribute to our understanding of basic mechanisms influencing tumor growth and immunity. Ultimately, this knowledge may pave the way for innovative therapeutic approaches that target the adenosinergic machinery for improved outcomes in cancer patients.
