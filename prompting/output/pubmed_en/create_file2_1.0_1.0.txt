Introduction

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has unveiled stark health disparities in the United States, particularly among historically marginalized populations. In this introduction, we aim to explore a different research question concerning the same issue addressed in the aforementioned article. Specifically, we investigate the impact of socioeconomic factors on health disparities observed during the COVID-19 pandemic and how they influence access to healthcare services for vulnerable communities.

Extensive literature has documented that minority populations, including Black, Latinx, and Indigenous individuals, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged groups, face disproportionately higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 compared to non-Latinx White individuals (Gross et al., 2020; Khazanchi et al., 2020; Yaya et al., 2020). This disparate burden can be attributed to several underlying structural and institutional factors that have perpetuated health inequities over generations.

Historically marginalized groups are more likely to be employed in low-wage jobs without adequate access to employer-sponsored healthcare benefits or paid sick leave (Chen et al., 2020; Gould-Werth & Macartney-Filgate ,2021). Consequently, these population subsets experience limited financial resources necessary for seeking timely medical attention or affording preventive measures such as personal protective equipment (PPE), leading to increased vulnerability. Moreover,CovidTracker Project Midwest Research Group (CovidTrek) study suggests that financial constraints may hinder adherence to quarantine measures among disadvantaged communities due to potential loss of income during isolation periods.

Furthermore,Lorena Garcia Gonzalez's work extensively demonstrates that systemic racism within institutions such as housing policies and educational systems perpetuates socio-economic disadvantages among minority groups. These systemic barriers restrict opportunities for social mobility resulting in concentrated poverty,great distances between essential services such as clinics,hospitals ,gyms etc which worsens accessibility issues.

Mistrust in the healthcare system also emerges as a significant factor contributing to health disparities. Historical experiences of medical exploitation and unethical research practices, such as the infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study, have eroded trust among minority communities (Gamble, 1997). This deep-rooted mistrust hinders effective communication between healthcare providers and patients, leading to reduced compliance with preventive measures and vaccination efforts (Wibbelsman et al., 2021).

Moreover,inadequate health literacy compounded by language barriers among immigrants further exacerbates disparities. Language variation limits access to accurate information regarding COVID-19 prevention strategies,misunderstandings or misinterpreting guidelines contribute to non-adherence(Rubalcava-Pe√±afiel et al., 2021;WHO),ultimately thwarting control efforts.Rapid adaptation of multilingual resources is necessary in disseminating critical information about testing,vaccination schedules,quarantine instructions etc.

The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the critical need for targeted interventions to mitigate health disparities rooted in socioeconomic factors. Understanding how structural inequities shape access to healthcare services can inform policy changes that promote equity and improve outcomes for marginalized populations.

Therefore,the objective of this study is three-fold:(1)to explore the relationship between socioeconomic factors and health disparities observed during the COVID-19 pandemic;(2)to evaluate the impact of these socioeconomic barriers on access to healthcare services;and(3)to propose evidence-based strategies that can address these underlying issues,solidify trust,and improve equitable healthcare delivery for vulnerable communities.

In conclusion,this introduction provides an overview of the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on historically marginalized populations in terms of infection rates,hospitalization,and mortality.Literature review reveals a complex interplay between several socioeconomic factors,distrust within institutions,and limited health literacy.We introduce our research question about investigating the influence of these factors on accessing healthcare services. The subsequent sections will present our methodology,data analysis,and findings,followed by a discussion of their implications for policy changes and strategies to mitigate disparities and promote equitable healthcare delivery.
