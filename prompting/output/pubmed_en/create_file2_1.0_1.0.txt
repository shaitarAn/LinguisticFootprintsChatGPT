Introduction

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound impact on individuals and societies across the globe. In particular, the United States has witnessed the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on certain marginalized populations, including Black, Latinx, Indigenous communities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals. These historically underserved groups have faced higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality compared to non-Latinx White individuals.

Addressing health disparities in COVID-19 outcomes is crucial for promoting equitable healthcare access and improving overall population health. The existing literature highlights various factors contributing to these disparities in the United States. Structural racism, institutional biases within healthcare systems, as well as socioeconomic inequities have been identified as significant contributors to the unequal burden experienced by marginalized communities during this pandemic.

While recent research has shed light on the nature and extent of these disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among different populations in the US context, there remains a need to understand effective strategies aimed at mitigating these inequalities moving forward. This paper aims to explore lessons learned from health disparities observed during the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years to inform interventions that can address structural barriers and improve health equity.

In this article section dedicated to an alternative research question concerning health disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among marginalized populations in the United States will be examined. Specifically focusing on evaluating social determinants of health (SDOH) factors influencing vaccination rates among minority communities such as mistrust in healthcare system providers due to historical bias or experiences of discrimination which might impede vaccine uptake.

Understanding how SDOH factors interact with individual beliefs towards vaccination can provide insights into tailoring interventions aimed at increasing vaccine uptake within vulnerable populations affected by health disparities during pandemics such as COVID-19. Thus providing evidence-based strategies designed specifically for minorities that are culturally competent addressing potential barriers linked with mistrust or limited awareness regarding vaccines.

By analyzing existing literature published during this pandemic, this study aims to identify effective approaches to engaging and supporting marginalized communities in increasing vaccine uptake thus helping mitigate health disparities associated with COVID-19. Findings from this research can inform public health policies and interventions that prioritize equity, inclusivity, and cultural competence when combating future pandemics or other health crises.

Overall, investigating the impact of SDOH factors on vaccination rates within marginalized populations affected by health disparities will enhance our understanding of strategies needed to improve equitable access to vaccinations during pandemics. By addressing these disparities effectively, we can work towards achieving a more just and inclusive healthcare system.
