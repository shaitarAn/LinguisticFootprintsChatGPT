Title: Lessons Learned from Health Disparities in Coronavirus Disease-2019 in the United States

Introduction:

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a devastating impact on the United States, infecting millions of people and causing over one million deaths since its onset in June 2020. This calamity has disproportionately affected historically marginalized populations, including Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals. These groups have experienced higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and mortality compared to non-Latinx White individuals.

One notable observation is that vaccination rates among minorities have been lower than the national average. Only 48% of eligible Black individuals and 63% of eligible Latinx individuals have received at least one vaccine dose as of June 2022, significantly lagging behind the overall vaccination rate of 78%. Several factors contribute to this disparity in vaccine uptake among marginalized communities including long-standing mistrust in the health care system and research enterprise, language barriers, immigration issues, and lack of health insurance particularly prevalent among low-wage jobs.

It is important to recognize that health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic are not random occurrences but rather are rooted in longstanding racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities caused by structural racism and discriminatory policies that affect access to high-quality education, employment opportunities, housing conditions, and healthcare services. Although access to healthcare has improved with the implementation of initiatives such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), millions remain uninsured which compromises equitable care delivery during public health crises like COVID-19.

Furthermore, already strained health systems serving predominantly Black , Latinx ,and Indigenous communities faced significant challenges during the pandemic due to overwhelming patient surges amidst limited resources. This situation further exacerbated existing disparities by limiting access to advanced treatments and critical care services for these vulnerable populations.

To provide a comprehensive analysis of lessons learned from these health disparities during COVID-19 pandemic., it is essential to examine the structural and social determinants of health (SDOH) that have contributed to these inequities. The World Health Organization Conceptual Framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health (WHO CSDH) provides a useful framework for understanding the root causes and identifying areas for action.

In this article, we aim to critically evaluate the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic in addressing health disparities, with a particular focus on marginalized and underserved populations. By examining the structural determinants that have underpinned these disparities, we can identify strategies to mitigate their impact moving forward. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute evidence-based recommendations that inform public health policy and practice aimed at achieving health equity amidst future crises.
