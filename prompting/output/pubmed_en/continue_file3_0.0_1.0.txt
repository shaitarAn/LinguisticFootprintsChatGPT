The adenosinergic machinery in cancer refers to the complex network of signaling pathways involving extracellular adenosine (eADO) and its receptors in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This system plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and has significant implications for cancer therapy.

Extracellular ATP (eATP) is a key player in this machinery, as it serves as the precursor for eADO production. Under conditions of cellular stress or damage, such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, or inflammation, eATP is released into the extracellular space. Once released, eATP can bind to and activate P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y), leading to pro-inflammatory responses.

On the other hand, eADO acts as an immunosuppressive molecule by binding to P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) on various immune cells. This activation of adenosine receptors inhibits immune cell function and dampens anti-tumor immune responses within the TME.

The interplay between eATP hydrolysis to eADO alters the balance of immunosurveillance within the TME. Not only does it reduce levels of pro-inflammatory ATP signaling but also enhances immunosuppressive adenosine receptor signaling. This dysregulation contributes to tumor progression by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment that allows tumors to evade immune surveillance.

Importantly, both immune cells and non-immune cells within the TME express these purinergic receptors. Therefore, understanding how this adenosinergic system functions across different cell types is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway.

In this review article, we aim to provide an up-to-date understanding of how the tumor adenosinergic system operates in various cell types present in TME including immune cells like T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor cells, and stromal cells. We will discuss the implications of dysregulated adenosinergic signaling in cancer progression and explore potential novel directions for adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology.

By targeting the adenosinergic machinery, it may be possible to modulate immune responses within the TME and enhance anti-tumor immunity. This could potentially improve the efficacy of existing immunotherapies or lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment. Understanding the intricate mechanisms underlying this system is crucial for advancing our knowledge and developing effective strategies to harness its therapeutic potential.
