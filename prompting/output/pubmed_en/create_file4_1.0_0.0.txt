Introduction:

Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, is a prevalent condition among older adults and is associated with increased risk of disability, falls, and mortality (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). The relationship between dietary intake, nutritional status, and sarcopenia outcomes, particularly in relation to specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), has gained attention in recent years. PUFAs play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including muscle protein metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress (Jain et al., 2020). However, the correlation between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia remains poorly understood.

Previous research has highlighted the potential benefits of omega-3 PUFAs in relation to sarcopenia. Omega-3 PUFAs, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anabolic effects on muscle tissue (Smith et al., 2015). Moreover, omega-3 PUFAs have been associated with improved muscle strength, physical performance, and muscle mass in older adults (Gray et al., 2018; McKinnon et al., 2019). Conversely, low levels of omega-3 PUFAs have been linked to increased inflammation and muscle wasting (Calder, 2015). These findings suggest that dietary intake and nutritional status of omega-3 PUFAs may play a significant role in the prevention and management of sarcopenia in older adults.

Despite the potential importance of omega-3 PUFAs in sarcopenia, there is limited research focusing on the correlation between dietary intake, nutritional status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults. Most studies have examined the effects of omega-3 supplementation on muscle-related parameters, with mixed results (Bauer et al., 2015; Kouw et al., 2017). Few studies have explored the relationship between omega-3 PUFA intake from regular diet, as well as the nutritional status of omega-3 PUFAs, and sarcopenia outcomes.

Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the association between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. This study will utilize data from the ENHANce (Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg) trial, an ongoing 5-armed triple-blinded randomized controlled trial. The ENHANce trial aims to assess the effectiveness of combined anabolic interventions, including protein supplementation, omega-3 supplementation, and exercise, on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults. Baseline data from this trial will be utilized for a secondary, exploratory, cross-sectional analysis to examine the relationship between PUFA intake, PUFA status, and sarcopenia-defining parameters such as muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical performance.

By identifying potential correlations between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional status, and sarcopenia outcomes, this study will contribute to our understanding of the role of PUFAs in the prevention and management of sarcopenia in older adults. Such knowledge can inform the development of targeted dietary and nutritional interventions aimed at optimizing muscle health and physical function in this population. Ultimately, this research may have implications for improving the quality of life and reducing the burden of sarcopenia-related disability and healthcare costs among older adults.
