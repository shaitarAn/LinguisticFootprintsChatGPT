The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its increasing prevalence worldwide. It highlights hemodialysis as the most common treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and emphasizes the importance of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) as preferred access options for chronic hemodialysis due to their lower risk of hospitalization and mortality compared to central venous catheters.

The article mentions that catheter-dependent patients have poorer outcomes, including an increased risk of sepsis and bacteremia. It also acknowledges that while AVF and AVG are preferred, they require frequent interventions to maintain access patency, which can burden healthcare resources and impact patients' quality of life, leading to implications on morbidity and mortality.

The leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG is thrombosis, accounting for 65-85% of cases. The thrombosis rate for AVF is reported as 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days, while AVG thrombosis occurs at a rate of 0.2 events per patient during a 2-year follow-up. The article identifies underlying venous or arterial anastomotic stenoses as common causes of access thrombosis, along with systemic factors such as hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications resulting in hematomas.

Thrombosed access leads to delays in hemodialysis treatment, treatment omissions, inpatient admissions, and the need for dialysis catheter placement. The thrombus formed in AV access consists of a soft, friable clot that disintegrates easily in the venous outflow and a firm fibrin plug near the anastomosis. The article mentions that there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies to prevent access thrombosis, and the long-term effects of anti-platelet therapy and warfarin on access patency remain unclear.

To avoid delays in dialysis treatment and catheter placement, thrombosed access should be treated promptly. Thrombectomy, the removal of thrombus, is less likely to be successful when fresh thrombus hardens into adherent thrombus in the native vein of an AVF. Thrombectomy in AVF should be performed within days, while thrombectomy in AVG can still be successful up to a week.

The article highlights the evolution of thrombectomy techniques, with endovascular thrombectomy becoming the standard of care for thrombosed access. Under imaging guidance, not only can the thrombus be removed, but underlying anatomical abnormalities such as stenoses can also be treated. The success rates of endovascular thrombectomy for thrombosed fistula or graft range from 70% to 90%, as reported by prior studies. The article notes that the number of endovascular access thrombectomy procedures has significantly increased in the past 20 years.

The objective of this article is to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The authors conducted a literature search of electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, to gather relevant information for this review article. The article follows the Narrative Review reporting checklist for its structure and presentation.
