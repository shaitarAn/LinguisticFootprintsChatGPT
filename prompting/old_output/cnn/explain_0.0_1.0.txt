This news article is about a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac from Florida who planned to carry out a terrorist attack in Tampa. He intended to use explosives and weapons to cause chaos and harm Americans. However, his plot was foiled thanks to the local Muslim community and law enforcement.

Osmakac believed he had an operable AK-47, real explosives, an explosive pack, and a car bomb that he planned to use against Americans. He was charged with attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.

According to the criminal complaint, Osmakac expressed his desire for revenge against wrongs done to Muslims in a martyrdom video message recorded before his arrest. The local Muslim community played a crucial role in alerting authorities about Osmakac's ideology and intentions.

Law enforcement officials stated that there is no evidence linking Osmakac to al Qaeda or any other terrorist organization. They believe he was self-radicalized.

The investigation into Osmakac began when someone informed the FBI that he had asked for al Qaeda flags. Over time, he discussed potential targets for terror attacks in Tampa and sought help from an undercover FBI employee in acquiring guns and explosives.

Osmakac allegedly planned to target nightclubs in the Ybor City area of Tampa, the operations center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, and a business in South Tampa. His primary target later became an Irish bar where large crowds were expected.

After carrying out a car bombing at his chosen location, Osmakac planned on retrieving additional weapons from a hotel room so that he could continue with hostage-taking as part of his attack strategy. He wanted the FBI to release prisoners as part of his demands.

Fortunately, law enforcement arrested Osmakac just after he made a video explaining his motives for carrying out this attack. The U.S attorney emphasized that thanks to tips from local Muslims and their collaboration with law enforcement, the community was not in real danger.

Overall, this article highlights the importance of community involvement and law enforcement efforts in preventing potential acts of terrorism.
