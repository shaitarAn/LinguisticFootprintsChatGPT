This news article discusses the arrest of a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac in Tampa, Florida. Osmakac was planning to carry out a terrorist attack using explosives and weapons. The plot was foiled thanks to the alertness of the local Muslim community and law enforcement.

According to the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Florida, Robert O'Neill, Osmakac believed he had an operable AK-47 rifle, real explosives, and an explosive pack that he intended to use against Americans. The charges brought against him include attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.

Osmakac allegedly expressed his desire for revenge for perceived wrongs done to Muslims in a martyrdom video recorded shortly before his arrest. He wanted "payback" and claimed that dying in an Islamic way would be preferable.

The investigation into Osmakac began based on information received from a confidential human source who reported that Osmakac had asked for al Qaeda flags. This led authorities to discover his plans and monitor his activities.

The assistance provided by members of the local Muslim community during the investigation was deemed significant by Steve Ibison, head of the FBI's Tampa office. He emphasized that this case should not be seen as representative of Islam or Muslims but rather as an individual committing a crime.

Law enforcement officials state that there is no evidence linking Osmakac to al Qaeda or any other terrorist organization at this time. They believe he became radicalized on his own through online sources - he is described as "self-radicalized."

In December, during interactions with undercover FBI employees, it was revealed that Osmakac planned attacks on nightclubs in Tampa's Ybor City area along with targets such as law enforcement offices and businesses in South Tampa. His intent included taking hostages after causing explosions using a car bomb followed by detonation via a suicide belt he planned to wear.

The actions of local Muslims and law enforcement prevented the attack from occurring. The FBI ensured that the explosives and firearms allegedly sought by Osmakac were rendered inoperable, and he was arrested just after he made a video explaining his motives.

The U.S. attorney acknowledges that without the intervention of the Muslim community and law enforcement, there could have been significant casualties.
