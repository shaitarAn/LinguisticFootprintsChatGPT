This news article is about a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac from Florida who planned to carry out a terrorist attack in Tampa. He intended to use explosives and weapons to cause chaos and harm to Americans. However, thanks to the cooperation of the local Muslim community and law enforcement, his plot was foiled.

Osmakac, who was born in Kosovo and later became a naturalized American citizen, had plans to carry out a car bombing followed by taking hostages and detonating a suicide belt. He expressed his desire for revenge against perceived wrongs done to Muslims in a video message recorded before his arrest.

The local Muslim community played a significant role in alerting law enforcement about Osmakac's dangerous ideology and intentions. The FBI received information about Osmakac's request for al Qaeda flags, which initiated the investigation. Eventually, an undercover FBI employee was introduced to Osmakac and helped gather evidence against him.

The FBI successfully rendered the explosives and firearms Osmakac sought inoperable, ensuring they posed no threat to the public. His intended targets included nightclubs, the operations center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, and a business in Tampa.

Osmakac's arrest occurred just after he made a video explaining his motives. Law enforcement officials praised the cooperation of the local Muslim community in preventing a potential tragedy. It is important to note that there is no evidence suggesting Osmakac had any direct ties to al Qaeda, and he appears to have self-radicalized.

Overall, this news article highlights the importance of community engagement, cooperation, and law enforcement efforts in preventing potential acts of terrorism.
