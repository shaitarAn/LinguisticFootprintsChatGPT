This clinical case is about a 21-year-old female patient who has been diagnosed with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). SWS is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the presence of a port wine birthmark on the face, abnormal blood vessel formation in the brain, and sometimes in the eye as well.

The patient has been experiencing frequent non-pulsating headaches for the past two years. These headaches are relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and do not worsen with physical activity. There are no accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura. The headaches last for hours and have a bilateral, generalized, and pressing quality.

The patient also has a history of seizures, which started when she was just 15 days old. These seizures were described as attacks of tonic-clonic contractions. At the age of 6, she underwent a callosotomy, which is a surgical procedure to control seizures by cutting the connections between the two hemispheres of the brain. However, at the age of 18, she had another seizure during a laser treatment for her port wine birthmark.

After this incident, she was prescribed carbamazepine, an anti-seizure medication, and has not had a seizure since then. However, her developmental progress has been delayed, and she has difficulty with literacy even though she had normal development in infancy. There is no significant family history of headache, except for her elder sister having a port wine birthmark.

On physical examination, a facial nevus (birthmark) is observed on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. She also has gingival overgrowth on the right side of her mouth, which is bright red and blanches upon pressure. There is mild asymmetry in her extremities, with the left arm and leg being slightly smaller and showing hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body) in both the upper and lower extremities.

Further evaluations reveal glaucoma in her right eye and signs of anxiety disorder upon psychiatric examination. Neurological examination is unremarkable except for the hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans show diffuse atrophy (shrinkage) in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications (abnormal calcium deposits) in the right occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI reveals multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures (enlarged blood vessels) on the right hemisphere along with diffuse atrophy. Axial T1 and T2 weighted MRI scans show various vascular formations in different locations within the brain.

The patient's cognitive abilities were assessed using a Proteus intelligence test, which indicated mild mental retardation, with a score of 75.

In summary, this case describes a young female patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome presenting with frequent headaches, seizures, developmental delay, a facial port wine birthmark, gingival overgrowth, hemiparesis, glaucoma, and abnormal findings on cranial imaging. The patient also has signs of anxiety disorder and is considered mildly mentally retarded based on cognitive testing.
