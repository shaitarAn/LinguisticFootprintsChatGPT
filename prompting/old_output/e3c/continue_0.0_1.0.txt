Upon further examination, the patient reported experiencing occasional visual disturbances such as blurred vision and sensitivity to light during her headaches. She also mentioned that the intensity of her headaches had been gradually increasing over the past few months. 

Physical examination revealed no abnormalities in her neurological status, including normal cranial nerve function and intact reflexes. However, a thorough evaluation of her skin revealed characteristic port-wine stain birthmarks on the right side of her face and scalp, consistent with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS). 

Given her history of seizures in infancy and now presenting with chronic headaches, a comprehensive workup was initiated to assess the extent of SWS involvement and determine appropriate management strategies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were ordered to evaluate for any structural abnormalities in the brain.

The MRI results showed evidence of leptomeningeal angioma involving both cerebral hemispheres on the affected side, confirming a diagnosis of SWS-related encephalopathy. This finding explained both her seizures in infancy and current headache symptoms.

To manage her chronic headaches associated with SWS, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted involving neurology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and pain management specialists. The patient was started on prophylactic medication targeting migraine prevention along with lifestyle modifications such as stress reduction techniques and regular sleep patterns.

Additionally, she was referred to an ophthalmologist for regular eye examinations due to potential complications associated with SWS affecting ocular structures. Genetic counseling was also recommended for future family planning considerations given the potential genetic component associated with this syndrome.

Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor treatment response and adjust medications if necessary. The patient's quality of life improved significantly over time as she experienced fewer headache episodes while managing other aspects related to SWS effectively.

This case highlights the importance of recognizing headache symptoms in patients diagnosed with Sturge-Weber Syndrome early on to provide appropriate interventions promptly. A comprehensive approach involving various medical specialties is crucial in managing the complex manifestations of this rare neurocutaneous disorder.
