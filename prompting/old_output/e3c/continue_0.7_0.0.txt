Upon further examination, the patient reported experiencing episodes of facial flushing and sweating on the affected side of her face, which coincided with the headaches. These episodes typically lasted for several minutes and occurred multiple times a day. The patient also mentioned having visual disturbances, such as blurry vision and sensitivity to light, during these episodes.

Physical examination revealed a port-wine stain (nevus flammeus) on the right side of her face, which extended to the scalp. Additionally, there were multiple angiomatous lesions on the same side of her face. Neurological examination was otherwise unremarkable, with no focal deficits noted.

Based on her clinical presentation and history, a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) was confirmed. SWS is a rare neurocutaneous disorder characterized by the presence of facial capillary malformations (port-wine stain) and leptomeningeal angiomas. It is typically associated with neurological manifestations, including seizures and cognitive impairments.

To further assess the extent and impact of the disease, additional investigations were performed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed leptomeningeal enhancement over the right cerebral hemisphere, confirming the presence of the characteristic leptomeningeal angioma. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed abnormal epileptiform discharges, consistent with the patient's history of seizures.

Treatment for SWS involves a multidisciplinary approach, addressing both the neurological and dermatological manifestations. Antiepileptic medications were initiated to control the patient's seizure activity. As the headaches were non-pulsating and responded well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, a diagnosis of tension-type headache was made. Lifestyle modifications, stress management techniques, and regular exercise were recommended to help reduce the frequency and severity of headaches.

In addition to the medical management, the patient was referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation and management of the port-wine stain. Laser therapy was discussed as a possible option for improving the appearance of the facial vascular malformation.

The patient was provided with education regarding the long-term implications of SWS, including the potential for neurological and cognitive deficits. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor her symptoms, adjust medications if necessary, and provide ongoing support and guidance.

Overall, the management of this 21-year-old female patient with SWS focused on addressing her neurological symptoms, specifically seizures and headaches, while also considering the dermatological manifestations. By implementing a comprehensive and collaborative approach, the goal was to improve her quality of life and minimize the impact of this complex condition.
