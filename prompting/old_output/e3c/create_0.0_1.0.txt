Clinical Case: A 25-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) presenting with chronic headaches was admitted to our clinic. He had a history of recurrent non-pulsating headaches for the past 3 years. The headaches were not exacerbated by physical activity and responded well to over-the-counter pain relievers. There were no associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or visual disturbances.

The patient had a significant medical history of seizures since childhood, which led to his diagnosis of NF1 at the age of 5. His seizures were characterized by generalized tonic-clonic contractions and were initially controlled with antiepileptic medications. However, at the age of 18, he experienced a seizure following a surgical procedure to remove neurofibromas from his face.

Since then, he has been on carbamazepine 600 mg daily for seizure control without any further episodes. Despite having normal developmental milestones during infancy and early childhood, his academic performance has been below average throughout his education.

Family history was unremarkable except for his younger brother who also had features suggestive of NF1 but did not undergo formal diagnostic evaluation. The patient was currently prescribed sertraline 100 mg daily for anxiety disorder and ibuprofen as needed for headache relief.

On physical examination, multiple café-au-lait macules were observed on various parts of his body along with cutaneous neurofibromas scattered across his trunk and extremities. Intraoral examination revealed gingival hypertrophy predominantly on the right side, appearing reddish in color with blanching upon pressure application - indicative of angiomatous enlargement.

Neurological examination revealed mild weakness in the left upper and lower extremities consistent with hemiparesis. Ophthalmological evaluation showed no abnormalities related to glaucoma or other ocular manifestations commonly seen in NF1 patients.

Imaging studies including cranial CT and MRI scans were performed. The CT scan showed no significant abnormalities, while the MRI revealed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular cortical calcifications in the right occipital region. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI demonstrated dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere, along with diffuse atrophy on the same side.

Psychometric testing using an intelligence quotient (IQ) test indicated a score of 70, consistent with mild intellectual disability. The patient was referred to a multidisciplinary team for further evaluation and management of his neurofibromatosis-related symptoms.

In summary, this case presents a 25-year-old male patient with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 who presented with chronic headaches. His clinical features included café-au-lait macules, cutaneous neurofibromas, gingival hypertrophy, hemiparesis, and intellectual disability. Imaging studies revealed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere along with irregular cortical calcifications and dilated pial venous vascular structures. A comprehensive management plan involving various specialties was initiated to address his neurological symptoms and overall well-being.
