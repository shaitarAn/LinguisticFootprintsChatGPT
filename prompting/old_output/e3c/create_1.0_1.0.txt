A 24-year-old male patient, Mr. J, presented to our clinic with a chief complaint of recurrent non-pulsating headaches. He had been experiencing these headaches for the past three years, which were typically relieved by over-the-counter painkillers. The pain was not aggravated by physical activity and did not accompany nausea or any other aura-like symptoms.

Upon further evaluation of his medical history, it was noted that Mr. J had a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) at the age of 12 due to seizures he experienced in infancy. These seizures were described as tonic-clonic contractions and led to his initial diagnosis of SWS.

At the age of 16, Mr. J underwent callosotomy surgery to control his seizures successfully. However, when he turned 22 and underwent laser treatment for his port wine birthmark on his right facial side, he experienced a seizure for the first time since the callosotomy procedure.

Following this episode, Mr. J was prescribed carbamazepine at a daily dose of 400 mg, which effectively controlled further seizures without recurrence.

In addition to his neurological symptoms, it became apparent that there were developmental delays and intellectual impairments in Mr. J's educational history from childhood until present day. While he showed normal development during infancy, he struggled academically throughout elementary school and has limited literacy skills currently.

Furthermore careful assessment indicated Mr.J's family history also included an elder sister with a facial port wine stain similar to him but no other features associated with SWS were noticed on her face nor was she examined or tested formally regarding this matter previously.
 
Mr.J had also been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder; therefore he was prescribed ketiapin at a daily dose of 25 mg along with venlafaxine at 75 mg daily for management purposes which partly reduced anxiety but did not decrease headache frequency significantly over one week in spite of NSAID medications. 

During his physical examination, notable findings included a port wine stain on his right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek - consistent with choroidal angioma development due to SWS. Furthermore he exhibited gingival overgrowth on the right side of his mouth; it appeared bright red in color and showed blanching upon pressure application.

In terms of his limb symmetry, Mr. J displayed mild asymmetry with his left arm and leg slightly smaller in proportion compared to their counterparts on the right side. Hemiparesis was also evident bilaterally in both the upper and lower extremities.

An ophthalmological evaluation revealed glaucoma affecting the right eye while other neurologic examinations were largely unremarkable except for persistent hemiparesis.

Cranial CT scans exhibited diffuse atrophy within the brain's right hemisphere accompanied by irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications located in the occipital area of that same hemisphere.

Furthermore an MRI scan utilizing gadolinium enhancement showed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures within the affected right hemisphere along with accompanying diffuse atrophy as observed initially. Axial T1-weighted cranial MRI illustrated increased thickness in calvaria limited to intersides favoring tendency toward enlargement particularly when compared with this patient's contralateral structure (left) besides identifying an overall asymmetrical smaller size exhibited by Mr.J's affected (right) hemisphere compared to its counterpart (left). Also T2-weighted MRI highlighted extensive venous formations around the corpus region adjacent to lateral ventricle's on its corresponding affected area beside widespread vascular formations observable at perivascular space located anteriorly to third ventricle situated at Willis polygon region whereas other areas indicating presence of a similar kind issue are detected at metastasis across herniated veins at quadrigeminal cistern location positioned adjacent to temporal-occipital section located towards the right hemisphere side.

Cognitive assessment using a proteus intelligence test measured Mr. J's intellectual functioning, indicating his score to be 75, which is consistent with a diagnosis of mild mental retardation.

In conclusion, Mr. J, a patient diagnosed with Sturge-Weber syndrome and presenting with recurrent non-pulsating headaches alongside associated neurological and cognitive impairments, requires comprehensive management to address all aspects of his condition effectively. A multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, psychiatry, ophthalmology, and supportive therapeutic interventions is recommended to optimize his quality of life while managing his complex medical needs.
