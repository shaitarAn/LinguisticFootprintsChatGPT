A 25-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) presented to our clinic with complaints of chronic headaches. He reported experiencing non-pulsating headaches for the past 3 years, which were typically relieved with over-the-counter pain medications. The headaches were not worsened by physical activity and did not present with any associated symptoms such as nausea or aura. They would last for several hours and were described as bilateral, generalized, and pressing in quality.

The patient had a significant medical history of seizures, which started in infancy. His seizures were characterized by tonic-clonic contractions and led to the diagnosis of SWS. At the age of 6, he underwent a callosotomy procedure to control his seizures. However, at 18 years old, he experienced a seizure following a laser treatment aimed at removing a port wine birthmark. Since then, he has been prescribed carbamazepine 400 mg daily, which effectively controlled his seizures.

Developmentally, the patient had a normal infancy, but his parents reported difficulties in academic achievements. He struggled to graduate from elementary school and has limited literacy skills. There was no significant family history of SWS, except for his elder sister who also had a port wine stain on her face. No further investigations were conducted regarding her birthmark.

Apart from the seizures and chronic headaches, the patient was also diagnosed with anxiety disorder. Currently, he is prescribed ketiapin 25 mg and venlafaxine 75 mg daily to manage his anxiety symptoms and chronic headaches. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were also included in his treatment regimen.

During the physical examination, a facial nevus was observed on the patient's forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. Furthermore, an intraoral examination revealed angiomatous enlargement characterized by bright red gingival overgrowth on the right side, which showed blanching upon pressure application. Asymmetry was noted in the patient's extremities, with the left arm and leg appearing slightly smaller and exhibiting hemiparesis of the same size. An ophthalmological evaluation confirmed glaucoma in the right eye.

Psychiatric examination revealed signs consistent with anxiety disorder, while neurological examination showed no remarkable findings except for the observed hemiparesis. Cranial computed tomography (CT) scans displayed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere, along with irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere, as well as diffuse atrophy on the same side. Further MRI imaging revealed right calvarial thickness compared to the left, asymmetrically smaller right hemisphere, extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle, and widespread vascular formations in various localizations.

To assess the patient's cognitive abilities, a proteus intelligence test was performed, resulting in a score of 75 points, which indicated mild mental retardation.

In summary, a 25-year-old male patient with Sturge-Weber Syndrome presented with chronic headaches, seizures, anxiety disorder, and various physical manifestations of the condition. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of vascular abnormalities and atrophy in the right hemisphere of the brain. Treatment involves the use of anti-seizure medications, anxiety management, and symptomatic relief for headaches.
