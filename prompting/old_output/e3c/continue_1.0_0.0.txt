Upon further examination, the patient revealed that she also experienced visual disturbances during her seizures, including flashing lights and blurred vision. The seizures were well-controlled with antiepileptic medication, and she hadn't experienced any seizure activity since adolescence.

Physical examination of the patient did not reveal any abnormal findings. Neurological examination, including cranial nerve examination, was within normal limits. There were no signs of neurocutaneous abnormalities, such as port-wine stains or facial asymmetry, typically associated with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS).

Given the patient's history of headaches and seizures, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted to determine the possible etiology of her headache. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, which showed leptomeningeal enhancement in the right parietooccipital region, consistent with the characteristic findings of SWS.

Based on her clinical presentation and imaging findings, a diagnosis of SWS with secondary headache disorder was established. The patient's headaches were classified as tension-type headaches, given the bilateral, pressing pain, absence of accompanying symptoms, and response to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Treatment options were discussed with the patient, focusing on both acute symptomatic relief and preventive measures. In addition to continuing her current antiepileptic medication regimen, she was prescribed a low-dose tricyclic antidepressant as a prophylactic treatment for her headaches. Education regarding triggers, stress management techniques, and relaxation exercises was also provided.

Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor the patient's response to treatment and assess the need for any adjustments. It was emphasized that a multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, ophthalmology, and dermatology would be essential for managing her condition comprehensively.

Additionally, the patient was referred to a support group for individuals with SWS and their families to provide psychosocial support and share experiences with others facing similar challenges.

Overall, the aim of her treatment plan was to optimize control of her seizures, reduce the frequency and intensity of her headaches, and enhance her overall quality of life. The patient expressed gratitude for the comprehensive care provided and expressed hope for improved symptom management and long-term outcomes.
