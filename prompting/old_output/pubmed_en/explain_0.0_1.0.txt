This article is a narrative review that discusses the use of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The abstract provides an overview of the content covered in the article.

The introduction section further explains that arteriovenous access is crucial for patients with ESRD to receive hemodialysis. However, thrombosis of AV access can lead to delays in treatment or even abandonment of access, requiring dialysis catheter placement. In recent years, endovascular approaches have become the preferred treatment option for thrombosed access over surgery.

The article describes various interventions used in endovascular thrombectomy techniques, including removing thrombus from the AV circuit and treating underlying anatomical abnormalities such as stenosis. Thrombolysis, which involves dissolving blood clots using fibrinolytic agents, and mechanical removal of clots through embolectomy balloon catheters or other devices are discussed. Adjunctive methods like cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon angioplasty, and stent placement are also mentioned.

Complications associated with these procedures are highlighted, including vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain.

The authors conducted a literature search using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar to gather information for this narrative review. They emphasize that understanding thrombectomy techniques and their potential complications is essential for managing patients with thrombosed AV access.

The introduction also provides some background information on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its increasing prevalence worldwide. Hemodialysis is commonly used as a renal replacement modality for ESRD patients. Compared to central venous catheters, AVF and AVG are preferred due to lower risks of hospitalization and mortality. Catheter-dependent patients have poorer outcomes and increased risks of sepsis and bacteremia.

However, maintaining long-term vascular access patency requires frequent interventions, which can burden healthcare resources and impact patients' quality of life, morbidity, and mortality.

Thrombosis is identified as the leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG cases. The article mentions the thrombosis rates for AVF and AVG based on previous studies. Various factors contribute to access thrombosis, including underlying venous or arterial stenoses, systemic factors like hypercoagulability or low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications resulting in hematomas.

The consequences of thrombosed access are discussed in terms of treatment delays, omissions, hospital admissions, and the need for dialysis catheter placement. The composition of thrombus formed in AV access is explained as a soft clot that disintegrates easily in the venous outflow along with a firm fibrin plug near the anastomosis.

The article highlights that there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies to prevent access thrombosis effectively. Thrombectomy should be performed promptly to avoid treatment delays or catheter placement when fresh thrombus hardens into adherent thrombus.

Historically surgical procedures were used for thrombectomy but with advancements in intravascular techniques endovascular approaches have become standard care. These techniques allow not only removal of clots but also treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities using imaging guidance.

The success rates for endovascular approach range from 70% to 90% based on prior studies mentioned in the article. The number of endovascular access thrombectomy procedures has significantly increased over time.

Overall, this narrative review aims to provide an overview of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for treating thrombosed AVGs and AVFs.
