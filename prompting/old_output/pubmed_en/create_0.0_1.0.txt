Introduction:

Thrombosis of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who rely on hemodialysis for renal replacement therapy. The occurrence of access thrombosis can lead to delays in hemodialysis treatment, necessitate hospitalization, and even result in the abandonment of the access site, requiring the placement of dialysis catheters. As such, effective management strategies for maintaining access patency are crucial to ensure uninterrupted hemodialysis and improve patient outcomes.

Traditionally, surgical thrombectomy has been employed as the primary treatment option for thrombosed AV access. However, with advancements in endovascular techniques, endovascular thrombectomy has emerged as the preferred approach due to its minimally invasive nature and favorable outcomes. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for treating thrombosed AVGs and AVFs.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is steadily increasing worldwide, contributing significantly to the global burden of disease. Hemodialysis remains the most common renal replacement modality for patients with ESRD. Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts (AVGs), compared to central venous catheters, are preferred vascular accesses due to their lower risk of hospitalization and mortality rates. Catheter-dependent patients often experience poorer outcomes characterized by an increased risk of sepsis and bacteremia.

However, long-term maintenance of vascular accesses poses challenges as they frequently require interventions to sustain patency over time. Access thrombosis accounts for a substantial proportion—65%–85%—of cases resulting in access loss among AVF and AVG patients. Thrombotic events occur at a rate of 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days for AVFs and 0.2 events per patient during a two-year follow-up for AVGs. Underlying venous or arterial anastomotic stenoses are common causes of access thrombosis, while systemic factors such as hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications further contribute to the risk.

The consequences of thrombosed access extend beyond treatment delays and omissions; they often necessitate inpatient admissions and may ultimately lead to the abandonment of the access site, requiring dialysis catheter placement. Thrombi formed within arteriovenous (AV) accesses consist of soft, friable clots that disintegrate easily in the venous outflow and firm fibrin plugs near the anastomosis. Currently, no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies exist to prevent access thrombosis effectively.

Early intervention is crucial in managing thrombosed AV accesses to avoid delays in dialysis treatment and catheter placement. Thrombectomy procedures have traditionally been performed surgically; however, with advancements in intravascular techniques guided by imaging modalities such as ultrasound or angiography, endovascular thrombectomy has become the standard of care for treating thrombosed accesses. This approach not only allows for mechanical removal of thrombus but also enables simultaneous treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities contributing to stenoses.

Previous studies have reported success rates ranging from 70%–90% for endovascular approaches in treating thrombosed fistulas or grafts. Over the past two decades, there has been a significant increase in endovascular access thrombectomy procedures performed for both AVFs and AVGs.

In this narrative review article, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of current practices regarding endovascular techniques employed for treating thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. Additionally, we will discuss outcomes associated with these techniques, as well as potential complications. The information presented in this review is based on a thorough literature search conducted using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar.
