This article is a narrative review that discusses the use of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The abstract provides an overview of the article's content, highlighting the importance of maintaining access patency in ESRD patients receiving hemodialysis and the complications associated with access thrombosis.

The introduction section further emphasizes the significance of arteriovenous (AV) access in allowing ESRD patients to receive hemodialysis. It explains that thrombosis of AV access can lead to delays in hemodialysis or the need for dialysis catheter placement. The endovascular approach has become the preferred treatment option for thrombosed access, replacing surgery. The section also mentions the various interventions used in endovascular thrombectomy, including thrombolysis (dissolving thrombus) and thrombectomy (mechanical removal of thrombus). Additionally, adjunctive methods such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon angioplasty, and stent placement are used to treat stenoses in the AV circuit. The section concludes by highlighting the potential complications associated with these procedures.

The article is based on a literature search from electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar. It emphasizes the importance of understanding thrombectomy techniques and their potential complications in managing patients with thrombosed AV access. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing globally, and hemodialysis is the most common renal replacement modality for ESRD patients. Compared to central venous catheters, AVFs and AVGs are preferred due to lower hospitalization risk and mortality. However, maintaining access patency requires frequent interventions, impacting patients' quality of life and overall outcomes.

Thrombosis is the leading cause of access loss in AVFs and AVGs, accounting for a significant proportion of cases. The article discusses the rates of thrombosis for AVFs and AVGs and highlights the underlying causes, including venous or arterial anastomotic stenoses and systemic factors. Thrombosed access leads to treatment delays, omissions, and inpatient admissions, necessitating dialysis catheter placement. The article also mentions the composition of thrombus in AV access and the lack of FDA-approved pharmacological therapies for preventing access thrombosis.

The section further explains the importance of timely treatment for thrombosed access, with thrombectomy being less successful as thrombus hardens. Surgical thrombectomy used to be the standard treatment, but endovascular thrombectomy has now become the preferred approach. It allows for the removal of thrombus and treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities under imaging guidance. The success rates of endovascular thrombectomy for thrombosed AVFs and AVGs range from 70% to 90%. The article concludes by stating its aim to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for thrombosed AVFs and AVGs.

Overall, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the use of endovascular thrombectomy techniques in maintaining access patency in ESRD patients. It highlights the importance of timely treatment and discusses the various interventions and potential complications associated with these procedures.
