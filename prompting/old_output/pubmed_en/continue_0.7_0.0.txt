Thrombectomy has emerged as a preferred approach for the maintenance of access in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who rely on arteriovenous (AV) access for hemodialysis. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of current practices and outcomes associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs).

AV access plays a crucial role in allowing ESRD patients to receive life-sustaining hemodialysis. However, thrombosis of the AV access can significantly impact the patient's treatment, resulting in delayed hemodialysis or even abandonment of the access, necessitating the placement of a dialysis catheter. To address this issue, endovascular approaches have gained prominence over surgical interventions in the treatment of thrombosed AV access.

The primary objectives of endovascular thrombectomy techniques are twofold. Firstly, the removal of thrombus from the AV circuit is crucial to restore blood flow and ensure the proper functioning of the access. Secondly, addressing the underlying anatomical abnormalities, such as stenosis at the anastomotic site, is important to prevent future thrombosis.

Thrombolysis, the process of dissolving thrombus, is one of the key techniques employed in endovascular thrombectomy. This is achieved through the use of infusion catheters or pulse injector devices, which deliver fibrinolytic agents to the site of thrombosis. By promoting the dissolution of the thrombus, thrombolysis restores blood flow and facilitates the subsequent removal of the remaining thrombus.

In addition to thrombolysis, mechanical removal of thrombus, known as thrombectomy, also plays a vital role in the endovascular management of thrombosed AV access. Various devices and techniques are employed for thrombectomy, including embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic mechanisms, and aspiration methods. These techniques allow for the physical removal of thrombus, ensuring optimal blood flow and functional AV access.

Furthermore, adjunctive methods, such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement, are often employed to address stenoses within the AV circuit. These interventions aim to improve the patency and longevity of the AV access by addressing underlying anatomical abnormalities.

While endovascular thrombectomy techniques have demonstrated promising outcomes in the management of thrombosed AV access, it is essential to be aware of potential complications associated with these procedures. Vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain are among the reported complications. Careful consideration of the patient's overall health, comorbidities, and anatomical factors is necessary to mitigate these risks effectively.

This narrative review article draws upon a comprehensive literature search conducted using electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar. By synthesizing the available evidence, this review aims to enhance our understanding of thrombectomy techniques and their potential complications in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

In conclusion, thrombectomy plays a crucial role in the maintenance of AV access in the end-stage renal disease population. Endovascular techniques, including thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, offer effective solutions for restoring blood flow and addressing anatomical abnormalities. Understanding the nuances of these techniques and their potential complications is essential for healthcare professionals involved in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access.
