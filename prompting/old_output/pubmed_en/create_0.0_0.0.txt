Introduction:

Thrombosis of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who rely on hemodialysis for renal replacement therapy. The occurrence of access thrombosis can lead to delays in hemodialysis treatment, necessitate hospitalization, and even result in the abandonment of the access site, requiring the placement of a dialysis catheter. As a result, maintaining the patency of vascular access is crucial for the effective management of ESRD patients.

Traditionally, surgical thrombectomy has been the standard treatment for thrombosed access. However, with advancements in endovascular techniques, endovascular thrombectomy has emerged as the preferred approach due to its minimally invasive nature and favorable outcomes. Endovascular thrombectomy involves the mechanical removal of thrombus from the AV circuit, along with the treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities such as stenoses. Various methods, including embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms, are employed for thrombus removal. Additionally, adjunctive techniques such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement are utilized to address stenoses in the AV circuit.

This narrative review aims to provide an overview of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The review is based on a comprehensive literature search conducted in electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar. By examining the existing evidence, this review seeks to enhance our understanding of thrombectomy techniques and their implications in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally has contributed to the growing burden of ESRD. Hemodialysis remains the most common renal replacement modality for ESRD patients, with AVFs and AVGs being the preferred vascular access options due to their lower risk of hospitalization and mortality compared to central venous catheters. However, the maintenance of long-term vascular access patency poses a significant challenge, requiring frequent interventions that not only strain healthcare resources but also impact patients' quality of life, morbidity, and mortality.

Thrombosis is the leading cause of access loss in AVFs and AVGs, accounting for a substantial proportion of cases. The thrombosis rate for AVFs is reported to be 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days, while AVG thrombosis occurs at a rate of 0.2 events per patient during a 2-year follow-up. Access thrombosis is commonly attributed to underlying venous or arterial anastomotic stenoses, with systemic factors such as hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications further increasing the risk. Thrombosed access not only leads to delays and omissions in hemodialysis treatment but also necessitates inpatient admissions and may ultimately result in the abandonment of the access site.

To date, no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies have demonstrated consistent efficacy in preventing access thrombosis. Therefore, prompt and effective treatment of thrombosed access is crucial to avoid delays in dialysis treatment and the need for catheter placement. Thrombectomy, either through mechanical removal or dissolution of the thrombus, has emerged as a viable approach. However, the success of thrombectomy largely depends on the timing of intervention, with thrombectomy in AVFs ideally performed within days of thrombus formation, while thrombectomy in AVGs can still yield favorable outcomes up to a week later.

With the increasing utilization of endovascular techniques, the number of endovascular access thrombectomy procedures has significantly risen over the past two decades. Procedure success rates for thrombosed AVFs and AVGs range from 70% to 90% when employing an endovascular approach. However, these procedures are not without risks, as complications such as vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain can occur.

In conclusion, this narrative review provides a comprehensive overview of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. By synthesizing the available evidence, this review aims to enhance our understanding of thrombectomy techniques and their implications in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access.
