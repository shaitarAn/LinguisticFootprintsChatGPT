Introduction

Thrombosis of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis. These thrombotic events not only lead to delays in hemodialysis treatment but may also result in the need for dialysis catheter placement or even abandonment of access. Therefore, effective management strategies are crucial for the maintenance of access patency and optimal patient outcomes.

Traditionally, surgical thrombectomy has been employed for the treatment of thrombosed AV access. However, with advancements in endovascular techniques, endovascular thrombectomy has emerged as a preferred approach due to its effectiveness and minimally invasive nature. Endovascular interventions involve the removal of thrombus from the AV circuit and concurrent treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities contributing to the development of stenoses.

Thrombolysis, achieved through infusion catheters or pulse injector devices delivering fibrinolytic agents, as well as mechanical thrombus removal techniques such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic devices, and aspiration mechanisms have shown promising results in restoring access patency among ESRD patients. Additionally, adjunctive methods including cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon angioplasty (DCB), and stent placement hold potential for treating stenoses within the AV circuit.

Despite these advancements improving clinical outcomes related to thrombotic events in ESRD patients' AV accesses, complications associated with these procedures need careful consideration. Vessel rupture, arterial embolism including pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain are among potential complications that must be addressed during interventions.

Given that chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence is on the rise globally resulting in an increased burden for healthcare systems worldwide; hemodialysis remains a primary modality for patients with ESRD. Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts (AVGs) are favored over central venous catheters for chronic hemodialysis treatment due to reduced hospitalization risk and improved overall survival rates. However, the maintenance of adequate access patency represents a significant challenge necessitating frequent interventions, impacting patients' quality of life and contributing to morbidity and mortality.

Notably, thrombosis accounts for a majority of access loss in both AVFs and AVGs. The incidence rate of AVF-related thrombosis is reported as 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days, while AVG thrombotic events occur at a rate of 0.2 events per patient during two years of follow-up.

Several factors confer an increased risk of access thrombosis among ESRD patients including hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, as well as cannulation complications leading to hematoma formation.

The urgency for prompt treatment in cases of thrombosed accesses is underscored by the need to prevent delays in dialysis treatment initiation or catheter placement while fresh clot remains more amenable to successful mechanical removal interventions. Timeliness becomes especially critical when considering adherence or adherence-threatened fresh clot in native veins connected within an AVF which becomes resistant over time.

This narrative review article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current practices including endovascular techniques employed in the management of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. Furthermore, we will examine outcomes relating to these interventions as well as potential complications associated with their implementation based on findings drawn from extensive literature searches conducted through electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar.

By consolidating knowledge on effective thrombectomy approaches along with potential complications linked with the management strategies employed in this specific patient population characterized by advanced renal disease; this review seeks not only to enhance clinicians' understanding but also to facilitate informed decision-making regarding optimal management strategies conducive to successful outcomes and improved quality of life for ESRD patients.
