Thrombectomy techniques have become the preferred approach for maintaining access in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who require hemodialysis. This article aims to review the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for treating thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs).

Arteriovenous access is crucial for ESRD patients to receive hemodialysis, but when thrombosis occurs, it can lead to delays in treatment or even abandonment of the access, necessitating the placement of a dialysis catheter. In recent years, endovascular interventions have emerged as the preferred treatment option over surgery.

These interventions involve removing the thrombus from the AV circuit and addressing any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to its formation, such as anastomotic stenosis. Thrombolysis is one method used to dissolve the thrombus using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices that administer fibrinolytic agents.

Another technique is thrombectomy, which involves mechanically removing the thrombus using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic mechanisms, or aspiration methods. These approaches aim to restore blood flow through the AV access by physically extracting or disrupting the clot.

In addition to these primary techniques, adjunctive methods like cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon angioplasty (DCB), and stent placement are also employed to treat stenoses within the AV circuit. These procedures help address any underlying narrowing or blockages that may contribute to clot formation.

However, it's important to note that these procedures are not without risks. Complications can include vessel rupture during intervention, arterial embolism caused by dislodged fragments of clot traveling downstream in circulation leading potentially pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism reaching brain circulation.

To compile this narrative review, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. The aim was to gather relevant studies and articles that discuss thrombectomy techniques, outcomes, and potential complications associated with their use.

Understanding the various thrombectomy techniques available and their potential complications is crucial for healthcare professionals involved in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access. By staying informed about the latest practices and outcomes in this field, clinicians can make more informed decisions regarding treatment options for ESRD patients requiring hemodialysis.
