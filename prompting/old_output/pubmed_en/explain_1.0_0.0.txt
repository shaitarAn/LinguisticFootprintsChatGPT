This article is a narrative review that examines current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population.

The abstract begins by highlighting the importance of arteriovenous (AV) access for patients with ESRD to receive hemodialysis. Thrombosis, or the formation of blood clots, in AV access can result in delays in hemodialysis treatment or the need for dialysis catheter placement. The endovascular approach has become the preferred treatment option for thrombosed access, replacing surgery. Different interventions are described, including the removal of thrombus and treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities. Thrombectomy, or the mechanical removal of thrombus, can be performed using various devices. Additional methods such as balloon angioplasty and stent placement are also utilized to treat stenoses in the AV circuit.

The abstract mentions that complications of these procedures can include vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism, and paradoxical embolism. The review article is based on a literature search from electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar.

The introduction of the article discusses the increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally and the use of hemodialysis as the main renal replacement therapy for ESRD patients. AVF and AVG are preferred access methods compared to central venous catheters due to lower hospitalization risk and mortality. Catheter-dependent patients have worse outcomes with increased sepsis and bacteremia risk. However, maintaining the patency of long-term vascular accesses requires frequent interventions, impacting healthcare resources and patient quality of life.

The leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG is thrombosis, accounting for 65-85% of cases. Thrombosis rates for AVF and AVG are mentioned, along with systemic and mechanical factors that increase the risk of access thrombosis. The consequences of thrombosed access include treatment delays, omissions, inpatient admissions, and the need for dialysis catheter placement.

The article states that there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies to prevent access thrombosis, and the long-term effects of anti-platelet therapy and warfarin on access patency are unclear. It emphasizes the importance of prompt treatment of thrombosed access to avoid delays in dialysis treatment and catheter placement. Thrombectomy is more likely to be successful in AVFs if performed within days, while thrombectomy in AVGs can still be successful up to a week.

The development of endovascular techniques has made endovascular thrombectomy the standard of care for thrombosed access. This technique allows for the removal of thrombus and treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities under imaging guidance. The success rates of endovascular thrombectomy for thrombosed access range from 70-90%.

The article aims to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. It utilizes a literature search from electronic databases. The article complies with the Narrative Review reporting checklist.

Overall, this article provides an overview of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for thrombosed access in the ESRD population, including their advantages, potential complications, and success rates. It highlights the importance of prompt treatment to avoid complications and improve patient outcomes.
