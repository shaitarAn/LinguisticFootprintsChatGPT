This introduction begins by highlighting the increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally and its impact on the burden of disease. It then focuses on hemodialysis as the most common treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), specifically discussing the preferred access methods for chronic hemodialysis treatment - arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) - due to their lower risk of hospitalization and mortality compared to central venous catheters. The introduction also mentions the poorer outcomes associated with catheter-dependent patients, including an increased risk of sepsis and bacteremia.

The introduction goes on to highlight the challenges of maintaining long-term vascular access patency, including the frequent interventions required, the burden on healthcare resources, and the impact on patients' quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. Thrombosis is identified as the leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG, accounting for the majority of cases. The factors contributing to access thrombosis are discussed, including underlying stenoses, systemic factors, and cannulation complications.

The consequences of thrombosed access are outlined, including delays and omissions in hemodialysis treatment, inpatient admissions, and the need for dialysis catheter placement. The composition of thrombus in AV access is described, and the lack of approved pharmacological therapies for preventing access thrombosis is emphasized. The timing and success rates of thrombectomy procedures for AVF and AVG are discussed, with a shift towards endovascular techniques in recent years.

Finally, the article states its aim to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The methodology of the review is briefly mentioned, indicating that it is based on a literature search of electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. The article also mentions that it follows the Narrative Review reporting checklist for structure and reporting.
