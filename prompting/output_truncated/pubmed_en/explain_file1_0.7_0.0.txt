The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on the rise globally and is contributing to the overall burden of disease. For patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hemodialysis is the most common treatment option, and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) are the preferred access methods for chronic hemodialysis due to their lower risks of hospitalization and mortality compared to central venous catheters.

Patients who are dependent on catheters for hemodialysis have poorer outcomes and are at an increased risk of sepsis and bacteremia. However, maintaining long-term vascular access, such as AVFs and AVGs, often requires frequent interventions to prevent access blockage, which not only puts a significant burden on healthcare resources but also affects patients' quality of life and can have implications on morbidity and mortality.

Thrombosis, or the formation of blood clots, is the leading cause of access loss in AVFs and AVGs, accounting for 65-85% of cases. The thrombosis rate for AVFs is 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days, while AVG thrombosis occurs at a rate of 0.2 events per patient during a 2-year follow-up. Access thrombosis is commonly caused by stenoses (narrowing) in the veins or arteries where the access is created. Certain systemic factors, such as hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications resulting in hematomas, can increase the risk of access thrombosis.

Thrombosed access not only leads to delays in hemodialysis treatment but also requires inpatient admissions and may result in the abandonment of the access, necessitating dialysis catheter placement. Thrombi formed in AV accesses consist of two components: a soft, friable clot that easily disintegrates in the venous outflow, and a firm fibrin plug near the anastomosis (connection point). Currently, there are no pharmacological therapies approved by the FDA to prevent access thrombosis, and the long-term effects of anti-platelet therapy and warfarin on access patency are still unclear.

To avoid delays in dialysis treatment and catheter placement, thrombosed access should be treated as soon as possible. However, when fresh thrombus hardens and becomes adherent in the native vein of an AVF, the success of thrombectomy (removal of the clot) becomes less likely. Thrombectomy in AVFs should ideally be performed within days, while thrombectomy in AVGs can still be successful up to a week.

In the past, surgical thrombectomy, which requires hospitalization and operation room resources, was the standard treatment for thrombosed AV accesses. However, with the development of intravascular techniques, endovascular thrombectomy has become the preferred approach. Using imaging guidance, not only can the thrombus be removed, but underlying anatomical abnormalities, such as stenoses, can also be addressed. Previous studies have reported success rates ranging from 70% to 90% for endovascular thrombectomy of thrombosed AVFs and AVGs.

Over the past two decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of endovascular access thrombectomy procedures for AVFs and AVGs. This article aims to review the current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The review is based on a comprehensive literature search of electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar.
