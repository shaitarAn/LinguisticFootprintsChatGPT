The adenosinergic machinery in cancer refers to the complex network of signaling pathways involving adenosine and its receptors in the context of tumor immunity. Adenosine, a nucleoside, acts as an immune modulator in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and has been shown to play a significant role in regulating immune responses in cancer.

Extracellular adenosine (eADO) is primarily derived from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP). eATP is released into the extracellular space during cellular stress or cell death, triggered by various factors such as hypoxia, inflammation, or nutrient starvation. eATP has been demonstrated to have a pro-inflammatory effect by binding and activating P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y), thereby contributing to the immune response in the TME.

On the other hand, eADO, generated through the hydrolysis of eATP, exerts immunosuppressive effects by activating the P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) in immune cells. This activation of adenosine receptors dampens the immune response, resulting in immunosuppression in the TME. Therefore, the interplay between eADO and eATP levels, and their respective receptor activation, provides a unique mechanism to regulate immune surveillance within the TME.

This adenosinergic system is not limited to immune cells alone. Tumor cells and stromal cells within the TME also play a crucial role in modulating adenosine signaling. Tumor cells themselves can both produce and respond to adenosine, further influencing the tumor microenvironment. Stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, can also contribute to the adenosinergic signaling through the regulation of adenosine receptor expression.

Understanding the adenosinergic machinery in cancer is crucial for the development of targeted therapies in immuno-oncology. Manipulating adenosine receptor signaling could potentially enhance anti-tumor immune responses, providing a promising avenue for cancer treatment. Several approaches are being explored, including the use of adenosine receptor antagonists to block immunosuppressive signaling and adenosine receptor agonists to enhance anti-tumor immune responses.

In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the current understanding of the adenosinergic systems in various cell types within the TME, including immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells. We will discuss the potential novel directions for future adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology, highlighting the importance of targeting this intricate signaling network for effective cancer treatment.
