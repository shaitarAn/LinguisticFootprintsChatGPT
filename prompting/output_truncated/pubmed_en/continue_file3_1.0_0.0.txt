The adenosinergic machinery in cancer refers to the complex network of signaling pathways involving extracellular adenosine (eADO) and its receptors, which play a crucial role in modulating immune responses and tumor immunity. This review aims to provide an updated understanding of the adenosinergic system in various cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and discuss potential therapeutic directions in immuno-oncology.

1.1 Adenosine production and regulation:
eADO is primarily generated from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP) through the action of ectonucleotidases, such as CD39 and CD73. eATP is released into the extracellular space in response to cell death, cellular stress, or inflammation. These conditions are commonly observed in the TME due to factors like hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, or immune cell activation. eATP, once outside the cells, can bind and activate P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y), promoting inflammation and immune cell activation.

1.2 Role of eADO in immunosuppression:
In contrast to eATP-induced inflammation, eADO acts as an immunosuppressive molecule. It binds and activates P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) on various immune cells, promoting a cascade of intracellular events that lead to immune suppression. This suppressive effect is mediated through multiple mechanisms, such as inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production, reducing T cell proliferation, and impairing the function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells.

1.3 The tumor adenosinergic system in immune cells:
The adenosinergic machinery in immune cells plays a critical role in shaping the immune response within the TME. For example, adenosine signaling through A2A receptors expressed on T cells negatively regulates their effector function, limiting their ability to eliminate tumor cells. Additionally, A2A receptor activation on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) promotes their immunosuppressive functions, further facilitating tumor growth and immune evasion.

1.4 The tumor adenosinergic system in tumor cells:
Not only immune cells, but tumor cells themselves also express components of the adenosinergic machinery. Increased expression of CD39 and CD73 in tumor cells leads to enhanced eADO production, creating an immunosuppressive milieu. Furthermore, tumor cell-derived eADO can directly promote tumor growth and metastasis through A2B receptor-mediated signaling pathways.

1.5 The tumor adenosinergic system in stromal cells:
Stromal cells in the TME, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, also contribute to the adenosinergic signaling network. These cells can express ectonucleotidases and adenosine receptors, affecting immune cell function and tumor progression. For instance, adenosine signaling in endothelial cells promotes angiogenesis, facilitating tumor growth and providing nutrients to tumor cells.

2. Potential therapeutic directions:
Given the critical role of the adenosinergic system in cancer immunosuppression and tumor progression, targeting this signaling pathway has become an attractive strategy for immuno-oncology therapy. Several approaches are being explored, including the use of small molecule inhibitors against adenosine receptors or ectonucleotidases, as well as the development of adenosine receptor agonists or antagonists. Combination therapies involving adenosinergic blockade with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4, are also being investigated to enhance the anti-tumor immune response.

In conclusion, the adenosinergic machinery in cancer represents a complex network of signaling pathways that contribute to immune suppression and tumor progression. Understanding the role of this system in different cell types within the
