The adenosinergic machinery has been attracting increasing attention in the field of cancer research. The discovery of the intricate interplay between extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling and immune responses, particularly in the context of tumor immunity, has revealed new avenues for therapeutic interventions. 

Extracellular adenosine is primarily produced through the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP), which accumulates rapidly in the extracellular space following cell death or cellular stress induced by hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, or inflammation. eATP, in turn, plays a pro-inflammatory role by binding and activating P2 purinergic receptors, including P2X and P2Y receptors. On the other hand, eADO has consistently been reported to mediate immunosuppression by activating P1 purinergic receptors, namely A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors, in various immune cells.

The hydrolysis of eATP to eADO not only reduces eATP levels but also enhances adenosine receptor signaling, thereby altering the immunosurveillance in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This intricate network of purinergic receptors affects not only immune cells but also other cell types within the TME, including tumor cells and stromal cells.

In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the tumor adenosinergic system across different cell types within the TME. We will discuss the roles and interactions of P1 and P2 purinergic receptors in immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells, highlighting the influence of extracellular adenosine signaling on tumor immunity.

Furthermore, we will explore the potential novel directions of adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology. Recent advancements in cancer immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the unique characteristics of the tumor adenosinergic system present new opportunities and challenges for targeted interventions.

Understanding the complex adenosinergic machinery in cancer not only improves our knowledge of immune regulation but also opens avenues for the development of innovative and selective therapeutic strategies. By targeting specific purinergic receptors or modulating the levels of eATP and eADO, it may be possible to enhance anti-tumor immunity while mitigating the immunosuppressive effects of adenosine.

In conclusion, this review aims to provide an in-depth exploration of the adenosinergic machinery in cancer, highlighting the roles of purinergic receptors in various cell types within the TME. By shedding light on the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of the tumor adenosinergic system, we hope to inspire further research and the development of effective adenosine-targeted therapies in immuno-oncology.
