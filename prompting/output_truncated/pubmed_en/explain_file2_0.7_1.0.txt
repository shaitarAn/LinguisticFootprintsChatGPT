The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, with a specific focus on how historically marginalized populations have been disproportionately affected. It highlights that Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations have higher infection and death rates compared to non-Latinx White groups. Additionally, it mentions that vaccination rates have been lower in Black and Latinx communities.

The introduction also discusses the underlying causes of these health disparities, including long-standing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities caused by structural racism and discriminatory policies. It mentions factors such as mistrust in the healthcare system, language barriers, immigration issues, lack of health insurance in low-paying jobs, and limited access to advanced treatments and critical care services.

The article introduces the concept of social determinants of health (SDOH) as circumstances in which people live that shape their experience and access to healthcare. It refers to a framework proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) that examines root causes of disparities while identifying opportunities for action.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for discussing the challenges faced by marginalized populations during the pandemic and emphasizes the importance of considering structural determinants when addressing health disparities.
