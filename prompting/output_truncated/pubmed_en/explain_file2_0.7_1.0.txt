This introduction provides an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, particularly on historically marginalized populations. It starts by stating that as of June 2022, there have been 84.2 million infections and over 1 million deaths in the United States due to COVID-19. It emphasizes that these burdens have disproportionately affected minority groups, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals.

The article highlights that Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations have higher infection and death rates compared to non-Latinx White groups. Furthermore, it points out that younger people from Black and Latinx populations have approximately twice as high age-adjusted death rates from COVID-19 compared to White groups.

The introduction then discusses the development of vaccines during the first year of the pandemic and their effectiveness in reducing transmission, hospitalizations, and deaths. However, it notes that vaccination rates have been lower in Black and Latinx communities. Specifically, only 48% and 63% of eligible Black and Latinx individuals had received at least one vaccine dose by June 2022.

The lower vaccination rates among marginalized populations are attributed to various factors such as mistrust in the healthcare system and research enterprise, language barriers, immigration issues, lack of health insurance among low-paying jobs. These factors exacerbate existing disparities caused by structural racism and discriminatory policies regarding access to education, employment housing ,and healthcare.

Although access to healthcare has improved with initiatives like the Affordable Care Act (ACA), millions of people remain uninsured which compromises equitable care delivery during a health crisis like a pandemic.

The article also highlights how hospitals predominantly serving marginalized communities were overwhelmed during the pandemic leading to limited access to advanced treatments and critical care services.

To understand these disparities better during COVID-19 pandemic outcomes for marginalized populations this article adopts a framework called "Structural Determinants Of Health" (SDOH) which considers socioeconomic status,racism,policies etc.,that influence health outcomes. This framework helps to evaluate both immediate circumstances as well as broader context that affected COVID-19 outcomes.

Lastly, the introduction mentions that since the early phases of the pandemic, minorities living in hotspot counties have been disproportionately affected. For example, Black individuals had a 30.2% mean difference between their proportion of cases and their proportion of the population. Similarly, Latinx individuals had a 14.5% mean difference.

In conclusion, this introduction sets up the context for understanding the impact of COVID-19 on marginalized populations in the United States by highlighting disparities in infection rates, deaths, vaccination rates, and access to healthcare services. It also introduces relevant frameworks for analyzing these disparities and provides a glimpse into the challenges faced by these populations during the pandemic.
