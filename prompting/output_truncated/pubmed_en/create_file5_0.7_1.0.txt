Introduction

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 500 million cases worldwide. In addition to the acute phase of infection, there is growing recognition of a post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as long COVID. PASC refers to the presence of prolonged or relapsing symptoms that persist for at least four weeks after the initial acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These persistent symptoms can affect various organ systems and have significant detrimental effects on individuals' health.

Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving PASC is essential for developing effective preventive and treatment strategies. It has been established that immune dysregulation plays a crucial role in both acute COVID-19 and PASC pathogenesis. However, the specific causal mechanisms responsible for immune dysfunction in PASC remain largely unknown. The dysregulation of immune processes is likely influenced by factors such as clinical phenotype, initial infection severity, and specific tissues involved.

To address these knowledge gaps, extensive research efforts are being undertaken globally through initiatives like the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This initiative involves multidisciplinary teams conducting studies on PASC using standardized protocols and collecting data from diverse populations across different age groups.

Within RECOVER, the Mechanistic Pathways Committee focuses on three priority areas: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage. This perspective article aims to provide an overview of current knowledge while highlighting important questions and hypotheses related to immune mechanisms underlying both acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC. By reviewing existing literature on these topics, we aim to identify gaps in understanding disease severity and sequelae associated with COVID-19.

While there are likely distinct differences between immune mechanisms during acute COVID-19 and those involved in PASC, studying the immunopathology of acute infection can serve as a starting point for investigating candidate pathways involved in PASC immunopathology. By examining the dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, we can gain insights into specific molecular signals and immune cell populations that contribute to PASC pathogenesis.

This article brings together researchers with expertise in adult and pediatric medicine to comprehensively review the role of immune mechanisms in both acute COVID-19 and PASC. We will explore potential hypotheses for PASC-related immune dysregulation and propose studies that could help elucidate these mechanisms. Additionally, we will discuss the importance of longitudinal analyses involving patients with and without PASC to better understand the heterogeneity of this condition.

By addressing knowledge gaps in the immunopathology of PASC, we hope to pave the way for novel research directions that ultimately lead to precision therapies aimed at restoring healthy immune function in individuals with long COVID. This comprehensive understanding is crucial given the significant public health impact of COVID-19 and its associated post-acute sequelae.
