Introduction:

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a devastating impact on the United States, with millions of infections and over a million deaths recorded as of June 2022. However, the burden of hospitalizations and deaths has not been distributed equally across the population. Historically marginalized groups, including Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals, have experienced disproportionately higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 compared to non-Latinx White individuals.

These disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among marginalized populations can be attributed to a culmination of structural, institutional, and socioeconomic inequities. Historically marginalized groups are more likely to be employed in low-wage jobs without health insurance, limiting their access to healthcare services and increasing their vulnerability to the virus. Additionally, mistrust in the healthcare system, language barriers, and limited health literacy have hindered vaccination rates in minority communities, further exacerbating health disparities.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and magnified existing health disparities rooted in racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities. Structural racism and discriminatory policies regarding access to education, employment, housing, and healthcare have perpetuated these disparities. While the passage of the Affordable Care Act improved access to healthcare for many, millions of people remain uninsured, compromising the capacity of the US healthcare system to deliver equitable care, particularly during a health crisis.

Furthermore, the pandemic has overwhelmed hospitals that predominantly serve marginalized communities, exacerbating the strain on already low-resourced health systems and limiting access to advanced treatments and critical care services. The challenges faced by marginalized and underserved populations during the COVID-19 pandemic have shed light on the urgent need to address these structural and social determinants of health (SDOH) in order to achieve health equity.

This article aims to discuss the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to health disparities and to propose strategies for mitigating these disparities moving forward. By examining the structural determinants that have contributed to the unequal impact of the pandemic, we can identify areas for action and develop targeted interventions to address the root causes of health disparities. Ultimately, addressing these disparities is crucial not only for the equitable management of the current pandemic but also for building a more resilient and equitable healthcare system in the future.
