This article discusses the health disparities that have been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, particularly among historically marginalized populations such as Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals. These groups have experienced higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 compared to non-Latinx White individuals. The authors highlight several factors that contribute to these disparities, including the disproportionate representation of marginalized groups in low-wage jobs without health insurance, mistrust in the healthcare system, language barriers, and limited health literacy.

The article emphasizes that these health disparities are rooted in structural, institutional, and socioeconomic inequities. It discusses the impact of structural racism and discriminatory policies on access to high-quality education, employment, housing, and healthcare, which have perpetuated these disparities. The authors also note that although access to healthcare has improved with the Affordable Care Act, millions of people remain uninsured, which compromises the capacity of the healthcare system to deliver equitable care, especially during a health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

The article further explores the challenges faced by marginalized and underserved populations during the pandemic and discusses the lessons learned from this experience. It highlights the importance of addressing structural and social determinants of health (SDOH) in order to reduce health disparities. The authors use the World Health Organization (WHO) Conceptual Framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health to examine the root causes of disparities and identify opportunities for action.

The article concludes by emphasizing the need to address structural determinants that have contributed to health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the importance of considering both the immediate circumstances of living and the broader context that has influenced COVID-19 outcomes. The authors propose areas for action based on the WHO framework, including improving healthcare access, addressing occupational and housing conditions, and reducing psychosocial stress.

Overall, this article provides insights into the health disparities observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, particularly among marginalized populations. It highlights the need for targeted interventions to address the structural and social determinants of health that contribute to these disparities and offers recommendations for mitigating health disparities moving forward.
