The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marginalized populations in the United States. It begins by stating the number of infections and deaths in the country, highlighting that historically marginalized populations, including minorities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals, have been disproportionately affected. Specifically, Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations have higher infection and death rates compared to non-Latinx White groups.

The introduction then discusses the development and effectiveness of vaccines in reducing transmission, hospitalization, and deaths from COVID-19. However, vaccination rates have been lower in Black and Latinx communities compared to the national average. This is attributed to factors such as mistrust in the healthcare system and research enterprise, language barriers, immigration issues, and lack of health insurance in low-paying jobs.

The introduction further emphasizes that health disparities during the pandemic are not random but are rooted in longstanding racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities caused by structural racism and discriminatory policies. It mentions that access to healthcare has improved but millions of people remain uninsured, compromising the capacity of the healthcare system to deliver equitable care, especially during a health crisis. Additionally, hospitals that predominantly serve marginalized communities have been overwhelmed, limiting access to advanced treatments and critical care services.

The introduction introduces the concept of structural and social determinants of health (SDOH) and explains how they contribute to health disparities. It references the World Health Organization (WHO) Conceptual Framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health to examine the root causes of disparities and identify opportunities for action. The framework highlights how structural bases, socioeconomic and political contexts, and intermediary determinants shape an individual's unique social circumstances and influence behavior and disease risk.

The introduction concludes by mentioning that the article focuses on the structural determinants that drove health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic. It references a figure from a previous study that illustrates the structural and social determinants of health contributing to racial and ethnic disparities in the pandemic.

Overall, the introduction sets the stage for the article by providing a comprehensive overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marginalized populations in the United States and the underlying factors contributing to health disparities.
