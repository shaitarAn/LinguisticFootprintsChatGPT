1. Introduction

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus, has resulted in an unprecedented global health crisis. With over 500 million reported cases worldwide, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection extends beyond the acute phase, giving rise to a range of post-acute sequelae, commonly referred to as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). These sequelae encompass a wide spectrum of persistent symptoms and organ system dysfunction that can significantly impair the quality of life for affected individuals.

Recent studies have suggested that dysregulated immune responses play a critical role in both the severity and outcomes of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the development of PASC. Notably, exaggerated immune responses characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been associated with the severe clinical manifestations observed in COVID-19 patients. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of immune dysregulation in the context of PASC remain poorly understood.

This review aims to explore the current understanding of immune mechanisms underlying both the pathology of COVID-19 and the development of PASC. By examining the existing literature on immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19, we seek to identify potential mechanisms that may be implicated in the immunopathology of PASC. Moreover, we will evaluate the limited emerging data specific to the immune responses observed in patients with PASC, with a particular focus on elucidating differences between the acute phase and the post-acute phase.

While acute COVID-19 and PASC may share some overlapping mechanisms of immunopathology, it is vital to recognize that PASC is a distinct clinical entity characterized by its heterogeneity. Consequently, the identification of specific molecular signals and immune cell populations that contribute to PASC pathogenesis necessitates in-depth mechanistic analyses. This review will explore the current knowledge gaps in the immunopathology of PASC, aiming to highlight the need for large-scale longitudinal studies that encompass patients both with and without PASC following an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

By shedding light on the immunological mechanisms underlying PASC, our ultimate goal is to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for precision therapies that restore healthy immune function in affected individuals. Understanding the unique immune dysregulation associated with PASC will be vital in designing personalized therapeutic strategies to alleviate the burden of long-term symptoms and improve the overall prognosis of those living with long COVID.

In summary, this paper will comprehensively review the current literature on immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19, with a specific focus on the immunopathology of PASC. By synthesizing available knowledge, we aim to identify key knowledge gaps and research directions that will facilitate the development of targeted interventions and precision therapies for PASC. A comprehensive understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying PASC will pave the way for improved patient care, enhanced quality of life, and ultimately contribute to the global efforts in managing the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
