Introduction

The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to a multitude of research focused on understanding the immune mechanisms underlying the pathology of the disease. As the number of cases continues to rise, there has been increasing concern about the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly referred to as long COVID. PASC is characterized by a range of persistent symptoms that persist for weeks or even months after the acute phase of the infection has resolved.

Recent studies have highlighted the significance of immune dysregulation in the severity and outcomes of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its potential role in the development of PASC. Exaggerated immune responses and sustained inflammatory processes have been linked to the pathogenesis of both acute COVID-19 and PASC. However, it is essential to unravel the intricate mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in order to identify the specific molecular signals and immune cell populations that contribute to the development of PASC.

This review aims to examine the existing literature on the immunopathology of PASC and the associated immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 cases. While there may be some overlapping mechanisms between acute COVID-19 and PASC, it is crucial to understand the unique and heterogeneous immunopathology of PASC. This understanding will require comprehensive longitudinal studies involving large-scale cohorts of patients with and without PASC following an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

By addressing the knowledge gaps surrounding the immunopathology of PASC, this study aims to pave the way for new research directions that can ultimately lead to the development of precision therapies targeting the restoration of healthy immune function in PASC patients. Understanding the immune mechanisms underlying PASC has significant implications, not only for providing effective treatment options for individuals suffering from long COVID but also for mitigating the long-term health consequences associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In light of the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing number of individuals affected by PASC, addressing this research question will provide critical insights into the immune dysregulation associated with long COVID, thereby contributing to the development of targeted interventions and strategies to improve the quality of life for individuals experiencing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
