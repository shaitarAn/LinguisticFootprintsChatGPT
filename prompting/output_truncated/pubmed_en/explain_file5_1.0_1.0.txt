The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as "long COVID," and highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying PASC for the development of preventive and treatment strategies. It mentions that PASC can present with a range of symptoms affecting different organ systems, but why this occurs is still largely unknown.

The article mentions that immune dysregulation is a key feature of acute COVID-19 and plays a role in the pathogenesis of PASC manifestations. However, the specific mechanisms underlying immune dysfunction in PASC need to be defined. The authors emphasize that studying immune mechanisms in PASC can vary depending on clinical phenotype, initial infection severity, and specific tissues involved.

The article then introduces the NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which involves over 100 researchers conducting studies on PASC using a standardized set of protocols. The goal is to collect data from individuals across different age groups using electronic health records and surveys. Biospecimens will also be collected for analysis.

Next, it is stated that the Mechanistic Pathways Committee within the RECOVER consortium focuses on three priority areas: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage. This perspective article aims to provide an overview of current knowledge in these areas related to PASC immunopathology.

The introduction further explains how dysregulated immune responses contribute to severe acute COVID-19 and discusses potential mechanisms such as delayed or impaired type I interferon responses, viral antagonism against pattern recognition receptors, and dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. It also highlights excessive neutrophil activation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation as factors associated with severe acute COVID-19 but notes limited understanding regarding their role in long COVID or PASC.

Overall, this introduction sets up the context for exploring immune mechanisms involved in both acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC, highlighting the knowledge gaps and the need for further research in understanding the immunopathology of PASC.
