Sarcopenia, characterized by age-related decline in muscle mass, strength, and physical performance, is a significant public health concern among older adults. Nutritional factors, including dietary intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), have been suggested to play a role in the development and progression of sarcopenia. PUFAs are essential nutrients that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet.

The Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) study is a large-scale randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults. As part of this study, we conducted a secondary analysis to explore the association between dietary PUFAs intake, nutritional status of PUFAs, and sarcopenia outcomes.

Baseline data from 29 community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia were used for this exploratory analysis. Dietary PUFAs intake was assessed using 4-day food records, while nutritional status was determined through examination of red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles. Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to explore associations between PUFAs intake/status and various sarcopenia parameters (muscle strength, mass, physical performance), as well as physical activity levels and quality of life.

Interestingly, we found that total omega-3 intake among participants was below recommended levels for both men and women. This highlights potential inadequacies in dietary habits among older adults with sarcopenia when it comes to consuming foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids. It is important to address these deficiencies given the potential benefits that omega-3s may have on muscle health.

Furthermore, our analysis revealed some intriguing associations between PUFAs status/intake and measures related to sarcopenia outcomes. Specifically, higher levels of alpha-linolenic acid status were inversely associated with appendicular lean mass (a marker for muscle mass). On the other hand, higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid status were positively associated with aLM. These findings suggest that PUFAs, particularly specific types such as alpha-linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, may have differential effects on muscle health in older adults with sarcopenia.

Additionally, we observed positive associations between certain measures of PUFAs intake/status and physical activity levels, quality of life scores (as measured by SF-36), and scores on the SarQoL questionnaire. This suggests that adequate PUFAs intake/status may not only benefit muscle health but also overall well-being among older adults with sarcopenia.

It is important to note that this exploratory study has generated new hypotheses for potential correlations between PUFAs intake/status and sarcopenia outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which specific PUFAs may influence muscle health.

In conclusion, our preliminary analysis from the ENHANce study provides insight into the potential associations between dietary PUFAs intake/status and sarcopenia outcomes among community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The findings suggest that optimizing dietary habits to ensure adequate intake of omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial for preserving muscle mass and function in this population. Further investigation is warranted to better understand these relationships and develop targeted interventions for improving nutritional status in individuals at risk for or diagnosed with sarcopenia.
