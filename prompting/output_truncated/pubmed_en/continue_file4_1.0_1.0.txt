Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in muscle mass and function, is a major public health concern in older adults. It is associated with increased risk of falls, fractures, disability, and mortality (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). Nutritional interventions have been explored as a potential strategy to prevent or manage sarcopenia, with particular interest in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).

PUFAs are essential fats that play crucial roles in various physiological processes including inflammation, immune response, and muscle metabolism (Calder et al., 2017). Omega-3 PUFAs such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and may influence muscle protein synthesis and degradation (Smith et al., 2015).

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status measured by red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. This was done through a secondary analysis of baseline data from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial.

A total of 29 participants were included in this exploratory analysis. The findings revealed that the total intake of omega-3 PUFAs among participants was below the recommended daily intake for both males and females. This indicates that there may be insufficient consumption of these beneficial fatty acids among older adults with sarcopenia.

Interestingly, there was no correlation observed between dietary PUFA intake and nutritional status assessed by red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles. This suggests that factors other than dietary intake alone may contribute to differences in PUFA status among individuals.

Regarding associations with sarcopenia outcomes, it was found that higher levels of DHA status were positively correlated with appendicular lean mass (aLM), a key indicator of muscle mass in older adults. On the other hand, higher levels of ALA status were inversely associated with aLM. These findings suggest that the specific types of PUFAs may have distinct effects on muscle mass in this population.

Furthermore, certain markers of PUFA intake and status were positively correlated with physical activity (step count) and quality of life scores, as measured by SF-36 and SarQoL questionnaires. This indicates a potential beneficial effect of PUFAs on physical function and overall well-being in sarcopenic older adults.

However, it should be noted that gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) status was inversely associated with the physical component summary score of SF-36. This suggests that GLA may have a negative impact on physical health outcomes in this population.

In conclusion, this exploratory analysis provides preliminary evidence for potential correlations between PUFA intake/status and sarcopenia outcomes in
