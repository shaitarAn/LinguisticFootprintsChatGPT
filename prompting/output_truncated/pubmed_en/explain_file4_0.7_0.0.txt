This introduction provides an overview of the importance of diet in the development and treatment of sarcopenia, which is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. The article highlights that sarcopenia is a growing concern in the aging population and can significantly impact the daily life of older adults. Malnutrition and low protein intake are identified as contributing factors to sarcopenia, while nutritional supplementation, particularly with protein, is recommended as a treatment strategy.

The introduction also discusses the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in muscle physiology and sarcopenia progression. It explains that omega-3 PUFAs are suggested to have beneficial effects on muscle, while omega-6 PUFAs may have negative effects due to their pro-inflammatory properties. The ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs in the diet is considered important for musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health.

The article then introduces the concept of using dietary intake and the fatty acid composition of red blood cell membranes as biomarkers to assess PUFAs status in sarcopenic older adults. The aim of the study is to investigate the correlation between dietary intake and PUFAs status, as well as the associations between PUFAs intake and status with sarcopenia-defining parameters, physical activity, and quality of life.

The introduction concludes by stating the hypotheses of the study, which include the expectation of low omega-3 PUFA intake in sarcopenic older adults and the assumption that higher intake of omega-3 PUFAs is associated with improved muscle strength, muscle mass, quality of life, and physical activity.
