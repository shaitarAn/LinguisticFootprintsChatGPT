This PubMed article explores the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and sarcopenia outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia refers to the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, and it can have a significant impact on the daily life of older adults. The article discusses the importance of diet in the development and treatment of sarcopenia, highlighting the role of protein and now also suggesting the potential influence of PUFAs.

The study, called the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce), is a randomized controlled trial that aims to assess the effect of combined interventions (protein, omega-3 supplement, and exercise) on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults. The researchers used baseline data from the trial for a secondary, exploratory, cross-sectional analysis.

Dietary intake of PUFAs was assessed using 4-day food records, while the nutritional status of PUFAs was assessed using the fatty acid profiles of red blood cell membranes. The researchers then calculated correlation coefficients to explore the associations between PUFAs intake and status with various sarcopenia-defining parameters, physical activity, and quality of life.

The results showed that the total omega-3 intake of the participants was below the recommended intake levels. The intake and status of PUFAs were not correlated. However, specific PUFAs were found to be associated with certain sarcopenia outcomes. For example, Î±-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with appendicular lean mass, while docosahexaenoic acid status was positively associated with appendicular lean mass. Some markers of omega-3 PUFAs intake and status were also associated with physical activity and quality of life scores.

The article concludes that although the intake of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs was low in the study population, the findings generate new hypotheses regarding the potential correlations between PUFAs intake and status with sarcopenia outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia.

The introduction section of the article provides background information on sarcopenia, its prevalence, and its impact on older adults. It also highlights the role of nutrition, particularly protein intake, in sarcopenia development and treatment. The section discusses the potential influence of PUFAs on muscle physiology and sarcopenia progression, with omega-3 PUFAs being suggested to have beneficial effects on muscle health.

The introduction also emphasizes the lack of detailed data on dietary PUFAs intake in sarcopenic older adults and the importance of assessing both intake and status. The authors mention that food records are a useful tool for measuring dietary intake but can be prone to bias. They propose using the fatty acid composition of red blood cell membranes as an objective biomarker for PUFAs status.

The aims of the present study are then outlined, including assessing the dietary intake and nutritional status of PUFAs in sarcopenic older adults, determining the correlation between intake and status, and exploring associations between PUFAs intake and status with sarcopenia-defining parameters, physical activity, and quality of life. The authors hypothesize that omega-3 PUFAs intake is low in sarcopenic older adults, and higher intake is associated with improved muscle strength, mass, quality of life, and physical
