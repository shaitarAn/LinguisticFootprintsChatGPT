The introduction of this PubMed article discusses the importance of diet in the development and treatment of sarcopenia, which is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. The authors highlight that sarcopenia is a growing concern in the aging population and can significantly impact daily life activities such as lifting heavy objects or walking. They also mention that sarcopenia affects a significant percentage of older adults living in communities or nursing homes.

The article emphasizes that malnutrition and low protein intake contribute to the onset or progression of sarcopenia, while nutritional supplementation (with or without exercise) is currently recommended for its treatment. In addition to protein intake, the authors suggest that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may also influence muscle physiology and sarcopenia progression. They explain that dietary fat intake plays a major role in optimizing muscle structure and function, as fatty acids can act as an energy source for muscles and are incorporated into various structures within skeletal muscles.

The introduction further explains that omega-3 PUFAs are considered beneficial for musculoskeletal health, while omega-6 PUFAs may have negative effects on muscles due to their pro-inflammatory properties. Therefore, it is suggested that maintaining a higher dietary intake ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs could be beneficial for overall health, including musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health.

The authors state that increasing omega-3 PUFA intake is gaining attention as a potential treatment for sarcopenia due to its properties such as anti-inflammatory effects, improving muscle protein synthesis, reducing anabolic resistance (the diminished response to anabolic stimuli), and reducing insulin resistance.

They also mention that there is currently limited data on usual dietary PUFA intake specifically in well-defined sarcopenic older adults. To address this gap, they propose using food records as a tool to measure dietary PUFA intake while acknowledging potential biases related to recall problems or socially desirable responses.

Moreover, they argue that assessing PUFA status in addition to intake would be valuable, as an optimal nutritional status is desired. To measure PUFA status objectively, they suggest using the fatty acid composition of red blood cell (RBC) membranes as a biomarker. This marker reflects the nutritional PUFA status over the past month or two and has been studied in other populations but not yet in sarcopenic older adults.

Based on these considerations, the authors outline the aims of their study: to assess dietary PUFA intake and PUFA status using food records and RBC membrane fatty acid composition respectively, in a sample of well-defined sarcopenic older adults according to recent criteria. They also aim to determine the correlation between intake and status of PUFAs and explore associations between dietary intake/status of PUFAs with sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, muscle mass, physical performance), physical activity levels, and quality of life.

The introduction concludes by stating their hypotheses that omega-3 PUFA intake is low among sarcopenic older adults and that there is a strong correlation between dietary intake and PUFA status. The authors also anticipate that higher omega-3 intake will be associated with improved muscle strength/mass, higher quality of life scores, and increased physical activity levels.
