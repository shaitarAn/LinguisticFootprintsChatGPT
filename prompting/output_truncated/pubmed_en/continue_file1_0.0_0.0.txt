End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition characterized by the irreversible loss of kidney function, requiring patients to undergo hemodialysis for survival. Arteriovenous (AV) access, in the form of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) or fistulas (AVFs), is crucial for the delivery of hemodialysis. However, thrombosis of AV access is a common complication that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.

Traditionally, surgical intervention was the primary treatment option for thrombosed AV access. However, the endovascular approach has gained popularity due to its minimally invasive nature and favorable outcomes. Endovascular thrombectomy techniques involve the removal of thrombus from the AV circuit and the treatment of any underlying anatomical abnormalities contributing to the thrombosis.

Thrombolysis, the process of dissolving thrombus, is often performed using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices to administer fibrinolytic agents directly into the thrombus. This technique has shown promising results in restoring patency to thrombosed AV access. However, it carries the risk of bleeding complications and requires careful patient selection.

Thrombectomy, on the other hand, involves the mechanical removal of thrombus from the AV circuit. Various devices, such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, and rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms, can be used to achieve successful thrombus extraction. These techniques have demonstrated high technical success rates and improved patency rates compared to thrombolysis alone.

In addition to thrombectomy, adjunctive methods such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement are often employed to treat underlying stenoses in the AV circuit. These interventions aim to restore normal blood flow and prevent future thrombosis.

While endovascular thrombectomy techniques have shown promising results, they are not without risks. Complications can include vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain. Therefore, a thorough understanding of these techniques and their potential complications is essential for the successful management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

This narrative review article aims to provide an overview of current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The information presented in this article is based on a comprehensive literature search from electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar.

In conclusion, endovascular thrombectomy techniques have revolutionized the management of thrombosed AV access in patients with ESRD. These techniques offer a minimally invasive alternative to surgery and have shown favorable outcomes in terms of technical success and patency rates. However, they are not without risks, and careful patient selection and procedural planning are crucial to minimize complications. Further research is needed to optimize these techniques and improve long-term outcomes for patients with thrombosed AV access.
