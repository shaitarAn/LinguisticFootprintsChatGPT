Diet plays an important role in the development and treatment of sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function [REF]. Primary sarcopenia is age-driven and is a growing concern in the ageing population. It can seriously affect the daily life of an older adult, e.g., by limiting the ability to lift heavy objects like groceries or through difficulties to climb the stairs or to walk [REF]. Sarcopenia affects up to 29% of community-dwelling older adults and up to 33% of nursing home residents [REF]. Malnutrition and low protein intake contribute to sarcopenia onset or progression [REF], whereas nutritional supplementation (alone or combined with exercise) is currently the recommended treatment strategy for sarcopenia [REF]. Besides protein intake, the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is also suggested to influence muscle physiology and sarcopenia progression [REF]. Dietary fat intake is a major determinant of muscle structure and function. Fatty acids can act as an energy source for the muscle, but are also incorporated in various structures of the skeletal muscle containing phospholipid membranes (e.g., sarcolemma or mitochondria), thus optimizing the muscle’s structure and function [REF]. In general, omega-3 PUFAs are suggested to have beneficial effects on the muscle, whereas omega-6 PUFAs might have negative effects on the muscle through their pro-inflammatory properties [REF]. Therefore, a higher omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs dietary intake ratio is considered beneficial for musculoskeletal health [REF], as well as other health domains like cardiovascular health [REF]. In this context, a high omega-3 PUFAs intake is gaining increasing attention as a potential treatment for sarcopenia [REF]. Increasing intake of omega-3 PUFAs might counteract or prevent sarcopenia through some of its properties that are potentially beneficial for the muscle (e.g., improving muscle protein synthesis through its anti-inflammatory properties [REF], reducing anabolic resistance [REF] and reducing insulin resistance [REF]).Detailed data on usual dietary PUFAs intake in well-defined sarcopenic older adults are lacking. For this purpose, food records are a useful tool to measure dietary intake but carry an inherent risk of bias due to recall problems or socially desirable responses [REF]. Moreover, this might be a measure reflecting only short-term intake and not how this intake interferes with nutritional status. An adequate intake should ideally lead to an optimal nutritional status. Thus, it might be interesting to not only assess intake, but also status. Therefore, an objective biomarker for PUFAs status, such as the fatty acids composition of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane, is useful [REF], as this represents the nutritional PUFAs status based on the intake over the past month or two [REF]. This longer-term marker of PUFAs status has been reported in several populations, e.g. children [REF], postmenopausal women [REF] or men with prostate cancer [REF] but not yet in sarcopenic older adults. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the dietary intake of PUFAs – through food records – and PUFAs status – through RBC membrane fatty acids composition – in a sample of well-defined sarcopenic older adults according
