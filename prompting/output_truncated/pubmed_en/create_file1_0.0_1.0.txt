Introduction

Thrombosis of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who rely on hemodialysis for their survival. The occlusion of these access sites can lead to significant morbidity, including delays in hemodialysis treatment and the need for temporary dialysis catheter placement. As such, the management of thrombosed AV access is crucial in ensuring optimal patient outcomes.

Current practices for the treatment of thrombosed AV access primarily involve endovascular techniques, which have emerged as the preferred approach over surgical interventions. These endovascular procedures aim to remove thrombus from the AV circuit while addressing any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to recurrent thrombosis.

Thrombolysis, or the dissolution of thrombus using fibrinolytic agents, is one such technique employed during endovascular interventions. Infusion catheters or pulse injector devices are utilized to administer these agents directly into the occluded vessel segment. Thrombolysis has shown promising results in restoring patency to thrombosed AVGs and AVFs.

In addition to thrombolysis, mechanical removal of thrombus through a procedure known as thrombectomy has gained traction as an effective treatment modality. Thrombectomy involves physically extracting or disrupting the clot using various devices such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic mechanisms, and aspiration techniques. These mechanical approaches offer an alternative means of restoring blood flow through occluded vessels when pharmacological methods may be contraindicated or ineffective.

Furthermore, adjunctive methods like cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement are often employed during endovascular interventions to address underlying stenoses within the AV circuit. These techniques aim to improve long-term patency rates by addressing the underlying anatomical abnormalities that contribute to thrombosis.

While endovascular techniques have demonstrated favorable outcomes in the management of thrombosed AV access, it is important to acknowledge that these procedures are not without risks. Complications associated with these interventions include vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of both the techniques and potential complications is essential for clinicians involved in managing patients with thrombosed AV access.

This academic paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of current practices and outcomes related to endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. By synthesizing existing literature from electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, this narrative review will explore various aspects of these interventions including their efficacy, safety profile, long-term patency rates, and potential complications.

The findings from this review will contribute valuable insights into the management strategies for patients with ESRD who experience thrombotic occlusion of their AV access sites. Ultimately, this research aims to inform clinical decision-making processes by providing evidence-based recommendations on optimal approaches for maintaining vascular access in this vulnerable patient population.
