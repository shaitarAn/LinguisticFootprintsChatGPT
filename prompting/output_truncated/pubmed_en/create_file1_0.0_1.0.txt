1. Introduction

The management of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) in the end stage renal disease (ESRD) population is a critical aspect of maintaining adequate access for hemodialysis. Thrombosis of arteriovenous (AV) access can result in significant complications, including delays in hemodialysis treatment or the need for dialysis catheter placement, which can negatively impact patient outcomes and quality of life.

Current practices for the treatment of thrombosed AV access primarily involve endovascular techniques, which have emerged as the preferred approach over surgical interventions. These endovascular techniques encompass a range of procedures aimed at removing thrombus from the AV circuit and addressing underlying anatomical abnormalities that contribute to thrombosis, such as anastomotic stenosis.

Thrombolysis, involving the administration of fibrinolytic agents through infusion catheters or pulse injector devices, is one method used to dissolve thrombus within the AV circuit. Mechanical removal of thrombus, known as thrombectomy, is another approach that utilizes embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic mechanisms, and aspiration methods.

In addition to these primary interventions, adjunctive methods such as cutting balloon angioplasty and drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty are employed to treat stenoses within the AV circuit. Stent placement may also be utilized when necessary.

While these endovascular techniques have shown promising outcomes in terms of restoring patency to thrombosed AV access sites in patients with ESRD, it is crucial to consider potential complications associated with these procedures. Vessel rupture during intervention poses a significant risk along with arterial embolism and pulmonary embolism (PE). Furthermore, there exists a possibility for paradoxical embolism leading to cerebral events.

This academic paper aims to provide an in-depth exploration of the thrombectomy approach for access maintenance in the ESRD population. By reviewing current practices and outcomes, as well as potential complications, this research seeks to enhance our understanding of thrombectomy techniques and their implications for managing patients with thrombosed AV access.

Through a comprehensive literature search utilizing electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, this study aims to contribute valuable insights into the field of endovascular thrombectomy techniques. Ultimately, this research will provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations for optimizing patient care and improving outcomes in individuals with ESRD requiring hemodialysis.
