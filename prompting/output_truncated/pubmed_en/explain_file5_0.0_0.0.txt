This article discusses the immune mechanisms underlying the pathology of COVID-19 and the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID. The authors highlight that exaggerated immune responses play a crucial role in the severity and outcomes of both the initial infection and subsequent PASC. They emphasize the need for in-depth mechanistic analyses to identify specific molecular signals and immune cell populations involved in PASC pathogenesis.

The introduction section provides an overview of PASC, which refers to prolonged symptoms and detrimental health effects that occur after the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The exact reasons for the development of PASC are still largely unknown, making it important to understand the underlying mechanisms for the development of preventive and treatment strategies.

The authors discuss the established role of immune dysregulation in acute COVID-19 and its involvement in systemic and tissue-specific manifestations of PASC. However, the specific causal mechanisms of immune dysfunction in PASC need to be defined. The mechanisms of immune dysregulation may vary depending on the clinical phenotype of PASC, the severity of the initial infection, and the specific tissues involved. Well-designed studies can help elucidate the role of immune mechanisms in PASC.

The article mentions the NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which involves over 100 researchers conducting studies on PASC. The initiative aims to generate a large SARS-CoV-2 recovery cohort and collect data from individuals across different age groups. The ultimate goal is to develop preventive and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and PASC.

The authors highlight the Mechanistic Pathways Committee within the RECOVER consortium, which focuses on three priority areas: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage. This perspective article, along with companion papers on viral persistence and PASC tissue damage, aims to provide an overview of current knowledge and raise important questions and hypotheses in these areas to guide future research efforts.

The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding immune mechanisms in both acute COVID-19 and PASC. While there are likely differences between the immune mechanisms involved in these two phases, the acute immunopathology of COVID-19 can serve as a starting point for examining candidate pathways involved in the immunopathology of PASC. The authors outline the established knowledge on acute COVID-19 and the limited data on the immunopathology of chronic PASC, highlighting important avenues for research on PASC immunopathology.

Overall, this article provides an overview of the immune mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathology and PASC, emphasizing the need for further research to understand the specific immune dysregulation in PASC and develop precision therapies for affected patients.
