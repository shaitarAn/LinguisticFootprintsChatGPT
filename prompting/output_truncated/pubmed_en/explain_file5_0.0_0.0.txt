This introduction provides an overview of the topic of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as "long COVID." It explains that many adults and children experience prolonged symptoms after COVID-19, and these symptoms are referred to as PASC when they persist for 4 or more weeks after the acute phase of the infection. The underlying mechanisms of PASC are still largely unknown, but immune dysregulation is believed to play a role. The introduction highlights the importance of understanding these mechanisms for the development of preventive and treatment strategies.

The introduction also introduces the NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which involves over 100 researchers conducting studies on PASC. The initiative aims to collect data from individuals across the lifespan using electronic health records and surveys, as well as biospecimens. The ultimate goal is to develop preventive and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and PASC.

The introduction further explains that the Mechanistic Pathways Committee within the RECOVER consortium focuses on three priority areas: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage. This perspective article aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on the role of the immune system in acute COVID-19 and PASC, with a focus on immune dysregulation. The article also discusses potential hypotheses for immune dysregulation in PASC and suggests studies that can help answer these questions.

The introduction concludes by mentioning the role of neutrophil activation and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in severe acute COVID-19. It highlights the need for further research to understand the potential role of neutrophils and NETs in PASC. The persistence of neutrophil activation and abnormal neutrophil responses in the subacute period after COVID-19 raises questions about how these short-lived cells can "remember" an infection that resolved weeks or months earlier. Possible explanations include reprogramming of tissue cells or the bone marrow environment by the preceding infection.
