The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its increasing prevalence worldwide. It highlights hemodialysis as the most common treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and emphasizes the importance of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) as preferred access options for chronic hemodialysis due to their lower risk of hospitalization and mortality compared to central venous catheters.

The article mentions that patients dependent on catheters have poorer outcomes, including an increased risk of sepsis and bacteremia. However, it also acknowledges that AVF and AVG require frequent interventions to maintain access patency, which can be burdensome on healthcare resources and impact patients' quality of life, leading to implications on morbidity and mortality.

Thrombosis is identified as the leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG, accounting for a significant percentage of cases. The thrombosis rates for AVF are provided as 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days, while AVG thrombosis occurs at a rate of 0.2 events per patient during a two-year follow-up period.

The introduction discusses various factors contributing to access thrombosis, including underlying venous or arterial stenoses at the anastomotic site, systemic factors like hypercoagulability or low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, cannulation complications resulting in hematomas.

It is mentioned that thrombosed access leads to delays in hemodialysis treatment along with treatment omissions. Inpatient admissions may be required due to complications arising from thrombosed access or abandonment necessitating dialysis catheter placement.

The composition of thrombus formed in AV accesses is described as consisting of two components: a soft clot easily disintegrating in the venous outflow and a firm fibrin plug near the anastomosis.

The introduction highlights the lack of FDA-approved pharmacological therapies to prevent access thrombosis and mentions the unclear long-term effects of anti-platelet therapy and warfarin on access patency.

The importance of timely treatment for thrombosed access is emphasized, with a note that thrombectomy becomes less likely to be successful when fresh thrombus hardens into adherent thrombus in the native vein of an AVF. Thrombectomy in AVF should ideally be performed within days, while it can still be successful up to a week in AVG.

The introduction discusses the evolution from surgical thrombectomy requiring hospitalization and operation room resources to endovascular techniques becoming the standard of care for treating thrombosed access. It notes that under imaging guidance, not only can the thrombus be removed but underlying anatomical abnormalities such as stenoses can also be treated.

Previous studies are referenced to highlight procedure success rates ranging from 70% to 90% for endovascular approaches in treating thrombosed fistula or graft. The article mentions a significant increase in endovascular access thrombectomy procedures compared to two decades ago.

Finally, it states that this review article aims to provide an overview of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular techniques for treating thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The authors conducted a literature search using electronic databases like PubMed and Google Scholar as their basis for writing this review article.
