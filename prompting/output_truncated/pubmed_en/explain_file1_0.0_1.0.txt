This introduction provides an overview of the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the use of hemodialysis as a treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It highlights the importance of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) as preferred access options for hemodialysis due to lower risks and better outcomes compared to central venous catheters. However, maintaining long-term vascular access patency requires frequent interventions, which can be burdensome for both healthcare resources and patients' quality of life.

The introduction also emphasizes that thrombosis is the leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG, accounting for a significant percentage of cases. It mentions various factors that contribute to access thrombosis, including underlying stenoses, systemic factors like hypercoagulability and low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications.

Furthermore, it states that there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies to prevent access thrombosis. Thrombosed accesses lead to delays in dialysis treatment and may require catheter placement. The article highlights the importance of timely treatment for thrombosed accesses before fresh thrombus hardens into adherent thrombus.

The introduction then discusses how endovascular techniques have become the standard approach for treating thrombosed accesses instead of surgical thrombectomy. These techniques allow not only removal of the clot but also treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities under imaging guidance. The success rates reported in prior studies range from 70% to 90%.

Finally, it mentions that this article aims to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications related to endovascular thrombectomy techniques for treating thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The authors conducted a literature search using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar to gather relevant information for this review article.
