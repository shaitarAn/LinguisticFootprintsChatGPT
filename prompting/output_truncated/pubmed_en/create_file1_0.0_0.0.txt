Introduction

Thrombosis of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who rely on hemodialysis for renal replacement therapy. The occlusion of these access sites can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, as it can result in delayed or inadequate hemodialysis, necessitating the placement of temporary dialysis catheters. The management of thrombosed AV access is crucial in ensuring optimal dialysis outcomes and minimizing the need for invasive interventions.

Current guidelines recommend an endovascular approach as the preferred treatment option for thrombosed AV access over surgical intervention. Endovascular techniques involve the removal of thrombus from the AV circuit and the treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities, such as anastomotic stenosis. Thrombolysis, the dissolution of thrombus, is achieved through the administration of fibrinolytic agents using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices. Alternatively, thrombectomy, the mechanical removal of thrombus, can be performed using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms.

While the endovascular approach has shown promising results in the management of thrombosed AV access, it is essential to understand the potential complications associated with these techniques. Vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain are among the reported complications. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of thrombectomy techniques and their associated risks is crucial for the safe and effective management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs in the end-stage renal disease population. By synthesizing the available literature from electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different thrombectomy approaches and identify potential areas for improvement in the management of thrombosed AV access.

This review will contribute to the existing body of knowledge by providing an updated overview of the various endovascular thrombectomy techniques available for the treatment of thrombosed AV access. Additionally, it will highlight the potential complications associated with these interventions, allowing clinicians to make informed decisions regarding the most appropriate treatment strategy for individual patients.

In conclusion, thrombosis of AV access remains a significant challenge in the management of patients with end-stage renal disease. The endovascular approach, including thrombolysis and thrombectomy techniques, has emerged as the preferred treatment option for thrombosed AV access. However, a thorough understanding of these techniques and their potential complications is essential for optimizing patient outcomes. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques, with the goal of improving the management of thrombosed AV access in the end-stage renal disease population.
