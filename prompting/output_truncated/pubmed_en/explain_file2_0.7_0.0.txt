This introduction provides an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, with a specific focus on the disproportionate effect on historically marginalized populations. It begins by stating the number of infections and deaths in the United States as of June 2022, highlighting the severity of the pandemic. It further emphasizes that certain populations, including minorities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals, have borne a greater burden of hospitalizations and deaths.

The introduction then highlights the racial disparities in infection and death rates. It mentions that Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations have higher infection and death rates compared to non-Latinx White groups. Additionally, it mentions that younger Black and Latinx populations have approximately twice the death rates compared to White groups.

The next part of the introduction focuses on the development and rollout of vaccines. It notes that vaccines have been effective in reducing transmission, hospitalization, and deaths from COVID-19. However, it highlights lower vaccination rates in Black and Latinx communities compared to the national average. It attributes this disparity to factors such as mistrust in the healthcare system, language barriers, immigration issues, and lack of health insurance in low-paying jobs.

The introduction then discusses the underlying causes of health disparities during the pandemic, specifically structural racism and discriminatory policies. It mentions that these disparities result from long-standing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities in access to education, employment, housing, and healthcare. It also acknowledges that although the Affordable Care Act improved access to healthcare, millions of people remain uninsured, which compromises the capacity of the healthcare system to deliver equitable care.

Furthermore, the introduction highlights the strain on hospitals that predominantly serve marginalized communities, exacerbating already low-resourced health systems and limiting access to advanced treatments and critical care services.

The introduction introduces the concept of structural and social determinants of health (SDOH) and references the World Health Organization (WHO) Conceptual Framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health. It explains how these determinants impact disparities and shape an individual's social circumstances and risk for disease. The framework is mentioned as a tool to evaluate the immediate circumstances of living while also considering the broader context that influenced COVID-19 outcomes.

Finally, the introduction briefly mentions a study that found COVID-19 disproportionately affects minorities living in hotspot counties and less-advantaged neighborhoods. It provides statistics on the higher rates of COVID-19 cases in Black and Latinx populations compared to White populations.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the article by highlighting the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marginalized populations and the underlying structural and social determinants that contribute to these disparities. It emphasizes the need to address these disparities and learn from the pandemic to improve equity in healthcare and society as a whole.
