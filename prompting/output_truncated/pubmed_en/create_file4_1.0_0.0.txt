1. Introduction

Age-related sarcopenia, characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and physical performance, is a significant public health concern among aging populations worldwide (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). It is estimated that sarcopenia affects up to 50% of adults aged 80 years and older (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2018). Sarcopenia is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes, including disability, falls, fractures, and increased mortality risk (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019; Morley et al., 2014). Therefore, there is a crucial need to identify potential modifiable risk factors and develop effective interventions to prevent or treat sarcopenia in older adults.

Dietary factors, particularly the intake of specific nutrients, have been implicated in the development and progression of sarcopenia (Houston et al., 2008; Volkert et al., 2019). Among these, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, have garnered attention for their potential role in maintaining muscle health and function (Cholewa et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2015). PUFAs are essential components of cell membranes, exerting a range of biological effects that may impact muscle metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress (Smith et al., 2015). However, the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia remains poorly understood.

The current literature on the association between PUFAs and sarcopenia has primarily focused on omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (Cholewa et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2015). Limited evidence suggests that higher intakes or blood levels of omega-3 PUFAs may be beneficial for muscle mass, strength, and physical performance in older adults (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019; Da Boit et al., 2017). However, the specific PUFAs and their associations with sarcopenia outcomes remain unclear. Additionally, it is essential to consider not only dietary intake but also the nutritional status of PUFAs, as it reflects their incorporation into cell membranes and potential bioavailability (Corsetto et al., 2019).

In light of this research gap, the present study aims to explore the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. To address this research question, we will utilize the baseline data from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) study, an ongoing randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults (ENHANce trial group, 2023). By examining the associations of specific dietary PUFAs intake and PUFAs status with sarcopenia-defining parameters, physical activity, and quality of life, this study aims to provide
