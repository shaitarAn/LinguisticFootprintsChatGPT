Title: Immune Modulation Strategies for the Treatment of Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC)

Abstract:
Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly known as long COVID, pose significant challenges with persistent symptoms and functional impairments following recovery from acute COVID-19. Immune dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PASC, providing a potential target for therapeutic interventions. This review aims to explore the role of immune modulation strategies in alleviating PASC symptoms and improving patient outcomes.

1. Introduction
With an increasing number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections worldwide, understanding the long-term consequences is becoming paramount for effective healthcare management. While many individuals recover completely after acute COVID-19 infection, a substantial proportion experience lingering symptoms and functional impairments known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV
