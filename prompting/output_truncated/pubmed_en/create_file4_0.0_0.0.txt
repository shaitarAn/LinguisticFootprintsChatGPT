Introduction

Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a significant concern in the aging population. It can greatly impact the daily lives of older adults, limiting their ability to perform essential tasks such as lifting heavy objects or engaging in physical activities like climbing stairs or walking. Sarcopenia affects a substantial proportion of community-dwelling older adults and nursing home residents. Malnutrition and low protein intake have been identified as contributing factors to the onset and progression of sarcopenia. As a result, nutritional supplementation, either alone or in combination with exercise, is currently recommended as a treatment strategy for sarcopenia.

In addition to protein intake, the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in muscle physiology and sarcopenia progression has gained attention. Dietary fat intake plays a crucial role in muscle structure and function. Fatty acids serve as an energy source for muscles and are incorporated into various structures of skeletal muscle, optimizing its structure and function. Omega-3 PUFAs have been suggested to have beneficial effects on muscle health, while omega-6 PUFAs may have negative effects due to their pro-inflammatory properties. Therefore, maintaining a higher ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs in the diet is considered beneficial for musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health.

Although the potential benefits of omega-3 PUFAs in sarcopenia treatment have been recognized, detailed data on the usual dietary intake of PUFAs in well-defined sarcopenic older adults are lacking. Food records are commonly used to measure dietary intake, but they may be subject to recall bias or socially desirable responses. Additionally, they may only reflect short-term intake and not provide insight into how this intake affects nutritional status. Therefore, assessing both dietary intake and nutritional status of PUFAs is essential.

To address this gap in knowledge, the present study aims to assess the dietary intake of PUFAs, using food records, and the nutritional status of PUFAs, using the fatty acid composition of red blood cell (RBC) membranes, in a sample of well-defined sarcopenic older adults. This study will also explore the correlation between PUFA intake and status and investigate the associations between dietary intake and nutritional status of PUFAs with sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical performance), physical activity, and quality of life (QoL).

It is hypothesized that the intake of omega-3 PUFAs will be low in sarcopenic older adults and that there will be a strong correlation between PUFA intake and status. Furthermore, it is expected that higher intake of omega-3 PUFAs will be associated with improved muscle strength and mass, higher QoL scores, and increased physical activity. This study will provide valuable insights into the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia.
