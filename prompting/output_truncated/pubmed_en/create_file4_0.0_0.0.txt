1. Introduction

Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, is a prevalent condition among older adults and is associated with increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). The etiology of sarcopenia is multifactorial, involving various physiological, genetic, and lifestyle factors (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019; Morley et al., 2014). Among the modifiable factors, nutrition plays a crucial role in the maintenance of muscle health and function.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), a type of dietary fat, have gained attention for their potential role in sarcopenia outcomes. PUFAs, including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, are essential nutrients that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through diet. These fatty acids have been implicated in various physiological processes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and muscle protein metabolism (Calder, 2015; Smith et al., 2011). Emerging evidence suggests that specific PUFAs may have distinct effects on muscle health and function, making them potential targets for interventions aimed at preventing or managing sarcopenia.

While previous studies have investigated the association between PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes, the existing literature is limited and inconclusive. Furthermore, most studies have focused on overall dietary intake of PUFAs, neglecting the importance of assessing individual PUFA status. Understanding the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions to optimize muscle health in older adults.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the correlation between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. By utilizing data from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial, this study will provide valuable insights into the potential role of PUFAs in the prevention and management of sarcopenia. The findings from this study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge and may inform future interventions and guidelines for optimizing muscle health in older adults.

In summary, this study aims to address the research gap regarding the association between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes. By investigating these relationships, this study will provide valuable insights into the potential role of PUFAs in the prevention and management of sarcopenia. The findings from this study may have important implications for the development of targeted interventions and guidelines for optimizing muscle health in older adults.
