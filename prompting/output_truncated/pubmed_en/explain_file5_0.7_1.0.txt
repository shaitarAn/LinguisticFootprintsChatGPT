This introduction provides an overview of the topic of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or 'long COVID'. It begins by stating that many adults and children experience prolonged symptoms after a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These ongoing, relapsing, or new symptoms are referred to as PASC or 'long COVID' when they persist for 4 or more weeks after the acute phase of the infection.

The introduction highlights that while it is clear that PASC can present with various symptoms affecting different organ systems, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing appropriate preventive and treatment strategies for PASC.

The role of immune dysregulation in both acute COVID-19 and PASC is emphasized. Immune dysregulation has been identified as a key pathogenic feature of acute COVID-19, and it also plays a role in the development of systemic and tissue-specific manifestations in PASC. However, the specific causal mechanisms behind immune dysfunction in PASC need to be defined.

The introduction then introduces the NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which involves over 100 researchers across the United States conducting studies on PASC. The initiative aims to collect data from individuals across different age groups using electronic health records and patient-completed surveys. Biospecimens will also be collected from a subset of participants. The ultimate goal is to use this data to develop preventive and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and PASC.

The Mechanistic Pathways Committee within the RECOVER consortium focuses on three priority areas: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage. This perspective article aims to provide an overview of current knowledge in these areas related to immune mechanisms in both acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC.

The severe respiratory distress caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to be driven by an excessive and dysregulated innate immune response, coupled with poor adaptive immune responses. The sensing of the initial infection triggers a type I interferon response, but delayed or impaired responses can result in severe disease. The virus also antagonizes the host's immune responses through several virally encoded genes.

The dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines is observed in severe disease, and prolonged hospitalizations are associated with elevated cytokine levels. The presence of viral RNA in plasma has been linked to PASC sequelae, suggesting that viral persistence in certain tissues may drive symptoms.

Excessive neutrophil activation and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been identified as key mechanisms promoting severe COVID-19. NETs are chromatin filaments released by neutrophils that can have proinflammatory and thrombogenic roles. Studies have shown elevated levels of NETs in patients with severe COVID-19.

However, little is known about the potential role of neutrophils and NETs in long COVID or PASC. Studies suggest that persistent neutrophil activation contributes to disease severity even after the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection has subsided. It raises questions about how short-lived neutrophils can "remember" an infection that resolved weeks or months earlier.

The introduction concludes by highlighting the need for further research on PASC immunopathology, particularly regarding immune mechanisms involved in both acute COVID-19 and PASC. It suggests that understanding these mechanisms will provide important
