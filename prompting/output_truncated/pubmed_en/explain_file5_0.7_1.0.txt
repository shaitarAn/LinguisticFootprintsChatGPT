This PubMed article discusses post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly referred to as "long COVID." It highlights that many adults and children experience prolonged symptoms after recovering from acute COVID-19, but the underlying mechanisms for these persistent symptoms are still largely unknown. The article emphasizes the role of immune dysregulation in PASC and the need to define the causal mechanisms of immune dysfunction. It introduces the NIH-funded RECOVER Initiative, which aims to collect data from individuals across different age groups using electronic health records and surveys to develop preventive and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and PASC.

The article also focuses on three mechanistic priority areas within the RECOVER consortium: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage. It reviews current knowledge on the role of innate and adaptive immune systems in both acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC. The authors discuss potential hypotheses for immune dysregulation in PASC and suggest studies that can help answer important questions about disease severity.

The article mentions that severe acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is driven by an exaggerated innate immune response coupled with poor adaptive immune responses. It explains how viral RNA triggers a type I interferon response, which can effectively suppress infection when timely activated. However, delayed or impaired type I responses can lead to severe disease. The dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines along with elevated chemokines is associated with severe disease.

Furthermore, excessive neutrophil activation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation are identified as key mechanisms in promoting severe COVID-19. NETs are thought to serve a host defense function but have been implicated in inflammatory cascades seen in various diseases including acute lung injury. Studies have shown excessive formation of NETs in lung tissues of patients with severe COVID-19.

However, while there is extensive research on these mechanisms during acute COVID-19, their role in PASC is still unclear. The article raises questions about how neutrophil activation and NET formation may contribute to long COVID and discusses the possibility of reprogrammed tissue cells or bone marrow environment as potential factors.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the article's focus on immune mechanisms in PASC, highlighting the knowledge gaps and research directions needed to better understand disease severity and sequelae of COVID-19.
