End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition in which the kidneys are no longer able to function properly, leading to the need for hemodialysis. Hemodialysis is a life-saving treatment that removes waste and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys are unable to do so. Arteriovenous (AV) access, such as arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), are created surgically to allow for the flow of blood to and from the hemodialysis machine.

However, AV access can become thrombosed, meaning that a blood clot forms and obstructs the flow of blood. This can lead to a delay in hemodialysis or even the need for dialysis catheter placement, which is less desirable than AV access. Traditionally, surgical intervention was the preferred treatment option for thrombosed AV access. However, over the years, endovascular techniques have gained popularity and have become the preferred approach for access maintenance in the ESRD population.

Endovascular thrombectomy techniques involve the use of various tools and methods to remove the thrombus and restore blood flow. Thrombolysis, or the use of fibrinolytic agents to dissolve the thrombus, is one such technique. This can be achieved by using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices to deliver the medication directly into the clot. Thrombectomy, on the other hand, involves the mechanical removal of the thrombus using specialized catheters, such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, and rheolytic or aspiration mechanisms. These devices are guided through the AV access to physically break up and remove the clot.

In addition to thrombus removal, it is often necessary to address any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may have contributed to the thrombosis. This can include the treatment of stenoses, or narrowings, in the AV circuit. Cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement are commonly used adjunctive methods to treat these stenoses and improve blood flow.

While endovascular thrombectomy techniques have proven to be effective in restoring patency to thrombosed AV access, they are not without risks. Complications can include vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain. Therefore, a thorough understanding of these techniques and their potential complications is essential in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AV access, a literature search was conducted using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. The aim of this narrative review article is to summarize the existing literature on this topic and provide insights into the optimal management of thrombosed AV access in the ESRD population.

In conclusion, endovascular thrombectomy techniques have revolutionized the management of thrombosed AV access in patients with ESRD. These techniques offer a less invasive alternative to surgery and have shown promising outcomes in terms of access patency. However, it is important to be aware of the potential complications associated with these techniques and to carefully select patients who are appropriate candidates for endovascular intervention. Further research is needed to refine and optimize these techniques to further improve outcomes in the ESRD population.
