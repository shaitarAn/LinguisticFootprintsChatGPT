This introduction provides an overview of the role of adenosine (ADO) and extracellular ATP (eATP) in various physiological and pathological processes, particularly in the context of cancer and tumor microenvironment (TME).

It begins by explaining that ADO is a metabolic intermediate involved in the breakdown of ATP and the synthesis of important signaling molecules like cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Extracellular nucleotides, including purines and pyrimidines, have been identified as signaling molecules in various systems such as blood pressure regulation, platelet activation, cardiovascular system remodeling, neurotransmission, anti-cell death, cell growth promotion, and immunoregulation.

Under normal physiological conditions, both ATP and ADO are present at low levels in the extracellular space. However, certain cell conditions and stresses, such as cell membrane damage, ischemia, inflammation, and cancer, can trigger the massive release of ATP. This release can occur through regulated processes like vesicular exocytosis and ion channel/transporter-mediated release, as well as through direct cell destruction.

The accumulation of eATP serves as a danger signal or Danger-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP), attracting phagocytic cells to the inflammatory sites and alerting the immune system about the presence of pathogen-associated molecules and cell/tissue damage. The activation of inflammation by eATP is mediated through P2 purinergic receptors, including ligand-gated receptors (P2X) and metabotropic nucleotide-selective receptors (P2Y). While most P2Y receptors promote oncogenic processes directly in tumor cells, P2Y receptors in immune cells indirectly regulate these processes.

Recent studies have shown that eATP activates the P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7) expressed on various immune cells to promote the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of inflammatory cytokines, enhancing anti-tumor immunity. However, eATP is rapidly hydrolyzed to extracellular adenosine (eADO) in the TME, as solid tumors typically have higher levels of ectonucleotidases than non-tumor tissues.

The article then delves into the metabolic pathways of eADO production, degradation, and signaling. The canonical route involves the sequential hydrolysis of eATP to eADO by CD39 and CD73. However, eAMP, a product of eATP hydrolysis, can also be phosphorylated back to eATP by enzymes like adenylate kinase (ecto-AK) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), forming an alternative pathway.

Another non-classical pathway involves the enzymes CD38 and CD203a, which hydrolyze extracellular nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD) to generate eADO. Various ectonucleotidases, including CD73, prostatic acid phosphatase, and tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), can also contribute to the hydrolysis of eAMP to eADO.

The half-life of eADO in the extracellular space is short, but its concentration can remain high in the TME. Cancer cell death and the release of ATP, as well as the death of regulatory T cells (Treg cells), contribute to eADO accumulation in the TME. Additionally, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) highly express CD73, induced by A2B receptor activation, to sustain a high level of eADO concentration in colorectal cancer.

The article concludes by highlighting that while ADO plays a role in balancing immune system activation and overreaction under physiological conditions, in the TME, all cell types are regulated by adenosine signaling and involved in eADO production. This ultimately supports tumor cell growth.

In summary, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the role of ADO and eATP in various physiological and pathological processes, with a particular
