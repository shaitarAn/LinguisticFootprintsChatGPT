1. Introduction

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic, with over 500 million reported cases to date. While the majority of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover within a few weeks, a significant proportion develop persistent symptoms that last beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. These persistent symptoms, collectively known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), present a significant clinical challenge and have been commonly referred to as "long COVID."

PASC is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, cognitive impairment, dyspnea, chest pain, and joint pain, among others. The underlying mechanisms driving PASC are not well understood, hindering the development of effective treatments for affected individuals. Recent studies have suggested that dysregulated immune responses may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of both severe acute COVID-19 and PASC.

Exaggerated immune responses have been implicated in the severity of initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a cytokine storm and immune cell infiltration in the lungs. These immune responses, while initially important for viral clearance, can also lead to tissue damage and contribute to the development of severe disease. In the context of PASC, it is unclear whether the immune dysregulation observed during acute infection persists or evolves into distinct immunopathology.

Understanding the immune mechanisms underlying PASC is essential for developing targeted therapies to alleviate the persistent symptoms experienced by affected individuals. However, the complexity of the innate and adaptive immune responses during both acute and post-acute phases necessitates comprehensive mechanistic analyses to identify specific molecular signals and immune cell populations driving PASC pathogenesis.

In this review, we aim to examine the current literature on the immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 and the limited emerging data on the immunopathology of PASC. By critically analyzing the existing knowledge gaps, we hope to identify avenues for novel research directions that will ultimately lead to the development of precision therapies to restore healthy immune function in PASC patients.

While some parallels may exist between the mechanisms of immunopathology in the acute and post-acute phases of COVID-19, it is important to recognize the potential heterogeneity and distinct nature of PASC immunopathology. Large-scale longitudinal studies involving patients with and without PASC following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection will be essential to elucidating the underlying immune mechanisms driving PASC and to identify potential biomarkers for early detection and intervention.

By unraveling the immune dysregulation in PASC, we can gain insights into the pathogenesis of persistent symptoms and develop targeted interventions to improve the quality of life for individuals experiencing long-term consequences of COVID-19. This research not only has implications for managing PASC but also provides valuable insights into the broader field of immune responses and their role in viral infections and post-viral syndromes.

In conclusion, this review aims to shed light on the immune mechanisms underlying PASC, highlighting the need for further research to decipher the complex immunopathology associated with this condition. By bridging the knowledge gaps, we can pave the way for precision therapies that restore healthy immune function, offering hope for the millions of individuals worldwide suffering from the long-term effects
