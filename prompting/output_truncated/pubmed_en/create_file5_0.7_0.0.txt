Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global health crisis, with millions of individuals infected worldwide. While the majority of COVID-19 cases present with mild to moderate symptoms, a significant proportion of patients develop severe disease requiring hospitalization, intensive care, and even leading to death. Additionally, a growing concern has emerged regarding the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), commonly referred to as long COVID.

PASC represents a constellation of persistent symptoms and complications that continue beyond the acute phase of the infection. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive impairment, and musculoskeletal pain, which significantly impact the quality of life of affected individuals. The underlying mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of PASC are still poorly understood, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate the immune dysregulation and immunopathology associated with this condition.

Previous studies have indicated that exaggerated immune responses play a pivotal role in determining the severity and outcomes of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as subsequent PASC. The interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses during the acute and post-acute periods is complex and requires in-depth mechanistic analyses to identify specific molecular signals and immune cell populations involved in promoting PASC pathogenesis.

This article aims to review the current literature on the immune dysregulation mechanisms observed in severe COVID-19 and the limited emerging data on the immunopathology of PASC. While there may be shared mechanisms of immunopathology between the acute and post-acute phases, it is hypothesized that PASC immunopathology is distinct and heterogeneous. Therefore, large-scale longitudinal analyses in patients with and without PASC following an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are necessary to delineate the unique immunological profiles associated with PASC.

By identifying the knowledge gaps in the immunopathology of PASC, this study seeks to provide a foundation for future research directions. Ultimately, the goal is to develop precision therapies that can restore healthy immune function in PASC patients, improving their long-term outcomes and quality of life. Understanding the immune mechanisms underlying PASC will not only contribute to the management of this condition but may also shed light on potential therapeutic strategies for other post-viral syndromes.
