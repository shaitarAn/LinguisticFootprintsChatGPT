1. Introduction

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects millions of individuals worldwide, necessitating the use of hemodialysis for renal replacement therapy. The successful provision of hemodialysis relies heavily on the establishment and maintenance of reliable arteriovenous (AV) access, such as arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs). Unfortunately, thrombosis, or the formation of blood clots, is a common complication that can significantly hinder AV access functionality.

Thrombosis of AV access poses a significant clinical challenge, often resulting in delays in hemodialysis or even abandonment of the access site, necessitating the placement of dialysis catheters. Traditional surgical interventions have been the historical standard of care for addressing thrombosed AV access. However, over the years, endovascular approaches have gained prominence as the preferred treatment option, offering less invasive techniques and improved outcomes.

While the literature provides a reasonable understanding of current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for thrombosed AVGs and AVFs, there remains a dearth of research on a specific aspect of this topic - the impact of the patient's age on thrombectomy outcomes in the end-stage renal disease population.

This paper aims to address this research gap by investigating the relationship between age and thrombectomy outcomes in the ESRD population. By focusing on age as a potential predictor of treatment success, our study aims to provide valuable insights into the optimal management strategies for thrombosed AV access in different age groups. Additionally, understanding the potential complications associated with thrombectomy techniques in the context of different age cohorts will aid in tailoring treatment approaches to maximize patient safety and minimize adverse events.

To achieve this goal, we will conduct a comprehensive literature review utilizing electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, to identify relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals. By consolidating and analyzing the available evidence, we hope to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on thrombectomy techniques for AV access maintenance in the ESRD population, specifically focusing on the impact of age on treatment outcomes and associated complications.

In summary, this study aims to enhance our understanding of thrombectomy approaches for access maintenance in the ESRD population, with a particular focus on the influence of age on treatment outcomes. By shedding light on this underexplored area, we hope to guide clinicians in making informed decisions regarding thrombectomy strategies for different age groups, ultimately optimizing patient care and improving long-term outcomes for individuals with ESRD.
