1. Introduction

Thrombosis of arteriovenous (AV) access is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who require hemodialysis. It often leads to delays in treatment or abandonment of the access site, necessitating the use of dialysis catheters. The endovascular approach has emerged as the preferred method for the treatment of thrombosed AV grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), replacing traditional surgical interventions. This narrative review aims to explore the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the management of thrombosed AV access in the end-stage renal disease population.

1.1 Background

Patients with ESRD rely on AV access for hemodialysis, which enables the removal of waste products and excess fluid from their blood. However, thrombosis of the AV access can result in significant complications, including the need for temporary dialysis catheter placement, delays in hemodialysis initiation, and even the abandonment of the access site. Consequently, it is crucial to promptly manage thrombosed AV access to ensure optimal patient care and minimize the associated risks.

1.2 Rationale for the Endovascular Approach

In recent years, the endovascular approach has gained popularity as the primary treatment modality for thrombosed AV access. Unlike invasive surgical techniques, endovascular interventions offer several advantages, including reduced procedure time, shorter hospital stays, lower morbidity, and improved patient outcomes. Furthermore, the endovascular approach allows for the removal of thrombus from the AV circuit and the treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities, such as anastomotic stenosis.

1.3 Thrombolysis Techniques

Thrombolysis, the dissolution of thrombus, is a crucial component of endovascular thrombectomy techniques. The administration of fibrinolytic agents through infusion catheters or pulse injector devices aids in the restoration of blood flow in thrombosed AV access. Thrombolysis can effectively dissolve the thrombus, allowing for the subsequent removal of residual debris through other mechanical means.

1.4 Mechanical Thrombectomy Techniques

In addition to thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy techniques play a vital role in the endovascular management of thrombosed AV access. These techniques involve the mechanical removal of thrombus using various devices, such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic systems, and aspiration mechanisms. These devices are designed to physically extract the thrombus from the AV circuit, restoring blood flow and preserving the patency of the access site.

1.5 Adjunctive Methods

In some cases, adjunctive methods may be necessary to address stenotic lesions within the AV circuit. Cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon angioplasty, and stent placement are among the strategies employed to treat stenoses. These techniques aim to alleviate the underlying anatomical abnormalities contributing to thrombosis and improve the long-term patency of the AV access.

1.6 Potential Complications

Despite the advantages of endovascular techniques, they are not without risks. Complications associated with these procedures include vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain. Understanding and mitigating these potential complications are essential for the safe and effective management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

1.7 Research Gap and Objectives

While previous studies have examined the efficacy and safety of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for thrombosed AV access, there remains a need to explore the specific considerations and outcomes in the end-stage renal disease population. This review aims to fill this research gap by
