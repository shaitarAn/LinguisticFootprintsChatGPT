Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing global health issue, and hemodialysis is the primary treatment modality for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts (AVGs) are favored over central venous catheters as access sites for chronic hemodialysis due to their lower risks of hospitalization and mortality. However, maintaining the patency of long-term vascular accesses often necessitates frequent interventions, placing a significant burden on healthcare resources while also affecting patients' quality of life, morbidity, and mortality.

Thrombosis is the leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG cases, accounting for 65-85% of incidents. The thrombosis rate for AVFs is reported at 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days, while AVG thrombosis occurs at a rate of 0.2 events per patient during two years of follow-up. Access thrombosis commonly arises from underlying venous or arterial anastomotic stenoses. Systemic factors such as hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications resulting in hematomas can also increase the risk of access thrombosis.

Thrombosed accesses lead to delays in hemodialysis treatment, treatment omissions, inpatient admissions, and even abandonment of access that may require dialysis catheter placement. Thrombi formed within arteriovenous accesses are composed of soft friable clots that easily disintegrate within venous outflows and firm fibrin plugs near the anastomosis site. Currently available pharmacological therapies have not been FDA-approved to prevent access thrombosis definitively.

It is crucial to promptly treat thrombosed access to avoid delays in dialysis treatment or catheter placement if fresh thrombus transforms into adherent thrombus within the native vein of an AVF. While thrombectomy within an AVF should be performed within days, successful thrombectomy in AVGs can still be achieved up to a week. In the past, surgical thrombectomy necessitated hospitalization and operating room resources. However, with advancements in intravascular techniques, endovascular thrombectomy has become the standard of care for treating thrombosed accesses. Through imaging guidance, not only can the thrombus be removed but underlying anatomical abnormalities such as stenoses can also be addressed.

Recent studies have reported success rates ranging from 70-90% for endovascular approach-based fistula or graft thrombectomies. Over the past two decades, there has been a substantial increase in the number of endovascular access thrombectomies performed on AVFs and AVGs compared to previous years.

This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques used for treating thrombosed AVGs and AVFs.
