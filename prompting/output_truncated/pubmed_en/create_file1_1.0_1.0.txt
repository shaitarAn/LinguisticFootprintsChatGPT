Introduction

Thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) are common complications in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population receiving hemodialysis. These thrombotic events can result in delays in crucial hemodialysis sessions or even necessitate the abandonment of the access site, requiring dialysis catheter placement. As a consequence, there is a pressing need to explore effective and safe approaches for maintaining access in this vulnerable patient cohort.

The currently preferred treatment option for thrombosed AV access is an endovascular approach, which involves removing the thrombus from the AV circuit and addressing any underlying anatomical abnormalities that contribute to stenosis or occlusion. Thrombolysis, accomplished through infusion catheters or pulse injector devices delivering fibrinolytic agents, has emerged as one method for dissolving clots within these grafts and fistulas.

In addition to thrombolysis, mechanical removal of thrombus through techniques collectively referred to as "thrombectomy" has gained prominence in recent years. Embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic systems employing high-velocity saline jets, and aspirating mechanisms have demonstrated efficacy in directly removing intravascular clot burden. Furthermore, adjunctive methods such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon angioplasty (DCB), and stent placement have been employed successfully to treat stenotic lesions encompassing arteriovenous circuits.

The application of such techniques is not without risks; several potential complications may arise during intervention including vessel rupture leading to hemorrhage or arterial embolism with resultant damage downstream. Pulmonary embolism (PE), characterized by embolic material lodging within pulmonary vasculature causing reduced blood flow distribution within lungs and impeding gas exchange may transpire following intervention procedures. Another risk includes paradoxical embolism where clot formation compromises cerebral blood flow leading to neurological sequelae.

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive narrative review of current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques utilized in the management of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. By surveying available literature from electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, this article seeks to investigate the various approaches employed in thrombus removal and highlight potential complications associated with these interventions. A deeper understanding of these techniques would enable clinicians and healthcare providers to make informed decisions regarding the optimal management strategies for patients with thrombosed AV access sites.

Overall, this research endeavor endeavors to contribute valuable insights into the safe and effective maintenance of vascular access in patients with end-stage renal disease, ultimately improving patient outcomes within the ESRD population requiring hemodialysis.
