Title: Impact of Thrombectomy Techniques on Access Maintenance in the End Stage Renal Disease Population: An Overview

1. Introduction

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) poses a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide, affecting millions of patients who require intensive hemodialysis to maintain their quality of life. Arteriovenous (AV) access, in the form of arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), is crucial for facilitating the repeated vascular access necessary for hemodialysis procedures. However, thrombosis within AV access remains a major clinical challenge, often resulting in delays or outright abandonment of these critical conduits.

The management and maintenance of functional AV access are essential to provide uninterrupted dialysis treatment and reduce associated complications. Traditional surgical approaches have been largely replaced by endovascular techniques due to advances in minimally invasive procedures that offer lower morbidity and more favorable outcomes. This article aims to comprehensively review current practices and outcomes related to endovascular thrombectomy techniques for managing thrombosed AVGs and AVFs amongst ESRD patients.

2. Rationale

Optimal management strategies for salvaging dysfunctional AV access are critical in enabling timely hemodialysis initiation while minimizing patient discomfort and healthcare costs associated with repeated interventions or catheter placement. Endovascular approaches have emerged as preferred alternatives due to their efficacy, cost-effectiveness, reduced hospitalization duration, faster recovery times, and lower risk profiles compared to surgical interventions.

3. Objectives

The primary objective of this paper is two-fold:

3.a To evaluate the efficacy of current endovascular thrombectomy techniques used in treating thrombotic events occurring within AV grafts/fistulas among patients with ESRD,
3.b To analyze potential complications associated with these procedures.

4. Methodology

This narrative review article presents an overview based on extensive literature searches using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. Search terms included "thrombectomy techniques," "endovascular interventions," "AV access maintenance," "AV graft thrombosis/fistula thrombosis," and relevant synonyms. Articles published between January 2000 and December 2021 were included, with preference given to systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, and retrospective studies with large sample sizes.

5. Structure of the Review

This paper is divided into several sections to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic:

5.a Basic Science
   This section explores the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to AV access thrombosis, emphasizing the physiological aspects underlying graft/fistula occlusion.

5.b Endovascular Thrombectomy Techniques
   A critical review of various endovascular approaches used in thrombus removal from AV grafts/fistulas will be presented. This will include descriptions of procedures commonly employed for thrombolysis (using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices) as well as mechanical removal techniques such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic mechanisms, and aspiration devices.

5.c Adjunctive Methods for Access Maintenance
   The utilization of cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, stent placement procedures specifically targeting anatomical abnormalities contributing to restenosis within AV circuits will be discussed along with their outcomes.

6. Clinical Outcomes and Complications
   A comprehensive analysis of clinical trial results, observational studies, case reports examining the efficacy rates associated with different endovascular techniques will be provided. Additionally clinicopathological data on complications arising from these interventions including vessel rupture risks,
   
7. Conclusion

The understanding of various endovascular thrombectomy techniques available for managing thrombotic events
