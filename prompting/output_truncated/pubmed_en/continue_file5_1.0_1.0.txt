The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has had a profound impact on global health, with millions of individuals affected by the virus. While the majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in mild to moderate symptoms, a significant proportion of patients experience long-lasting symptoms and impairment post-infection, referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID.

Mounting evidence suggests that dysregulated immune responses play a crucial role in both the initial severity of COVID-19 and the development of PASC. The immune system responds to viral infections through intricate interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells, orchestrated by intricate molecular signaling pathways. However, in some cases, this immune response becomes exaggerated or dysregulated, leading to tissue damage and persistent symptoms.

In severe cases of COVID-19, it is believed that an excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines commonly known as cytokine storm contributes to lung injury and multi-system organ damage. Similarly, an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses during the acute phase may fuel chronic inflammation during the development of PASC. This chronic inflammatory state can potentially drive long-term organ dysfunction observed in PASC patients.

Additionally, abnormalities in specific immune cell populations have been observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, T-cell exhaustion or dysfunction has been reported in severe cases while regulatory T-cells may play a role in modulating inflammation and controlling disease progression.

While similarities may exist between the immunopathology seen during acute infection and post-infection periods, emerging evidence suggests that there are distinct differences as well. It is now recognized that PASC is a heterogeneous condition with various clinical phenotypes ranging from neurocognitive impairments to respiratory difficulties or cardiovascular complications. Such heterogeneity likely stems from an array of underlying immunopathological mechanisms yet to be fully understood.

To gain insights into these immunopathological mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic strategies, large-scale longitudinal analyses in patients with and without PASC are necessary. Comprehensive profiling of immune cell populations, cytokine profiles, and molecular signaling pathways is crucial to uncover the underlying immune dysregulation mechanisms specific to PASC.

In conclusion, the immune response plays a critical role in both the initial severity of COVID-19 and the development of PASC. Understanding the specific immunopathology unique to PASC is key to developing targeted therapies that can restore healthy immune function and alleviate long-lasting symptoms experienced by these patients. Filling in the knowledge gaps through further research will provide valuable insights into precision therapies for PASC patients, ultimately improving their quality of life.
