The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic, leading to millions of cases of COVID-19. While many individuals experience mild or moderate symptoms and recover within a few weeks, there is increasing recognition of a subset of patients who develop persistent symptoms that last for months after the initial infection. This condition is often referred to as long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). 

Understanding the immune mechanisms underlying both the acute illness and PASC is critical in order to develop targeted therapies and interventions. Numerous studies have highlighted the role of immune dysregulation in driving disease severity during acute COVID-19. Exaggerated immune responses, characterized by excessive inflammation and cytokine release, have been associated with worse outcomes such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure.

In addition to these acute immunopathological processes, there is growing evidence suggesting that PASC may also involve immune dysregulation. However, our knowledge regarding the specific mechanisms driving PASC immunopathology remains limited. Comparative studies are needed to investigate how immunological changes evolve over time in patients with PASC compared to those who recover more quickly.

It is becoming clear that PASC can manifest with a wide range of symptoms affecting various organ systems including fatigue, brain fog, chest pain, joint pain, and cardiovascular abnormalities among others. These diverse manifestations suggest that PASC immunopathology may be highly heterogenous.

Longitudinal analyses involving comprehensive profiling of multiple immune cell populations are necessary to unravel the complex immune dysregulation in patients with PASC. Biomarker identification will help distinguish between different subtypes or phenotypes within this patient group and guide therapeutic strategies tailored towards specific imbalances.

By identifying key molecular signals involved in long COVID immunopathology, we can potentially develop targeted therapies aimed at restoring healthy immune function in these patients. Precision medicine approaches, based on an individual's immune profile and specific dysregulation patterns, may offer promising strategies to manage PASC and improve patient outcomes.

In this review, we will explore the current understanding of immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 and examine the limited emerging data on PASC immunopathology. We will highlight the gaps in knowledge regarding immunological changes during PASC and discuss avenues for future research to advance our understanding of this condition. Ultimately, uncovering the immune mechanisms driving PASC will pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions that can alleviate symptoms and improve long-term outcomes in affected individuals.
