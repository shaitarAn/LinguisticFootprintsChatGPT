1. Introduction

The dysregulation of immune responses and the immunosuppressive microenvironment in cancer pose significant challenges for developing effective therapeutic interventions. In recent years, there has been growing interest in exploring the role of adenosine signaling in cancer progression and immune evasion. Adenosine, a purine nucleoside metabolite, is known to modulate various physiological processes through its interaction with specific cell surface receptors. Extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling has emerged as a crucial mechanism that regulates immune responses, including tumor immunity.

The primary source of eADO is the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP), which is rapidly accumulated within the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to cellular stress triggered by hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation. While eATP predominantly acts as a pro-inflammatory molecule by binding and activating P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y), several studies have reported the immunosuppressive properties of eADO mediated through its interaction with P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3).

Interestingly, the hydrolysis of eATP to eADO not only reduces the levels of ATP but also enhances adenosine receptor signaling within TME. This dual role of both P1 and P2 purinergic receptor activation provides novel insights into how alterations in adenosinergic machinery influence tumor-immune interactions.

While prior research has predominantly focused on understanding adenosine signaling in immune cells within TME, it is now evident that multiple cell types contribute to this complex regulatory system. Therefore, comprehensively characterizing the expression patterns and functional significance of different components involved in adenosine metabolism across immune cells, tumor cells themselves (including malignant cells), as well as stromal cells within TME would provide critical insights into potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

In this article, we review the most up-to-date understanding of the adenosinergic system in cancer, encompassing all cell types present in TME. By synthesizing the available literature, we aim to shed light on the intricate mechanisms by which adenosine signaling modulates tumor-immune interactions and immune surveillance. Additionally, we will discuss potential novel directions for adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology that may offer promising avenues for improving cancer treatment outcomes.

Overall, gaining a comprehensive understanding of how the adenosinergic machinery operates within TME and its impact on tumor progression and immune responses holds significant potential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing antitumor immunity and overcoming immunosuppressive barriers in cancer.
