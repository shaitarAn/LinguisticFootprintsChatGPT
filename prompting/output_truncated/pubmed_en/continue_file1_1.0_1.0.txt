Arteriovenous (AV) access plays a critical role in providing hemodialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, thrombosis of AV grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) can occur, leading to delays in hemodialysis or the need for alternative access methods such as dialysis catheters. In recent years, endovascular thrombectomy techniques have emerged as the preferred treatment option for thrombosed AV access over surgical interventions.

The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the management of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The review focuses on interventions that involve removing the thrombus from the AV circuit while also addressing any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to recurrent thrombosis.

One common approach involves using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices to perform pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. This technique involves infusing fibrinolytic agents directly into the clot through specially designed catheters, promoting its dissolution. Additionally, mechanical disruption of the clot can be achieved using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic mechanisms, or aspiration devices.

Adjunctive methods such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement are often employed to treat stenoses within the AV circuit that may contribute to clot formation. These techniques help restore normal blood flow and prevent future thrombotic events.

While these endovascular approaches offer promising results in terms of restoring patency to thrombosed AVGs and AVFs, it is essential for clinicians to be aware of potential complications associated with these procedures. Vessel rupture during intervention can result in significant bleeding complications requiring emergent management. Other potential risks include arterial embolism if dislodged clots migrate distally, pulmonary embolism (PE) if clots enter the pulmonary circulation, and paradoxical embolism to the brain in cases of patent foramen ovale.

To inform this review article, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. The retrieved studies encompassed the latest research on endovascular thrombectomy techniques in the context of AV access preservation in patients with ESRD.

In conclusion, understanding various thrombectomy techniques and their associated complications is essential for effectively managing patients with thrombosed AV access. Endovascular interventions have increasingly become the preferred approach due to their favorable outcomes compared to surgical alternatives. However, careful consideration of potential risks and complications is vital when deciding on treatment strategies for individual patients.
