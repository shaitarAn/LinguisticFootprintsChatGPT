Arteriovenous (AV) access is crucial for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as it enables them to receive life-saving hemodialysis. However, thrombosis, or the formation of blood clots within the AV grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), can lead to significant complications including delays in hemodialysis or complete abandonment of the access site, necessitating the placement of a dialysis catheter.

In recent years, endovascular techniques have emerged as the preferred approach for the treatment of thrombosed AV access. These minimally invasive interventions involve not only removing existing thrombi from the AV circuit but also addressing any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to clot formation, such as anastomotic stenosis.

To dissolve blood clots during these procedures, various fibrinolytic agents can be administered using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices. This process is known as thrombolysis and aims to restore blood flow within the AV access by breaking down the obstructive clot.

Alternatively, mechanical removal of thrombus through a technique called thrombectomy can be employed. Embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic mechanisms, and aspiration methods are commonly used during this procedure. Thrombectomy serves to physically retrieve clots from affected vessels and re-establish unrestricted blood flow.

In addition to addressing clot removal techniques in AV access management, this review article explores adjunctive methods utilized for treating stenoses encountered in AVGs and AVFs. Cutting balloon angioplasty involves scoring plaque-lined vessel walls with blades on a balloon catheter tip before dilation occurs; whereas drug-coated balloon angioplasty utilizes balloons coated with antiproliferative drugs that inhibit cell growth post-dilation. Stent placement may also be considered when severe stenosis persists after these interventions.

Despite their effectiveness in restoring adequate vascular patency, these procedures are not without risks. Complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy include vessel rupture, arterial embolism (the migration of clot material to other arteries), pulmonary embolism (PE), and the occurrence of paradoxical embolisms that reach the brain despite their origin in venous circulation.

For this narrative review article, a comprehensive search of electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted to gather relevant literature on thrombectomy techniques. By understanding the available methods and potential complications associated with them, healthcare professionals can more effectively manage patients with thrombosed AV access.

In conclusion, endovascular thrombectomy has become an essential tool in treating thrombosed AVGs and AVFs among patients with ESRD. The ability to remove clots mechanically or dissolve them using fibrinolytic agents allows for the salvage and maintenance of optimal vascular access for hemodialysis. However, a careful assessment of each patient's individual needs is necessary before determining whether these techniques are appropriate in a given clinical scenario.
