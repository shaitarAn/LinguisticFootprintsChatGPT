This introduction provides an overview of the role of adenosine (ADO) in the extracellular space and its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes. It begins by explaining that ADO is a metabolic intermediate in the ATP catabolism pathway and is involved in the synthesis of important signaling molecules such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The introduction then highlights that extracellular nucleotides, including purines and pyrimidines, have been reported as signaling molecules in various systems, including blood pressure regulation, platelet activation, cardiovascular system remodeling, neurotransmission, anti-cell death, cell growth promotion, and immunoregulation.

The introduction further explains that under normal physiological conditions, both ATP and ADO are present at low levels in the extracellular space. However, certain cell conditions and stresses, such as cell membrane damage, ischemia, inflammation, and cancer, can trigger the massive release of ATP in controlled manners or through cell destruction. This accumulation of extracellular ATP (eATP) serves as a danger signal to attract phagocytic cells to inflammatory sites and alert the immune system about the presence of pathogens and cell/tissue damage.

The activation of inflammation by eATP is mediated through P2 purinergic receptors, including ligand-gated receptors (P2X) and metabotropic nucleotide-selective receptors (P2Y). The introduction also mentions that most family members of P2Y receptors promote oncogenic processes directly in tumor cells, while P2Y receptors in immune cells regulate these processes indirectly.

The introduction then discusses recent studies suggesting that eATP activates P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7) expressed on various immune cells to promote the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of inflammatory cytokines, enhancing anti-tumor immunity. However, eATP is rapidly hydrolyzed to extracellular adenosine (eADO) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to higher levels of ectonucleotidases in solid tumors.

The metabolic pathways of eADO production, degradation, and signaling are then explained. The canonical route involves the sequential hydrolysis of eATP to eADO by CD39 and CD73. However, eAMP, a product of eATP hydrolysis, can also be phosphorylated back to eATP by adenylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase. The non-classical eADO production pathway involves CD38 and CD203a.

The introduction also mentions other enzymes, such as prostatic acid phosphatase and tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase, that can hydrolyze eAMP to eADO. It explains that the half-life of eADO in the extracellular space is short, and it can be further metabolized into inosine and hypoxanthine. eADO can also be transported into cells via nucleoside transporters.

Inside cells, adenosine undergoes various metabolic pathways, including phosphorylation to AMP and conversion to ATP, conversion to inosine by adenosine deaminase, and conversion to S-adenosyl-homocysteine by S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase.

The introduction concludes by highlighting that the concentration of eADO can remain high in the tumor microenvironment due to ATP release from cancer cell death and Treg cell deaths, as well as the expression of CD73 by cancer-associated fibroblasts. It mentions that while ADO plays a role in balancing immune system activation and overreaction under normal conditions, in the tumor microenvironment, all cell types are regulated by adenosine signaling, ultimately supporting tumor cell growth.
