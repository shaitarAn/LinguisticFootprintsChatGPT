Adenosine is a purine nucleoside that plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. In recent years, the adenosinergic machinery has gained significant attention in the field of cancer research. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem consisting of immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells, all of which contribute to tumor growth and progression. The adenosinergic system, specifically the interplay between eATP and eADO, has been shown to have profound effects on the immune response within the TME.

Extracellular ATP is released into the TME as a result of cellular stress or death. This eATP acts as a danger signal, alerting the immune system to the presence of a threat. It binds to P2 purinergic receptors on immune cells, triggering pro-inflammatory responses and promoting immune cell activation. However, the accumulation of eATP can also have detrimental effects on the immune response, leading to chronic inflammation and immunosuppression.

The conversion of eATP to eADO is mediated by the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73. This process not only reduces the levels of eATP but also generates eADO, which has immunosuppressive properties. eADO binds to P1 purinergic receptors on immune cells, inhibiting their activation and dampening the immune response. This immunosuppressive effect of eADO is particularly relevant in the context of cancer, where tumor cells exploit the adenosinergic system to evade immune surveillance.

In addition to immune cells, tumor cells themselves can also express adenosine receptors. Activation of these receptors can promote tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Furthermore, stromal cells within the TME, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, can also contribute to the adenosinergic signaling network. These cells can produce and respond to eATP and eADO, influencing the immune response and tumor progression.

Understanding the adenosinergic machinery in cancer has important implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Targeting the adenosine receptors or the enzymes involved in eATP hydrolysis could potentially enhance anti-tumor immune responses and overcome immunosuppression within the TME. Several preclinical and clinical studies have already shown promising results using adenosinergic inhibitors or agonists in combination with other immunotherapies.

In conclusion, the adenosinergic machinery plays a critical role in modulating immune responses within the TME. The interplay between eATP and eADO influences the balance between pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive signals, ultimately shaping the anti-tumor immune response. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying the adenosinergic system in cancer and to develop effective therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway.
