Adenosine is a purine nucleoside that plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. In recent years, the adenosinergic machinery has gained significant attention in the field of cancer research. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex network of immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells, all of which contribute to tumor growth and progression. The adenosinergic system, specifically the production and signaling of extracellular adenosine (eADO), has been shown to have profound effects on the immune response within the TME.

Extracellular ATP (eATP) is a key precursor for eADO production. Under conditions of cellular stress or damage, such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, or inflammation, eATP is released into the extracellular space. This eATP can then be hydrolyzed by ectonucleotidases, such as CD39 and CD73, to generate eADO. The hydrolysis of eATP to eADO not only reduces the pro-inflammatory effects of eATP but also enhances the immunosuppressive effects of eADO.

The effects of eADO are mediated through the activation of P1 purinergic receptors, including A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors. These receptors are expressed on various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Activation of these receptors leads to the suppression of immune responses, including the inhibition of T cell proliferation, the promotion of regulatory T cell differentiation, and the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

In addition to immune cells, tumor cells themselves can also express adenosine receptors. Activation of adenosine receptors on tumor cells has been shown to promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Furthermore, stromal cells within the TME, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, can also express adenosine receptors and contribute to the immunosuppressive effects of eADO.

Given the critical role of the adenosinergic system in regulating immune responses within the TME, targeting this pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy in immuno-oncology. Several approaches have been explored, including the use of adenosine receptor antagonists to block the immunosuppressive effects of eADO and the use of ectonucleotidase inhibitors to prevent the hydrolysis of eATP to eADO.

In conclusion, the adenosinergic machinery plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses within the TME. The production and signaling of eADO have profound effects on immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells, ultimately shaping the tumor immune landscape. Understanding the intricate interactions between the adenosinergic system and the TME will provide valuable insights for the development of novel adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology.
