Adenosine is a purine nucleoside that acts as a signaling molecule in various physiological processes. It is involved in regulating immune responses, inflammation, and tissue repair. In the context of cancer, the adenosinergic machinery plays a crucial role in shaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) and modulating the immune response against cancer cells.

The TME is a complex network of cells, including immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells, that interact dynamically to promote or suppress tumor growth. Adenosine receptors are widely expressed on these cells and their activation by eADO can have profound effects on their function.

In immune cells, eADO binding to A2A and A2B receptors leads to the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and the inhibition of T cell activation. This immunosuppressive effect allows cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and promotes tumor immune evasion. Additionally, eADO can induce the expansion of regulatory T cells, which further suppress anti-tumor immune responses.

Tumor cells themselves can also produce adenosine through the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, which convert eATP to eADO. This local production of eADO creates an immunosuppressive TME, which facilitates tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, adenosine has been shown to directly promote angiogenesis, a process necessary for tumor growth and survival.

Stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts and endothelial cells, also contribute to the adenosinergic machinery in the TME. These cells can express adenosine receptors and respond to eADO, leading to the secretion of factors that promote tumor progression and angiogenesis.

Given the critical role of the adenosinergic machinery in cancer, targeting this pathway has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy. Several approaches are being explored, including the blockade of adenosine receptors, inhibition of the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, and the use of adenosine receptor agonists or antagonists. These strategies aim to reverse the immunosuppressive TME and enhance anti-tumor immune responses.

In conclusion, the adenosinergic machinery plays a central role in shaping the TME and modulating immune responses in cancer. Understanding the complex interplay between adenosine receptors and different cell types in the TME is crucial for developing effective adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology. Further research is needed to uncover new targets and therapeutic strategies that can harness the adenosinergic machinery for improved cancer treatment.
