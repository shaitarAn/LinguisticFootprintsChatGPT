The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. While the majority of COVID-19 cases are mild or moderate, a considerable number of patients develop severe disease, and a notable proportion experience a protracted illness characterized by persistent symptoms long after the initial infection has resolved. This condition, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID, has gained increasing recognition as a significant public health concern.

The immune response plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and dysregulated immune responses have been implicated in the development of severe disease and subsequent PASC. During the acute phase of infection, SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets respiratory epithelial cells, leading to the release of viral particles and the activation of innate immune responses. The recognition of viral components by pattern recognition receptors triggers the production of type I interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines, leading to the recruitment and activation of immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells.

In severe COVID-19, an exaggerated inflammatory response, often referred to as a cytokine storm, contributes to tissue damage and organ dysfunction. The hyperactivation of immune cells leads to the release of an array of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), which can have detrimental effects on multiple organs, including the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. Moreover, dysregulated immune responses can disrupt the delicate balance between effector and regulatory immune cells, leading to a state of immune exhaustion and impaired viral clearance.

While the pathogenesis of PASC remains poorly understood, there is growing evidence to suggest that persistent immune dysregulation may underlie the development of this condition. Longitudinal studies have demonstrated that some individuals with mild or moderate COVID-19 continue to exhibit an altered immune response characterized by prolonged activation of immune cells and abnormal cytokine production even after viral clearance. This sustained immune activation may contribute to the persistence of symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, and muscle pain in PASC patients.

Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that PASC is associated with the development of autoimmunity and the dysregulation of adaptive immune responses. The production of autoantibodies targeting various self-antigens has been reported in a subset of PASC patients, which may contribute to tissue damage and the perpetuation of chronic symptoms. Furthermore, the persistence of activated T cells and B cells in the post-acute phase indicates ongoing antigen stimulation and the potential for sustained immune-mediated pathology.

Understanding the immunopathology of PASC is crucial for the development of targeted therapies to alleviate symptoms and promote recovery. Large-scale longitudinal studies involving comprehensive immune profiling and functional analyses are needed to elucidate the specific immune mechanisms underlying PASC and identify potential therapeutic targets. It is essential to differentiate the immunopathology of PASC from the acute phase of infection to tailor interventions to the specific needs of PASC patients.

In conclusion, there is increasing evidence to suggest that immune dysregulation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and the subsequent development of PASC. Elucidating the specific
