Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has affected millions of individuals worldwide, resulting in a wide range of clinical outcomes. While the majority of infected individuals experience a mild illness and recover without complications, a significant proportion develop severe disease characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure. 

In addition to the acute phase of illness, there is growing recognition of a distinct clinical entity known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or long COVID. PASC is characterized by persistent symptoms and functional impairments that persist beyond the acute infection phase, often lasting for weeks or even months. Common symptoms include fatigue, cognitive dysfunction ("brain fog"), dyspnea, chest pain, and a variety of other physical and psychological symptoms. The underlying mechanisms driving PASC are not yet fully understood, but emerging evidence suggests that dysregulated immune responses play a crucial role.

2. Exaggerated immune responses in severe COVID-19

Studies have demonstrated that severe COVID-19 is characterized by an excessive immune response, often referred to as a "cytokine storm." This immune dysregulation is marked by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). The excessive release of these cytokines leads to widespread tissue damage and contributes to the severity of the disease. Furthermore, immune cell dysfunction, including lymphopenia and impaired T cell responses, has been observed in severe cases.

3. Immune dysregulation in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)

While the mechanisms driving PASC are still being elucidated, it is becoming increasingly clear that immune dysregulation persists in the post-acute phase. Some studies have suggested that persistent low-grade inflammation may contribute to the ongoing symptoms experienced by PASC patients. This chronic inflammation is thought to result from sustained activation of immune cells and prolonged cytokine production.

Additionally, evidence suggests that PASC is associated with a dysregulated adaptive immune response. Studies have reported persistent alterations in T cell subsets, including decreased numbers of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and increased levels of exhausted T cells. These changes may impair the immune system's ability to control viral persistence and contribute to the development of chronic symptoms.

4. Heterogeneity of PASC immunopathology

While some similarities exist between the immunopathology of severe COVID-19 and PASC, it is important to recognize that PASC is a heterogeneous condition. Different individuals may experience different symptom profiles, suggesting that there may be distinct underlying mechanisms at play. Large-scale longitudinal studies that follow patients from acute infection through the development of PASC will
