Introduction

The adenosinergic machinery in cancer has gained significant recognition as a crucial regulator of immune responses, particularly in the context of tumor immunity. Adenosine, derived from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP), has been shown to mediate immunosuppression by activating purinergic receptors in various immune cells. This process not only reduces eATP levels but also enhances adenosine receptor signaling, thereby altering immunosurveillance within the tumor microenvironment (TME).

Adenosine (ADO) is an intermediate metabolite involved in ATP catabolism and the synthesis of important signaling molecules such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Under normal physiological conditions, both ATP and ADO are present at low levels in the extracellular space. However, certain cellular conditions and stresses including cell membrane damage, ischemia, inflammation, and cancer can trigger the massive release of endogenous ATP. This release serves as a danger signal or Danger-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP), attracting phagocytic cells to inflammatory sites and alerting the immune system to pathogen-associated molecules and tissue damage.

The activation of inflammation mediated by eATP is achieved through P2 purinergic receptors such as ligand-gated receptors (P2X) and metabotropic nucleotide-selective receptors (P2Y). While most family members of P2Y receptors directly promote oncogenic processes in tumor cells, P2Y receptors expressed on immune cells indirectly regulate these processes. Recent studies have indicated that eATP activates specific purinoceptor 7 (P2X7) on macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), granulocytes, T cells, and B cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity through the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome complexes.

However, eATP is rapidly hydrolyzed to extracellular adenosine (eADO) in the TME due to the higher expression of ectonucleotidases in solid tumors. The hydrolysis of eATP is primarily mediated by CD39, also known as ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1, which sequentially converts eATP into extracellular ADP and AMP. Subsequently, CD73, known as 5'-nucleotidase, hydrolyzes AMP to generate eADO. Additionally, alternative ecto-enzymes such as CD38 and CD203a have been identified to contribute to non-classical eADO production pathways.

Although the half-life of eADO is short in the extracellular space, its concentration can remain high within the TME. Cancer cell death resulting from rapid growth or chemotherapy contributes to ATP release and subsequent accumulation of eADO. Moreover, regulatory T (Treg) cell deaths also provide ATP and CD39/CD73 for immunosuppression in the TME. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the TME have been reported to express high levels of CD73 induced by A2B receptor activation, leading to sustained elevation of eADO concentration in colorectal cancer.

In summary, adenosine signaling plays a critical role in modulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment through its interaction with purinergic receptors on various cell types including immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells. Understanding these complex adenosinergic mechanisms provides valuable insights into novel therapeutic strategies for immuno-oncology. In this article, we review current knowledge regarding the adenosinergic system's involvement across different cell types within the tumor microenvironment and discuss potential future directions for adenosinergic therapies in cancer treatment.
