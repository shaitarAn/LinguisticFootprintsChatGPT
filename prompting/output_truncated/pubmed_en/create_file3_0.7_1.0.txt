Introduction

The role of adenosine signaling in cancer has gained considerable attention in recent years. Adenosine, a purine nucleoside, is known to play diverse roles in various physiological and pathological processes. In cancer, adenosine has been implicated in tumor growth, immune evasion, and metastasis. The adenosinergic machinery regulates the delicate balance between pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This intricate interplay between adenosine and its receptors has significant implications for cancer progression and response to therapy.

Previous studies have focused on understanding how extracellular adenosine (eADO) modulates immune responses within the TME. eADO is primarily generated through the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP), which accumulates following cellular stress triggered by hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation. While eATP acts as a pro-inflammatory molecule by binding to P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y), eADO exerts immunosuppressive effects by activating P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3). This balance between pro-inflammatory ATP signaling versus immunosuppressive adenosine signaling determines the overall immune response within tumors.

However, most studies have primarily focused on immune cells within the TME when investigating the role of adenosinergic signaling in cancer. Therefore, there remains a critical knowledge gap regarding how this machinery influences other cell types present within tumors such as tumor cells themselves and stromal cells.

Understanding how different cell types respond to eATO hydrolysis can provide valuable insights into novel therapeutic strategies targeting the tumor adenosinergic system. In this review article, we aim to provide an updated overview of our current understanding of the tumor adenosinergic system across all relevant cell types present in the TME including immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells.

By comprehensively examining the role of adenosinergic signaling in different cell types, we can gain a more holistic understanding of how these mechanisms shape the TME. This knowledge can pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting specific components of the adenosinergic machinery to enhance anti-tumor immune responses while simultaneously inhibiting tumor-promoting signals mediated by adenosine.

In addition to discussing existing literature on the topic, this review will also explore potential future directions in adenosinergic therapy within immuno-oncology. The identification and validation of novel targets within this complex signaling network may hold promising prospects for improving cancer treatment outcomes.

In summary, this review aims to bridge existing knowledge gaps regarding the involvement of various cell types in modulating tumor immunity through adenosine signaling. By elucidating these mechanisms, we hope to contribute towards developing targeted therapies that exploit or inhibit specific components of the adenosinergic machinery to tip the balance towards anti-tumor immune responses.
