The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a significant global burden of disease. While the majority of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover within a few weeks, a subset of patients develop severe disease and experience prolonged symptoms even after the acute phase of infection has resolved. This condition, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID, has become a major concern for healthcare providers and researchers.

Recent studies have highlighted the role of immune dysregulation in both the acute phase of COVID-19 and the development of PASC. It is now well-established that an exaggerated immune response, characterized by an excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, contributes to the severity of COVID-19. This dysregulated immune response can lead to tissue damage, particularly in the lungs, and contribute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other complications.

In the context of PASC, the immune mechanisms underlying the persistent symptoms and organ dysfunction are not yet fully understood. It is hypothesized that the immune dysregulation observed during the acute phase of infection may persist and contribute to the pathogenesis of PASC. However, it is also possible that additional immune mechanisms come into play during the post-acute phase, leading to a distinct immunopathology.

To date, there is limited research on the immunopathology of PASC, and most studies have focused on the acute phase of infection. Therefore, there is a critical need for in-depth mechanistic analyses to identify the specific immune cell populations and molecular signals that drive PASC pathogenesis. Longitudinal studies that follow patients with and without PASC over an extended period of time are necessary to understand the evolution of the immune response and its contribution to persistent symptoms.

By addressing the knowledge gaps in the immunopathology of PASC, we can pave the way for the development of precision therapies that target specific immune pathways and restore healthy immune function in PASC patients. This may involve the use of immunomodulatory drugs or therapies that promote immune tolerance and resolution of inflammation. Additionally, understanding the heterogeneity of PASC immunopathology will be crucial for tailoring treatments to individual patients and improving outcomes.

In conclusion, immune dysregulation plays a central role in both the acute phase of COVID-19 and the development of PASC. However, the immunopathology of PASC is likely to be distinct and heterogeneous, necessitating further research to unravel its
