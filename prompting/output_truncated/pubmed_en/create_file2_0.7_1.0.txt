1. Introduction

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought to light significant health disparities in the United States, particularly among historically marginalized groups such as Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals. These vulnerable communities have experienced disproportionate rates of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 compared to non-Latinx White individuals. The existing structural, institutional, and socioeconomic inequities have perpetuated these disparities.

While the example article focuses on the lessons learned from health disparities in COVID-19 among marginalized populations in the United States over the past two years, this paper aims to explore a different research question related to this issue. Specifically, we seek to investigate the impact of social determinants of health on healthcare access and outcomes for marginalized communities during public health emergencies.

Public health emergencies often exacerbate pre-existing inequalities rooted in societal structures and systems that disadvantage certain populations based on race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how disparities in healthcare access and outcomes can be further compounded during times of crisis. Understanding these dynamics is critical for informing policy decisions aimed at reducing such disparities and promoting equitable healthcare delivery.

In this paper, we will examine how social determinants of health contribute to variations in healthcare access and outcomes during public health emergencies within marginalized communities. We will explore factors such as employment conditions (including low-wage jobs without health insurance), mistrust in the healthcare system due to historical experiences of discrimination or mistreatment, language barriers that limit effective communication with healthcare providers or hinder understanding of preventive measures like vaccinations, limited health literacy that affects comprehension of public health messages or instructions for self-care practices.

By elucidating these social determinants' influence on healthcare access and outcomes within marginalized communities during public health emergencies like COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity to identify key areas for intervention aimed at addressing systemic inequities. Furthermore,this research will contribute towards the development of targeted strategies to mitigate health disparities and promote equitable healthcare delivery during future public health emergencies.
