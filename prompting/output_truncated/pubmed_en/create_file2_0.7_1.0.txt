Introduction

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a devastating impact on populations worldwide, with the United States experiencing a disproportionately high number of cases and deaths. The virus has affected various communities differently, leading to significant health disparities. Among those most affected are Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals.

COVID-19 has highlighted the existing structural and socioeconomic inequities faced by historically marginalized groups in the United States. These communities often face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to factors such as limited financial resources, lack of health insurance coverage, language barriers, and limited health literacy. Consequently, they experience higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 compared to non-Latinx White individuals.

The disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among different racial and ethnic groups can be attributed to various interconnected factors. Historically marginalized populations are more likely to be employed in low-wage jobs that do not offer comprehensive health insurance coverage or paid sick leave. This puts them at greater risk of exposure to the virus due to their inability to work remotely or take time off when feeling unwell.

Moreover, these communities often reside in densely populated areas with limited access to healthcare facilities and resources necessary for prevention and treatment. They may also face challenges related to transportation infrastructure that restrict their ability to access testing sites or vaccination centers conveniently.

An additional factor contributing significantly to health disparities is mistrust within historically marginalized communities towards the healthcare system. Historical instances of systemic racism have eroded trust among these populations over time resulting in hesitancy towards seeking medical care or participating in public health interventions such as vaccinations.

Language barriers also play a crucial role in exacerbating disparities during public health emergencies like COVID-19. Limited English proficiency can hinder effective communication between patients and healthcare providers regarding symptoms monitoring guidelines or preventive measures required for disease containment.

Furthermore, low levels of health literacy within these communities act as a barrier to understanding and implementing public health recommendations. This can result in poor adherence to preventive measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand hygiene.

To mitigate the health disparities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to address these structural inequities systematically. Efforts must be made to provide equitable access to healthcare services for historically marginalized populations. This includes ensuring affordable health insurance coverage, paid sick leave policies, and targeted outreach efforts that address language barriers and limited health literacy.

Moreover, rebuilding trust within these communities requires acknowledging historical injustices and actively engaging community leaders and organizations in public health initiatives. Culturally sensitive messaging strategies should be employed to deliver accurate information about COVID-19 prevention measures, testing procedures, and vaccination campaigns.

This article aims to discuss the lessons learned from the disparities experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic among historically marginalized groups in the United States over the last two years. By examining these lessons comprehensively, we can identify effective strategies for mitigating future health disparities during similar public health crises.

In conclusion, addressing the underlying structural inequities that perpetuate health disparities among historically marginalized communities is essential for achieving equitable outcomes during public health
