Introduction

The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 500 million confirmed cases worldwide. While the majority of individuals experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover within a few weeks, a significant proportion of patients continue to experience persistent symptoms long after the acute phase of infection has resolved. This condition, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or more commonly referred to as long COVID, has become a growing concern for healthcare providers and researchers alike.

PASC is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that can affect multiple organ systems, including but not limited to fatigue, dyspnea, cognitive impairment ("brain fog"), musculoskeletal pain, and autonomic dysfunction. These persistent symptoms significantly impact the quality of life for affected individuals and pose substantial challenges for healthcare systems worldwide.

While the exact mechanisms underlying PASC remain poorly understood, recent studies have suggested that immune dysregulation may play a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Exaggerated immune responses during the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection have been implicated in determining disease severity and outcomes. It is plausible that similar immune mechanisms contribute to the development and persistence of PASC symptoms.

Understanding the immunopathology underlying PASC is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring healthy immune function in affected individuals. However, current knowledge regarding these immunological processes remains limited due to several factors including heterogeneity among PASC patients and limited longitudinal data on their immune responses following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Therefore, this paper aims to explore the immunopathological mechanisms involved in PASC development by reviewing existing literature on severe COVID-19 immunopathology as well as emerging data specifically related to PASC. By identifying gaps in our understanding of these processes, we hope to highlight areas requiring further investigation through large-scale longitudinal analyses involving both PASC and non-PASC patients.

Ultimately, the findings from this research will contribute to the development of precision therapies that target specific immune dysregulation pathways, thereby improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals suffering from PASC.
