This introduction provides an overview of the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the use of hemodialysis as a treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It highlights the importance of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) as preferred access for hemodialysis due to lower risks of hospitalization and mortality compared to central venous catheters. However, maintaining the patency of these vascular accesses requires frequent interventions, which can impact patients' quality of life and healthcare resources. Thrombosis is identified as the leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG, with underlying factors such as stenoses and systemic conditions increasing the risk. The article emphasizes the lack of FDA-approved pharmacological therapies for preventing access thrombosis and the need for timely treatment to avoid delays in dialysis and catheter placement. Surgical thrombectomy used to be the standard approach, but endovascular techniques have become the preferred method, allowing for both thrombus removal and treatment of anatomical abnormalities. The success rates of endovascular thrombectomy are discussed, along with the increasing utilization of this procedure over the years. The article aims to review current practices, outcomes, and potential complications of endovascular thrombectomy for thrombosed AVGs and AVFs, based on a literature search of electronic databases.
