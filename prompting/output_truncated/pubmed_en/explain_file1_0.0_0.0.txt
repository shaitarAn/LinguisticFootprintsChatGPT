This article is a narrative review that discusses the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

The introduction provides background information on the importance of arteriovenous (AV) access for patients with ESRD who require hemodialysis. It explains that thrombosis of AV access can lead to delays in hemodialysis or the need for dialysis catheter placement. The introduction also highlights that the endovascular approach has become the preferred treatment option for thrombosed access over surgery. It describes various interventions used in endovascular thrombectomy, including thrombolysis (dissolving thrombus using fibrinolytic agents) and thrombectomy (mechanical removal of thrombus using different devices). The introduction also mentions adjunctive methods such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon angioplasty, and stent placement for treating stenoses in the AV circuit. It notes that complications of these procedures can include vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism, and paradoxical embolism to the brain.

The article states that it is a narrative review based on a literature search from electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar. It emphasizes the importance of understanding thrombectomy techniques and their potential complications in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

Overall, this article provides an overview of the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs in patients with ESRD. It highlights the importance of maintaining AV access patency and discusses the various interventions and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy.
