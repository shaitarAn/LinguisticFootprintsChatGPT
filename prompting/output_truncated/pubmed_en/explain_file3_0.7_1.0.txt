This PubMed article discusses the role of adenosine (ADO) in various physiological and pathological processes, particularly in the context of cancer. Adenosine is a metabolic intermediate that is involved in the breakdown of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and the synthesis of signaling molecules such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The extracellular release of nucleotides, including purines and pyrimidines, has been reported to act as signaling molecules in several systems.

Under normal conditions, both ATP and ADO are present at low levels in the extracellular space. However, certain cellular conditions and stresses can trigger the massive release of ATP either through regulated vesicular exocytosis or direct cell-lytic mechanisms. The accumulation of extracellular ATP (eATP) functions as a danger signal to attract phagocytic cells to inflammatory sites and alert the immune system about tissue damage or pathogen presence.

The activation of inflammation by eATP is mediated through P2 purinergic receptors, specifically ligand-gated receptors (P2X) and metabotropic nucleotide-selective receptors (P2Y). While most family members of P2Y receptors promote oncogenic processes directly in tumor cells, P2Y receptors expressed by immune cells indirectly regulate these processes.

Recent studies have shown that eATP activates a specific receptor called P2X7 on various immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, T cells, and B cells. This activation leads to the formation of an inflammasome called NLRP3 and subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and IL-18. This process enhances anti-tumor immunity.

However, eATP is rapidly converted into extracellular adenosine (eADO) within tumor microenvironments due to higher levels of ectonucleotidases found in solid tumors compared to non-tumor tissues. The production of eADO primarily involves the sequential hydrolysis of eATP by two enzymes: CD39 (ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1), which converts eATP into extracellular ADP and AMP, and CD73 (5′-nucleotidase), which further hydrolyzes AMP into eADO.

Apart from the canonical pathway, another non-classical pathway mediated by CD38 (NAD+ ectohydrolase) and CD203a (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase) contributes to the production of eADO. In this pathway, extracellular nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD) released through a specific protein called connexin 43 can be hydrolyzed by CD38 to generate nicotinamide and ADP-ribose. Subsequently, CD203a consumes ADP-ribose to produce inorganic pyrophosphate and AMP, which is then converted into eADO by CD73.

The concentration of eADO remains high within tumor microenvironments despite its short half-life. Cancer cell death caused by rapid growth or chemotherapy contributes to ATP release and subsequent accumulation of eADO in the extracellular space. Treg cell deaths also supply ATP and enzymes like CD39/CD73 for immunosuppression within tumor microenvironments. Additionally, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) highly express CD73 induced by A2B receptor activation in colorectal cancer, leading to sustained high levels of eADO concentration.

Under normal physiological conditions, adenosine plays a role in balancing immune system activation and preventing overreaction. However, within tumor microenvironments, all cell types are regulated by adenosine signaling pathways involved in the production of eADO. This ultimately promotes tumor cell growth.

In summary, this article provides an overview of the metabolic pathways involved in the production, degradation, and signaling of eADO. It highlights the importance of eATP and eADO in modulating immune responses and their potential implications in cancer progression.
