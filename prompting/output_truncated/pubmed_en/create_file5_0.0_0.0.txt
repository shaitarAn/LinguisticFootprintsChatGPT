Introduction

The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. While the acute phase of the infection has been extensively studied, there is growing recognition of a subset of individuals who experience persistent symptoms and complications long after the initial infection has resolved. This condition, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID, has emerged as a major concern due to its impact on the quality of life and the potential long-term consequences for affected individuals.

Recent studies have suggested that immune dysregulation plays a crucial role in both the severity of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of PASC. Exaggerated immune responses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, leading to tissue damage and multi-organ dysfunction. However, the underlying immune mechanisms driving the development of PASC remain poorly understood.

This paper aims to explore the immunopathology of PASC and address the following research question: What are the specific immune mechanisms underlying the development and persistence of PASC following an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection? By elucidating the molecular signals and immune cell populations involved in PASC pathogenesis, we can gain insights into the complex immune responses that contribute to the persistence of symptoms and identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions.

While there may be shared mechanisms of immunopathology between the acute and post-acute phases, it is hypothesized that PASC immunopathology is distinct and heterogeneous. Therefore, comprehensive longitudinal analyses are necessary to characterize the immune dysregulation in patients with and without PASC after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. By addressing the knowledge gaps in the immunopathology of PASC, this study aims to provide a foundation for future research directions and the development of precision therapies that restore healthy immune function in PASC patients.

In this review, we will critically analyze the current literature on the immune dysregulation in severe COVID-19 and the limited emerging data on the immunopathology of PASC. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities in studying the immune mechanisms underlying PASC, including the need for large-scale longitudinal studies and the integration of multi-omics approaches. Ultimately, a better understanding of the immune dysregulation in PASC will pave the way for targeted interventions and improved management strategies for individuals suffering from this debilitating condition.
