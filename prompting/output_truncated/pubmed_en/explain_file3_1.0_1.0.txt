This introduction provides an overview of the research topic, which is focused on extracellular adenosine (eADO), its production, degradation, and signaling pathways. The first paragraph highlights the importance of adenosine in cellular metabolism and signaling processes. It mentions that extracellular nucleotides, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), are involved in various physiological systems such as blood pressure regulation, cardiovascular function, neurotransmission, cell growth, and immune regulation.

The second paragraph discusses how the release of ATP can be triggered by different conditions or stresses such as cell damage, inflammation, ischemia (restricted blood flow), and cancer. This accumulation of extracellular ATP (eATP) serves as a danger signal that attracts immune cells to sites of inflammation and alerts the immune system to potential threats.

The third paragraph introduces purinergic receptors called P2 receptors that mediate the effects of eATP on inflammation. Different members of the P2Y receptor family have been shown to promote oncogenic processes directly in tumor cells or regulate these processes indirectly in immune cells.

The fourth paragraph focuses on recent studies suggesting that eATP activates a specific purinoceptor called P2X7 expressed on various immune cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity by promoting the formation of inflammasomes and releasing inflammatory cytokines.

The fifth paragraph explains that eATP is rapidly converted into eADO in tumor microenvironments due to higher levels of ectonucleotidases present in solid tumors compared to normal tissues. It briefly describes two established pathways for eADO production involving CD39 (ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1) followed by CD73 (5'-nucleotidase) activity on AMP derived from ATP hydrolysis.

The sixth paragraph highlights an alternative pathway for eADO production mediated by CD38 (NAD+ ectohydrolase) and CD203a (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase) involving the hydrolysis of extracellular nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD).

The seventh paragraph mentions other enzymes, such as prostatic acid phosphatase and tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase, that can also contribute to eADO production.

The eighth paragraph acknowledges the short half-life of eADO but explains that its concentration can remain high in the tumor microenvironment due to ATP release from cancer cell death and CD39/CD73 activity on ATP from Treg cell deaths. It also mentions the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in sustaining high levels of eADO in colorectal cancer.

Finally, the last paragraph emphasizes that while adenosine ordinarily plays a role in balancing immune system activation and overreaction under normal conditions, it is also involved in tumor growth regulation when dysregulated within the tumor microenvironment.
