This article explores the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, which can significantly impact daily life activities for older adults. The study is part of a larger ongoing randomized controlled trial called ENHANce, which aims to assess the effect of combined interventions (protein, omega-3 supplement, and exercise) on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

The researchers collected baseline data from 29 participants (9 males and 20 females with a mean age of 76.3 years) for this secondary exploratory analysis. They assessed dietary PUFA intake using 4-day food records and measured PUFA status using red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles. They then calculated correlation coefficients to explore associations between PUFA intake/status and various sarcopenia-defining parameters such as muscle strength, mass, physical performance, physical activity (step count), and quality of life.

The results showed that the total omega-3 intake among participants was below the recommended levels for both males and females. There was no significant correlation between PUFA intake and status. However, certain specific PUFAs were associated with different outcomes: Î±-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with appendicular lean mass (aLM), while docosahexaenoic acid status was positively associated with aLM. Some omega-3 PUFAs intake/status markers were positively associated with step count, quality of life scores (SF-36/SarQoL), but gamma-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with SF-36 physical component summary score.

Overall, despite low omega-3 and omega-6 intake levels observed in this study's population, these exploratory findings suggest potential correlations between PUFA intake/status and sarcopenia outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia. The study highlights the importance of assessing both dietary intake and nutritional status of PUFAs to better understand their impact on muscle health in this population.
