This introduction provides an overview of the importance of diet in the development and treatment of sarcopenia, which is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. It highlights that sarcopenia is a growing concern in the aging population and can significantly impact daily life activities. The article mentions that malnutrition and low protein intake contribute to sarcopenia, while nutritional supplementation (with or without exercise) is currently recommended for its treatment.

The introduction also discusses the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in muscle physiology and sarcopenia progression. It explains that omega-3 PUFAs are suggested to have beneficial effects on muscles, while omega-6 PUFAs may have negative effects due to their pro-inflammatory properties. Therefore, a higher dietary intake ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs is considered beneficial for musculoskeletal health.

The article then emphasizes that there is a lack of detailed data on usual dietary PUFA intake in well-defined sarcopenic older adults. To address this gap, food records are proposed as a useful tool but with potential biases. Additionally, an objective biomarker for PUFA status, such as the fatty acid composition of red blood cell membranes, is suggested as a valuable measure reflecting longer-term PUFA status based on past month or two's intake.

Based on these considerations, the aim of this study is described: to assess both dietary PUFA intake through food records and PUFA status through red blood cell membrane fatty acid composition in well-defined sarcopenic older adults according to established criteria. The study also aims to determine correlations between intake and status of PUFAs and explore associations between dietary intake/status with individual parameters defining sarcopenia (muscle strength, mass), physical performance, physical activity levels, and quality-of-life scores.

Overall hypotheses are presented: low omega-3 PUFA intake among sarcopenic older adults with good correlation between intake and status, higher omega-3 intake associated with improved muscle strength/mass, higher quality-of-life scores, and increased physical activity levels.
