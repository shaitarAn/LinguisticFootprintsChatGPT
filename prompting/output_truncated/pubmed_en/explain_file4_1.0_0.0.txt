This introduction provides an overview of the importance of diet in the development and treatment of sarcopenia, which is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. It notes that sarcopenia is a growing concern in the aging population and can significantly impact daily activities. The article highlights the prevalence of sarcopenia in older adults and the role of malnutrition and low protein intake in its onset or progression.

The introduction also mentions the potential influence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on muscle physiology and sarcopenia progression. It explains that omega-3 PUFAs are generally considered beneficial for muscle health, while omega-6 PUFAs may have negative effects due to their pro-inflammatory properties. The article suggests that a higher dietary intake ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs is favorable for musculoskeletal health.

The introduction then discusses the lack of detailed data on usual dietary PUFAs intake in well-defined sarcopenic older adults and the challenges of measuring dietary intake using food records. It suggests that assessing PUFAs status through objective biomarkers, such as the fatty acids composition of red blood cell membranes, may provide a more accurate reflection of nutritional intake over a longer period.

Based on this background, the aim of the present study is described. The study intends to assess both dietary intake of PUFAs (through food records) and PUFAs status (through red blood cell membrane fatty acids composition) in a sample of well-defined sarcopenic older adults. It also aims to determine the correlation between intake and status of PUFAs and explore associations between dietary intake/status of PUFAs and sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, muscle mass, physical performance), physical activity, and quality of life.

The hypotheses of the study are also stated, suggesting that intake of omega-3 PUFAs is low in sarcopenic older adults and that intake is correlated with status. The study further speculates that higher intake of omega-3 PUFAs may be associated with improved muscle strength and mass, higher quality of life scores, and more physical activity.
