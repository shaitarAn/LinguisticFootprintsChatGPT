Introduction

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a devastating impact on the United States, with millions of infections and over a million deaths. However, it has become increasingly clear that certain populations have been disproportionately affected by the virus. Historically marginalized groups, including Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals, have experienced higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 compared to non-Latinx White individuals.

This disparity in COVID-19 outcomes can be attributed to a variety of factors. Firstly, individuals from marginalized groups are more likely to be employed in low-wage jobs without access to health insurance, making it difficult for them to seek timely and appropriate healthcare. Additionally, mistrust in the healthcare system, language barriers, and limited health literacy have hindered vaccination rates in minority communities, further exacerbating existing health disparities rooted in structural, institutional, and socioeconomic inequities.

The purpose of this article is to discuss the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years and explore strategies to mitigate health disparities moving forward. By examining the challenges faced by marginalized and underserved populations, we can gain a better understanding of the structural and social determinants of health that have contributed to these disparities. This knowledge will inform future interventions and policies aimed at promoting health equity and reducing the impact of future pandemics on vulnerable populations.

Using the World Health Organization (WHO) Conceptual Framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health, we will analyze the root causes of existing disparities and identify opportunities for action. This framework recognizes that structural bases, such as social class, influence the socioeconomic and political context, which in turn shape exposure to intermediary social determinants. These intermediary determinants include factors such as health care access, occupational and housing conditions, and psychosocial stress, all of which contribute to an individual's unique social circumstances and influence their behavior and risk for disease.

Throughout this article, we will focus on the structural determinants that have been essential drivers of health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic. By understanding and addressing these determinants, we can work towards creating a more equitable healthcare system that ensures all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, have equal access to quality care and protection during public health crises.
