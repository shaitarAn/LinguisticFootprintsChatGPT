Sarcopenia, characterized by the loss of muscle mass and function, is a common condition among older adults that can lead to various adverse health outcomes. Nutritional interventions, including the supplementation of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), have been proposed as potential strategies to improve sarcopenia outcomes.

The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the relationship between dietary PUFAs intake, nutritional PUFAs status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The study utilized baseline data from the ongoing Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy Ageing (ENHANce) trial, which is a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance in older adults with sarcopenia.

A total of 29 subjects (9 males and 20 females) with a mean age of 76.3 ± 5.4 years were included in this analysis. The participants' dietary PUFAs intake was assessed using 4-day food records, while their nutritional PUFAs status was evaluated through RBC membrane fatty acid profiles. Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to explore associations between PUFAs intake/status and various sarcopenia-defining parameters such as muscle strength, muscle mass, physical performance, as well as physical activity levels and quality of life.

The results showed that the total omega-3 intake among participants (1.99 ± 0.99 g/d) was below the recommended daily intake for both males (2.8-5.6 g/d) and females (2.2-4.4 g/d). Interestingly, there was no significant correlation observed between dietary PUFAs intake and nutritional PUFAs status.

However, when examining associations with sarcopenia outcomes, it was found that higher levels of α-linolenic acid status were inversely associated with appendicular lean mass (aLM), indicating that a lower status of this particular PUFA may be related to decreased muscle mass. On the other hand, higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid status were positively associated with aLM, suggesting a potential protective effect against muscle loss.

Furthermore, some markers of omega-3 PUFAs intake and status were positively associated with physical activity levels, quality of life scores (as assessed by SF-36 and SarQoL questionnaires), while gamma-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with the physical component summary score of SF-36.

In conclusion, although the dietary intake of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs was found to be low in this study population, these exploratory findings suggest potential correlations between PUFAs intake/status and sarcopenia outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia. Further research is needed to confirm these associations and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Nonetheless, these results provide valuable insights for future studies exploring nutritional interventions for sarcopenia management.
