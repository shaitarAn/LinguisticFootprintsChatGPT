Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a significant health concern in older adults. It is associated with increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality. Nutritional factors, including dietary intake of specific nutrients, have been suggested to play a role in the development and progression of sarcopenia.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are a group of essential fatty acids that have been shown to have various health benefits. They are involved in numerous physiological processes, including inflammation regulation and cell membrane integrity. Omega-3 PUFAs, such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been particularly studied for their potential anti-inflammatory effects and their impact on muscle health.

The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The study utilized baseline data from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy Ageing (ENHANce) trial, which is investigating the effect of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

The results showed that the total omega-3 intake among participants was below the recommended levels for both males and females. This indicates that there may be a deficiency in omega-3 PUFAs among this population. Interestingly, dietary PUFA intake did not correlate with nutritional PUFA status measured by red blood cell membrane fatty acids profiles.

When examining correlations with sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, mass, and physical performance), it was found that ALA status was inversely associated with appendicular lean mass (aLM). This suggests that lower levels of ALA may be related to decreased muscle mass in sarcopenic individuals. On the other hand,DHA status was positively associated with aLM, indicating that higher levels of DHA may be beneficial for muscle health.

Furthermore, some omega-3 PUFA intake and status markers were positively associated with physical activity levels, as measured by step count. This suggests that adequate omega-3 intake and status may contribute to improved physical activity in older adults with sarcopenia. Additionally, higher omega-3 PUFA intake and status were also associated with better quality of life scores, as measured by SF-36 and SarQoL questionnaires.

However, it is worth noting that gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) status was inversely associated with the physical component summary score of the SF-36 questionnaire. This indicates that higher GLA levels may be related to poorer physical functioning in sarcopenic individuals.

In conclusion, this exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for potential correlations between PUFA intake and nutritional status with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The findings suggest that specific PUFAs, such as ALA and DHA, may play a role in muscle mass regulation. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms involved. Understanding the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes could have important implications for developing targeted interventions to prevent or manage sarcopenia in older adults.
