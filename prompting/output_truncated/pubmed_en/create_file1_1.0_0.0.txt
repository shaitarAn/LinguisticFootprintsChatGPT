Introduction

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on the rise globally, contributing to the increasing burden of disease worldwide. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients often rely on hemodialysis as the primary renal replacement therapy. Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts (AVGs) are preferred over central venous catheters as access points for chronic hemodialysis, as they offer lower risks of hospitalization and mortality. However, maintaining the patency of long-term vascular accesses poses a considerable challenge, burdening healthcare resources and impacting the quality of life, morbidity, and mortality of patients.

Thrombosis accounts for the majority of access failures in AVFs and AVGs, contributing to 65-85% of cases. The thrombosis rate for AVFs is recorded at 0.24 events per 1,000 patient days, while AVG thrombosis occurs at a rate of 0.2 events per patient during a 2-year follow-up. Venous or arterial anastomotic stenoses underlie most cases of access thrombosis, although systemic factors such as hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications leading to hematomas also contribute to the risk. Thrombosed accesses result in delays in hemodialysis treatments, treatment omissions, inpatient admissions, and in some instances, the abandonment of access. Consequently, dialysis catheter placement becomes necessary, further complicating patient care.

Early treatment of thrombosed accesses is crucial to prevent delays in dialysis treatment and catheter placement. However, the success of thrombectomy hinges on the timing and characteristics of the thrombus. Thrombus formed in AV access comprises two components: a soft, friable clot that easily disintegrates in the venous outflow, and a firm fibrin plug near the anastomosis. While thrombectomy can be successful in AVFs within days, its success rate decreases once fresh thrombus hardens into adherent thrombus in the native vein. Conversely, thrombectomy in AVGs can still achieve favorable outcomes up to a week after thrombosis occurs.

Historically, surgical thrombectomy requiring hospitalization and operation room resources was the standard treatment for thrombosed AV access. However, the development of intravascular techniques has changed the landscape, making endovascular thrombectomy the preferred approach. Through imaging guidance, endovascular thrombectomy not only removes the thrombus but also allows for the treatment of underlying anatomical abnormalities, such as stenoses.

This narrative review aims to provide an overview of current practices, outcomes, and potential complications associated with endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. It explores the various interventions, including thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, as well as adjunctive methods like balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon angioplasty, and stent placement. The article draws upon a comprehensive literature review of electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, to provide insights into the understanding of thrombectomy techniques and their implications in managing patients with thrombosed AV access.
