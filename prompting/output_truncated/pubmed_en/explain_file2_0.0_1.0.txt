This introduction provides an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marginalized and underserved populations in the United States. It begins by stating that as of June 2022, there have been 84.2 million infections and over 1 million deaths in the country. It highlights that historically marginalized populations, including minorities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals, have borne a disproportionate burden of hospitalizations and deaths.

The introduction emphasizes that Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations have higher infection and death rates compared to non-Latinx White groups. In particular, it mentions that younger people from these communities have approximately twice the age-adjusted death rates from COVID-19 compared to White groups.

The introduction then discusses the development of vaccines as an effective tool to reduce transmission, hospitalization, and deaths from COVID-19. However, it notes that vaccination rates have been lower in Black and Latinx communities. Only 48% and 63% of eligible Black and Latinx individuals had received at least one vaccine dose by June 2022, well below the national average of 78%. The article attributes this disparity to factors such as mistrust in the healthcare system and research enterprise among these communities, language barriers, immigration issues, lack of health insurance in low-paying jobs.

Furthermore, it highlights that health disparities during the pandemic are not random but rather rooted in longstanding racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities caused by structural racism and discriminatory policies regarding access to education employment housing healthcare. Although access to healthcare improved following the passage of Affordable Care Act (ACA), millions remain uninsured which compromises equitable care delivery during a health crisis.

The introduction also mentions how hospitals predominantly serving Black Latinx Indigenous communities were overwhelmed during the pandemic due to already strained low-resourced health systems resulting in limited access to advanced treatments critical care services.

To understand these disparities better within a broader context beyond just immediate circumstances living through COVID-19 outcomes; the article employs the World Health Organization (WHO) Conceptual framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health (WHO CSDH). This framework considers structural bases such as social class, socioeconomic and political context, structural determinants like policies, socioeconomic status, racism that shape exposure to intermediary social determinants. These intermediary determinants include health care access, occupational and housing conditions, psychosocial stress that ultimately determine an individual's unique social circumstances shaping behavior and risk for disease.

The introduction concludes by stating that this article will focus on the structural determinants that were essential drivers of health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also references a figure from a previous study illustrating the structural and social determinants of health contributing to racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes.

Finally, it briefly mentions some specific observations related to COVID-19 disparities among minorities living in hotspot counties and less-advantaged neighborhoods. For example, it notes higher rates of cases among Blacks and Latinx populations compared to their proportion in the population. It also highlights exponential growth in COVID-19 cases among Latinx individuals residing in less advantaged neighborhoods with low median household income and educational attainment.

Overall, this introduction sets up the context for understanding how marginalized populations have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 due to
