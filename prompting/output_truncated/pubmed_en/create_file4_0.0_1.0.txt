1. Introduction

Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, is a prevalent condition among older adults that significantly impacts their quality of life and independence (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). The multifactorial nature of sarcopenia suggests that various factors contribute to its development and progression. Among these factors, dietary intake and nutritional status have gained attention as potential modifiable determinants.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential nutrients known for their diverse physiological functions in the human body. Specifically, omega-3 PUFAs have been extensively studied for their anti-inflammatory properties and potential benefits in various chronic diseases (Calder et al., 2020). Emerging evidence suggests that PUFAs may also play a role in muscle health and sarcopenia outcomes.

While previous studies have investigated the association between dietary intake or blood levels of PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes in older adults (Beasley et al., 2019; Robinson et al., 2020), there remains a gap in our understanding regarding specific types of PUFAs and their correlation with sarcopenia parameters. Therefore, this study aims to explore the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with sarcopenia.

2. Methods

To address this research question, we will conduct a cross-sectional analysis using baseline data from the ongoing Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial. The ENHANce trial is a five-armed triple-blinded randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effect of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance among sarcopenic older adults (>65 years). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either protein supplementation alone or in combination with omega-3 supplements along with exercise interventions. Placebo interventions will also be included for comparison purposes.

Dietary intake of PUFAs will be assessed using 4-day food records, providing a comprehensive understanding of participants' habitual PUFA consumption. Additionally, the nutritional status of PUFAs will be evaluated by analyzing red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles, which reflect long-term PUFA exposure and metabolism.

Spearman's correlation coefficients will be calculated to explore the associations between PUFAs intake and status with sarcopenia-defining parameters such as muscle strength, mass, and physical performance. Furthermore, we will assess the relationship between PUFAs and other relevant outcomes including physical activity levels (step count) and quality of life measures (SF-36, SarQoL).

3. Expected Results

Based on previous literature suggesting potential roles for specific types of PUFAs in muscle health (Beasley et al., 2019; Robinson et al., 2020), we hypothesize that certain types of omega-3 PUFAs may exhibit positive associations with sarcopenia outcomes in older adults. Specifically, we
