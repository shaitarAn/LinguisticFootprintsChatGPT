Introduction

Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a significant concern in the aging population. It can greatly impact the daily lives of older adults by limiting their ability to perform essential tasks such as lifting heavy objects or engaging in physical activities like climbing stairs or walking. Sarcopenia affects a substantial proportion of community-dwelling older adults and nursing home residents. Malnutrition and low protein intake have been identified as contributing factors to the onset and progression of sarcopenia. As a result, nutritional supplementation, either alone or in combination with exercise, is currently recommended as a treatment strategy for sarcopenia.

In addition to protein intake, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have also been suggested to influence muscle physiology and the progression of sarcopenia. Dietary fat intake plays a crucial role in muscle structure and function. Fatty acids serve as an energy source for muscles while also being incorporated into various structures within skeletal muscles that contain phospholipid membranes, thereby optimizing muscle structure and function.

Omega-3 PUFAs are generally considered beneficial for musculoskeletal health due to their potential positive effects on muscle protein synthesis through anti-inflammatory properties, reduction of anabolic resistance, and improvement of insulin resistance. On the other hand, omega-6 PUFAs may have negative effects on muscles due to their pro-inflammatory properties.

The ratio between omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs dietary intake has been suggested as an important factor for musculoskeletal health. A higher ratio is considered beneficial not only for maintaining healthy muscles but also for other aspects of health such as cardiovascular health.

Despite these potential benefits, detailed data on usual dietary PUFA intake among well-defined sarcopenic older adults are lacking. Food records are commonly used tools to measure dietary intake but may be subject to recall problems or socially desirable responses which introduce bias into the data collected.

To address this gap in knowledge, this study aims to assess the dietary intake of PUFAs using food records and the nutritional status of PUFAs using the fatty acid composition of red blood cell (RBC) membranes in a sample of well-defined sarcopenic older adults. By examining both intake and status, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how PUFA consumption relates to nutritional status. Furthermore, this study seeks to explore associations between dietary intake and nutritional status of PUFAs with individual sarcopenia-defining parameters such as muscle strength, muscle mass, physical performance, as well as physical activity levels and quality of life.

Based on previous research findings, it is hypothesized that omega-3 PUFA intake will be low among sarcopenic older adults and that there will be a strong correlation between PUFA intake and status. Additionally, it is expected that higher omega-3 PUFA intake will be associated with improved muscle strength and mass, higher quality of life scores, increased physical activity levels in this population.
