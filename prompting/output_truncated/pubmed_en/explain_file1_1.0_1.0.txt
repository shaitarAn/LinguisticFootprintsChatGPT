This PubMed article is a narrative review that focuses on the use of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for treating thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The abstract provides a brief overview of the main points discussed in the article.

The introduction section expands on the context and importance of AV access for patients with ESRD who require hemodialysis. It emphasizes that thrombosis is a common complication in AV access, leading to delays in hemodialysis treatment and potential abandonment of access, necessitating catheter placement. The introduction also mentions that endovascular approaches have become preferred over surgery for treating thrombosed access.

The introduction goes on to describe various interventions used in endovascular thrombectomy techniques. These include removing thrombus from the AV circuit and addressing underlying anatomical abnormalities such as stenosis. Thrombolysis, which involves dissolving blood clots using fibrinolytic agents, can be performed using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices. Thrombectomy, which involves mechanically removing blood clots, can be done using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms.

Additionally, the introduction mentions adjunctive methods used to treat stenoses within the AV circuit such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon angioplasty, and stent placement. The section concludes by acknowledging potential complications associated with these procedures including vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain.

A literature search from electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted to write this narrative review article focusing on thrombectomy techniques and their complications related to managing patients with thrombosed AV access.

In summary, this article aims to provide an overview of current practices regarding endovascular thrombectomy techniques for treating thrombosed AV access in patients with ESRD. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these techniques and their potential complications in order to effectively manage patients with thrombosed AV access.
