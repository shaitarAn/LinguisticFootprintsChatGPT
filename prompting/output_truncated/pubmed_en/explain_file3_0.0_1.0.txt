This introduction provides an overview of the role of adenosine (ADO) in cellular metabolism and signaling, particularly in relation to extracellular ATP (eATP) and its conversion to extracellular adenosine (eADO). It highlights the importance of eATP and eADO as signaling molecules involved in various physiological processes such as blood pressure regulation, platelet activation, cardiovascular system remodeling, neurotransmission, anti-cell death mechanisms, promotion of cell growth, and immunoregulation.

Under normal physiological conditions, both ATP and ADO are present at low levels in the extracellular space. However, certain cellular conditions and stresses like cell membrane damage, ischemia (lack of oxygen), inflammation, and cancer can trigger the massive release of endogenous ATP. This release can occur through regulated vesicular exocytosis or ion channel/transporter-mediated release but also through direct cell destruction.

The accumulation of eATP serves as a danger signal or Danger-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP), attracting phagocytic cells to inflammatory sites and alerting the immune system about the presence of pathogen-associated molecules or tissue damage. The activation of inflammation by eATP is mediated through P2 purinergic receptors including ligand-gated receptors (P2X) and metabotropic nucleotide-selective receptors (P2Y). While most family members of P2Y receptors directly promote oncogenic processes in tumor cells themselves, P2Y receptors in immune cells indirectly regulate these processes.

Recent studies suggest that eATP activates a specific receptor called P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7) expressed on various immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), granulocytes, T cells, and B cells. This activation promotes the formation of an inflammatory complex called NLRP3 inflammasome which leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines like IL-1Î² and IL-18, enhancing anti-tumor immunity.

However, eATP is rapidly hydrolyzed to eADO in the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to higher levels of ectonucleotidases in solid tumors compared to non-tumor tissues. The canonical pathway for eADO production involves the sequential hydrolysis of eATP by CD39 and CD73 enzymes. CD39 converts eATP to extracellular ADP and AMP, while CD73 further hydrolyzes AMP into eADO.

Additionally, there is a non-classical pathway for eADO production mediated by enzymes such as CD38 and CD203a. These enzymes convert extracellular nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD) released via gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) regulation into ADPR, which is then consumed by CD203a to generate inorganic pyrophosphate and AMP. This AMP can be further hydrolyzed by various enzymes including prostatic acid phosphatase and tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase.

The half-life of eADO in the extracellular space is very short. It can be catalyzed directly into inosine by adenosine deaminase (ADA) or transported into cells via specific nucleoside transporters. Inside cells, adenosine undergoes various metabolic pathways including phosphorylation back to ATP or conversion into other metabolites like inosine or S-adenosyl-homocysteine involved in the methionine cycle.

In the tumor microenvironment, cancer cell death as a result of rapid growth or chemotherapy contributes to ATP release and subsequent accumulation of eADO. Treg cell deaths also provide ATP for immunosuppression through the action of CD39/CD73 enzymes. Additionally, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) highly express CD73 induced by A2B receptor activation, leading to sustained high levels of eADO concentration in colorectal cancer.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for understanding the metabolic pathways involved in eADO production, degradation, and
