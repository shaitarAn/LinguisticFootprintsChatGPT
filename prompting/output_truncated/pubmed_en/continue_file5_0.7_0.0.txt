The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global health crisis with significant morbidity and mortality. While the majority of COVID-19 cases are mild or moderate, a subset of patients experience severe disease characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and death. However, even in individuals with mild or moderate disease, there is growing recognition of persistent symptoms and long-term complications that can last for months after the initial infection, collectively referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID.

In the acute phase of COVID-19, the immune response plays a crucial role in controlling viral replication and clearing the infection. However, in severe cases, an exaggerated immune response characterized by a cytokine storm, lymphopenia, and dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses is observed. This dysregulated immune response is thought to contribute to the development of ARDS and multi-organ dysfunction.

In recent months, there has been increasing recognition of immune dysregulation in PASC. Several studies have reported persistent immune activation and inflammation in individuals with PASC, even in the absence of detectable viral replication. This suggests that immune-mediated mechanisms may be responsible for the persistent symptoms observed in these patients.

One of the key features of PASC is the presence of long-lasting fatigue, cognitive impairment, and post-exertional malaise, which are reminiscent of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Studies have shown that individuals with PASC exhibit abnormalities in immune cell populations, including persistent lymphopenia and alterations in the distribution and function of T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Moreover, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are elevated in individuals with PASC, suggesting ongoing immune activation.

In addition to immune cell dysfunction, dysregulation of the innate immune response has also been implicated in PASC. Studies have shown that individuals with PASC have increased levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18, which are known to activate innate immune responses. Furthermore, there is evidence of dysregulated type I interferon responses, with decreased production of interferon-beta (IFN-β) and impaired antiviral activity in individuals with PASC.

It is important to note that the immunopathology of PASC is likely to be heterogeneous, with different individuals experiencing different patterns of immune dysregulation. This heterogeneity may be influenced by various factors, including age, sex, comorbidities, and the severity of the initial infection. Longitudinal studies that follow individuals over time are needed to better understand the immunological changes associated with PASC and to identify potential biomarkers that can predict the development of long-term complications.

In conclusion, immune dysregulation appears to play a central role in both the acute and post-acute phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While the immunopathology of severe COVID-19 has been extensively studied, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying PASC is still limited. Further research is needed to unravel the complex interactions between the virus and the immune system in PASC and to develop targeted therapies that can restore immune homeostasis and improve the long-term outcomes of individuals with PASC.
