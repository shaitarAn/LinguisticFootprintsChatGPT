The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a significant global health crisis. While the majority of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience mild to moderate symptoms, a subset of patients develop severe disease characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan dysfunction, and death. Even more concerning is the emerging recognition of a distinct clinical entity known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or long COVID, which refers to a wide range of persistent symptoms and complications that can last for weeks to months after the acute phase of COVID-19 has resolved.

The pathogenesis of both severe COVID-19 and PASC is thought to be driven by dysregulated immune responses. During the acute phase of infection, SARS-CoV-2 triggers a robust immune response characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and the activation of various immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and T cells. This inflammatory response is crucial for viral clearance and resolution of infection. However, in some individuals, this immune response becomes dysregulated, leading to excessive inflammation and tissue damage.

Several studies have highlighted the role of cytokine storm, an uncontrolled and hyperinflammatory response, in the development of severe COVID-19. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) have been observed in patients with severe disease. These cytokines can contribute to the recruitment and activation of immune cells, vascular leakage, and tissue damage, particularly in the lungs.

In addition to the acute phase, immune dysregulation is also believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of PASC. Emerging evidence suggests that PASC is characterized by a persistent immune activation and chronic inflammation, even in the absence of detectable viral replication. This sustained immune response may contribute to the diverse range of symptoms observed in PASC, including fatigue, brain fog, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, and autonomic dysfunction.

The mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in PASC are not yet fully understood. It is hypothesized that viral persistence, immune cell dysfunction, and aberrant immune signaling pathways may contribute to the sustained immune activation observed in PASC. Longitudinal studies following COVID-19 patients over an extended period are needed to elucidate the temporal dynamics of immune responses and identify potential biomarkers of PASC.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that PASC is a heterogeneous condition, and different immune mechanisms may contribute to its pathogenesis in different individuals. Factors such as age, sex, comorbidities, and genetic predisposition may influence the immune response and subsequent development of
