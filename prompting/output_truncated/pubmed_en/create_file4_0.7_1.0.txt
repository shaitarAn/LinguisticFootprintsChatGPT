Introduction

Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, poses a significant challenge for older adults and has a detrimental impact on their daily lives. It affects up to 29% of community-dwelling older adults and up to 33% of nursing home residents. Malnutrition and low protein intake have been identified as contributing factors to the onset or progression of sarcopenia. As such, nutritional supplementation, either alone or in combination with exercise, is currently recommended as a treatment strategy for sarcopenia.

In addition to protein intake, the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in influencing muscle physiology and the progression of sarcopenia has gained attention. Fatty acids play an essential role in optimizing muscle structure and function by acting as an energy source for muscles and being incorporated into various structures within skeletal muscles. Omega-3 PUFAs are believed to have beneficial effects on muscle health, while omega-6 PUFAs may have negative effects due to their pro-inflammatory properties. Therefore, achieving a higher ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs in dietary intake is considered advantageous for musculoskeletal health.

The present study aims to explore the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with sarcopenia according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) criteria. The study utilizes baseline data from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial â€“ a randomized controlled trial investigating combined interventions (protein supplementation, omega-3 supplements, exercise) compared to single/placebo interventions on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

To assess dietary PUFA intake accurately over time rather than relying solely on short-term measurements prone to bias or recall problems, this study employs four-day food records as an objective tool. Additionally, the nutritional PUFA status is determined by analyzing the fatty acid composition of red blood cell (RBC) membranes, providing insights into long-term PUFA status. This biomarker has been studied in various populations but not yet in sarcopenic older adults.

The study aims to determine the correlation between dietary PUFA intake and nutritional status and explore associations with sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, muscle mass, physical performance), physical activity (step count), and quality of life (SF-36, SarQoL). It hypothesizes that omega-3 PUFA intake is low in sarcopenic older adults and that higher intake is associated with improved muscle strength and mass, higher quality of life scores, and increased physical activity levels.

By investigating the relationship between dietary PUFAs intake, nutritional PUFAs status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia, this study seeks to shed light on a potential avenue for mitigating or preventing sarcopenia through targeted interventions aimed at optimizing PUFAs intake. Furthermore, it aims to contribute valuable insights into the role of PUFAs in musculoskeletal health among this population.
