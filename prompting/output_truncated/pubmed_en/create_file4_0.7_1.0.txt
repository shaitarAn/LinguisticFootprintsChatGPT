1. Introduction

Sarcopenia, characterized by age-related loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, is a prevalent condition among older adults that significantly impacts their quality of life and independence (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). As the global population continues to age, there is an urgent need to understand the factors contributing to sarcopenia and identify potential interventions to mitigate its impact.

One area of interest in sarcopenia research is the role of dietary intake and nutritional status of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). PUFAs are essential fatty acids that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through dietary sources. They play crucial roles in various physiological processes, including inflammation modulation, cellular membrane integrity, and muscle metabolism (Calder et al., 2020).

Previous studies have suggested that PUFAs may influence muscle health in older adults. Specifically, omega-3 PUFAs have been associated with anti-inflammatory properties and improved muscle protein synthesis (Smith et al., 2015; Grayson et al., 2020). However, limited research has explored the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether there is a correlation between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The exploration will provide valuable insights into potential associations between PUFA profiles and key parameters defining sarcopenia such as muscle strength, mass, physical performance as well as overall physical activity levels and quality of life.

To address this research question comprehensively, data from participants enrolled in the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy Ageing (ENHANce) study will be utilized. ENHANce is an ongoing triple-blinded randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effects of combined anabolic interventions (protein, omega-3 supplement, and exercise) on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults (>65 years). This trial offers a unique opportunity to investigate the role of PUFAs in sarcopenia outcomes within a well-controlled intervention setting.

It is hypothesized that specific PUFAs intake and status may be associated with improved sarcopenia outcomes. Furthermore, it is expected that there may be gender differences in the relationship between PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes, as previous studies have suggested potential sex-specific responses to nutritional interventions (Grayson et al., 2020).

Understanding the potential correlations between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes has significant implications for developing targeted nutritional strategies to prevent or manage sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults. By elucidating these associations, healthcare professionals can provide evidence-based recommendations regarding PUFA-rich dietary patterns or supplementation strategies for optimal muscle health.

In conclusion, this study aims to explore whether there are correlations between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with key parameters defining sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The findings from this investigation will contribute valuable insights into the role of PUFAs in muscle health among older adults and inform future interventions targeting nutrition-related aspects of sarcopenia management.
