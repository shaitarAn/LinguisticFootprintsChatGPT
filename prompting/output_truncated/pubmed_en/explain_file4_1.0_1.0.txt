The introduction of this PubMed article discusses the role of diet in the development and treatment of sarcopenia, which is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. Sarcopenia is a concern in the aging population, as it can significantly impact daily life activities such as lifting heavy objects or walking up stairs. The article highlights that sarcopenia affects a significant portion of older adults living in communities or nursing homes.

Malnutrition and low protein intake are contributing factors to sarcopenia, while nutritional supplementation (alone or combined with exercise) is currently recommended as a treatment strategy. In addition to protein intake, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are suggested to influence muscle physiology and sarcopenia progression. Dietary fat intake plays a crucial role in muscle structure and function by acting both as an energy source for muscles and being incorporated into various structures of skeletal muscles.

There is evidence that omega-3 PUFAs have beneficial effects on muscle health, while omega-6 PUFAs might have negative effects due to their pro-inflammatory properties. Therefore, maintaining a higher omega-3 to omega-6 PUFA dietary ratio is considered beneficial for musculoskeletal health and other aspects such as cardiovascular health.

With increasing attention on high omega-3 PUFA intake as a potential treatment for sarcopenia, there is a need for detailed data on usual dietary PUFA intake among well-defined sarcopenic older adults. Food records are commonly used tools to measure dietary intake but may carry biases due to recall problems or socially desirable responses.

In addition to assessing dietary intake, it would be interesting to evaluate nutritional status by using objective biomarkers like the fatty acids composition of red blood cell (RBC) membranes. This biomarker represents longer-term PUFA status based on past month or two intakes.

Although RBC membrane fatty acid composition has been studied in various populations, including children, postmenopausal women, and men with prostate cancer, it has not yet been investigated in sarcopenic older adults. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess dietary PUFA intake and status using RBC membrane fatty acids composition in well-defined sarcopenic older adults according to the recent European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) criteria.

The study also aimed to determine the correlation between PUFA intake and status and explore associations between dietary intake/status of PUFAs and various sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, muscle mass, physical performance), as well as physical activity levels and quality of life. The hypothesis was that omega-3 PUFA intake is low in sarcopenic older adults and that higher intake would be associated with improved muscle strength, mass, quality of life scores, and increased physical activity levels.
