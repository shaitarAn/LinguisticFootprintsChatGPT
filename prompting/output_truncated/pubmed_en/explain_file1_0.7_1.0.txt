This introduction provides an overview of the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the treatment options for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), focusing on hemodialysis. It highlights the importance of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and graft (AVG) as preferred access for hemodialysis due to lower risks compared to central venous catheters. However, maintaining patency in long-term vascular accesses requires frequent interventions, impacting both healthcare resources and patients' quality of life.

The introduction also discusses thrombosis as a leading cause of access loss in AVF and AVG. It mentions various factors that contribute to access thrombosis, including stenoses, hypercoagulability, low ejection fraction, hypotension, hemoconcentration, and cannulation complications resulting in hematomas. Thrombosed access leads to delays in dialysis treatment and may require catheter placement.

Furthermore, it states that currently there are no FDA-approved pharmacological therapies to prevent access thrombosis effectively. The long-term effect of anti-platelet therapy and warfarin on access patency remains unclear.

The introduction highlights the importance of timely treatment for thrombosed accesses to avoid complications and discusses the differences between AVF and AVG regarding successful thrombectomy timelines. Previously surgical intervention was required for thrombectomy; however, with intravascular techniques under imaging guidance becoming available, endovascular thrombectomy has become the standard approach.

Additionally, it mentions that there has been an increase in endovascular procedures over time for AVFs and AVGs compared to two decades ago. Finally, it states that this article aims to review current practices related to endovascular thrombectomy techniques for treating thrombosed AVGs and AVFs based on a literature search from databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar.

Overall, this introduction sets up the context by discussing CKD prevalence globally, the significance of AVF and AVG as access for hemodialysis, the issues related to access thrombosis, and the need for effective treatment options.
