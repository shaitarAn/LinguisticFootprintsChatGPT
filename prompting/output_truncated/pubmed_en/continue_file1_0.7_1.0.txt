End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition in which the kidneys are no longer able to function properly, requiring patients to undergo hemodialysis for survival. Arteriovenous (AV) access, specifically arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), are commonly used to facilitate hemodialysis by creating a connection between an artery and vein. However, thrombosis, or the formation of blood clots within the AV access, can occur and lead to complications.

When thrombosis occurs in AV access, it can result in a delay in hemodialysis or even necessitate the placement of a dialysis catheter. Traditionally, surgical intervention was the mainstay of treatment for thrombosed AV access. However, over time, endovascular techniques have emerged as the preferred approach due to their minimally invasive nature and improved outcomes.

The endovascular approach involves several interventions aimed at restoring patency to the thrombosed AV access. One such intervention is thrombolysis, which involves using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices to administer fibrinolytic agents that dissolve the clot. Thrombolysis has shown promising results but carries a risk of bleeding complications.

Another technique employed is thrombectomy – mechanical removal of the clot from the AV circuit. This can be achieved using various devices such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic mechanisms that use high-velocity saline jets to disrupt and remove clots from vessels' walls through small incisions made distal from occlusions site or aspiration methods that rely on suctioning out clots using vacuum force generated by specialized devices.

In addition to removing clots themselves through mechanical means like these mentioned above; adjunctive methods may also be utilized if there are underlying anatomical abnormalities contributing to recurrent clot formation within an AVG/AVF system – such as stenoses in the AV circuit. These adjunctive techniques include cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement. Cutting balloon angioplasty involves using a balloon with microblades to score the stenosed vessel wall, allowing it to be dilated more effectively. DCB angioplasty applies an antiproliferative drug directly to the vessel wall during dilation to reduce the risk of restenosis. Stent placement is reserved for cases with severe or resistant stenoses.

While endovascular thrombectomy techniques have shown promising outcomes in restoring patency to thrombosed AV access, they do carry risks of complications. Vessel rupture is a potential complication that can occur during these procedures due to mechanical trauma caused by devices used or underlying fragility of vessels' walls secondary either anatomical factors like small-caliber vessels or pathological conditions such as arterial calcification seen frequently in ESRD population.

Arterial embolism is another possible complication that can arise when fragments of clot dislodge during the procedure and travel downstream causing occlusions at various sites within arterial tree further from original site where clot was initially lodged; this can potentially lead to ischemic damage if not promptly addressed.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is yet another complication associated with endovascular thrombectomy procedures for AV access maintenance. It occurs when clots dislodge from AV access system and travel through venous circulation reaching lungs where they cause blockages leading respiratory distress symptoms range from mild shortness breath chest pain severe respiratory failure requiring advanced life
