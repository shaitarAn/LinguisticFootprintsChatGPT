This article discusses the immune mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathology and the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as long COVID. The authors highlight that exaggerated immune responses play a crucial role in determining the severity and outcomes of both acute COVID-19 and PASC. They emphasize the need for in-depth mechanistic analyses to identify specific molecular signals and immune cell populations involved in PASC pathogenesis.

The introduction section provides an overview of PASC, which refers to prolonged symptoms or new health effects that occur after 4 or more weeks following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The exact reasons why PASC occurs are still largely unknown, making it important to understand its underlying mechanisms for developing appropriate preventive and treatment strategies.

The authors discuss how immune dysregulation is a key feature of acute COVID-19 as well as systemic and tissue-specific manifestations of PASC. However, they note that the causal mechanisms of immune dysfunction in PASC need further investigation, as they likely vary depending on clinical phenotype, initial infection severity, and specific tissues involved.

The article mentions the NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which involves over 100 researchers conducting studies on PASC using standardized protocols. This initiative aims to collect data from individuals across different age groups using electronic health records, surveys, and biospecimens to develop preventive and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and PASC.

The authors explain that within the RECOVER consortium, there is a Mechanistic Pathways Committee focusing on three priority areas: immunopathology (discussed in this article), viral persistence (covered in another companion paper), and tissue damage (also discussed separately). These areas are considered potential mechanisms underlying various clinical phenotypes of PASC. The goal is to identify gaps in understanding disease severity mechanisms through generating new ideas for research efforts.

Multiple researchers with expertise in adult and pediatric medicine collaborated to review the role of innate and adaptive immune systems in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC. The article emphasizes the dysregulation of immune processes intertwined with viral persistence and tissue-specific pathologies, which are important for addressing different PASC subtypes defined by RECOVER investigators. The authors discuss potential hypotheses for PASC-related immune dysregulation and suggest studies to answer these questions.

The article also highlights that while there may be differences between immune mechanisms during acute COVID-19 and those involved in PASC, studying acute immunopathology can provide a starting point for examining candidate pathways in PASC immunopathology. The authors outline established knowledge on acute COVID-19 as well as limited data on the immunopathology of chronic PASC to identify new avenues for research.

Overall, this article provides an overview of the current understanding of immune mechanisms underlying COVID-19 pathology and post-acute sequelae (PASC). It emphasizes the need for further research to elucidate specific molecular signals and immune cell populations involved in PASC pathogenesis, with the ultimate goal of developing precision therapies that restore healthy immune function in patients with long-term effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
