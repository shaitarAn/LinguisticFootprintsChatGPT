This introduction provides an overview of the topic of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as "long COVID." It explains that many adults and children experience prolonged symptoms after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and these symptoms are referred to as PASC or long COVID when they persist for four or more weeks after the acute phase of infection.

The introduction highlights that while it is clear that PASC can present with a variety of symptoms affecting different organ systems, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing appropriate preventive and treatment strategies.

The role of immune dysregulation in both acute COVID-19 and PASC is established, but the specific causal mechanisms need to be defined. The introduction suggests that immune dysregulation likely varies depending on the clinical phenotype of PASC, the severity of the initial COVID-19 infection, and the specific tissues involved. Well-designed studies are needed to elucidate these immune mechanisms in PASC.

The introduction then introduces the NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which involves over 100 researchers across the United States conducting studies on PASC. The initiative aims to generate a large SARS-CoV-2 recovery cohort by collecting data from individuals using electronic health records and surveys. Biospecimens will also be collected from a subset of participants. The ultimate goal is to use this data to develop preventive and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and PASC.

Within RECOVER, there is a Mechanistic Pathways Committee focusing on three priority areas: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage. This perspective article aims to provide an overview of current knowledge in these areas related to immune dysregulation in both acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC.

The article emphasizes that understanding immune mechanisms is essential for addressing different PASC subtypes defined by RECOVER investigators. It suggests that the acute immunopathology of COVID-19 can serve as a starting point for examining candidate pathways involved in PASC.

The introduction also discusses the role of neutrophil activation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in severe acute COVID-19. It highlights that excessive neutrophil activation and NET formation are associated with disease severity, but their potential role in long COVID or PASC is not well understood.

The introduction concludes by raising questions about how short-lived neutrophils can "remember" an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection that resolved weeks or months earlier, suggesting possibilities such as reprogramming of tissue cells or the bone marrow environment.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the article by providing background information on PASC, highlighting the knowledge gaps in immune dysregulation mechanisms, and introducing the RECOVER Initiative's efforts to study and understand these mechanisms.
