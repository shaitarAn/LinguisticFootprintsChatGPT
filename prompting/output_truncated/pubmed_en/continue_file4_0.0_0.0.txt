Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a significant public health concern among older adults. It is associated with increased risk of falls, disability, and mortality. Nutritional interventions, including the consumption of specific polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), have been proposed as potential strategies to mitigate sarcopenia.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The study utilized baseline data from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial, a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

Dietary PUFA intake was assessed using 4-day food records, while PUFA status was determined by analyzing red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles. The researchers calculated Spearman's correlation coefficients to examine the associations between PUFA intake and status with sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, mass, and physical performance), physical activity (step count), and quality of life.

A total of 29 subjects (9 males and 20 females) with a mean age of 76.3 years were included in the analysis. The participants' total omega-3 intake was found to be below the recommended intake levels for both males and females. Interestingly, there was no significant correlation between PUFA intake and status.

However, when examining the associations with sarcopenia outcomes, the researchers found that the status of Î±-linolenic acid (an omega-3 PUFA) was inversely associated with appendicular lean mass, while the status of docosahexaenoic acid (another omega-3 PUFA) was positively associated with appendicular lean mass. Some markers of PUFA intake and status were also positively associated with physical activity, quality of life, and SarQoL scores. On the other hand, the status of gamma-linolenic acid (an omega-6 PUFA) was inversely associated with the physical component summary score of the SF-36 questionnaire.

Overall, despite the low intake of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs in this population, the exploratory analysis generated new hypotheses regarding the potential correlations between PUFA intake and status with sarcopenia outcomes in older adults. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
