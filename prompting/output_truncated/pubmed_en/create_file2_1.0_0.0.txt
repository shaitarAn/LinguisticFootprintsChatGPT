Introduction:

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound impact on the United States, affecting millions of people and resulting in a significant number of deaths. Unfortunately, the burden of hospitalizations and fatalities has been disproportionately borne by historically marginalized populations, including Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals. These groups have experienced higher infection rates, hospitalization rates, and death rates from COVID-19 compared to non-Latinx white individuals. This disparity can be attributed to a range of structural, institutional, and socioeconomic inequities, such as limited access to healthcare, low-wage employment without health insurance, language barriers, and limited health literacy.

Mistrust in the healthcare system has also contributed to lower vaccination rates in minority communities, exacerbating existing health disparities. Despite the development and availability of vaccines, only 48% and 63% of eligible Black and Latinx individuals have received at least one dose, falling well below the national average of 78%. Factors such as long-standing mistrust, language barriers, immigration issues, and lack of health insurance in low-paying jobs have hindered vaccine access and uptake among these populations.

It is important to recognize that the health disparities observed during the COVID-19 pandemic are not random, but rather rooted in long-standing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities caused by structural racism and discriminatory policies. These disparities can be attributed to inequitable access to high-quality education, employment opportunities, housing, and healthcare. While the passage of the Affordable Care Act improved access to healthcare for some, millions of individuals remain uninsured, compromising the capacity of the healthcare system to deliver equitable care, particularly during a health crisis.

Furthermore, the pandemic has overwhelmed hospitals that primarily serve Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, further straining already under-resourced healthcare systems and hindering access to advanced treatments and critical care services.

In this article, we aim to explore the challenges faced by marginalized and underserved populations during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss the lessons learned from these experiences. We will examine the structural and social determinants of health that have contributed to the racial and ethnic disparities observed, as well as propose areas for action based on the World Health Organization's Conceptual Framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health. By understanding and addressing these determinants, we can work towards mitigating health disparities and promoting equity in relation to COVID-19 and future public health crises.
