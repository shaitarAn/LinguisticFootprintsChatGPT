Introduction:

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed and exacerbated existing health disparities in the United States, particularly among historically marginalized populations. The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, as well as immigrants and economically disadvantaged individuals, highlights the urgent need to address the underlying structural, institutional, and socioeconomic inequities that perpetuate these disparities. While previous research has extensively documented the disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities, limited attention has been given to understanding the role of cultural factors, such as traditional healing practices, in shaping health-seeking behaviors and healthcare access in these communities.

In recent years, scholars have increasingly recognized the importance of considering cultural factors in examining health disparities and improving healthcare delivery among marginalized populations. However, the existing literature has primarily focused on non-communicable diseases and has yet to comprehensively explore the influence of cultural factors on COVID-19 outcomes and access to care. Therefore, this study aims to fill this gap by investigating the impact of cultural factors, including traditional healing practices, cultural beliefs, and language barriers, on COVID-19 outcomes and vaccination rates among racial and ethnic minorities.

By identifying and analyzing the cultural factors that contribute to health disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, we can gain a deeper understanding of the unique challenges faced by marginalized populations and develop targeted interventions to promote health equity. Moreover, exploring the role of cultural factors in healthcare decision-making and access can inform the development of culturally-sensitive strategies to address disparities in COVID-19 vaccination rates and uptake.

This paper aims to contribute to the growing body of literature on health disparities in the context of COVID-19 by providing a comprehensive analysis of the influence of cultural factors on health outcomes and access to care among racial and ethnic minorities. By examining the lessons learned from existing research on health disparities during the pandemic and drawing from a framework of structural and sociocultural determinants of health, this study will provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between culture, healthcare access, and COVID-19 outcomes. These findings will inform policy makers, healthcare providers, and community stakeholders on the importance of integrating cultural competence and tailored interventions into COVID-19 response strategies, ultimately working towards mitigating health disparities and promoting health equity for all populations.
