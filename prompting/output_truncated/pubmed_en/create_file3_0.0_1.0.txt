Introduction

The adenosinergic machinery in cancer has gained significant attention in recent years due to its crucial role in regulating immune responses, particularly tumor immunity. Extracellular adenosine (eADO) signaling, which is primarily derived from the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP), has been implicated in mediating immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This intricate interplay between eATP and eADO, along with their respective purinergic receptors, not only affects immune cells but also influences various other cell types within the TME.

The TME is a complex ecosystem comprising immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells that collectively shape the fate of cancer progression. Dysregulation of this microenvironment can lead to immune evasion by tumors and subsequent disease progression. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the adenosinergic system within different cell types present in the TME holds great promise for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting immuno-oncology.

Previous studies have demonstrated that eATP acts as a pro-inflammatory molecule by binding and activating P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y) on immune cells. The release of eATP into the extracellular space occurs following cellular stress triggered by hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation-induced cell death. Conversely, eADO has been shown to exert immunosuppressive effects through activation of P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) on diverse immune cells.

In addition to modulating immune responses within the TME through direct effects on immune cells themselves, alterations in eATP hydrolysis to eADO can indirectly impact immunosurveillance by influencing other cellular components present within this dynamic environment. For instance, tumor cells have been found to express both P1 and P2 purinergic receptors on their surface. Activation of these receptors can regulate tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Furthermore, stromal cells within the TME, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, also express purinergic receptors that can modulate their functions and contribute to tumor progression.

Given the intricate network of interactions between eATP, eADO, and their respective purinergic receptors in different cell types within the TME, it is imperative to comprehensively understand the adenosinergic system's role in cancer biology. This knowledge will not only shed light on fundamental mechanisms underlying immune evasion but also provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for immuno-oncology.

In this review article, we aim to provide an up-to-date understanding of the adenosinergic machinery in cancer by examining its impact on various cell types present within the TME. We will explore how eATP hydrolysis to eADO alters immunosurveillance by affecting immune cells' behavior and function. Additionally, we will discuss recent advancements in our understanding of how P1 and P2 purinergic receptor signaling influences tumor cells' behavior and stromal cell functions within the TME.

Furthermore, we will highlight potential novel directions for adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology based on emerging evidence from preclinical studies and clinical trials. By elucidating key molecular players involved in this intricate signaling network and identifying therapeutic targets that can modulate adenosine receptor signaling pathways selectively or synergistically with existing immunotherapies, we hope to pave the way for more effective treatment strategies against cancer.

In conclusion, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of our current understanding regarding the adenosinergic machinery's role
