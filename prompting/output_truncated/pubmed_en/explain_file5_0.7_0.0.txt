This introduction provides an overview of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as "long COVID." It explains that many adults and children experience prolonged symptoms after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and these symptoms are referred to as PASC or long COVID if they persist for 4 or more weeks after the acute phase of infection. While the symptoms of PASC can affect different organ systems, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown.

The introduction highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of PASC for the development of appropriate preventive and treatment strategies. It mentions that immune dysregulation is a key feature of acute COVID-19 and likely plays a role in PASC manifestations. However, the specific causal mechanisms of immune dysfunction in PASC need to be defined, as they may vary depending on the clinical phenotype, severity of the initial infection, and specific tissues involved.

The introduction then introduces the NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which involves over 100 researchers conducting studies on PASC. The initiative aims to collect data from individuals across the lifespan using electronic health records and surveys, as well as biospecimens, to develop preventive and therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and PASC.

The introduction also mentions the Mechanistic Pathways Committee within the RECOVER consortium, which focuses on immune mechanisms, viral persistence, and tissue damage as potential underlying mechanisms of PASC. The article aims to provide an overview of current knowledge, raise important questions and hypotheses, and identify gaps in understanding the mechanisms of disease severity and sequelae of COVID-19.

The role of the innate and adaptive immune systems in the pathogenesis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC is discussed, with an emphasis on immune dysregulation, viral persistence, and tissue-specific pathologies. The article suggests that understanding the immunopathology of acute COVID-19 can serve as a starting point for examining candidate pathways involved in PASC.

The involvement of neutrophil activation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in severe acute COVID-19 is highlighted, as well as their potential role in PASC. The article mentions that further studies are needed to explore the role of neutrophils and NETs in PASC and their association with disease severity.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the article by providing background information on PASC, emphasizing the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms, introducing the RECOVER Initiative, and highlighting the role of immune dysregulation and neutrophil activation in COVID-19 and PASC.
