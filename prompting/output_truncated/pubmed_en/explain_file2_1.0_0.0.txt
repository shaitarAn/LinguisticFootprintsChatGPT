This PubMed article discusses the health disparities observed during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, particularly among historically marginalized populations such as Black, Latinx, and Indigenous individuals, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals.

The abstract highlights that these marginalized groups have experienced higher rates of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death compared to non-Latinx White individuals. It attributes these disparities to factors such as the disproportionate employment of marginalized groups in low-wage jobs without health insurance, mistrust in the healthcare system, language barriers, and limited health literacy. The abstract also mentions the lower vaccination rates among minorities, further exacerbating existing health disparities rooted in structural, institutional, and socioeconomic inequities.

In the introduction section, the article provides data on the impact of the pandemic in the United States, including the number of infections and deaths. It emphasizes that historically marginalized populations, including minorities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals, have borne a larger burden of hospitalizations and deaths. The article cites research showing higher infection and death rates among Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations compared to non-Latinx White groups. It also discusses the lower vaccination rates among Black and Latinx communities, attributing it to long-standing mistrust in the healthcare system, language barriers, immigration issues, and lack of health insurance in low-paying jobs.

The introduction further explains that health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic are not random but rather a result of long-standing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequities caused by structural racism and discriminatory policies. It mentions that although access to healthcare improved with the Affordable Care Act, millions of people remain uninsured, which compromises equitable care delivery, especially during a health crisis. The article also notes that hospitals predominantly caring for marginalized communities were overwhelmed during the pandemic, further limiting access to advanced treatments and critical care services.

The article discusses the challenges faced by marginalized and underserved populations during the pandemic and highlights lessons learned. It mentions the concept of structural and social determinants of health (SDOH) and references a framework proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) that examines root causes of disparities while identifying opportunities for action. The article focuses on the structural determinants that were essential drivers of health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Finally, the article provides data on the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on minorities living in hotspot counties and less-advantaged neighborhoods. It mentions significant differences in infection rates between Black and Latinx populations compared to non-Latinx White populations in various cities across the United States. The article concludes by highlighting the higher risk of community transmission and hospitalization for Latinx populations compared to White populations.

Overall, this article emphasizes the existence of health disparities in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among historically marginalized populations. It discusses the underlying factors contributing to these disparities and highlights the lessons learned from the pandemic with the aim of mitigating health disparities moving forward.
