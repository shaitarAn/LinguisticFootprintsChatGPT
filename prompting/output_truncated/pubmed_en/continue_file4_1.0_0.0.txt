Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a prevalent condition among older adults that has significant implications for physical independence, quality of life, and healthcare costs (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). In recent years, there has been growing interest in the potential role of nutrition, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in the prevention and management of sarcopenia.

PUFAs are essential fatty acids that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through the diet. They are known to play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and muscle metabolism (Calder, 2015). Omega-3 PUFAs, in particular, have been extensively studied for their anti-inflammatory and muscle-preserving effects (Abdelhamid et al., 2018). However, the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional status, and sarcopenia outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia is still unclear.

The present study aims to explore the relationship between dietary PUFA intake, nutritional PUFA status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The study uses baseline data from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial, which is an ongoing randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of combined anabolic interventions on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

The results of the study showed that the total omega-3 intake of participants was below the recommended intake, indicating suboptimal PUFA consumption in this population. Interestingly, there was no significant correlation between dietary PUFA intake and nutritional status, suggesting that other factors may influence PUFA metabolism and absorption.

Furthermore, the study found some intriguing associations between PUFA status and sarcopenia outcomes. Specifically, a higher status of alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 PUFA) was inversely associated with appendicular lean mass, while a higher status of docosahexaenoic acid (another omega-3 PUFA) was positively associated with appendicular lean mass. These findings suggest that different types of omega-3 PUFAs may have distinct effects on muscle mass in sarcopenic older adults.

Additionally, the study observed positive associations between certain PUFA intake and status markers and physical activity, quality of life, and sarcopenia-related outcomes. This suggests that adequate PUFA intake and status may have beneficial effects on physical function and overall well-being in older adults with sarcopenia.

Although this study has provided valuable exploratory insights into the relationship between PUFA intake, status, and sarcopenia outcomes, it is important to note its limitations. The sample size was relatively small, and the study design was cross-sectional, limiting the ability to establish causality. Therefore, further research, including larger randomized controlled trials, is warranted to validate these findings and investigate the mechanisms underlying the observed associations.

In conclusion, this exploratory study suggests that dietary PUFA intake and nutritional status may be correlated with sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. These findings highlight the potential importance of adequate PUFA consumption for the preservation of muscle mass and function in this population. Future research should focus on determining the optimal PUFA intake levels and identifying the underlying mechanisms through which PUFAs influence sarcopenia outcomes in older adults.
