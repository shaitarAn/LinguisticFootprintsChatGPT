Introduction

Sarcopenia, characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength with aging, is a prevalent condition among older adults that significantly impairs their physical function and quality of life (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). As the global population continues to age, the burden of sarcopenia is expected to increase substantially in the coming decades (Demontiero et al., 2012). Therefore, understanding the factors that contribute to sarcopenia and identifying potential interventions are crucial for promoting healthy aging.

Dietary factors have been recognized as important contributors to muscle health and function. Among these dietary factors, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have gained particular attention due to their diverse roles in human physiology and potential impact on muscle metabolism. PUFAs are essential fats that cannot be synthesized by the body and must therefore be obtained through dietary sources. Omega-3 PUFAs include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are primarily found in fish oil, while omega-6 PUFAs encompass linoleic acid (LA), an essential fatty acid abundant in vegetable oils. Both omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs have been implicated in various health outcomes, including inflammation modulation, cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and now emerging evidence suggests their potential role in sarcopenia.

Despite growing interest in understanding the relationship between PUFAs intake or status with sarcopenia outcomes among older adults living with sarcopenia within community settings remains limited. Most studies examining this association have largely focused on specific subpopulations such as institutionalized older adults or those residing within clinical care environments. Furthermore, few studies have investigated both dietary intake patterns of different types of PUFAs as well as measures assessing nutritional status reflecting actual PUFA levels present within relevant body tissues.

Therefore Exploratory results from the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy Ageing (ENHANce) trial offer a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs with sarcopenia outcomes among community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The ENHANce trial is an ongoing five-armed triple-blinded randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the impact of combined anabolic interventions, including protein supplementation, omega-3 supplements, and exercise, on physical performance in community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with sarcopenia. By utilizing baseline data collected from this trial, we can investigate whether there are associations between dietary PUFAs intake measured through 4-day food records and nutritional status assessed via red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles with sarcopenic parameters such as muscle strength, mass, physical performance as well as physical activity levels and quality of life.

Understanding these potential correlations will provide valuable insights into the role of PUFAs in influencing muscle health among older adults affected by sarcopenia within community settings. Identifying specific types of PUFAs that may be associated with favorable or unfavorable outcomes could help inform targeted nutritional interventions aimed at mitigating or preventing further decline in muscle mass and function. Moreover, exploring how PUFA status relates to quality of life measures will shed light on potential psychological as well as physical benefits associated with adequate PUFA intake.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore potential associations between dietary intake patterns and nutritional status markers for specific types of PUFAs
