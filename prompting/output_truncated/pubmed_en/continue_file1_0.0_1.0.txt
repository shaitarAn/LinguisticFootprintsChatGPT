End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition in which the kidneys are no longer able to function properly, requiring patients to undergo hemodialysis for the removal of waste products and excess fluid from their blood. Arteriovenous (AV) access, such as arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), are commonly used to facilitate hemodialysis in these patients. However, thrombosis, or the formation of blood clots within the AV access, can occur and lead to complications.

Thrombosis of AV access can result in a delay in hemodialysis or even abandonment of the access site, necessitating the placement of a dialysis catheter. This not only disrupts the patient's treatment but also increases their risk for infection and other complications associated with catheter use. Therefore, prompt and effective management of thrombosed AV access is crucial.

Traditionally, surgical intervention was considered the standard treatment for thrombosed AV access. However, over time, endovascular approaches have emerged as preferred options due to their minimally invasive nature and lower morbidity rates compared to surgery. Endovascular techniques involve removing thrombus from the AV circuit while addressing any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to clot formation.

Thrombolysis is one such technique used in endovascular interventions for thrombosed AV access. It involves dissolving clots using fibrinolytic agents delivered through infusion catheters or pulse injector devices. Thrombolysis has shown promising results in restoring patency to occluded vessels; however, it carries a risk of bleeding complications due to systemic administration of fibrinolytic agents.

Another approach is mechanical thrombectomy which involves physically removing clots from the AV circuit using various devices such as embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic mechanisms that create high-velocity saline jets for clot disruption, and aspiration mechanisms that suction out the thrombus. Mechanical thrombectomy offers the advantage of immediate restoration of blood flow without the need for systemic fibrinolytic agents. However, it also carries a risk of complications such as vessel rupture or embolism.

In addition to thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, adjunctive methods may be employed to treat stenoses in the AV circuit. Cutting balloon angioplasty involves using a balloon with microsurgical blades to incise and dilate stenotic lesions. Drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty utilizes balloons coated with antiproliferative drugs to prevent restenosis after dilation. Stent placement may also be considered in cases where there is significant residual stenosis or vessel collapse.

While endovascular techniques have revolutionized the management of thrombosed AV access, they are not without risks. Complications can include vessel rupture during intervention, arterial embolism due to dislodgement of clots or debris, pulmonary embolism (PE) if clots migrate to the lungs, and paradoxical embolism if clots travel from venous circulation to arterial circulation through an intracardiac shunt.

To provide an overview of current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for thrombosed AV access in ESRD patients, a narrative review was conducted based on literature search from electronic databases including PubMed and Google Scholar. The aim was to summarize existing knowledge on different approaches used for access maintenance in this population while highlighting potential complications associated with these interventions.

In conclusion, endovascular approaches have become the preferred treatment option for managing thrombosed AV access in
