End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition characterized by the irreversible loss of kidney function, requiring patients to undergo hemodialysis for survival. Arteriovenous (AV) access, such as arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), are commonly used to facilitate hemodialysis. However, thrombosis of AV access can occur, leading to significant complications.

Thrombosed AV access can result in delayed or missed hemodialysis sessions, which can have detrimental effects on the patient's health. In some cases, the thrombosis may be so severe that it necessitates the abandonment of the AV access altogether, requiring the placement of a dialysis catheter. This not only increases healthcare costs but also poses an increased risk of infection and other complications.

Traditionally, surgical intervention was considered the standard treatment for thrombosed AV access. However, with advancements in endovascular techniques and devices, an endovascular approach has become increasingly favored over surgery. Endovascular interventions involve removing thrombus from the AV circuit and addressing any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to thrombosis.

Thrombolysis is one method used in endovascular treatment where fibrinolytic agents are infused through catheters or pulse injector devices to dissolve the clot. Thrombectomy involves mechanically removing the clot using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic mechanisms that use high-velocity saline jets to disrupt and remove clots or aspiration mechanisms that suction out clots.

In addition to these techniques, adjunctive methods such as cutting balloon angioplasty - which uses a balloon with microblades on its surface - drug-coated balloon angioplasty - where a balloon coated with medication is used - and stent placement may be employed to treat stenoses within the AV circuit.

While these endovascular techniques have shown promising results in the management of thrombosed AV access, they are not without risks. Complications can arise during these procedures, including vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain. Therefore, a thorough understanding of these techniques and their potential complications is crucial for healthcare providers involved in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

This narrative review article aims to provide an overview of current practices and outcomes in endovascular thrombectomy techniques for the treatment of thrombosed AVGs and AVFs. The information presented here is based on a comprehensive literature search from electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar.

In conclusion, endovascular approaches have become the preferred treatment option for thrombosed AV access in patients with ESRD. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy techniques offer effective means of restoring patency to occluded grafts or fistulas. However, it is important for healthcare providers to be aware of potential complications associated with these procedures to ensure optimal patient outcomes. Further research is needed to continue improving our understanding and refining endovascular techniques for maintaining access in the ESRD population.
