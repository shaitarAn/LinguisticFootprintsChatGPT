This introduction provides background information on the role of adenosine (ADO) in the body and its connection to ATP catabolism and the synthesis of signaling molecules such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). It also discusses the significance of extracellular nucleotides, including purines and pyrimidines, as signaling molecules in various systems such as blood pressure regulation, platelet activation, cardiovascular system remodeling, neurotransmission, anti-cell death, cell growth promotion, and immunoregulation.

Under normal conditions, both ATP and ADO are present in low levels in the extracellular space. However, certain cell conditions and stresses such as cell membrane damage, ischemia, inflammation, and cancer can trigger the release of ATP in large amounts through different mechanisms. This accumulation of extracellular ATP (eATP) acts as a danger signal to attract phagocytic cells to the site of inflammation and alert the immune system about the presence of pathogen-associated molecules and cell/tissue damage.

The inflammatory response triggered by eATP is mediated through P2 purinergic receptors, including ligand-gated receptors (P2X) and metabotropic nucleotide-selective receptors (P2Y). While most P2Y receptors promote oncogenic processes directly in tumor cells, they regulate these processes indirectly in immune cells.

Recent studies suggest that eATP activates P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7) expressed on various immune cells to promote the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of inflammatory cytokines, enhancing anti-tumor immunity. However, eATP is rapidly converted to extracellular adenosine (eADO) in the tumor microenvironment due to higher levels of ectonucleotidases in solid tumors.

The production of eADO primarily occurs through the sequential hydrolysis of eATP by established ectonucleotidases, CD39 and CD73. This canonical pathway converts eATP to extracellular ADP, then AMP, and finally to eADO. However, eAMP can also be phosphorylated back to eATP through other enzymes. Additionally, a non-classical pathway involving CD38 and CD203a can produce eADO from extracellular nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD).

The half-life of eADO is short in the extracellular space, but its concentration can remain high in the tumor microenvironment due to cancer cell death, Treg cell deaths, and the expression of CD73 by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).

Overall, this introduction provides an overview of the production and metabolism of eADO and highlights its role in tumor growth.
