This article focuses on the health disparities in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically how certain populations, including Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals, have been disproportionately affected. These marginalized groups are more likely to be employed in low-wage jobs without health insurance and have higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19 compared to non-Latinx White individuals.

The article highlights several factors that contribute to these health disparities. Mistrust in the healthcare system, language barriers, limited health literacy, and structural inequities rooted in racism and discriminatory policies all play a role. These factors have also impacted vaccination rates among minority populations.

The authors discuss lessons learned from the past two years of the pandemic and how to mitigate these health disparities moving forward. They emphasize the importance of addressing structural determinants of health such as social class, government policies, socioeconomic status, racism, access to healthcare services etc., using a conceptual framework proposed by WHO. The article also mentions that COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on minorities living in hotspot counties with lower socioeconomic conditions.

In conclusion,this article provides an overview of how certain marginalized populations have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 due to various social determinants of health. It emphasizes the need for addressing systemic inequalities in order to improve healthcare access and outcomes for these communities during public health crises like pandemics.
