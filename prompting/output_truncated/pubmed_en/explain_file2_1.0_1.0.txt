The introduction of this PubMed article presents an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marginalized populations in the United States. It begins by stating key statistics, such as the number of infections and deaths caused by COVID-19 in the country. It emphasizes that historically marginalized populations, including minorities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals, have borne a disproportionate burden of hospitalizations and deaths.

The introduction then highlights racial and ethnic disparities in infection and death rates among different population groups. Black, Latinx, and Indigenous populations are noted to have higher rates compared to non-Latinx White groups. Furthermore, it mentions that younger people from Black and Latinx populations have approximately twice as high death rates as compared to White groups.

The next focus is on vaccination rates among marginalized communities. It is mentioned that vaccination rates have been lower in Black and Latinx communities compared to the national average. Factors such as mistrust in the healthcare system, language barriers, immigration issues, lack of health insurance in low-paying jobs are cited as reasons for this disparity.

The introduction also highlights structural racism and discriminatory policies regarding access to education, employment housing, and healthcare as underlying causes for health disparities during the pandemic. The passage of the Affordable Care Act improved access to healthcare but millions remain uninsured.

Additionally mentioned is how hospitals predominantly serving marginalized communities were overwhelmed during the pandemic leading to limited access to advanced treatments and critical care services.

The concept of structural determinants of health (SDOH) is introduced using a framework proposed by World Health Organization (WHO). This framework suggests that social class impacts socioeconomic context which further influences policies & structures determining exposure to intermediary social determinants affecting health outcomes.

Lastly highlighted are specific examples demonstrating racial disparities during COVID-19 - higher proportions cases among Blacks & Latinx individuals living hotspot counties or less advantaged neighborhoods in various cities across America compared with Whites.

Overall, this article aims at discussing challenges faced by marginalized populations during COVID-19 and drawing attention to the structural and social determinants of health that contributed to these disparities.
