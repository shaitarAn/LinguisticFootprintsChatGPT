Introduction:

The introduction to the PubMed article highlights the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically focusing on its disproportionate effect on historically marginalized populations in the United States. It begins by providing statistics to emphasize the scale of the crisis, stating that as of June 2022, 84.2 million people in the U.S. have been infected and over 1 million have died.

The introduction goes on to discuss how certain populations, such as minorities, immigrants, and economically disadvantaged individuals, have borne a greater burden of hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19. In particular, it highlights that Black, Latinx (referring to individuals with Latin American or Hispanic heritage), and Indigenous populations have higher infection and death rates compared to non-Latinx White groups.

The article then shifts focus towards vaccination rates within these marginalized communities. It notes that while vaccines have proven effective in reducing transmission and severe illness from COVID-19 since their initial development during the first year of the pandemic, there has been lower uptake among Black and Latinx communities compared to national averages.

Several barriers contribute to this lower vaccination rate among marginalized populations cited in this introduction. These barriers include long-standing mistrust in healthcare systems and research institutions by Black and Latinx communities; language barriers; immigration issues; lack of health insurance for low-paying jobs; as well as inequalities caused by systemic racism regarding access to education, employment opportunities housing quality healthcare.

Furthermore, it is mentioned that despite improvements following passage Affordable Care Act (ACA), millions remain uninsured compromising equitable care delivery capability where already strained hospitals predominantly serving minority groups are overwhelmed during pandemics exacerbating existing disparities

To understand these disparities better along with exploring potential solutions for action against them during public health crises such as COVID-19 according World Health Organization Conceptual Framework for Action Social Determinants Health (WHO CSDH) is invoked[5].It examines various levels at which disparities manifest themselves starting from a structural basis like social class has socioeconomic and political context (government, policies, cultures) to downstream exposure which includes access health care, occupational housing conditions psychosocial stressors ultimately leading individual's specific social circumstances.

The introduction concludes by underscoring the importance of recognizing structural determinants as essential drivers of health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic. This sets the stage for the remainder of the article, which focuses on discussing challenges faced by marginalized and underserved populations and exploring lessons learned from this ongoing crisis.
