The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a significant global burden of disease. While the majority of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover within a few weeks, there is a growing recognition of a subset of patients who continue to experience persistent symptoms long after the initial infection has resolved. This condition, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID, encompasses a wide range of symptoms including fatigue, dyspnea, cognitive impairment, and musculoskeletal pain.

The underlying mechanisms driving PASC are not yet fully understood but emerging evidence suggests that immune dysregulation plays a crucial role. In severe cases of COVID-19, an exaggerated immune response characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of immune cells leads to tissue damage and organ dysfunction. This phenomenon, often referred to as cytokine storm or hyperinflammation, is thought to contribute to the severity and poor outcomes observed in these patients.

Similarly, it is hypothesized that dysregulated immune responses may also underlie the development and persistence of PASC symptoms. However, the immunopathology underlying PASC appears to be distinct from that seen during acute infection. While acute COVID-19 is characterized by an overwhelming inflammatory response with activation of both innate and adaptive immune cells, PASC seems to be associated with more subtle alterations in immune function.

Several studies have reported persistent abnormalities in various components of the immune system among individuals with PASC. For instance, some patients exhibit prolonged elevation in circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), suggesting ongoing low-grade inflammation. Others have shown alterations in T cell subsets with decreased numbers or impaired function.

In addition to these systemic changes in immunity, there is growing evidence of tissue-specific immune dysregulation in PASC. For example, studies have demonstrated the presence of persistent immune cell infiltration in affected organs such as the lungs and heart, suggesting ongoing local inflammation. Furthermore, autoantibodies targeting various self-antigens have been detected in a subset of PASC patients, indicating potential autoimmune mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis.

Despite these intriguing findings, our understanding of the immunopathology underlying PASC remains limited. The heterogeneity of symptoms and clinical presentations among PASC patients suggests that multiple mechanisms may be at play. Moreover, it is unclear whether the immune dysregulation observed in PASC is a consequence of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection or represents a distinct pathological process.

To address these knowledge gaps, large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to
