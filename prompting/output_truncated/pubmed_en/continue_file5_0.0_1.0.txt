The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in millions of cases worldwide. While the majority of individuals experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover within a few weeks, a significant proportion develop severe disease and require hospitalization. Additionally, there is growing recognition of a subset of patients who continue to experience persistent symptoms long after the initial infection has resolved, known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID.

Mounting evidence suggests that dysregulated immune responses play a crucial role in both the severity of acute COVID-19 and the development of PASC. During the acute phase, SARS-CoV-2 infects respiratory epithelial cells through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. This triggers an innate immune response characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferons. These cytokines recruit immune cells to the site of infection and activate adaptive immune responses.

In severe cases, however, this initial response becomes dysregulated and leads to an excessive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines known as a cytokine storm. This hyperinflammatory state can result in tissue damage throughout the body, particularly in organs such as the lungs, heart, kidneys, and liver. The dysregulation is thought to be driven by an imbalance between pro-inflammatory signals produced by activated immune cells and anti-inflammatory signals that normally dampen inflammation.

In addition to this acute immunopathology observed during active infection with SARS-CoV-2, emerging evidence suggests that PASC may involve distinct mechanisms related to chronic inflammation or autoimmune processes. Longitudinal studies have shown persistent activation of certain immune cell populations even after viral clearance. For example, T lymphocytes have been found to exhibit altered phenotypes and functional exhaustion in PASC patients. This suggests that the immune system may be trapped in a state of chronic activation, leading to ongoing tissue damage and symptoms.

Furthermore, autoantibodies targeting various self-antigens have been detected in some PASC patients. These autoantibodies may contribute to the development of autoimmune-like manifestations such as fatigue, joint pain, and neurological symptoms. The underlying mechanisms driving the production of these autoantibodies are not yet fully understood but could involve molecular mimicry or epitope spreading triggered by the initial viral infection.

It is important to note that while there may be shared immunopathological mechanisms between acute COVID-19 and PASC, there is likely significant heterogeneity among individuals with long COVID. Factors such as age, sex, comorbidities, and genetic predisposition may influence the specific immune dysregulation observed in each patient. Therefore, large-scale longitudinal studies involving diverse patient populations are needed to unravel the complex immunological underpinnings of PASC.

Understanding the immune mechanisms underlying both acute COVID-19 pathology and PASC is crucial for developing targeted therapies that can restore healthy immune function in affected individuals. Potential therapeutic strategies include modulating cytokine levels using anti-inflammatory agents or cytokine inhibitors during acute infection or targeting specific immune cell populations involved in chronic inflammation during PASC.

In conclusion, dysregulated immune responses play a central role in both severe acute COVID-19 pathology and the development of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). While some parallel mechanisms may exist
