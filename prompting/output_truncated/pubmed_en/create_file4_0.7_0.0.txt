Introduction

Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a growing concern in the aging population, affecting up to 29% of community-dwelling older adults and up to 33% of nursing home residents. Malnutrition and low protein intake contribute to the onset and progression of sarcopenia, making nutritional supplementation a recommended treatment strategy. In addition to protein intake, the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in muscle physiology and sarcopenia progression is gaining attention.

Dietary fat intake plays a crucial role in muscle structure and function. Fatty acids not only serve as an energy source for muscles but also contribute to the optimization of muscle structure and function by incorporating into various skeletal muscle structures. Omega-3 PUFAs are believed to have beneficial effects on muscle health, while omega-6 PUFAs may have negative effects due to their pro-inflammatory properties. Therefore, a higher dietary intake ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs is considered beneficial for musculoskeletal and cardiovascular health.

However, detailed data on the usual dietary intake of PUFAs in well-defined sarcopenic older adults are lacking. To address this gap, the present study aimed to assess the dietary intake of PUFAs and their nutritional status in a sample of sarcopenic older adults using food records and red blood cell (RBC) membrane fatty acid composition, respectively. The study also explored the correlation between PUFA intake and status. Furthermore, the associations between PUFA intake and status with sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical performance), physical activity, and quality of life (QoL) were examined.

The hypothesis of this study is that the intake of omega-3 PUFAs is low in sarcopenic older adults and that this intake is well correlated with their nutritional status. Additionally, it is presumed that higher omega-3 intake is associated with improved muscle strength and mass, higher QoL scores, and increased physical activity.

This study's findings will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between dietary intake, nutritional status of specific PUFAs, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. Furthermore, it will provide insights into the potential benefits of omega-3 PUFA intake as a treatment strategy for sarcopenia.
