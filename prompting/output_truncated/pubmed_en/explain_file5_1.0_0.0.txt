This introduction of the PubMed article discusses post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as 'long COVID', which refers to the prolonged symptoms experienced by individuals after recovering from acute COVID-19. The authors note that while it is clear that PASC can present with various symptoms affecting different organ systems, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. They emphasize the importance of understanding these mechanisms for the development of preventive and treatment strategies.

The authors then mention the NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which involves over 100 researchers conducting studies on PASC. The initiative aims to collect data from individuals across different age groups using electronic health records and patient surveys, as well as biospecimens. The ultimate goal is to use the data to develop treatments for COVID-19 and PASC.

The authors explain that the Mechanistic Pathways Committee within the RECOVER consortium focuses on three priority areas: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage. This perspective article specifically focuses on the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC. It highlights the dysregulation of immune processes that are intertwined with viral persistence and tissue-specific pathologies.

The introduction goes on to discuss the dysregulated innate immune response and poor adaptive immune responses observed in severe acute COVID-19. It also mentions the potential role of excessive neutrophil activation and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in promoting severe COVID-19. While the presence of NETs is elevated in acute COVID-19, their role in PASC is still unclear.

The authors state that studies suggest the persistence of neutrophil activation even after the acute infection has subsided, raising questions about how short-lived neutrophils can "remember" an infection that resolved weeks or months earlier. They propose that long-lived tissue cells or the bone marrow environment may play a role in reprogramming the immune response and promoting persistent activation.

Overall, this introduction provides an overview of the gaps in knowledge regarding the mechanisms underlying PASC and highlights the importance of studying the immune system's role in PASC pathogenesis.
