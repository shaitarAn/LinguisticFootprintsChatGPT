This introduction provides an overview of the article's focus on the mechanisms underlying post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as 'long COVID'. It begins by explaining that many adults and children experience prolonged symptoms after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. These ongoing, relapsing, or new symptoms and other detrimental health effects are referred to as PASC or 'long COVID' if they persist for 4 or more weeks after the acute phase of the infection.

The introduction emphasizes the unknown nature of why PASC occurs, highlighting the need to understand the mechanisms underlying it in order to develop appropriate preventive and treatment strategies. It suggests that immune dysregulation is a key pathogenic feature of acute COVID-19 and plays a role in PASC manifestations. However, the specific causal mechanisms of immune dysfunction in PASC are still unclear, and they likely vary depending on the clinical phenotype, severity of the initial COVID-19 infection, and specific tissues involved.

The introduction then introduces the NIH-funded Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, which involves over 100 researchers conducting studies on PASC. The initiative aims to collect data from individuals across the lifespan using electronic health records and patient-completed surveys, as well as biospecimens from a subset of participants. The ultimate goal is to develop preventive and therapeutic treatments for the public health impact of COVID-19 and PASC.

The introduction further discusses the Mechanistic Pathways Committee within the RECOVER consortium, which focuses on three priority areas: immunopathology, viral persistence, and tissue damage. This article is part of a series that provides an overview of current knowledge and raises important questions and hypotheses in these three areas to identify gaps in understanding the mechanisms of disease severity and sequelae of COVID-19.

Next, the introduction highlights the importance of immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC. It references the dysregulation of immune processes intertwined with viral persistence and tissue-specific pathologies. The article outlines the established knowledge on acute COVID-19 and the limited data on the immunopathology of chronic PASC, suggesting that the study of acute immunopathology can serve as a starting point for examining candidate pathways involved in PASC.

Following that, the introduction discusses the role of the innate and adaptive immune systems in the pathogenesis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC. It mentions the dysregulated innate immune response coupled with poor adaptive immune responses as drivers of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The activation of neutrophils and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are highlighted as key mechanisms in promoting severe COVID-19, but their role in PASC is less understood.

The introduction ends with the acknowledgment that while studies have established the critical role of excessive neutrophil activation and NET formation in severe acute COVID-19, little is known about their potential role in PASC. It raises questions about the persistence and programming of neutrophils in PASC, suggesting possibilities such as reprogrammed tissue cells or a reprogrammed bone marrow environment.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the article by providing a context for the study of immune mechanisms in PASC
