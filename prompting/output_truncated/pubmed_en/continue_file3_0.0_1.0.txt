The adenosinergic machinery in cancer refers to the complex network of signaling pathways involving extracellular adenosine (eADO) and its receptors in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This system plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses, particularly tumor immunity. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this adenosinergic machinery is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

Extracellular ATP (eATP) serves as a precursor for eADO production. Under conditions of cellular stress or damage, such as hypoxia, nutrient starvation, or inflammation, eATP is released into the extracellular space. This accumulation of eATP triggers pro-inflammatory responses by binding and activating P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y). These receptors are expressed on various immune cells and play a role in promoting inflammation.

On the other hand, eADO has been shown to mediate immunosuppression by activating P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) on immune cells. Activation of these receptors leads to inhibition of immune cell function and promotes an immunosuppressive TME. The balance between eATP-induced inflammation and eADO-mediated immunosuppression determines the overall immune response within the TME.

Notably, both P1 and P2 purinergic receptor signaling is not limited to immune cells alone. Tumor cells themselves express these receptors and can respond to changes in extracellular ATP/adenosine levels. Additionally, stromal cells present within the TME also contribute to this adenosinergic machinery by producing or responding to ATP/adenosine signals.

In recent years, there has been significant progress in understanding how this adenosinergic machinery influences tumor progression and response to therapy. For example, studies have shown that high levels of adenosine within the TME can inhibit anti-tumor immune responses, allowing tumors to evade immune surveillance. This has led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the adenosinergic pathway.

One such approach involves the use of adenosine receptor antagonists, which block the binding of eADO to its receptors and restore anti-tumor immune responses. Several preclinical and clinical studies have shown promising results with these antagonists in combination with other immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors.

Another strategy is to target enzymes involved in eADO production or degradation. For instance, inhibiting CD39 and CD73, enzymes responsible for converting eATP to eADO, can reduce immunosuppression within the TME. Similarly, blocking adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme that degrades eADO, can enhance its accumulation and potentiate anti-tumor immune responses.

Furthermore, recent advances in understanding the role of adenosine receptors on tumor cells have opened up new possibilities for targeted therapies. By selectively targeting specific adenosine receptor subtypes expressed on tumor cells, it may be possible to directly inhibit tumor growth or sensitize them to conventional therapies.

In conclusion, the adenosinergic machinery plays a critical role in regulating immune responses within the TME. Understanding this complex network of signaling pathways involving extracellular ATP/adenosine and their receptors is crucial for developing effective cancer therapies. Targeting this machinery holds great promise for improving outcomes in immuno-oncology and represents an exciting area of research with potential clinical applications in cancer treatment.
