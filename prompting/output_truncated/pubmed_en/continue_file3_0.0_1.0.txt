The adenosinergic machinery in cancer refers to the complex network of signaling pathways involving extracellular adenosine (eADO) and its receptors in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This system plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and has significant implications for cancer therapy.

Extracellular ATP (eATP) is a key player in this machinery, as it serves as the precursor for eADO production. Under conditions of cellular stress or damage, such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, or inflammation, eATP is released into the extracellular space. Once released, eATP can bind to and activate P2 purinergic receptors (P2X and P2Y), leading to pro-inflammatory responses.

On the other hand, eADO acts as an immunosuppressive molecule by binding to P1 purinergic receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) on various immune cells. This activation of adenosine receptors inhibits immune cell function and dampens anti-tumor immune responses within the TME.

Notably, both immune cells and non-immune cells within the TME express these purinergic receptors. Immune cells include lymphocytes such as T cells and natural killer cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Additionally, tumor cells themselves can express these receptors. Furthermore stromal components like fibroblasts also contribute to this adenosinergic signaling network.

Understanding the intricate interplay between eATP hydrolysis to eADO production is crucial for comprehending how this system impacts tumor immunity. By reducing levels of pro-inflammatory ATP while simultaneously enhancing immunosuppressive adenosine signaling through receptor activation on various cell types within the TME including both immune-competent infiltrating leukocytes but also tumor cells themselves, the adenosinergic machinery can significantly alter the immunosurveillance and immune responses against cancer.

Given the importance of this adenosinergic system in cancer, there is growing interest in developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways. By modulating eADO levels or blocking specific adenosine receptors, it may be possible to enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve outcomes for cancer patients. These potential directions for future adenosinergic therapies in immuno-oncology will be further explored and discussed in this review.

In conclusion, the adenosinergic machinery plays a critical role in regulating immune responses within the TME. The interplay between eATP hydrolysis to eADO production alters immunosurveillance and impacts tumor immunity. Understanding this complex network of signaling pathways provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for improving cancer treatment outcomes.
