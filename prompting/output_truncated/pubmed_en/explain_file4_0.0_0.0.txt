This introduction provides an overview of the importance of diet in the development and treatment of sarcopenia, which is the age-related loss of muscle mass and function. It highlights that sarcopenia is a growing concern in the aging population and can significantly impact the daily life of older adults. The introduction also mentions that malnutrition and low protein intake contribute to sarcopenia, while nutritional supplementation, including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), is recommended for its treatment.

The introduction further explains that dietary fat intake, specifically omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs, plays a crucial role in muscle structure and function. Omega-3 PUFAs are suggested to have beneficial effects on muscle, while omega-6 PUFAs may have negative effects due to their pro-inflammatory properties. Therefore, a higher omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs dietary intake ratio is considered beneficial for musculoskeletal health.

The introduction then states that there is a lack of detailed data on usual dietary PUFAs intake in sarcopenic older adults. To address this, the study aims to assess both dietary intake and PUFAs status using objective biomarkers, specifically the fatty acids composition of red blood cell (RBC) membranes. This biomarker reflects the nutritional PUFAs status based on intake over the past month or two. The study also aims to explore the correlation between intake and status of PUFAs and their associations with sarcopenia-defining parameters, physical activity, and quality of life.

In summary, this introduction sets the stage for the study by highlighting the importance of diet in sarcopenia, specifically the role of PUFAs. It emphasizes the need for more data on dietary PUFAs intake and status in sarcopenic older adults and outlines the objectives and hypotheses of the present study.
