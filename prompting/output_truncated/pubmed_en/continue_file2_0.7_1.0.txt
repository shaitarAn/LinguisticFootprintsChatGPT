The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shed light on the stark health disparities that exist within the United States. Certain populations, particularly Black, Latinx, Indigenous individuals, immigrants, and those who are economically disadvantaged, have faced a disproportionately high burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to non-Latinx White individuals. These disparities can be attributed to various factors including structural racism, socioeconomic inequities, and limited access to healthcare.

1.1 Structural Racism: A Major Contributing Factor

Structural racism plays a significant role in perpetuating health disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically marginalized groups have been subjected to systemic discrimination that limits their access to resources such as quality healthcare services and affordable housing. This lack of access has further exacerbated their vulnerability to COVID-19 due to living conditions that promote overcrowding and make social distancing difficult.

1.2 Socioeconomic Inequities: Impact on Health Outcomes

Economically disadvantaged individuals often find themselves in low-wage jobs without the luxury of paid sick leave or employer-provided health insurance. They are more likely to work in essential industries such as food service or retail where exposure risks are higher. As a result, they face increased rates of infection due to their inability to work from home or take time off when feeling unwell.

Furthermore, limited financial resources may hinder their ability to afford necessary preventive measures such as personal protective equipment (PPE) or seek timely medical care when symptoms arise. This economic disparity leads not only to increased infection rates but also higher hospitalization and mortality rates among these populations.

1.3 Mistrust in Healthcare Systems: A Barrier for Vaccination

Mistrust in the healthcare system is another critical factor contributing to health disparities during this pandemic. Historical injustices such as unethical medical experiments conducted on minority populations have eroded trust over generations.

This mistrust has been further magnified by misinformation campaigns, particularly on social media platforms, which have targeted marginalized communities. As a result, vaccine hesitancy has been prevalent among these populations, leading to lower vaccination rates and prolonged vulnerability to COVID-19.

1.4 Language Barriers and Limited Health Literacy

Language barriers pose significant challenges in disseminating accurate information about COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Many individuals from marginalized communities may have limited English proficiency, making it difficult for them to access crucial healthcare resources or understand public health guidelines.

Additionally, limited health literacy within these populations can hinder their ability to comprehend complex medical information or navigate the healthcare system effectively. This further exacerbates disparities by impeding access to testing sites, vaccination centers, and other essential resources.
