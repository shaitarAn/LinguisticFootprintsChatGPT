End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition characterized by the permanent loss of kidney function, requiring long-term hemodialysis to remove waste products and excess fluid from the body. Arteriovenous (AV) access, which includes arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), is crucial for patients with ESRD to receive hemodialysis. However, thrombosis, or the formation of blood clots, can occur within AV access, leading to complications such as delayed or inadequate dialysis. If left untreated, thrombosed access may necessitate the placement of a dialysis catheter, which is associated with higher infection rates and lower long-term patency rates compared to functional AV access.

In recent years, the endovascular approach has emerged as the preferred treatment option for thrombosed AV access, surpassing surgical interventions. This approach involves using minimally invasive techniques to remove the thrombus from the AV circuit and address any underlying anatomical abnormalities that may contribute to thrombosis, such as anastomotic stenosis.

Thrombolysis, the act of dissolving the thrombus, is a common technique employed during endovascular thrombectomy. This can be achieved by using infusion catheters or pulse injector devices to administer fibrinolytic agents directly into the clot. Thrombolysis is particularly effective in cases where the thrombus is small or easily accessible.

Alternatively, mechanical removal of the thrombus, known as thrombectomy, can be performed using various devices. Embolectomy balloon catheters, for example, can be inflated within the thrombus to mechanically disrupt and remove it. Rotating baskets or wires can be advanced into the clot to capture and extract it from the AV access. Rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms utilize high-pressure saline jets or suction devices to break up and remove the thrombus. The choice of thrombectomy technique depends on the size and composition of the clot, as well as the operator's preference and experience.

In addition to thrombus removal, adjunctive methods are often utilized to address any underlying stenoses within the AV circuit. Cutting balloon angioplasty involves using a balloon with microblades to selectively disrupt the stenotic tissue. Drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, on the other hand, utilizes a balloon coated with an antiproliferative medication to prevent restenosis. In some cases, stent placement may be necessary to physically support and maintain vessel patency.

Despite the advantages of endovascular thrombectomy, there are potential complications associated with these procedures. Vessel rupture, for example, can occur during aggressive thrombus removal or balloon angioplasty, necessitating immediate repair. Arterial embolism, including pulmonary embolism (PE), is a risk when dislodged thrombus migrates to a distant vessel. Paradoxical embolism to the brain can occur if a clot bypasses the pulmonary circulation through an arteriovenous shunt, leading to a stroke.

In conclusion, endovascular thrombectomy techniques have become the preferred approach for the management of thrombosed AV access in patients with ESRD. The selection of thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy depends on various factors, and adjunctive methods may be necessary to treat underlying stenoses. While these techniques have shown promising outcomes in restoring vessel patency, operators must be aware of the potential complications associated with these procedures. Continued research and advancements in endovascular techniques are essential to improve the outcomes of patients with thrombosed AV access.
