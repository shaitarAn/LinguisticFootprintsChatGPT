End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a condition that requires hemodialysis as a treatment option, and arteriovenous (AV) access is a crucial component of this process. Thrombosis of AV access, such as arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs), can greatly impact the ability of ESRD patients to receive hemodialysis effectively. When AV access becomes thrombosed, it can lead to delays in treatment or necessitate the placement of a dialysis catheter.

In recent years, the endovascular approach has emerged as the preferred method for treating thrombosed AV access compared to surgical interventions. This approach involves the removal of thrombus from the AV circuit and the treatment of any underlying anatomical abnormalities contributing to the thrombosis, such as anastomotic stenosis.

There are various techniques used in endovascular thrombectomy, ranging from thrombolysis to mechanical removal of thrombus. Thrombolysis involves the use of infusion catheters or pulse injector devices to administer fibrinolytic agents, which help to dissolve the thrombus. On the other hand, thrombectomy focuses on mechanically removing the thrombus using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic and aspiration mechanisms.

In addition to thrombectomy, adjunctive methods can be used to treat stenoses in the AV circuit. These methods include cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement. These techniques aim to reopen the narrowed or obstructed blood vessels to restore proper blood flow.

However, it is important to note that these procedures are not without complications. Some potential complications include vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the thrombectomy techniques and their potential complications is essential in the management of patients with thrombosed AV access.

To gather information for this narrative review, a literature search was conducted using electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar. By reviewing the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques, this article aims to provide healthcare professionals with a comprehensive overview of this approach for maintaining access in the end-stage renal disease population.

In conclusion, endovascular thrombectomy techniques have emerged as the preferred treatment option for thrombosed AV access in ESRD patients. By understanding these techniques and their potential complications, healthcare professionals can effectively manage and maintain AV access in this population. Further research and advancements in this field are necessary to improve the outcomes and long-term success of endovascular thrombectomy procedures.
