End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients rely on arteriovenous (AV) access for hemodialysis. However, thrombosis of the AV access can lead to significant complications, such as delays in hemodialysis or the need for dialysis catheter placement. To address this issue, the endovascular approach has emerged as the preferred method for treating thrombosed arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and fistulas (AVFs) over surgical intervention.

In this narrative review, we aim to examine the current practices and outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy techniques for AV access maintenance in the ESRD population. These techniques involve removing thrombus from the AV circuit, as well as addressing any underlying anatomical abnormalities, such as anastomotic stenosis.

One important aspect of thrombectomy is thrombolysis, which involves dissolving the thrombus using fibrinolytic agents administered via infusion catheters or pulse injector devices. This technique can effectively restore blood flow in the AV access, allowing for unhindered hemodialysis.

Another approach to thrombectomy is mechanical removal of the thrombus. This can be achieved using embolectomy balloon catheters, rotating baskets or wires, rheolytic, and aspiration mechanisms. Each of these techniques has its advantages and considerations, and the choice of method depends on the specific case and the expertise of the operator.

In addition to thrombectomy, adjunctive methods such as cutting balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty, and stent placement are often employed to address stenoses in the AV circuit. These techniques further optimize the patency and function of the AV access.

Despite the benefits of endovascular thrombectomy, there are potential complications associated with these procedures. Vessel rupture, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism (PE), and paradoxical embolism to the brain are rare but serious risks that need to be considered and managed appropriately.

To inform this narrative review, we conducted a comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar. Through this literature search, we have uncovered valuable insights into the techniques, outcomes, and potential complications of endovascular thrombectomy for maintaining AV access in ESRD patients.

In conclusion, the understanding of thrombectomy techniques and their associated complications is crucial in the management of thrombosed AV access in the ESRD population. By staying abreast of the latest practices and outcomes in this field, healthcare professionals can optimize patient care and improve outcomes for these vulnerable individuals.
