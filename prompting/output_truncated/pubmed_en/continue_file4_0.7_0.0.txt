Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a prevalent condition among older adults, leading to decreased physical performance and increased risk of disability and falls. Nutritional interventions, such as protein supplementation and exercise, have shown promise in mitigating the progression of sarcopenia. However, the role of specific dietary components, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in sarcopenia outcomes remains unclear.

PUFAs, particularly omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, have been implicated in various physiological processes, including inflammation, muscle protein synthesis, and muscle function. Previous studies have suggested that PUFAs may have a beneficial effect on muscle health, but the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia has not been thoroughly investigated.

The current study, conducted as part of the ongoing Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy Ageing (ENHANce) trial, aimed to explore the potential associations between dietary PUFAs intake, nutritional PUFAs status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The ENHANce trial is a triple-blinded, randomized controlled trial that investigates the combined effect of anabolic interventions, including protein supplementation, omega-3 supplementation, and exercise, on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

Baseline data from 29 participants (9 male, 20 female) were used for this exploratory, cross-sectional analysis. Dietary PUFAs intake was assessed using 4-day food records, while nutritional PUFAs status was determined by analyzing red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles. Correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the associations between PUFAs intake and status with sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical performance), physical activity (step count), and quality of life (SF-36, SarQoL).

The results indicated that the total intake of omega-3 PUFAs among the participants was below the recommended levels for both males and females. Interestingly, there was no significant correlation observed between PUFAs intake and PUFAs status. However, when examining the associations between PUFAs status and sarcopenia outcomes, it was found that higher levels of alpha-linolenic acid were inversely associated with appendicular lean mass, while higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid were positively associated with appendicular lean mass.

Furthermore, certain markers of omega-3 PUFAs intake and status were positively associated with physical activity, quality of life, and overall muscle function. On the other hand, gamma-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with the physical component summary score of the SF-36 questionnaire.

Overall, although the intake of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs was relatively low in this study population, these exploratory findings provide valuable insights into potential correlations between PUFAs intake and status with sarcopenia outcomes
