Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and function, is a significant health concern among older adults. It is associated with increased risk of falls, fractures, disability, and mortality. Nutritional interventions, including adequate intake of protein and specific nutrients, have been shown to have a positive impact on muscle health and physical function in older adults.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are a type of fat that have been studied for their potential role in preventing or ameliorating sarcopenia. Omega-3 PUFAs, in particular, have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and may play a role in muscle protein synthesis and muscle function. However, the relationship between dietary intake and nutritional status of specific PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes in older adults is not well understood.

The present study, conducted as part of the Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg (ENHANce) trial, aimed to explore the relationship between dietary PUFAs intake, nutritional PUFAs status, and sarcopenia outcomes in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. The ENHANce trial is a triple-blinded randomized controlled trial that assesses the effect of combined anabolic interventions, including protein, omega-3 supplements, and exercise, on physical performance in sarcopenic older adults.

Baseline data from the ENHANce trial were used for this secondary, exploratory, cross-sectional analysis. Dietary PUFAs intake was assessed using 4-day food records, and nutritional status was assessed using red blood cell membrane fatty acid profiles. The researchers calculated Spearman's correlation coefficients to explore the associations between PUFAs intake and status with sarcopenia-defining parameters, physical activity, and quality of life.

The study included a total of 29 participants, with a mean age of 76.3 years. The results showed that the total omega-3 intake of the participants was below the recommended intake for both males and females. Intake and status of PUFAs were not found to be correlated. However, there were some interesting associations between specific PUFAs and sarcopenia outcomes. For example, Î±-linolenic acid status was inversely associated with appendicular lean mass, while docosahexaenoic acid status was positively associated with appendicular lean mass.

In addition to these associations with sarcopenia outcomes, some markers of omega-3 PUFAs intake and status were also associated with physical activity and quality of life measures. These findings suggest that PUFAs may have a broader impact on overall health and well-being in older adults with sarcopenia.

Overall, this exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for potential correlations between PUFAs intake and status and sarcopenia outcomes in older adults. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand the underlying mechanisms. Future studies should also consider interventions aimed at increasing PUFAs intake and improving nutritional status to determine if these interventions can effectively improve outcomes in older adults with sarcopenia.
