The news article discusses the potential presidential run of a 43-year-old governor, who is considering running in the 2016 election. The governor, who has been gaining national attention through his role as vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association, stated that he would not make a final decision until after the November midterm elections.

The governor emphasized that his decision to run would not be based on polls or fundraising numbers but rather on whether he believes he can make a difference and offer unique ideas and experiences. He reflected on his previous decisions to run for Congress and governor, stating that he made those choices based on similar considerations.

During an appearance at a breakfast event, the governor unveiled an energy proposal from his nonprofit group called America Next. The plan supports an "all of the above" strategy for energy development but places particular importance on domestic oil and gas production through methods like hydraulic fracturing. This focus is significant because oil and gas play a critical role in Louisiana's economy.

The governor criticized the Obama administration's refusal to move forward with the Keystone XL pipeline, calling them "science deniers" when it comes to harnessing America's energy resources. He expressed support for strengthening U.S. efforts to combat Ebola in Africa and argued that there was both a humanitarian basis and vested interest in helping countries most affected by the outbreak.

When asked about confronting ISIS in the Middle East, Jindal stated that Congress should back White House proposals to train and arm Syrian rebels. However, he criticized repeated delays by the administration for allowing Islamic extremists' power to grow unchecked over time. He claimed that due to these delays, both friends and enemies do not trust or fear America.

Jindal also addressed topics likely popular with GOP primary voters such as spending controls and what he referred to as a "war on religious liberty" within the United States. He criticized President Obama for speaking eloquently about protecting Christians overseas while ignoring issues happening domestically.

In conclusion, the article highlights the governor's potential presidential run in 2016 and his considerations for making that decision. It also discusses his energy proposal, criticisms of the Obama administration, and his stance on various issues such as Ebola and ISIS. The governor's views align with conservative values and may resonate with GOP primary voters.
