This news article is about a 25-year-old naturalized American citizen born in Kosovo who planned a terrorist attack in Tampa, Florida. The suspect, identified as Osmakac, intended to carry out a car bombing followed by hostage-taking and the detonation of a suicide belt he planned to wear.

According to the criminal complaint made public on Monday, Osmakac expressed his desire for revenge against perceived wrongs done to Muslims and stated that he wanted to die "the Islamic way." He recorded a martyrdom video message shortly before his arrest expressing these sentiments.

The FBI became aware of Osmakac's plans through information provided by members of the local Muslim community. Assistance from the community was described as "very significant" throughout the investigation. Law enforcement officials emphasized that this case is not about religion or the Muslim community but rather an individual who committed a crime.

The suspect does not appear to have any ties to al Qaeda, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation. They believe he was "self-radicalized." There is no indication that anyone else was involved in pushing him towards carrying out this plot.

The federal investigation began in September when an informant informed the FBI that Osmakac had requested al Qaeda flags. By November, he started discussing potential targets for terror attacks in Tampa and sought help from an undercover FBI employee in obtaining weapons and explosives.

During their interactions, Osmakac expressed his desire for firearms such as AK-47-style machine guns and Uzi submachine guns along with grenades and an explosive belt. He even provided a $500 down payment for these weapons.

Osmakac's alleged bomb targets included nightclubs in Ybor City area of Tampa, Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office operations center also located there, as well as another business in South Tampa. However, by Saturday night before his arrest, it appears that his primary target had become an Irish bar in south Tampa.

After the car bombing, Osmakac planned to retrieve additional weapons and explosives from a hotel room in Tampa to continue his attacks. He intended to use the explosive belt to take hostages and demand the release of prisoners.

FBI agents arrested Osmakac on Saturday night, just after he recorded a video explaining his motives. The U.S. attorney stated that there was no real danger to the community once law enforcement became involved, thanks to tips from local Muslims and their ability to handle the situation effectively.
