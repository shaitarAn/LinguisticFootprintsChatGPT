This news article is about a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac from Florida who planned to carry out a terrorist attack in Tampa. He intended to use explosives and weapons to cause chaos and harm Americans. However, his plot was foiled thanks to the local Muslim community and law enforcement.

Osmakac had an AK-47, explosives, and a car bomb that he believed were real and planned to use against Americans. He also wanted to wear a suicide belt and take hostages as part of his attack. He expressed his desire for revenge for what he perceived as wrongs done to Muslims.

The local Muslim community played a crucial role in alerting authorities about Osmakac's ideology and intentions. Law enforcement worked with them throughout the investigation, which led to Osmakac's arrest.

It is important to note that there is no evidence linking Osmakac directly with al Qaeda or any other terrorist organization. Early information suggests that he was "self-radicalized," meaning he became radicalized on his own without direct influence from external groups.

The investigation into Osmakac began when someone reported him asking for al Qaeda flags in September. Over time, he discussed potential targets with an undercover FBI employee and sought help in acquiring weapons and explosives.

Law enforcement ensured that the weapons provided by Osmakac were rendered inoperable, so there was no threat posed by them. His alleged bomb targets included nightclubs in Tampa, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office operations center, and a business in South Tampa.

Osmakac planned on retrieving additional weapons from a hotel room after the initial car bombing so that he could continue his attacks. He wanted to take hostages and demand the release of prisoners from law enforcement agencies.

Fortunately, FBI agents arrested him just after he made a video explaining his motives when they deemed the attack imminent. The U.S attorney emphasized that thanks to the tips from the local Muslim community and the work of law enforcement, there was no real danger to the community.

Overall, this article highlights how cooperation between law enforcement and communities can help prevent potential acts of terrorism.
