(CNN) -- A massive tornado has struck Greenford, Ohio, causing significant damage and leaving several residents injured. The tornado touched down on Saturday afternoon, wreaking havoc on the small town located in Mahoning County.

Local authorities reported that the tornado first made landfall near James Traficant Jr.'s farm, the same location where the former congressman tragically died in a tractor accident just a few months ago. The severity of the storm's impact caused widespread destruction in the area, demolishing homes, uprooting trees, and downing power lines.

Eyewitnesses described the terrifying scene as the tornado barreled through Greenford, unleashing high winds and torrential rain. Many residents sought shelter in basements and safe rooms, bracing themselves for the worst. Emergency services swiftly responded to the disaster, tending to those injured and assessing the extent of the damage.

According to local police, numerous individuals sustained injuries due to flying debris and collapsed structures. Ambulances rushed the wounded to St. Elizabeth Health Center, where medical staff worked tirelessly to provide much-needed care. The full extent of the injuries has yet to be determined, and residents are urged to report any missing persons or additional casualties.

The path of the tornado cut through residential neighborhoods, leaving a trail of debris and destruction in its wake. Witnesses described scenes of homes reduced to rubble, vehicles tossed around like toys, and shattered glass littering the streets. Power lines were also severely affected, leaving a significant portion of Greenford without electricity.

Governor Mike DeWine has declared a state of emergency in Mahoning County, directing state resources to assist local authorities in their recovery efforts. The National Guard has been mobilized to aid in search and rescue operations and to restore essential services, such as electricity and clean water, which have been disrupted by the storm.

The community of Greenford is no stranger to tragedy, having lost former Congressman James Traficant Jr. earlier this year. The storm's path intersecting with Traficant's farm brought an eerie reminder of his untimely passing, further deepening the town's grief.

As the recovery and rebuilding process begins, residents of Greenford are rallying together to support one another. Local shelters have been set up to provide temporary housing for those displaced by the storm, and volunteers are pitching in to assist with cleanup efforts. The American Red Cross has also dispatched teams to offer aid and supplies to affected residents.
