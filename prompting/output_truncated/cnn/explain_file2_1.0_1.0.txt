This news article discusses the bombings that occurred during the Boston Marathon on April 15th, 2013. The FBI is still investigating the incident and has not identified any suspects or motives. The bombs used in the attack were pressure-cooker bombs filled with BB-like pellets and nails, causing extensive damage and injuries. Photos of evidence, including parts of a pressure cooker, a shredded black backpack, and metal pellets were sent to federal law enforcement agencies for analysis.

The article also highlights stories of bravery from individuals who rushed to help after the explosions. Despite their own injuries or exhaustion from running the marathon, people such as Carlos Arredondo and Dr. Natalie Stavas went above and beyond to provide immediate assistance.

Authorities provided details about the devices used in the bombing, indicating they were possibly placed in pressure cookers hidden inside backpacks or black nylon bags. They believe the bombs may have been on a timer rather than remotely triggered by a phone.

The article mentions that while tests showed no high-grade explosives like C-4 were used in this attack, it was still deadly with several casualties reported. The victims included 8-year-old Martin Richard, Krystle Campbell (29 years old), and an unidentified Boston University graduate student from China who was studying mathematics and statistics.

Investigators are continuing their search for leads while urging public assistance in identifying anyone involved or suspicious activity before or after the attacks. By Tuesday evening following the incident, over 2,000 tips had been received by authorities.

The aftermath of this tragedy includes many people recovering physically as well as emotionally from their experiences. Hospitals treated numerous injured patients; some required multiple surgeries but progress was being made with over a hundred patients able to go home by Tuesday night.

In response to these eventsâ€™ security measures have increased not only around Boston but also in other cities across America such as New York City and Los Angeles as precautionary measures against similar attacks happening elsewhere.

Despite the tragedy, Boston officials stated their determination to not let terror control or define their city, promising that the Boston Marathon would continue and be even bigger and better in the future.
