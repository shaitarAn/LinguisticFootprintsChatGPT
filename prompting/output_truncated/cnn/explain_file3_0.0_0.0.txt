This news article is about James Traficant Jr., a former politician from Ohio. The article highlights some of Traficant's controversial statements and actions throughout his career. 

The article begins by mentioning Traficant's comments during an ethics hearing, where he declared that there are no ethics in politics and that there should be no ethics committee. This statement made him popular among reporters in Washington, who sought his opinions on various topics. 

The article also mentions Traficant's distinctive hairstyle, which was the subject of much discussion among reporters. It was later revealed that he wore a toupee, which was discovered when he was booked into a jail in 2002. 

Traficant was known for his flamboyant and animated speeches in the House of Representatives, often ending with his catchphrase, "Beam me up!" Before entering politics, he had a career as a football player and served as a drug counselor and sheriff in Mahoning County, Ohio. 

However, Traficant's career was marred by controversy. He was tried on bribery charges in 1983 but managed to convince the jury to acquit him by claiming he was conducting his own sting operation. He was later elected to Congress in 1984. 

In Washington, Traficant portrayed himself as a maverick populist, frequently criticizing foreign aid and government agencies such as the IRS and the CIA. He was convicted in 2002 on charges of bribery, racketeering, and tax evasion. Despite not being a lawyer, Traficant represented himself during the trial. 

As a result of his conviction, Traficant was expelled from the House of Representatives by a vote of 420-1. He served his sentence from 2002 to 2009 and took up painting as a hobby during that time. After his release, he attempted to regain his old seat in Congress but was unsuccessful. 

The article concludes by quoting Traficant, who described himself as a regular guy and son of a truck driver.
