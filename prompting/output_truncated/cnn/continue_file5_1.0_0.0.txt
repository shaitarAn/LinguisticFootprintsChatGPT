Jindal continued, "Poll numbers are just a snapshot in time. It's still early in the process, and I have confidence in my ability to connect with voters and earn their support. I have a strong track record of conservative leadership in Louisiana, and I believe that will resonate with voters as they learn more about my record."

He acknowledged that name recognition may be a challenge for him compared to other candidates who have been in the national spotlight for longer. However, Jindal expressed his determination to overcome this obstacle and make his case to the American people.

"I may not have the same level of name recognition as some of my competitors, but I believe it's the substance of my ideas and my proven conservative principles that will ultimately matter to voters," Jindal asserted. "I am committed to traveling across New Hampshire and other key states, meeting with citizens, listening to their concerns, and sharing my vision for a brighter future."

Jindal also emphasized the importance of having a positive message and staying focused on the issues that matter most to the American people. Rather than getting caught up in the ups and downs of the polling numbers, he aimed to concentrate on delivering a consistent and compelling message that resonates with voters.

"I won't be dissuaded or discouraged by a single poll or a temporary setback," Jindal vowed. "I am in this race to offer a genuine conservative alternative and fight for the values that I believe will make our country stronger. That's what matters to me, and that's what I hope will matter to the voters as well."

As the breakfast came to a close, Jindal remained confident in his ability to build momentum and gain traction among Republican voters in New Hampshire and beyond. He recognized the challenges ahead but remained determined to prove himself as a viable contender in the 2016 presidential race.
