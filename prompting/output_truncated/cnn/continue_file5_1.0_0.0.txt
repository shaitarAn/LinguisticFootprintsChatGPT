Jindal expressed confidence in his ability to win over voters based on his track record and conservative principles. He believed that his low poll numbers were a result of limited name recognition rather than a reflection of his abilities as a candidate. He had faced similar challenges in the past and had managed to overcome them.

"I have always been an underdog," Jindal declared passionately. "Throughout my career, I have defied expectations and proven the naysayers wrong. I am not deterred by these polls; in fact, they only fuel my determination to work harder and connect with the people of New Hampshire."

Jindal acknowledged that he had some ground to cover in terms of increasing visibility and awareness about his campaign. He outlined his plans to intensify his efforts in the state, engaging directly with voters, attending town halls, and increasing his presence in the media. He believed that once people got to know him and understood his conservative vision, they would rally behind him.

"I am a true conservative who has fought relentlessly for limited government, lower taxes, and a strong economy," Jindal emphasized. "I have a proven record of delivering results and transforming Louisiana into a beacon of conservative governance. I will bring that same leadership and determination to the White House."

Jindal expressed gratitude to his supporters and urged them to remain steadfast, assuring them that he was in the race for the long haul. He remained optimistic that as the campaign progressed and voters became more familiar with the field of candidates, his message would resonate with the people of New Hampshire.

"Polls may indicate a snapshot in time, but they do not determine the outcome of this race," Jindal asserted confidently. "I trust in the intelligence and discernment of the American people. They are searching for a principled and visionary leader. I believe I possess those qualities, and I am committed to proving that to them." 

With a renewed determination, Jindal left the breakfast, ready to hit the campaign trail in New Hampshire with an unwavering resolve to defy the odds and emerge victorious in the 2016 presidential race.
