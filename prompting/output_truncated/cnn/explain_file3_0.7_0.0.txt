Traficant was known for his controversial statements, flamboyant personality, and unique appearance, particularly his distinctive hairstyle. The article also mentions his criminal charges, expulsion from Congress, and subsequent attempts to regain his political seat.

The article begins by highlighting Traficant's comments during his ethics hearing, where he boldly stated that there are no ethics in politics and criticized the existence of an ethics committee. These remarks made him popular among reporters in Washington, who appreciated his willingness to express his opinions on various topics. Traficant's eccentric personality and hairstyle, which was described as a "Planet of the Apes sort of hair helmet," also garnered attention in the media.

However, it was later revealed that Traficant wore a toupee, which was discovered during a search when he was booked into a jail in Akron, Ohio. The toupee was described as small and not fully covering his head.

The article then delves into Traficant's background, mentioning that he was a former football player at the University of Pittsburgh and served as a drug counselor and sheriff in Mahoning County, Ohio. In 1983, Traficant faced bribery charges while serving as sheriff but managed to convince the jury to acquit him by claiming he was conducting a sting operation. He was subsequently elected to Congress in 1984.

As a congressman, Traficant gained a reputation for his flamboyant and animated speeches, often ending with his catchphrase, "Beam me up!" He positioned himself as a maverick populist and frequently criticized foreign aid and various government agencies, including the IRS and the CIA.

However, in April 2002, Traficant was convicted on charges of bribery, racketeering, and tax evasion. Despite not being a lawyer, he represented himself in court. As a result of his conviction, he was expelled from the House by a vote of 420-1, making him only the second congressman to be expelled since the Civil War.

During his imprisonment from 2002 to 2009, Traficant took up painting as a hobby. After his release, he filed for office as an independent but failed to regain his old seat, losing to sitting Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat.

The article concludes with a quote from Traficant a few days before his expulsion from Congress, where he emphasized his humble background and portrayed himself as a regular person rather than a typical politician.

In summary, this news article provides an overview of James Traficant Jr.'s controversial political career, his criminal charges and expulsion from Congress, and his subsequent attempts to regain his political position.
