He made headlines for his comments during an ethics hearing, where he declared that there are no ethics in politics and that there should be no ethics committee.

Traficant was a favorite of reporters in Washington due to his willingness to offer his opinion on various topics.

The article mentions Traficant's background as a former football player and his role as a drug counselor and sheriff in Mahoning County, Ohio. While serving as sheriff, he was tried on bribery charges but successfully convinced the jury to acquit him by claiming he was conducting a sting operation. He was then elected to Congress in 1984.

In Congress, Traficant portrayed himself as a maverick populist and often criticized foreign aid, as well as government agencies like the Internal Revenue Service and the CIA. He was known for his flamboyant and animated speeches, which often ended with his trademark phrase, "Beam me up!"

As a result of his conviction, he was expelled from the House of Representatives by a vote of 420-1, making him only the second congressman to be expelled since the Civil War.

During his prison sentence from 2002 to 2009, Traficant took up painting as a hobby. After his release, he filed for office as an independent but lost his bid to regain his old seat to sitting Representative Tim Ryan.
