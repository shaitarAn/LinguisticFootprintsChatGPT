Jindal continued, "Polls can fluctuate and change dramatically as the campaign progresses. It's still early in the process, and I am confident that as voters become more familiar with my record and my vision for the country, my support will grow."

The Louisiana governor acknowledged that he faced an uphill battle in gaining name recognition compared to some of the more well-known candidates in the race. However, he remained undeterred, emphasizing his determination to connect with voters on a personal level.

"I believe in the power of grassroots campaigning," Jindal stated. "I will continue to travel across New Hampshire, meeting with voters, listening to their concerns, and sharing my conservative principles and solutions. I am confident that my message will resonate with the people of New Hampshire."

Jindal also highlighted his successful track record as governor of Louisiana, pointing to his conservative policies that had led to economic growth and job creation in the state. He emphasized his commitment to limited government, lower taxes, and a strong national defense as key pillars of his campaign.

"I am not running to be popular in the polls," Jindal declared. "I am running to be a voice for the American people, to fight for their values and their future. I believe that my conservative principles and proven leadership will ultimately prevail."

As the breakfast came to a close, Jindal expressed his gratitude for the opportunity to share his vision with the American people. He vowed to continue working tirelessly to earn the support of voters, regardless of the current poll numbers.

"I am in this race to win," Jindal concluded. "I will not be discouraged by temporary setbacks. I am confident that with hard work, determination, and the support of the American people, we can achieve victory in 2016."
