The article discusses the arrest of a 25-year-old man, identified as Osmakac, who was planning a terrorist attack in Tampa, Florida. Osmakac, a naturalized American born in Kosovo, had planned to carry out a car bombing followed by hostage-taking using a suicide belt. He expressed his extremist views to an undercover FBI employee, stating that he wanted to die the "Islamic way" and seek revenge for perceived wrongs against Muslims.

Law enforcement officials stated that Osmakac was not linked to al Qaeda and appeared to be self-radicalized. The investigation began when a confidential source informed the FBI that Osmakac had requested al Qaeda flags. By November, Osmakac was discussing potential targets for his attack and sought assistance from the source in obtaining firearms and explosives. The source then introduced Osmakac to an undercover FBI employee.

During a meeting with the undercover employee on December 21, Osmakac expressed his desire to acquire various weapons, including an AK-47, Uzi submachine guns, grenades, and an explosive belt. He provided a down payment of $500 for these items. The government clarified that the weapons and explosives Osmakac sought were rendered inoperable by law enforcement and posed no threat to the public.

Osmakac detailed his plans during a meeting on New Year's Day, specifying nightclubs in the Ybor City area of Tampa, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office operations center, and a business in South Tampa as potential targets for his attack. However, by Saturday night, his primary target had become an Irish bar in south Tampa, according to law enforcement officials. Osmakac aimed to target places with large crowds.

After the car bombing, Osmakac planned to retrieve additional weapons and explosives from a hotel room in Tampa to continue his attack. He intended to use the explosive belt to take hostages and demand the release of prisoners. However, FBI agents arrested him on Saturday night, just after he recorded a video explaining his motives.

Law enforcement officials credited the assistance of the local Muslim community in providing information about Osmakac's radical ideology and plans. They emphasized that the case was not about the Muslim religion or community but about an individual who committed a crime. The U.S. attorney acknowledged that the tips from local Muslims and the work of law enforcement prevented significant bloodshed and ensured the safety of the community.

In summary, the article reveals the arrest of a 25-year-old man who planned a terrorist attack in Tampa. The individual, Osmakac, expressed his extremist views and desire for revenge against perceived wrongs done to Muslims. Law enforcement officials, with the help of the local Muslim community, were able to gather information about Osmakac's plans and prevent the attack from taking place.
