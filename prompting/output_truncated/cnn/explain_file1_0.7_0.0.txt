This news article is about a 25-year-old naturalized American born in Kosovo named Osmakac who planned a terrorist attack in Tampa, Florida. According to a criminal complaint made public on Monday, Osmakac planned a car bombing followed by hostage-taking and the detonation of a suicide belt that he intended to wear. He expressed his motivation for the attack in a martyrdom video message, stating that he wanted to seek revenge for perceived wrongs against Muslims. 

The article highlights that the local Muslim community played a significant role in assisting law enforcement, providing information about Osmakac's ideology and intentions. The FBI's Tampa office commended the support from the Muslim community throughout the investigation. However, the authorities clarified that the case is not about the Muslim religion or community but about an individual who committed a crime.

Law enforcement officials stated that Osmakac does not appear to have any ties to al Qaeda and was likely "self-radicalized." They also mentioned that there are no indications that anyone else was involved in the plot or that Osmakac was acting under the control or direction of al Qaeda.

The federal investigation into Osmakac began in September when a confidential source informed the FBI that he had requested al Qaeda flags. As the investigation progressed, Osmakac discussed potential targets and sought help in obtaining firearms and explosives. He eventually made a down payment for the weapons, but unbeknownst to him, they had been rendered inoperable by law enforcement.

Osmakac's planned targets included nightclubs in the Ybor City area, the operations center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, and a business in the South Tampa area. However, his primary target on the day of his arrest was an Irish bar in south Tampa. He intended to retrieve guns and explosives from a hotel room following the car bombing to continue his attacks. Osmakac expressed his desire to use the suicide belt to take hostages and make demands to the FBI.

FBI agents arrested Osmakac on Saturday night shortly after he recorded a video explaining his motives. Officials stated that there was no real danger to the community once law enforcement became involved. The U.S. attorney acknowledged the crucial role played by tips from local Muslims and the work of law enforcement in preventing significant bloodshed.
