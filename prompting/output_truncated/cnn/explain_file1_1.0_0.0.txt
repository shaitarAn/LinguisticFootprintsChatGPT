The news article discusses the arrest of a 25-year-old naturalized American born in Kosovo who was planning a terrorist attack in Tampa, Florida. The suspect, whose name is Osmakac, allegedly planned a car bombing followed by hostage-taking and detonation of a suicide belt he planned to wear.

According to a criminal complaint made public on Monday, Osmakac expressed his desire to "die the Islamic way" to an undercover FBI employee. In a martyrdom video recorded prior to his arrest, he stated that he wanted revenge for perceived wrongs done to Muslims.

The article highlights the importance of the local Muslim community in assisting law enforcement in preventing the attack. Members of the community were instrumental in providing information about Osmakac's ideology and plans, leading to the initiation of the federal investigation.

It is noted that the suspect does not appear to have any ties to al Qaeda, and early information suggests that he was "self-radicalized." Officials involved in the investigation stated that there is no indication that anyone else was involved in the plot or that Osmakac was acting under the control of al Qaeda.

The investigation began in September when a confidential source informed the FBI that Osmakac had requested al Qaeda flags. By November, he was discussing potential targets in Tampa and seeking assistance from the source in acquiring guns and explosives. The confidential source then introduced Osmakac to an undercover FBI employee which led to a meeting where he expressed his intent to acquire various weapons and an explosive belt.

Osmakac allegedly made a down payment for the weapons and later detailed his plans during a meeting with the undercover FBI employee on New Year's Day. His intended targets were nightclubs in the Ybor City area of Tampa, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office operations center, and a business in the South Tampa area. However, by the time of his arrest, his primary target had become an Irish bar in south Tampa, where large crowds were expected to gather.

After the car bombing, Osmakac planned to retrieve guns and explosives from a hotel room in Tampa to carry out the next phase of his attack. He intended to use the explosive belt to take hostages and demand the release of prisoners. FBI agents arrested Osmakac shortly after he made the video explaining his motives, ensuring that the attack was thwarted.

The article emphasizes that the weapons and explosives Osmakac sought and attempted to use had been rendered inoperable by law enforcement, posing no threat to the public. The US attorney involved in the case acknowledges the essential role of tips from local Muslims and the collective efforts of law enforcement in preventing significant bloodshed and ensuring the safety of the community.

In conclusion, the news article details the planned terrorist attack by Osmakac in Tampa and highlights the critical involvement of the local Muslim community in assisting law enforcement. The article also emphasizes that Osmakac was not connected to al Qaeda and appears to have self-radicalized. The arrest was made just in time to prevent the attack and ensure public safety.
