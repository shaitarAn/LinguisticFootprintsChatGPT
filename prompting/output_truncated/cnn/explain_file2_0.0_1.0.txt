This news article discusses the horrific bombings that took place during the Boston Marathon on April 15th. The article begins by stating that the range of suspects and motives for the attack remains wide open, according to Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office. The bombs used in the attack were two identical pressure-cooker bombs filled with BB-like pellets and nails, causing extensive damage.

Photos obtained by CNN show parts of a pressure cooker, a shredded black backpack, and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings. These pieces of evidence will be sent to an FBI facility in Quantico, Virginia for further analysis to determine how the devices worked and potentially identify those responsible.

The article then highlights the physical and psychological impact on those affected by this tragedy. Many people are facing a lengthy physical recovery while also dealing with emotional trauma from witnessing such devastation. One survivor named Ron Brassard shares his experience of being injured in the blast but emphasizes his determination not to let this act of terror change him.

The article also mentions several individuals who acted heroically during and after the bombings. Carlos Arredondo, an affiliate of Red Cross, tended to a man who had lost both his limbs. Dr. Natalie Stavas, a pediatric resident at Boston Children's Hospital who was running in the marathon with her father when she heard the blasts, immediately went over barriers and past policemen to help those injured.

Authorities have provided some details about how these attacks were carried out but have not identified any suspects yet. It is believed that pressure cookers containing explosives were hidden inside backpacks or black nylon bags placed at specific locations along Boylston Street where they detonated simultaneously.

The bombs used were small and made from crude materials rather than high-grade explosives like C-4. The death toll includes 8-year-old Martin Richard, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell, and a Boston University graduate student from China. Many others were injured, and doctors have been working tirelessly to treat them.

The article mentions that the FBI has received over 2,000 tips and is analyzing numerous photos and videos from the scene. Authorities are urging the public to come forward with any information that might help in identifying the perpetrator or perpetrators.

In response to this tragedy, security measures have been increased in cities like Los Angeles, New York, and London. However, officials in Boston are determined not to let fear dictate their actions. They promise to rebuild and make next year's marathon even bigger and better.

The article concludes by stating that while there may be heightened security measures in place moving forward, Boston will not allow terror to take over its spirit. Mayor Thomas Menino emphasizes that this tragedy will not stop Boston from moving forward.
