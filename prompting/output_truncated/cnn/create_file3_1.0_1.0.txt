(CNN) -- A massive UFO sighting created a frenzy among residents of Greenford, Ohio, as strange lights were spotted in the night sky on Saturday. The unidentified flying objects glowed brightly, descending and ascending rapidly, captivating onlookers who gathered to witness the mysterious event.

Eyewitnesses report that the spectacle began around 9 p.m., when multiple bright lights appeared low in the sky. The lights seemed to move with extraordinary speed and agility, defying conventional aircraft capabilities. Some witnesses claimed they saw the UFOs change colors from white to red and green before disappearing into thin air.

Local authorities were inundated with numerous phone calls reporting the unusual phenomenon. "We received a record number of reports about this bizarre occurrence," said Sheriff Mark Roberts. "It's definitely something we've never encountered before."

As news of the sighting spread through social media platforms like wildfire, videos taken by excited spectators started circulating online. In one video, a small group can be heard gasping in awe as they watch three luminous orbs darting across the night sky.

Experts from nearby observatories and aviation centers are scrambling to explain this otherworldly occurrence. Dr. Emily Lopez, an astrophysicist at Ohio State University Observatory, offered some insights into what may have caused such a unique celestial display.

"While we cannot definitively confirm these sightings as extraterrestrial activity," Dr. Lopez stated cautiously, "one possibility is that this could be an exceptionally rare atmospheric phenomenon known as ball lightning. Alternatively, it could also be an experimental military aircraft conducting secretive maneuvers."

The Greenford community has always been known for its close-knit nature and skeptical outlook on unexplained events; however, many residents are now questioning their previous beliefs about unidentified aerial phenomena.

"I've always been skeptical about UFO sightings," said local resident Sarah Thompson. "But after witnessing those lights last night? I'm starting to think there's more out there than we can comprehend."

As investigations into the incident continue, skeptics are urging caution, highlighting the need for scientific evidence to support any definitive conclusions. Nonetheless, this captivating event has undoubtedly left its mark on Greenford and its inhabitants, sparking discussions and fueling imaginations about life beyond Earth.

Residents are already organizing a town hall meeting to share their experiences and discuss possible explanations for the extraordinary sighting. The small Ohio town may have embarked on an unexpected journey into the realm of the unexplained, igniting curiosity and inspiring a renewed sense of wonder among its community members.
