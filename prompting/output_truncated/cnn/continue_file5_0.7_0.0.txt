"I'm not going to let poll numbers discourage me from pursuing my goals and fighting for what I believe in," Jindal continued. "I have a strong track record of conservative leadership and a vision for the future of this country that I will continue to share with the people of New Hampshire and across the nation."

Jindal acknowledged that name recognition plays a significant role in early polls, especially in a crowded field of potential candidates. However, he expressed confidence that as voters become more familiar with his record and ideas, his support will grow.

"I believe in connecting with voters on a personal level, sharing my story, and discussing the issues that matter most to them," Jindal stated. "I will continue to visit New Hampshire and engage with its residents, listening to their concerns and presenting them with solutions that will make a real difference in their lives."

The governor also emphasized the importance of grassroots organizing and building a strong ground game in New Hampshire. He expressed his commitment to investing time and resources into building relationships with local Republican activists, volunteers, and supporters.

"Polls may fluctuate, but what truly matters is the strength of our message and the dedication of our supporters," Jindal asserted. "I have seen firsthand the power of a motivated and committed grassroots network, and I am confident that we can build that same kind of movement here in New Hampshire."

Jindal concluded by reiterating his determination to run an energetic and positive campaign, focused on offering bold solutions and conservative principles.

"I am in this race to win, and I will continue to work tirelessly to earn the support of the people of New Hampshire," he declared. "I am not discouraged by a single poll or a momentary setback. This is just the beginning of a long journey, and I am ready to fight for the future of our great nation."
