Jindal continued, "Polls can fluctuate and change dramatically as the campaign progresses. It's still early in the process, and I am confident that as voters become more familiar with my record and my vision for America, their support will grow."

He acknowledged that his low polling numbers were a challenge but emphasized that he was not deterred by them. Jindal expressed his belief that his conservative principles and successful track record as governor of Louisiana would resonate with voters once they had a chance to learn more about him.

"I have a proven record of cutting taxes, reducing government regulations, and fostering economic growth," Jindal stated proudly. "I believe these are the solutions our country needs, and I am committed to sharing my message with the people of New Hampshire and across the nation."

Jindal also highlighted his strong conservative values, emphasizing his stance on issues such as traditional marriage, protecting religious freedom, and defending the sanctity of life. He believed that these principles would resonate with Republican voters in New Hampshire and beyond.

"I am not in this race for personal gain or to boost my own name recognition," Jindal asserted. "I am running because I genuinely believe that I can make a positive difference in this country. I am here to champion the values and principles that have made America great."

Despite his low polling numbers, Jindal remained optimistic and vowed to continue working hard to win over voters. He planned to intensify his campaign efforts in New Hampshire, visiting communities, holding town hall meetings, and engaging in meaningful conversations with voters.

"I am confident that once people have the opportunity to hear directly from me and understand my vision for America, they will see that I am the candidate who can lead our nation forward," Jindal declared.

As the breakfast concluded, Jindal left reporters with one final message: "Polls may tell one story, but the American people will ultimately decide who will be their next leader. I have faith in their judgment and trust that they will choose based on substance and proven leadership, not just on name recognition or popularity. I am ready to earn their support, one voter at a time."
