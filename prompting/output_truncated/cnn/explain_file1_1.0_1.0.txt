This news article reports on a planned terrorist attack in Tampa, Florida. A 25-year-old naturalized American citizen born in Kosovo named Osmakac intended to carry out a car bombing followed by hostage-taking using a suicide belt. According to the complaint filed against him, Osmakac expressed his desire for an Islamic martyrdom and sought "pay back" for perceived wrongs against Muslims.

The investigation into Osmakac began when a confidential human source informed the FBI about his interest in obtaining al Qaeda flags. Subsequently, he engaged with an undercover FBI employee who posed as someone able to help him acquire weapons and explosives for his plot. He allegedly provided a down payment of $500 for these items.

Osmakac outlined his plans during meetings with the undercover employee, targeting nightclubs in Ybor City, the operations center of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, and a business in South Tampa. However, it was later revealed that he specifically intended to target an Irish bar in south Tampa due to its potential large crowd.

His plan involved detonating the car bomb and then retrieving more weapons from a hotel room before wearing an explosive belt to take hostages. He also demanded that prisoners be released by the FBI before he would surrender himself.

The FBI arrested Osmakac shortly after he made a video explaining his motives when they deemed that an attack was imminent. The U.S. Attorney praised the assistance of local Muslims and said there was no immediate threat to public safety once law enforcement became involved.

It is important to note that law enforcement officials have stated there is no evidence connecting this individual or plot directly with al Qaeda; rather it appears he had become self-radicalized on his own accord.
