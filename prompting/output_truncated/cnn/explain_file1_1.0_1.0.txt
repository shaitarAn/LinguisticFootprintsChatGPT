The news article describes the arrest of a 25-year-old naturalized American born in Kosovo, named Osmakac, who planned to carry out a car bombing and take hostages before detonating a suicide belt. The criminal complaint against him was made public on Monday.

According to the complaint, Osmakac allegedly expressed his desire to die "the Islamic way" and seek revenge for perceived wrongs against Muslims. He recorded a martyrdom video message just prior to his arrest, stating his intention to retaliate. However, the article emphasizes that this case is not about the Muslim religion or community as a whole but about an individual who committed a crime.

Law enforcement officials mentioned that there were no indications of Osmakac having ties with al Qaeda or being directed by them. They believed he had become "self-radicalized." The federal investigation into Osmakac began in September when an informant informed the FBI that he had requested al Qaeda flags.

As conversations progressed between Osmakac and undercover FBI employees, he discussed potential targets for terror attacks in Tampa and sought assistance in obtaining firearms and explosives. He allegedly provided $500 as a down payment for weapons during one meeting with an undercover agent.

Osmakac identified nightclubs in Tampa's Ybor City area, as well as the operations center of Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office - both located there - and a business in South Tampa as potential bomb targets. However, by Saturday night when he was arrested, it is reported that his primary target had become an Irish bar in South Tampa because it would have been crowded.

He planned to retrieve additional weapons from a hotel room after carrying out the initial car bombing so that he could continue launching more attacks. His intention was also to use the explosive belt attached to himself while taking hostages inside one of these locations before demanding prisoner releases from authorities.

Fortunately, law enforcement intervened just as Osmakac was recording a video explaining his motives, and they arrested him. The explosives and firearms that he sought were rendered inoperable by law enforcement, ensuring there was no threat to the public.

The article emphasizes the significant role played by members of the Muslim community in assisting law enforcement agencies throughout this investigation. Officials expressed gratitude for the tip-offs provided, which helped them prevent any potential bloodshed or harm to the community.

In summary, this news article highlights an individual's attempt to carry out a terrorist attack in Tampa through car bombings, hostage-taking, and a suicide bombing. It underscores the importance of collaboration between law enforcement agencies and communities in preventing such acts of violence.
