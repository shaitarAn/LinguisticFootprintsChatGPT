Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Kosovo, was arrested on January 7, 2012, after an extensive investigation led by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. The investigation began when a confidential informant, who was close to Osmakac, alerted law enforcement authorities about the alarming statements and plans made by Osmakac.

According to the details presented in court, Osmakac had been actively seeking firearms, explosives, and potential targets to carry out a violent attack. His intentions were rooted in his belief that the U.S. government and its citizens were his enemies. He had a particular interest in attacking locations in Tampa, including a busy sheriff's office, an Irish pub, and a local business establishment frequented by military personnel.

The court hearing shed light on the meticulous planning that Osmakac had undertaken. He had acquired an AK-47, ammunition, and an explosive belt that he intended to wear during these attacks. Osmakac also purchased a car that he planned to turn into a car bomb to cause maximum destruction.

The U.S. attorney commended the tireless efforts of the Muslim community for reporting Osmakac's suspicious behavior, which ultimately led to his arrest. He emphasized the importance of community members being vigilant and stepping forward when they notice potential threats to national security.

"This case exemplifies the importance of a strong partnership between law enforcement and communities," O'Neill stated. "When community members come forward to report suspicious activities, it allows law enforcement to investigate and prevent potentially devastating acts of violence."

The hearing revealed Osmakac's extremist ideology and his readiness to inflict harm on innocent people. As the proceedings unfolded, it became apparent that Osmakac was determined to create chaos and instill fear among Americans, based on his twisted beliefs.

Now, facing charges of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, Osmakac will undergo a legal process that will determine the extent of his punishment for his criminal intent. The arrest of individuals like Osmakac highlights the continuous efforts of law enforcement agencies to maintain the safety and security of the public.

As the case against Osmakac moves forward, the community remains grateful for the vigilance and cooperation that led to the foiling of this potentially devastating plot. While the threat of extremism persists, the case stands as a testament to the success of collaboration between community members and law enforcement in countering terrorism and ensuring the safety of all Americans.
