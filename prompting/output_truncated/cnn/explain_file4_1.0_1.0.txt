This news article discusses a brutal attack that took place at a synagogue in the ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof. Four rabbis, including one American citizen, were killed by two Palestinian attackers armed with guns and butcher knives. The attackers entered the synagogue during morning prayers and proceeded to slay the victims.

The article provides information about each of the victims. Levine, one of the rabbis, had dual US-Israeli citizenship and was described as someone who prioritized connecting with God in his life. Kupinsky and Twersky also had dual citizenship, while Goldberg was a British-Israeli national who grew up in Liverpool.

During the attack, several other individuals were wounded, including an Israeli police officer named Zidan Saif who later succumbed to his injuries. Saif was Druze, which is an Arabic-speaking religious community that combines elements of Islam with other religions.

The incident left behind a horrific scene as blood covered the floor of the synagogue along with prayer books and shawls stained red. This attack has further strained tensions between Palestinians and Jews and put Jerusalem on high alert.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Hamas and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas for incitement leading to this attack. However, Abbas condemned it while emphasizing resolving tensions over religious sites like Temple Mount/al-Aqsa Mosque.

The names of the attackers were identified as Ghassan Abu Jamal and Udayy Abu Jamal but it is uncertain whether their actions were coordinated or spontaneous.

The article also mentions various friends and family members describing each victim's personal attributes: Levine's "gigantic soul," Twersky's renowned family background in Jewish philosophy, Kupinsky's kindness towards others regardless of their background or religion, Goldberg's tolerance as a chemical engineer living peacefully with his family in Jerusalem.

Mourners expressed devastation at an eulogy for these four rabbis where they emphasized that such attacks on innocent people while praying in public instill unimaginable grief. They also highlighted the need for healing and recovery from this traumatic event.

Israel's President Reuven Rivlin attended the funeral of the slain police officer and praised his bravery. Rivlin has been an advocate for better Jewish-Arab relations and coexistence in Israeli society.

The article concludes by mentioning a Canadian-Israeli dual citizen who was severely injured in the attack and is currently in a medically induced coma.
