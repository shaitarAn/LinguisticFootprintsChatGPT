Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Kosovo, had been under surveillance by law enforcement for several months after concerns were raised by members of the local Muslim community about his extremist views and potential plans for violence. The community members, who had been working closely with law enforcement as part of a joint effort to combat radicalization, provided crucial information that led to Osmakac's arrest.

During the hearing, O'Neill detailed the disturbing evidence against Osmakac, including recorded conversations where he expressed his desire to carry out a terrorist attack on American soil. Osmakac had allegedly been in contact with an undercover FBI agent, whom he believed to be a like-minded individual willing to assist him in his plans.

According to O'Neill, Osmakac had meticulously planned his attack, intending to target multiple locations in Tampa, including a popular nightclub and a sheriff's office. He had acquired an AK-47, grenades, and what he believed to be a car bomb. Osmakac had also conducted surveillance on his potential targets and had even recorded a martyrdom video, in which he pledged allegiance to a foreign terrorist organization.

However, thanks to the vigilance of the Muslim community and the swift action of law enforcement, Osmakac's plot was foiled before it could be carried out. Undercover agents were able to provide him with inert explosives and weapons, ensuring that no harm would come to innocent civilians.

O'Neill emphasized the importance of community engagement in preventing acts of terrorism, stating, "This case is a testament to the critical role that community involvement plays in our efforts to combat terrorism. The Muslim community in Tampa demonstrated their commitment to the safety and security of their fellow Americans by reporting their concerns about Osmakac."

The arrest of Osmakac serves as a reminder of the ongoing threat posed by individuals who seek to carry out acts of violence in the name of extremist ideologies. It also highlights the effectiveness of community partnerships and law enforcement efforts in identifying and neutralizing potential threats.

As the legal proceedings against Osmakac continue, authorities remain vigilant in their efforts to protect the community from any potential acts of terrorism. The case serves as a stark reminder that the fight against terrorism requires the collective efforts of law enforcement, community members, and government agencies working together to ensure the safety and security of all Americans.
