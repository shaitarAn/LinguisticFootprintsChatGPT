This news article is about a 25-year-old man named Sami Osmakac from Florida who planned to carry out a terrorist attack in Tampa. He intended to use explosives and weapons to cause chaos and harm Americans. However, thanks to the local Muslim community and law enforcement, his plot was foiled.

Osmakac believed he had an operable AK-47, real explosives, an explosive pack, and a car bomb that he wanted to use against Americans. He also planned on wearing a suicide belt. Authorities arrested him on one count of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.

In conversations with undercover FBI employees, Osmakac expressed his desire for "payback" for what he felt were wrongs done to Muslims. He wanted to die as a martyr in the name of Islam.

The local Muslim community played an important role in preventing this attack by providing information about Osmakac's ideology and intentions. Law enforcement officials emphasized that this case is not about the Muslim religion or community but rather about an individual who committed a crime.

Investigation into Osmakac began when someone alerted the FBI that he had asked for al Qaeda flags. The suspect then discussed potential targets in Tampa and sought help from the source in obtaining guns and explosives for his attack plans.

Despite early indications suggesting that Osmakac was "self-radicalized" rather than being connected with al Qaeda or any other group, law enforcement took this threat seriously due to the nature of his plans.

The FBI employee introduced him to an undercover agent posing as someone who could provide weapons and explosives. During their interactions, Osmakac made down payments for firearms but did not receive any operational weapons or explosives; instead, those provided were rendered useless by law enforcement beforehand.

Osmakac's intended targets included nightclubs in Ybor City area of Tampa, the operations center of Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office in Ybor City, and a business in the South Tampa area. However, his primary target by the time of his arrest was an Irish bar in south Tampa.

After the car bombing, Osmakac planned to retrieve guns and explosives from a hotel room to continue with his attacks. He wanted to take hostages and demand the release of prisoners from the FBI.

Fortunately, Osmakac was arrested just after making a video explaining his motives when law enforcement deemed that an attack was imminent. The U.S. attorney acknowledged that without tips from local Muslims and the work of law enforcement, there may have been significant bloodshed.

Overall, this news article highlights how collaboration between communities and law enforcement plays a crucial role in preventing acts
