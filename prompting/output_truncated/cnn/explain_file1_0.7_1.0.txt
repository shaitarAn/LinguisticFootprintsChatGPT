This news article discusses the arrest of a 25-year-old naturalized American born in Kosovo who planned a car bombing and hostage-taking incident. The individual, identified as Osmakac, expressed his desire to die in an "Islamic way" and sought revenge for perceived wrongs done to Muslims. The local Muslim community played a significant role in providing information about his ideology and intentions to commit a crime. Law enforcement officials stated that there is no evidence linking Osmakac to al Qaeda or any indication that he was acting under their control.

The investigation began when a confidential source informed the FBI that Osmakac had requested al Qaeda flags. Over time, he discussed potential targets for terrorist attacks in Tampa and sought assistance from the source in acquiring weapons and explosives. An undercover FBI employee was introduced to Osmakac, leading to a meeting where he expressed his desire for various firearms, grenades, and an explosive belt.

However, it is important to note that the weapons provided by law enforcement were rendered inoperable and posed no threat to public safety. Osmakac's planned targets included nightclubs in Ybor City area of Tampa, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office operations center, and a business in South Tampa. However, his primary target on Saturday night was reportedly an Irish bar with large crowds.

After carrying out the car bombing at his chosen target location, Osmakac intended to retrieve additional weapons from a hotel room before proceeding with further attacks. He planned on using an explosive belt during this phase of the attack while taking hostages and demanding prisoner releases from law enforcement authorities.

Osmakac was arrested just after recording a video explaining his motives for carrying out these attacks when law enforcement deemed them imminent. The U.S. attorney credited tips from local Muslims as well as law enforcement work for preventing significant bloodshed and ensuring public safety during this investigation.
