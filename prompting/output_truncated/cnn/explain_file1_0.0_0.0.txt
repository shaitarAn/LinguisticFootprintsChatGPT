This news article is about a 25-year-old naturalized American citizen born in Kosovo who planned a terrorist attack in Tampa, Florida. The suspect, identified as Osmakac, intended to carry out a car bombing followed by hostage-taking and the detonation of a suicide belt he planned to wear. He expressed his extremist views to an undercover FBI employee, stating that he wanted to die in the "Islamic way" and seek revenge for perceived wrongs against Muslims.

The article emphasizes that this case is not about the Muslim religion or community as a whole, but rather about an individual who committed a crime. The FBI received assistance from members of the local Muslim community, which was described as "very significant" in the investigation.

Law enforcement officials stated that Osmakac does not appear to have any ties to al Qaeda and was likely "self-radicalized." There is no indication that he was acting under the control or direction of al Qaeda. The investigation began when a confidential source informed the FBI that Osmakac had requested al Qaeda flags. Subsequently, he discussed potential targets and sought help in obtaining weapons and explosives.

The suspect allegedly made a down payment for firearms and explosives, but these items were rendered inoperable by law enforcement. Osmakac planned to target nightclubs, the sheriff's office operations center, and a business in Tampa. However, his primary target on the day of his arrest was an Irish bar in south Tampa, where he believed there would be a large crowd.

After the car bombing, Osmakac planned to retrieve additional weapons and explosives from a hotel room to continue his attacks. He intended to use the explosive belt to take hostages and demand the release of prisoners. The FBI arrested him just after he recorded a video explaining his motives.

The U.S. attorney acknowledged that the tips from local Muslims and the work of law enforcement prevented significant bloodshed and ensured the safety of the community.
