The news article discusses the potential presidential run of a 43-year-old governor named Jindal. He mentions that he is thinking and praying about whether he will run in 2016. Jindal states that his decision will not be based on polls or fundraising numbers, but rather on whether he believes he can make a difference and has something unique to offer.

During an appearance at a breakfast event, Jindal unveils an energy proposal from his nonprofit group, America Next. The proposal supports an "all of the above" strategy for energy development but emphasizes the importance of domestic oil and gas production through methods like hydraulic fracturing. This is particularly significant for Louisiana's economy, which heavily relies on oil and gas.

Jindal criticizes the Obama administration for not moving forward with the Keystone XL pipeline, calling them "science deniers" when it comes to harnessing America's energy resources. He believes that the administration's stance hinders economic growth and job creation.

The governor also expresses his support for strengthening U.S. efforts to combat Ebola in Africa, stating that it is important to lean forward and help countries hardest hit by the outbreak.

When asked about confronting ISIS in the Middle East, Jindal suggests that Congress should back White House proposals to train and arm Syrian rebels. However, he criticizes the administration for repeated delays which have allowed Islamic extremists to grow unchecked.

Jindal addresses topics likely to appeal to GOP primary voters such as spending controls and religious liberty issues. He accuses President Obama of ignoring issues related to religious liberty within the United States while speaking eloquently about protecting Christians overseas.

In addition, Jindal labels Obama as the worst American president since Jimmy Carter, stating that Carter at least believed in American exceptionalism whereas Obama does not. He refers to Obama as ideologically radical and incompetent.

This article provides insight into Governor Jindal's potential presidential aspirations while highlighting some of his policy positions and criticisms of the Obama administration.
