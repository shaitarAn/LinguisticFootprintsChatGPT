The article also highlights Jindal's energy proposal from his nonprofit group, America Next, which supports continued development of domestic oil and gas resources through hydraulic fracturing. Jindal criticizes the Obama administration for not moving forward with the Keystone XL pipeline.

In addition to energy policy, Jindal addresses other topics during a breakfast with reporters. He expresses support for U.S. efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak in Africa and suggests backing White House proposals to train and arm Syrian rebels against ISIS. However, he criticizes the administration for allowing Islamic extremist groups to grow due to delays.

Jindal also touches on spending controls and what he perceives as a "war on religious liberty" in the United States. He claims that President Obama is not supportive of American exceptionalism and describes him as both radical and incompetent.

Overall, this news article provides an overview of Governor Bobby Jindal's thoughts on his poll numbers, his potential presidential run in 2016, his energy proposal, foreign policy issues such as Ebola and ISIS, spending controls, religious liberty concerns within the United States, and his criticism of President Obama's leadership abilities compared to previous presidents like Jimmy Carter who was labeled as incompetent by Jindal.
