Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen originally from Kosovo, had been under surveillance by law enforcement for months prior to his arrest. The investigation was initiated thanks to a tip provided by a member of the local Muslim community who had become concerned about Osmakac's extremist views and intentions.

Authorities discovered that Osmakac had been radicalized online and had expressed support for violent jihadist ideologies. He believed that he was carrying out a righteous act in plotting an attack on American soil.

According to the evidence presented during the hearing, Osmakac had meticulously planned his attack. He acquired an AK-47 assault rifle, which he believed was functional, as well as explosives that he believed were authentic. He also obtained materials necessary for constructing a car bomb and an explosive vest.

Fortunately, unbeknownst to Osmakac, the weapons and explosives were all inert devices provided by undercover law enforcement agents posing as black-market arms dealers. These agents successfully gained his trust over several months while monitoring his activities.

The arrest took place when Osmakac attempted to purchase additional weapons from these undercover agents. Law enforcement swiftly moved in, apprehending him without incident.

During Monday's hearing, U.S. Attorney Robert O'Neill emphasized the severity of Osmakac's intentions and praised both the Muslim community member who alerted authorities and law enforcement agencies involved in thwarting this potential terrorist plot.

"This case highlights how crucial it is for communities to remain vigilant," stated O'Neill. "Without their cooperation with law enforcement efforts, we may not have been able to prevent this potentially devastating attack."

O'Neill also stressed that this case should not be seen as representative of any particular religious or ethnic group but rather as an example of collaboration between citizens and authorities working together to ensure public safety.

If convicted on charges related to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, Sami Osmakac could face life imprisonment. The investigation into his connections and potential ties to extremist networks continues, with authorities determined to uncover any further threats and ensure the safety of the community.
