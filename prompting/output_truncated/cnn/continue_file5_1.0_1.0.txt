"I am fully aware of the poll numbers, but I have never been one to let setbacks discourage me," Jindal continued. "I believe in the power of ideas and connecting with voters on a personal level. While name recognition may be a factor at this stage, I believe that as I continue to share my conservative vision for the future of our country, more people will begin to listen and support my candidacy."

Jindal acknowledged that he has faced similar challenges before in his political career. "When I first ran for office, many experts wrote me off, saying I had no chance of winning," he said. "But through hard work and determination, I proved them wrong. I connected with voters by focusing on the issues that matter most to them – jobs, education, and opportunity."

The Louisiana governor emphasized that his focus remains on delivering results for the people he serves. "My priority right now is governing Louisiana and making a positive impact on people's lives," Jindal stated. "As governor, my record speaks for itself – we've cut taxes, reformed education, and made our state more business-friendly."

Jindal also highlighted his commitment to grassroots campaigning in New Hampshire and other early primary states. "I trust in the wisdom of the American people and their ability to see through political rhetoric," he said. "I will continue traveling across this great nation, meeting with voters face-to-face, listening to their concerns, and offering practical solutions based on conservative principles."

Despite low poll numbers at this stage of the race, Jindal remained optimistic about his chances in 2016. He concluded by saying: "The road ahead won't be easy; no campaign ever is. But with faith in our principles and a steadfast dedication to serving others before self-interests or polls results—I am confident that we can build momentum towards victory."
