This news article discusses the horrific bombings that occurred during the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. The article begins by stating that the range of suspects and motives for the bombings remains unknown. The two bombs were pressure-cooker bombs, each with the capacity to hold six liters of liquid. They contained BB-like pellets and nails, causing significant damage and injuries.

Photos obtained by CNN showed parts of a pressure cooker, a shredded black backpack, and what appeared to be metal pellets or ball bearings. These pieces of evidence, along with a partial circuit board, were sent to an FBI facility in Quantico, Virginia, for further analysis and to identify the person or persons responsible.

The article then highlights the pain and suffering caused by the bombings. Many people who were not grieving the loss of loved ones were faced with a long physical recovery and psychological trauma. The article shares the story of Ron Brassard, who was injured in the blast and lost a chunk of his leg. Despite his anger, Brassard is determined not to let the terror change him.

The article also praises the heroic actions of those who rushed to help the injured. Spectators, like Carlos Arredondo, and medical professionals, such as Dr. Natalie Stavas, did everything they could to assist the victims. The scene on the ground was described as sheer horror, with blood and unconscious people everywhere.

While authorities have not identified the perpetrators, they provided details about the devices used in the attack. The bombs were possibly placed in pressure cookers hidden inside a backpack or another black nylon bag. There is speculation that the bombs were on a timer rather than being set off remotely by a cell phone. The materials used in the attack were crude but deadly.

The article mentions the victims who lost their lives in the bombings, including 8-year-old Martin Richard, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell, and a Boston University graduate student from China. It also highlights the efforts of emergency personnel and volunteers who saved many lives. Doctors removed nails and metal beads from patients who were injured.

Authorities pleaded for the public's help in providing any information that could lead to the identification of the perpetrator. The FBI received over 2,000 tips and began analyzing photos and videos from the scene. Security measures were increased in other cities, and there were several unfounded alerts and threats in the aftermath of the attack.
