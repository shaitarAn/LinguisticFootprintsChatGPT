This news article is about James Traficant Jr., a former congressman who gained attention for his controversial statements and flamboyant style. During an ethics hearing, he declared that there are no ethics in politics and argued against the existence of an ethics committee. Traficant was known for his willingness to offer his opinion on various topics, which made him a favorite of reporters in Washington.

The article also mentions his distinctive hairstyle, which was the subject of much discussion among reporters. Although initially believed to be his real hair, it was later discovered that Traficant wore a toupee. This revelation occurred when he was booked into a jail and authorities searched for contraband.

Traficant had a colorful background, having been a football player, a drug counselor, and a sheriff before being elected to Congress in 1984. He often made animated speeches in the House, ending them with his trademark phrase, "Beam me up!"

As a congressman, Traficant positioned himself as a maverick populist, criticizing foreign aid and government agencies such as the IRS and CIA. He faced bribery charges in 1983, but acted as his own lawyer and convinced the jury to acquit him by claiming he was conducting a sting operation.

However, Traficant's political career came to an end in 2002 when he was convicted on multiple charges, including bribery, racketeering, and tax evasion. He was expelled from the House later that year by a vote of 420-1, making him only the second congressman to be expelled since the Civil War.

During his prison sentence from 2002 to 2009, Traficant took up painting as a hobby. After his release, he attempted to regain his old seat in Congress but lost to a sitting representative. In an interview before his expulsion, Traficant emphasized his working-class background and stated that he saw himself as a regular guy.
