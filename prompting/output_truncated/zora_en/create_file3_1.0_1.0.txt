Is 'Verb' a Verb? A Syntactic Analysis of the Distribution of Verb Phrases in Modern English

1. Introduction

The study of wordhood and its implications for syntactic analysis has been a topic of great importance in linguistic research. Contemporary investigations have explored the complex nature of words within different languages, with particular emphasis on morphological and phonological aspects. The classification and identification of individual words remain crucial in understanding the structural organization and grammar within language systems.

In this paper, we delve into an investigation that focuses on verb phrases (VPs) in Modern English, seeking to understand the distributional patterns that define them as functional units within sentences. Unlike previous studies that have concentrated primarily on bound elements or phrasal structures found in older Insular Celtic languages, our research delves into the intricacies surrounding VPs specifically.

By adopting a typological approach to wordhood examination, this paper aims to offer a comprehensive perspective on VPs' morphological and phonological domains in Modern English. We draw upon insights from contemporary typology research as well as discuss the challenges inherent in studying wordhood using corpus-based languages. Through detailed analysis and examination, we seek to provide an insightful overview of how VPs manifest themselves syntactically within Modern English.

Our findings present several structural components that can be identified as "verb phrases" based on our investigation's outcomes. This leads us to question whether employing the term "verb" adequately captures these nuanced features when conducting synchronic descriptions of language structures such as those found in Modern English.

In light of this inquiry's significance for syntactic analyses, it is imperative that we thoroughly explore and investigate how verb phrases function within modern linguistic frameworks. By doing so, we hope to contribute not only critical understandings but also broader implications for theories regarding syntax and language structure across multiple disciplines.

This paper progresses by first outlining essential concepts related to wordhood studies before transitioning into discussing typological research on verb phrases. We then proceed to address the practical challenges inherent in corpus-based investigations and highlight the need for an in-depth analysis of verb phrase distribution in Modern English. Finally, we present our methodologies and findings, shedding light on various structures that qualify as "verb phrases" within our study's context.

Through this examination, we aim to provide new insights into the role of verb phrases within Modern English syntax and promote further discussions on linguistic phenomena related to wordhood classification. By better understanding how syntactic elements are positioned within sentences and their relationship with other
