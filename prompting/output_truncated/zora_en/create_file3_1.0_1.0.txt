Title: Exploring the Role of Wordhood in Middle Welsh: A Syntactic Analysis

Abstract:
The study of wordhood and its implications for syntactic structure has long been a topic of interest across various linguistic traditions. However, an investigation specifically focused on the Middle Welsh verbal complex and the distribution of phonological and morphological domains within it remains largely unexplored. This article aims to fill this gap by examining the role of wordhood in Middle Welsh from a syntactic perspective.

1. Introduction
Understanding how languages organize their lexical units into larger syntactic structures is crucial for gaining insights into their grammatical systems. The concept of "word" has played a central role in traditional linguistic analysis, serving as a fundamental unit for organizing morphological, phonological, and morphosyntactic processes.

In recent years, however, typological research on wordhood has raised questions about its validity as a universal category across all languages (Corbett & Stump, 2002; Dixon & Aikhenvald, 2004). For instance, the older Insular Celtic languages such as Middle Welsh demonstrate distinctive characteristics that challenge the conventional notion of wordhood prevalent in European languages.

The profound presence of bound elements within the morphological landscape and intricate phonological interactions within both morphemic and phrasal structures have led researchers to question whether individual words play significant or even primary roles in shaping grammars within these types of languages (Evans & Osada, 2005; Harris & Campbell ,1995).

Inspired by these developments and armed with insights from current typology research on wordhood (Haspelmath et al., 2020), this study aims to conduct an extensive investigation into understanding how Middle Welsh organizes its verbal complex from both morphological and phonological perspectives. We seek to reevaluate traditional notions surrounding word boundaries within this language through meticulous examination using data from various corpora.

To achieve this, the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of the theoretical framework and conceptual underpinnings. Section 3 offers a detailed description and analysis of morphological and phonological word-like domains in Middle Welsh based on corpus data. In Section 4, we critically discuss the findings, explore any identified structures that could be considered 'word,' and evaluate the usefulness of the term "word" for synchronic descriptions of Middle Welsh.

The significance of this study lies in its potential to contribute to our understanding of cross-linguistic variation in syntactic organization by examining a language that challenges conventional notions surrounding wordhood. By delving deep into the complexities of word boundaries within the Middle Welsh verbal complex, we hope to shed light on how languages with intricate morphological systems differ from those that adhere more closely to traditional concepts associated with words.

Overall, this research not only responds to insights gained from current typology research but also aims at paving new paths for future investigations into similar phenomena.
