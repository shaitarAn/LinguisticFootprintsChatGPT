This introduction begins by highlighting the importance of framing as a theoretical approach in communication research. It mentions that while many studies refer to framing, there is often a lack of clear definitions, resulting in a variety of phenomena being grouped under this concept. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights, which has been identified as a problem for communication research.

The introduction then explains that systematic reviews aim to address these problems by identifying common trends, research gaps, and guiding future research. However, previous reviews on framing have not fully utilized one unique characteristic of the framing approach: its bridging potential. Framing has the ability to consider the entire communication process and bridge different interdisciplinary perspectives such as strategic communication, journalistic cognitions, audience frames, framing effects, and cultural contexts.

The article argues that by systematically reviewing how framing has been applied across different locations in the communication process (communicator/text/message/receiver/culture), insights can be gained about the cultural framing repository - the competitive environment where salient and culturally/cognitively available frames emerge.

The authors justify their focus on climate change as a specific topic for this review for several reasons. Firstly, they note that climate change is one of the most important contemporary global problems and exploring its communication is highly relevant. They mention that audiences rely on multiple sources for information but find it difficult to engage with and understand climate change. Frames play a role in shaping audience support for actions related to climate change.

Additionally, climate change stands out due to its complexity and scientific uncertainty as well as its connections between experts, policy-makers, sources of information, and audiences. The authors argue that framing can help overcome these communication barriers.

Furthermore, they highlight how studying framing can aid in developing effective communication strategies targeting specific audiences while building consensus and supporting actions against climate change.

Nextly ,the authors state that since research on framing in climate change communication is growing steadily ,a systematic review is necessary to take stock and guide future research in this field. They mention that previous studies have examined frames of communicators, journalists, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, allowing for an assessment across different locations.

The authors point out that there are only a limited number of systematic reviews available for framing in communication research overall. They argue that attention should be given to whether common trends observed elsewhere are also evident in framing research on climate change communication.

They further explain that field-specific insights add to the limited number of studies systematically examining published literature on framing. Therefore, the present study aims to conduct a systematic review on the framing of climate change and compare findings with those from reviews covering framing in communication research overall.

The authors state their intention to focus on the most salient frames across different locations with the goal of harnessing framing's potential as an integrative bridging concept. By connecting research on frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects - they aim to identify any conceptual (mis)fit across these locations. A misfit would mean subsequent studies did not identify or relate to the same frames and thus do not contribute
