The introduction of this Zora article begins by highlighting the importance of framing as a theoretical approach in communication research. It mentions that while many studies refer to framing, they often fail to provide clear definitions, leading to a range of different phenomena being included under the concept. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights in communication research.

The article then explains that systematic reviews are designed to address these problems by identifying common trends, research gaps, and guiding future research. However, previous reviews on framing have not fully utilized one important aspect of framing: its ability to bridge different perspectives and consider the entire communication process.

The author argues that reviewing how framing has been applied across different locations within the communication process can provide insights into the cultural framing repository. To demonstrate this, they focus on the specific topic of climate change because it is a significant global problem and exploring its communication is highly relevant. They also note that climate change is unique due to its complexity, scientific uncertainty, and the need for connections between experts, policy-makers, sources of information, and audiences.

The article further justifies why studying framing in climate change communication through a systematic review is important. It mentions that there has been steady growth in research on this topic but limited availability of systematic reviews overall. The authors believe that field-specific insights will contribute valuable knowledge about how framing operates in different subtopics.

Overall, this study aims to conduct a systematic review on the framing of climate change by examining published literature from 25 years. By analyzing frame production (communicators' and journalists' frames), frame content (salient frames), audience frames, and framing effects across frame locations, they hope to identify conceptual misfits and contribute towards closing the climate change communication cycle.
