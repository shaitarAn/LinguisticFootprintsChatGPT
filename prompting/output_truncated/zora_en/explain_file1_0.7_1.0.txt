In this introduction, the author discusses the concept of reference in conversation and how it is commonly expressed through noun phrases (NP REs). They explain that during interactive communication, changes can be observed in the NP REs produced by interlocutors. Two main changes-in-interaction are highlighted: convergence and shortening.

Convergence refers to the tendency for interlocutors' contributions to become more similar lexically and grammatically over the course of their interaction. This phenomenon is linked to speakers aligning on their linguistic representations, as described by the Interactive Alignment Model. The author mentions that lexical convergence has been well-documented in psycholinguistic research and suggests that speakers form conceptual pacts during interaction, leading to lexical entrainment and establishment of referential precedents.

The second change-in-interaction observed in NP REs is referential contraction, which refers to interlocutors shortening their contributions. The author states that this chapter will primarily focus on this process of change-in-interaction but notes that convergence and shortening typically occur together. 

To investigate these changes, a referential communication task was designed where interlocutors repeatedly referred to the same visual stimuli over four rounds of interaction. The author provides an example from a resulting corpus of spoken dialogue illustrating how NP REs get shortened as the interaction progresses.

The study aims to describe general tendencies regarding structural changes in NP REs throughout the interaction, particularly focusing on preferred grammatical structures for modifying and descriptive elements within NP RE constructions. The example shows a trajectory from post-head clausal elements (e.g., "it's green") towards phrasal modification (e.g., "green").

The term "compression" is introduced by referencing Biber and Clark's work from 2002. Compression encompasses both the shortening process itself as well as changes in structural preferences observed along the trajectory from clausal elements to phrasal ones.

Previous research on change-in-interaction, especially regarding compression in NP REs, is discussed in Section 2. Theoretical approaches related to the production of NP REs, such as the Interactive Alignment Model and discussions of familiarity and accessibility, are contextualized within experimental referential communication task studies.

Section 3 introduces the experimental set-up used to elicit a corpus of spoken English dialogues. Section 4 presents an analysis of structural changes in NP REs over the course of the interactions. It shows that as NP REs get shortened, their structure changes from more elaborate clausal forms to more compressed phrasal forms.

In Section 5, these findings are discussed in relation to Biber and Clark's notion of compression as a response to conveying a large amount of information efficiently.

Overall, this introduction sets up the context for studying changes-in-interaction in reference expression during interactive communication. It highlights convergence and shortening as key processes and outlines the research questions addressed in subsequent sections.
