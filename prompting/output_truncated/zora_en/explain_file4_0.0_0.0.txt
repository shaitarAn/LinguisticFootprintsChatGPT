This introduction discusses the importance of imitation in human culture and its role in language and cognitive development. It highlights that previous research has focused on specific types of imitation skills and age groups, leaving gaps in our understanding. The present study aims to address these gaps by investigating the relationship between different types of imitation skills (language-based multimodal imitation vs. object-based imitation) in preschool children and their linguistic and pragmatic abilities. The introduction also provides a review of previous literature that supports the hypothesis that imitation behaviors are crucial for language production, comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and social communication. It emphasizes the need to study imitation from an integrated multimodal perspective, considering the role of gestures, prosody, and verbal/lexical content. The introduction concludes by stating that further research is needed to fully understand the role of socially relevant imitation patterns in preschoolers and their relationship to complex language and sociopragmatic measures.
