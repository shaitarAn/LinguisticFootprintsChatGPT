Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time, with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems, economies, and societies. Effective communication about climate change is crucial for raising awareness, fostering public understanding, and mobilizing action. Framing has emerged as a useful concept in understanding how various aspects of climate change are presented and interpreted in communication processes.

Over the past 25 years, there has been a growing body of literature on framing in climate change communication. However, despite this abundance of research, the lack of clear definitions and conceptual frameworks has hindered the synthesis of theoretical and empirical insights. This systematic review aims to address this gap by providing an overview and analysis of trends in framing research on climate change.

The review adopts a comprehensive approach by examining frame production (the sources or actors responsible for framing), frame content (the specific frames used to depict climate change), audience frames (how different groups interpret and respond to these frames), as well as framing effects (the impact that framing has on attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors). By comparing frames across these different locations within the broader cultural framing repository, we aim to harness the bridging potential of framing.

To conduct this review, both quantitative and qualitative methods are employed. Content analysis is used to systematically analyze 275 peer-reviewed articles spanning a period of 25 years. Through this approach, we aim to identify common themes and patterns in how climate change is framed within scholarly discourse.

Preliminary findings suggest that there has been limited exploration of framing's bridging potential in climate change communication research. Rather than examining how frames from different locations intersect or inform each other, much existing literature tends to focus on individual aspects or perspectives without considering their interconnections.

The misalignment between frame locations presents both challenges and opportunities for future research. On one hand, it highlights the need for greater integration between different levels or layers of framings within communication processes related to climate change. On the other hand, it offers new avenues for investigation by exploring how these frame locations can be connected and coordinated in more cohesive and strategic ways.

In this paper, we will discuss the conceptual (mis)fit between frame locations in climate change communication research and highlight the potential benefits of a bridging approach. We will also propose directions for future research that can enhance our understanding of framing as a powerful tool in climate change communication.
