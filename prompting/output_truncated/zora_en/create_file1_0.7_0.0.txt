1. Introduction

Language users often engage in interactive communication, where they produce referring expressions with noun phrases at their center (NP REs) to refer to specific entities or concepts. Throughout the course of a communicative interaction, interlocutors' use of NP REs tends to undergo changes, as previous research has shown a tendency for speakers to converge on linguistic forms and shorten their expressions in the process (REF). This phenomenon, known as post-head compression, has been observed in various contexts and languages, highlighting the dynamic nature of language production and comprehension.

While previous studies have examined the general trends of convergence and shortening in NP REs, the present research seeks to investigate the structural changes that accompany this process. Specifically, we aim to analyze the shifts in the type of structural modification present within NP REs as interlocutors engage in interactive communication. By examining the modifications in NP REs, we can gain insights into the cognitive and communicative processes underlying the production and comprehension of referring expressions.

To achieve this goal, we utilize data from an experimentally elicited corpus of spoken English. The corpus consists of conversational dyads engaging in a referential communication task, where they repeatedly refer to visual stimuli. By analyzing the dialogues produced during the task, we can examine the changes in NP REs over time and identify any patterns or tendencies that emerge.

The primary focus of our investigation is to observe the shortening process that occurs within NP REs and how it relates to the structural changes in these expressions. Specifically, we will explore the extent to which interlocutors decrease the presence of longer clausal post-head elements and increase the use of premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification. These changes in structural modification within NP REs will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the compression process.

The observed structural changes in NP REs are expected to shed light on the cognitive and sociolinguistic factors that influence the production and comprehension of referring expressions in interactive communication. By understanding how interlocutors modify their expressions over the course of an interaction, we can gain a deeper understanding of the strategies they employ to ensure effective communication.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the relevant literature on post-head compression and the structural changes in NP REs observed in previous studies. Section 3 outlines the methodology employed in the present research, including the experimental setup, data collection procedures, and data analysis techniques. Section 4 presents the results of our analysis, focusing on the observed changes in structural modifications within NP REs. Finally, Section 5 discusses the implications of our findings and offers suggestions for future research in the field.

In conclusion, this study aims to contribute to our understanding of the dynamic nature of language production and comprehension. By investigating the structural changes that occur in NP REs during interactive communication, we hope to provide valuable insights into the cognitive and sociolinguistic processes involved in the compression of referring expressions.
