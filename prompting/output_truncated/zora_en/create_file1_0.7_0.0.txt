1. Introduction

The phenomenon of post-head compression in noun phrase referring expressions (NP REs) has been a topic of interest in the field of interactive communication. Previous research has demonstrated that language users tend to converge on linguistic forms and shorten their NP REs over the course of a communicative interaction (REF). However, while existing studies have focused on the structural changes accompanying this shortening process, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the specific effects of post-head compression on the comprehensibility and efficiency of communication.

The present study aims to address this gap by investigating the impact of post-head compression on the structural modification of NP REs in interactive communication. We aim to explore how interlocutors adapt their NP REs to facilitate efficient and effective communication. By examining data from an experimentally elicited corpus of spoken English, consisting of conversational dyads engaged in a referential communication task, we will analyze the changes in NP REs over the course of the dialogues.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of post-head compression, we will focus on two specific aspects: the decrease in longer clausal post-head elements and the increase in the use of premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification. These specific structural changes are indicative of a shift from elaboration to compression in the construction of NP REs (REF). By examining these changes, we aim to shed light on the strategies employed by language users to optimize communication.

The findings of this study will contribute to our understanding of how interactive communication shapes the structure of referring expressions. Moreover, the insights gained from this research will have implications for various domains, including psycholinguistics, pragmatics, and language processing. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying post-head compression, we can enhance our understanding of how language users adapt their linguistic strategies to facilitate effective communication.

In the following sections, we will present the methodology employed in this study, followed by a detailed analysis of the data and a discussion of the implications of our findings. We anticipate that this research will advance our understanding of the dynamic nature of referring expressions in interactive communication and provide valuable insights into the processes underlying effective communication strategies.
