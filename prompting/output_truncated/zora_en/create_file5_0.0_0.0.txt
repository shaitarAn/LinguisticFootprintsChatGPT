1. Introduction

The phonetic properties of Swiss Standard German (SSG) have been a subject of limited research, despite its status as one of the official languages in Switzerland. While previous studies have primarily focused on consonants in Alemannic (ALM) dialects, there remains a general lack of investigation into the vowel qualities of these dialects and their influence on the respective varieties of SSG. This study aims to address this research gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of vowel quality in four ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties.

The primary objective of this study is twofold. Firstly, it seeks to provide a comparative acoustic analysis of ALM and SSG vowels, shedding light on the similarities and differences between these dialects. Secondly, it aims to examine the extent to which interference from ALM dialects shapes the vowel qualities of SSG varieties. By investigating the long-vowel inventories of ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties, this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the phonetic properties of SSG and its relationship with ALM dialects.

To achieve these objectives, a corpus of speech samples was collected from eight speakers, consisting of four males and four females, representing the dialect regions of Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Each speaker was recorded producing each vowel three times, resulting in a total of 1,632 tokens. Acoustic analysis was then conducted to examine the vowel qualities present in the speech samples.

Preliminary findings indicate that ALM vowel quality is predominantly transferred to the SSG varieties in two dialect regions, namely Chur and Brig. However, in the SSG varieties spoken in Bern and Zurich, certain vowel qualities did not align with those of the ALM dialects. Notably, the vowel <a> was fronted in the SSG variety of either dialect. Furthermore, the SSG variety spoken in Bern exhibited variation in the production of the vowel <ä>, which was realized as both [ɛː] and [æː]. Additionally, the vowel <o> was observed to be more back in its realization.

This research contributes to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of vowel quality in ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties. By examining the influence of ALM dialects on SSG vowel qualities, this study enhances our understanding of the phonetic properties of SSG and its relationship with regional dialects. The findings of this research have implications for language variation and change, as well as for the development of accurate phonetic representations of SSG.
