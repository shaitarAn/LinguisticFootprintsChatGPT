1. Introduction

The phonetic properties of Swiss Standard German (SSG) have been a subject of limited research, despite its status as one of the official languages in Switzerland. While some studies have explored the phonetic characteristics of Alemannic (ALM) dialects, the focus has primarily been on consonants rather than vowels. This general lack of research presents an opportunity to investigate the influence of vowel quality in ALM dialects on the respective varieties of SSG.

This study aims to address this research gap by conducting a comparative acoustic analysis of vowel inventories in four ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties. By examining the long-vowel qualities in these dialects, we seek to understand the extent to which interference from ALM dialects shapes the vowel qualities in SSG varieties. This research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the phonetic properties of SSG and shed light on the influence of ALM dialects on the standard variety.

To achieve these objectives, we recorded the speech of eight native speakers (four male and four female) from four different regions: Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Each speaker produced the vowels three times, resulting in a corpus of 1,632 tokens. The acoustic analysis of these recordings will provide valuable insights into the vowel qualities present in both ALM dialects and SSG varieties.

The results of this study reveal interesting patterns in the transfer of vowel quality from ALM dialects to SSG varieties. Specifically, we find that in the dialect regions of Chur and Brig, ALM vowel quality is largely transferred to the corresponding SSG varieties. However, in the SSG varieties spoken in Bern and Zurich, certain vowel qualities do not align with those found in ALM dialects. Notably, the vowel <a> is fronted in the SSG variety of either dialect. Additionally, the SSG variety spoken in Bern exhibits variation in the production of the vowel <ä>, which is realized as both [ɛː] and [æː]. Furthermore, the vowel <o> in the Bern SSG variety is predominantly produced with a back realization.

These findings highlight the complex relationship between ALM dialects and SSG varieties, particularly in terms of vowel quality. The observed variations in vowel production suggest that the influence of ALM dialects on SSG is not uniform across all regions. Instead, it appears that certain dialect regions exhibit a stronger influence on the vowel qualities of SSG varieties.

Understanding the influence of ALM dialects on SSG vowel quality is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it contributes to our knowledge of the phonetic properties of SSG, which has been understudied in comparison to other languages. Secondly, it sheds light on the dynamics of language variation and change within the Swiss German dialect continuum. Finally, this research has practical implications for language education and language policy, as it provides insights into the pronunciation norms and standards of SSG.

In the following sections, we will provide a comprehensive analysis of the vowel qualities in ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties. By examining the acoustic properties of these vowels, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and mechanisms that govern the transfer of vowel quality from ALM dialects to SSG varieties. Through this investigation, we hope to contribute to
