The introduction of this Zora article provides background information on the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland. It explains that the region is known for diglossia, a situation in which two different varieties of a language are used in different contexts. In this case, the Alemannic dialects, known as Swiss German or Mundart, are used for oral communication, while Swiss Standard German, also called Schriftdeutsch, is used for written communication.

The article goes on to explain that everyone in German-speaking Switzerland is a native speaker of a local dialect, but they learn Swiss Standard German in school. Both the Alemannic dialects and Swiss Standard German can be used to some extent in each other's domains, and people in Switzerland often switch between the two varieties. This indicates that the situation is not simply a continuum between a standard dialect, but rather a complex interaction between the two varieties.

Given this situation, it is not surprising that there have been reports of interferences between the dialects on various linguistic levels, such as phonetics, morphology, syntax, and lexicon. However, when it comes to the specific topic of vowels, there have been very few studies on the Alemannic dialects, with only four acoustic studies available. On the other hand, there have been studies on Swiss Standard German vowels, but only one study has compared them to the Alemannic dialects.

Therefore, the current study aims to systematically investigate the vowel qualities of four Alemannic dialects and their respective Swiss Standard German varieties using an instrumental phonetic approach. It will provide a comparative acoustic analysis of the long vowels produced by speakers from Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. The study will also analyze to what extent the vowel qualities of Swiss Standard German are influenced by the speakers' dialect.

The introduction also briefly describes the three subgroups of Alemannic dialects: Low ALM, High ALM, and Highest ALM. The study will focus on High and Highest ALM, as they are the most common dialects in German-speaking Switzerland. It explains that these two dialect groups are defined by multiple isoglosses, with the most famous one being hiatus diphthongisation. This means that in the northern half of German-speaking Switzerland (High ALM), certain words are pronounced with a diphthong, while in the southern half (Highest ALM), they are pronounced with a monophthong.

However, the dialect groups are not completely homogeneous, and there is also an east-west divide based on various phonetic, lexical, and morphosyntactic isoglosses. For example, the vocalization of the phoneme
