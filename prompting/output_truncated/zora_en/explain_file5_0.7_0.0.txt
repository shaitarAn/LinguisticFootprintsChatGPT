In this introduction, the author is discussing the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland, specifically focusing on the concept of 'diglossia'. Diglossia refers to the coexistence of two distinct varieties of a language within a community, where each variety has its own specific functions and domains of use.

In German-speaking Switzerland, two varieties are used: Alemannic dialects (ALM) and Swiss Standard German (SSG). Alemannic dialects, also known as Swiss German or Mundart, are predominantly used for oral communication, while Swiss Standard German, also referred to as Schriftdeutsch or script German, is used for written communication. This means that in German-speaking Switzerland, everyone is a native speaker of a local dialect, but they learn Swiss Standard German in school. However, it is worth noting that both Alemannic dialects and Swiss Standard German can be used in each other's domains, and Swiss people are generally adept at code-switching between the two.

The contact between these two varieties is inevitable, and as a result, research has reported interferences on various linguistic levels, including phonetics, morphology, syntax, and lexicon. However, when it comes to the specific topic of this study, which is vowels, there have been limited acoustic studies conducted on Alemannic dialects, with only four previous studies identified. On the other hand, there have been some studies on Swiss Standard German vowels, but only one study has compared the vowels of Alemannic dialects and Swiss Standard German in specific regions.

Therefore, the current study aims to systematically investigate the vowel qualities of four Alemannic dialects (spoken in Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich) and their respective Swiss Standard German varieties using an instrumental phonetic approach. The study will provide a comparative acoustic analysis of the long vowels produced by the same speakers and will also explore the extent to which Swiss Standard German vowel qualities are influenced by the speakers' dialect.

The introduction then briefly describes the three subgroups of Alemannic dialects in Swiss German: Low ALM (found in Basel), High ALM (dialects of the northern half), and Highest ALM (spoken in the alpine southern half). The focus of this study will be on High and Highest ALM, as they are the most common dialects in German-speaking Switzerland. These two subgroups are distinguished by several isoglosses, with one notable example being the phenomenon of hiatus diphthongisation. High ALM developed a diphthong in certain positions, while Highest ALM maintained a monophthong.

However, the author notes that the dialects are not as homogeneous as their names suggest, and there are additional divisions based on multiple phonetic, lexical, and morphosyntactic isoglosses. For example, there is an east-west divide, with differences such as vocalization of the phoneme /l/ in the western parts but not in the east.

In conclusion, German-speaking Switzerland can be divided into four broad dialect regions, taking into account both the north-south and east-west divides. The introduction sets the stage for the study by providing background information on the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland, the limited research on vowels in Alemannic dialects, and the specific aims of the current study.
