The introduction of this Zora article begins by highlighting the ubiquity of imitation in humans and its importance for human culture, language development, and cognitive skills. The study aims to expand on previous research by investigating the role of different types of imitation skills (language-based multimodal imitation vs. object-based imitation) that have rarely been assessed together. Additionally, the study focuses on young preschoolers, an age group that undergoes significant linguistic and social developmental advances but has not been actively studied in terms of imitation abilities.

The authors state that this is the first time the relationship between different types of imitation is being investigated in relation to linguistic and pragmatic skills in preschool children. They briefly review previous literature that demonstrates how imitative behaviors are crucial for language production and comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and social communication behaviors such as requesting or greeting.

The authors cite various studies that support their argument. For example, Bates et al. (1979) found a strong link between vocal imitation and language production/comprehension in infants aged 9-13 months. Hanika and Boyer (2019) showed a unique relationship between motor imitation behaviors in infants aged 15-18 months and language comprehension skills.

In relation to vocabulary acquisition, Carpenter et al. (1998) observed a positive relationship between infants' ability to imitate arbitrary actions involving physical objects at 9-15 months old and their use of referential language. Masur and Eichorst (2002) demonstrated that infants who imitated more novel words at 13 months had larger lexicons later on.

Regarding sociopragmatic skills, Dohmen et al.'s (2016) longitudinal study with German-speaking late-talking children found that imitative behaviors made a significant contribution to predicting social communication outcomes at 4 years old.

The authors also discuss studies focusing on non-typically developing populations such as children with language impairment or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which further support the importance of imitation skills in language development.

The introduction emphasizes that previous studies have not explicitly compared the relevance of language-based and object-based imitation skills. Stone, Ousley, and Littleford (1997) suggested that these two types of imitation represent independent dimensions with different associations to language use and development. Other studies highlighted the social function of gestures in modulating infants' imitation patterns.

The authors argue that an integrative multimodal view of language-based imitation, including gestural, prosodic, and verbal/lexical components, is lacking in previous research. They aim to fill this gap by analyzing the relationship between multimodal language-based imitation and object-based imitation in early preschool years.

The introduction concludes by stating that although imitative learning behaviors tend to decrease after 2 years old, they continue to be important for social communication during the preschool stage. The authors believe it is crucial to investigate young preschoolers' abilities to perform accurate multimodal imitations of socially relevant events and their correlation with language and sociopragmatic skills.

They assert that this developmental period is significant because children are delving into complex areas of language acquisition before entering school. Sociopragmatic abilities and basic narration skills are predictive of important aspects of language and academic development.

In summary, while previous studies have focused on early infancy or children with specific disorders, further research is needed to understand the role of socially relevant imitation patterns during the preschool stage. The
