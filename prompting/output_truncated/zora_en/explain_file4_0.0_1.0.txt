This introduction discusses the importance of imitation in human culture and its role in language and cognitive development. It highlights that previous research has focused on specific types of imitation skills, such as language-based multimodal imitation or object-based imitation, but rarely assessed them together. The study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between different types of imitation skills and linguistic and pragmatic abilities in preschool children.

The introduction provides a review of previous literature that demonstrates the significance of imitative behaviors for language production, comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and social communication. It also discusses studies that show how imitative behaviors can predict later language outcomes and identify children at risk for social communication and language problems.

Furthermore, the introduction emphasizes the need to consider both language-based imitation (including speech vocalizations, body actions, facial expressions, and vocabulary) and object-based imitation (involving actions on objects observed through play activities) when studying imitation abilities. Previous studies have suggested that language-based imitation may have stronger links to language abilities than object-based imitation.

The introduction also highlights the importance of an integrative multimodal view of language-based imitation that includes gestural, prosodic, verbal/lexical components. It argues that previous studies have not fully explored this perspective.

Lastly, it states that understanding socially relevant imitation patterns during early preschool years is crucial because it is a developmental period when children are delving into complex areas of language. The study aims to investigate whether young preschoolers' abilities to perform multimodal imitations are correlated with their linguistic and sociopragmatic skills.

Overall, this introduction sets up the rationale for the study by highlighting gaps in previous research regarding different types of imitations skills assessed together in relation to linguistic and pragmatic abilities in preschool children.
