This introduction provides background information on the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland, specifically focusing on the use of two language varieties: Alemannic dialects (ALM) for oral communication and Swiss Standard German (SSG) for written communication. It states that everyone in German-speaking Switzerland is a native speaker of a local dialect, but they learn SSG in school. The introduction mentions that interferences between the two varieties have been observed on various linguistic levels such as phonetics, morphology, syntax, and lexicon.

Regarding vowels, the article states that there have been limited studies on ALM dialects and SSG vowels separately. There is only one study comparing ALM and SSG vowels in specific regions of Switzerland. This current study aims to investigate systematically the vowel qualities of four ALM dialects and their respective SSG varieties using an instrumental phonetic approach. It aims to provide a comparative acoustic analysis of long vowels produced by speakers from different regions such as Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich.

The introduction also describes the three subgroups into which Swiss ALM dialects can be classified: Low ALM only found in Basel city, High ALM spoken in the northern half of German-speaking Switzerland, and Highest ALM spoken in the alpine southern half. These subgroups differ based on various linguistic features, such as pronunciation variations for certain words or sounds.

In summary, this introduction sets up the linguistic context of Swiss German-speaking Switzerland where two language varieties are used with certain regional variations. It highlights gaps in research regarding vowel qualities in different dialect regions and outlines how this current study aims to fill that gap through a comparative analysis using an instrumental phonetic approach.
