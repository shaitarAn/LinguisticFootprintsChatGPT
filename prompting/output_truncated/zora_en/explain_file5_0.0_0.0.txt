The introduction of this Zora article provides an overview of the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland, focusing on the concept of "diglossia." Diglossia refers to the coexistence of two distinct varieties of a language within a community, each with its own specific functions and contexts of use.

In German-speaking Switzerland, the two varieties in question are Alemannic dialects (ALM) and Swiss Standard German (SSG). Alemannic dialects, also known as Swiss German or Mundart, are primarily used for oral communication, while Swiss Standard German is used for written communication. This means that everyone in German-speaking Switzerland is a native speaker of a local dialect, but they learn Swiss Standard German in school.

The article highlights that both Alemannic dialects and Swiss Standard German can be used to some extent in each other's domains, and Swiss people are generally adept at code-switching between the two varieties. This indicates that the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland is not a simple continuum between a standard language and dialects.

Given the inevitable contact between the two varieties, research has long reported interferences on various linguistic levels, including phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and lexical. However, when it comes to the specific topic of vowels, there have been limited acoustic studies on Alemannic dialects, with only four studies found. On the other hand, there have been studies describing vowels in Swiss Standard German and providing formant charts based on acoustic measurements.

The current study aims to fill this research gap by systematically investigating the vowel qualities of four Alemannic dialects and their respective Swiss Standard German varieties. The study will use an instrumental phonetic approach to conduct a comparative acoustic analysis of the long vowels produced by speakers from Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. It will also examine the extent to which Swiss Standard German vowel qualities are influenced by the speakers' dialect.

The introduction then provides a brief description of Alemannic dialects and the Swiss Standard German varieties spoken in German-speaking Switzerland. It mentions that Alemannic dialects can be categorized into three subgroups: Low ALM, High ALM, and Highest ALM. However, the study will focus on High and Highest ALM, as they are the most prevalent dialects in the region.

The distinction between High and Highest ALM is based on multiple isoglosses, with the most famous one being hiatus diphthongisation. High ALM developed a diphthong in certain positions, while Highest ALM maintained a monophthong. However, the dialect groups are not entirely homogeneous, and there are additional divisions based on phonetic, lexical, and morphosyntactic isoglosses, such as the east-west divide related to /l/-vocalisation.

The introduction concludes by highlighting that German-speaking Switzerland consists of four broad dialect regions, as depicted in Figure 1 of the article. It notes that the regions of Basel and Samnaun are not included in this categorization due to the presence of a Low ALM dialect in Basel and a Bavarian dialect in Samnaun.

Overall, the introduction sets the stage for the study by providing background information on the linguistic situation in German-speaking Switzerland, emphasizing the coexistence of Alemannic dialects and Swiss Standard German, and outlining the research gap that the study aims to address.
