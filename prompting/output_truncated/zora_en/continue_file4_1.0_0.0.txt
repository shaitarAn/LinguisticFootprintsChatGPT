Imitation plays a crucial role in the development of language and sociocommunicative skills in children. It has been widely studied in infants, with research showing that early imitation skills in infants between 9 and 20 months old are predictive of later language development. However, there is a lack of research examining the joint relevance of different types of imitation skills in older children.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between multimodal imitation skills, object-based imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children. Multimodal imitation refers to the imitation of gestural, prosodic, and lexical components, while object-based imitation involves imitating actions with objects. The focus on multimodal imitation reflects the understanding that communication involves more than just verbal language.

A sample of thirty-one typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children participated in the study. Four tasks were used to assess their imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities. The results showed a significant relationship between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative and sociopragmatic abilities. However, there was no significant relationship between object-based imitation skills and these language and sociocommunicative skills.

These findings suggest that preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is strongly related to their language development and sociocommunicative skills. This supports a broader conceptualization of imitation behaviors in the field of language development, which includes prosodic, gestural, and verbal linguistic patterns. Understanding and incorporating these multimodal cues in imitation tasks may provide valuable insights into children's language and social development.

The implications of this study are significant for educators, speech therapists, and researchers working with preschool-aged children. It highlights the importance of incorporating multimodal cues in language intervention programs and assessments. By fostering children's ability to imitate not only verbal language but also nonverbal gestures and prosody, professionals can support the development of their narrative and sociopragmatic abilities.

In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the strong relationship between preschoolers' multimodal imitation skills and their narrative and sociopragmatic abilities. It emphasizes the importance of considering multiple dimensions of imitation in language development research and intervention. Further research is needed to explore the specific mechanisms underlying this relationship and to develop effective intervention strategies that target multimodal imitation skills.
