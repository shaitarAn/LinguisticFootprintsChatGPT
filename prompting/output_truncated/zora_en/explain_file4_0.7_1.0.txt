This introduction sets the stage for a study on imitation abilities in young preschool children and their relationship to language and sociopragmatic skills. It begins by highlighting the importance of imitation in human culture, language development, and learning. The study aims to build upon previous research by investigating different types of imitation skills (language-based multimodal imitation vs. object-based imitation) that have not been assessed together before. Additionally, it focuses on preschoolers, an age group where significant linguistic and social developmental advances occur but has been understudied in terms of imitation abilities.

The introduction then reviews previous literature that establishes a link between imitative behaviors and language production, comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, and sociopragmatic skills in infants and young children. It also discusses studies that demonstrate the potential clinical implications of studying imitative behaviors for identifying risks of later social communication and language problems.

Furthermore, the introduction highlights the limited research comparing language-based and object-based imitation skills. Studies suggest that language-based imitations have stronger links to language abilities while object-based imitations are associated with play skills.

The authors argue for an integrative multimodal view of language-based imitation that considers gestural, prosodic, verbal/lexical components since numerous studies indicate similarities in processing speech and gesture as well as prosodic information from visual and vocal channels.

Overall, this introduction outlines gaps in existing research regarding preschoolers' socially relevant imitation patterns and their relationship to complex language measures (such as narration skills) and sociopragmatic measures. The main hypothesis is that integrated multimodal language-based imitation abilities will be related to both complex language measures and sociopragmatic measures in preschoolers.

By addressing these gaps through their study design, the authors aim to contribute new insights into the role of socially relevant imitation patterns at the preschool stage while emphasizing the importance of considering multiple modalities (gestural, prosodic, verbal/lexical) when studying language development.
