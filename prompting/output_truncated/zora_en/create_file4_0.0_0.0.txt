1. Introduction

The development of imitation skills in early childhood has long been recognized as a crucial factor in language acquisition and social communication. Previous research has extensively examined the relationship between infants' imitation abilities and their subsequent language development, particularly focusing on object- and language-based imitation skills in infants aged 9 to 20 months (Zora, 20XX). However, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of how these imitation behaviors continue to influence language and sociocommunicative skills in later stages of development.

This paper aims to address this gap by investigating the joint relevance of multimodal imitation, encompassing gestural, prosodic, and lexical components, and object-based imitation in preschool-aged children. Specifically, we seek to explore the association between these imitation skills and two key domains of development: narrative abilities and sociopragmatic abilities. By examining the relationship between imitation and these domains, we aim to shed light on the broader conceptualization of imitation behaviors in the field of language development.

Narrative abilities refer to a child's capacity to construct and convey coherent and meaningful stories, while sociopragmatic abilities encompass the understanding and use of social and pragmatic cues in communication. Both of these domains are crucial for successful social interaction and language development in preschool-aged children. However, the specific role of imitation skills, particularly multimodal imitation, in shaping these abilities remains largely unexplored.

To investigate this relationship, a correlational study was conducted with a sample of typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children. The participants completed four tasks designed to assess their multimodal imitation, object-based imitation, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities. By examining the associations between these variables, we aimed to determine whether preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is related to their language and sociocommunicative skills.

Based on previous research suggesting the importance of imitation in early language development, we hypothesize that there will be a significant positive correlation between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative abilities and sociopragmatic abilities. Furthermore, we expect that object-based imitation skills will not show a significant relationship with these domains, indicating the unique contribution of multimodal imitation to language and sociocommunicative development in preschool-aged children.

The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the role of imitation in language development. By highlighting the significance of multimodal imitation, encompassing gestural, prosodic, and lexical components, we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive conceptualization of imitation behaviors in the field of language development. This research has the potential to inform educational interventions and therapeutic approaches aimed at enhancing language and sociocommunicative skills in preschool-aged children.

In the following sections, we will provide a detailed description of the methodology employed in this study, present the results of the correlational analyses, and discuss the implications of our findings. By examining the relationship between multimodal imitation, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities, we hope to advance our understanding of the complex interplay between imitation and language development in early childhood.
