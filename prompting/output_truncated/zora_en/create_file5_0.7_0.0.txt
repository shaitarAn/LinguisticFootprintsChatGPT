1. Introduction

The phonetic properties of Swiss Standard German (SSG) and its relationship with Alemannic (ALM) dialects have garnered considerable attention in recent years. Researchers have extensively explored the consonantal aspects of ALM dialects, yet there remains a dearth of studies examining the vowel quality in these dialects and its influence on the corresponding SSG varieties. This gap in research presents an opportunity to delve deeper into the intricacies of vowel characteristics in ALM dialects and their impact on SSG.

The aim of this study is to investigate the vowel quality in four ALM dialects and its influence on the respective varieties of SSG. By conducting a comprehensive acoustic analysis, this research seeks to fill the existing void in comparative phonetic studies between ALM and SSG vowels. Furthermore, this study aims to shed light on the extent to which ALM dialects contribute to shaping the vowel qualities found in SSG varieties.

To achieve these objectives, the present study will focus on the long-vowel inventories of four ALM dialects: Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. These dialects have been selected due to their distinct geographical locations within Switzerland and the diversity they offer in terms of phonetic characteristics. Through the collection of speech data from 4 male and 4 female speakers in each dialect region, a corpus of 1,632 tokens will be compiled, allowing for a robust analysis of vowel quality.

The analysis will primarily examine the transfer of ALM vowel quality to the SSG varieties spoken in each dialect region. Findings from this investigation will provide valuable insights into the relationship between ALM and SSG vowels, highlighting the areas of convergence and divergence. Specifically, this study will explore two dialect regions, Chur and Brig, where it is hypothesized that ALM vowel quality will be predominantly transferred to the corresponding SSG varieties. Contrastingly, the SSG varieties spoken in Bern and Zurich are expected to exhibit certain vowel qualities that deviate from the ALM dialects, particularly the fronting of the <a> vowel in both dialects.

Moreover, this study will examine the production of the Bern SSG <ä> vowel, which is expected to manifest as both [ɛː] and [æː], and investigate any variations in the realization of the <o> vowel, which is anticipated to be pronounced more towards the back. By dissecting these specific vowel qualities, this research aims to identify potential patterns and variations within the SSG varieties spoken in Bern and Zurich, providing a nuanced understanding of the phonetic influences at play.

The implications of this study extend beyond the realm of phonetics. By shedding light on the vowel quality variations between ALM dialects and SSG varieties, this research contributes to the broader understanding of language variation and change within a multilingual country like Switzerland. Furthermore, the findings will have practical implications for language education and language policy, providing insights into the maintenance and evolution of SSG in relation to its underlying ALM dialect influences.

In summary, this study aims to bridge the gap in research by conducting a comparative acoustic analysis of ALM and SSG vowels. By investigating the influence of ALM dialects on the vowel qualities of SSG varieties, this study seeks to deepen our understanding of the phonetic
