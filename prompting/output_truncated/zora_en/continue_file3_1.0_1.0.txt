The study of wordhood in the Middle Welsh verbal complex is a challenging task due to the complex morphological and phonological interactions within this language. This article aims to provide an extensive analysis of these domains and shed light on whether the term "word" is a suitable descriptor for the grammatical units in Middle Welsh.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding how bound elements function within Insular Celtic languages, especially considering their significant presence compared to other European languages. These bound elements can create intricate phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures, making it difficult to delineate discrete words in the traditional sense.

To approach this issue, it is essential to review current typological research on wordhood and understand its limitations when applied to corpus languages like Middle Welsh. While typology provides valuable insights into language universals and cross-linguistic patterns, it may not fully capture the intricacies of specific languages with unique features such as Insular Celtic ones.

With these considerations in mind, this study embarks on a meticulous examination of morphological and phonological structures within the Middle Welsh verbal complex. The findings reveal various linguistic units that could potentially be identified as "words." However, due to their interconnections and overlapping boundaries, labeling them definitively as words becomes problematic.

This conclusion challenges our conventional understanding of wordhood and highlights its limited applicability in synchronic descriptions of Middle Welsh grammar. Rather than attempting to fit these linguistic units into rigid word categories borrowed from other languages' frameworks, future research should adopt a more flexible approach that accounts for their dynamic nature.

This article will proceed by first introducing some background information about Middle Welsh morphology before delving into detailed analyses of specific verbal formations. By closely examining various aspects such as inflectional morphology, derivational processes, compound verbs formation, syntactic behavior patterns with clitics or particles at both sentence-level and clause-level positions - we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the morphological and phonological domains within Middle Welsh's verbal complex.

In doing so, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of the nature of linguistic units in Middle Welsh and offer valuable insights into the broader discussions on wordhood in corpus languages. Ultimately, this study aims to stimulate further research in this field and encourage more nuanced approaches to describing and analyzing languages with complex bound elements, such as Insular Celtic ones.
