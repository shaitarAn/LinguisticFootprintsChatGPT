This introduction to the Zora article discusses the concept of framing in communication research and the need for systematic reviews to better understand and synthesize the theoretical and empirical insights related to framing. The author highlights that while many studies refer to framing, there is a lack of clear definitions, resulting in a diversity of phenomena being categorized under this concept. This poses challenges for communication research in terms of identifying common trends and gaps in knowledge.

The author argues that previous systematic reviews on framing have not fully utilized one of the unique characteristics of the framing approach: its ability to consider the entire communication process and bridge different perspectives. The framing approach encompasses strategic communication by various actors, journalistic cognitions and reporting, audience frames, framing effects, as well as broader cultural contexts. The author references Entman's framework, which identifies frame locations in the communication process: the communicator, the text/message, the receiver, and the culture.

To address the limitations of existing reviews, the author proposes conducting a systematic review that explores how framing has been applied across frame locations. The focus of this review is on the framing of climate change. The author justifies this choice by highlighting the importance of climate change as a global problem and the challenges audiences face in engaging with and understanding the issue. Frames play a role in shaping audience support for actions related to climate change. Additionally, the author notes that climate change communication is unique due to its complexity, scientific uncertainty, and the interconnectedness of experts, policy, sources of information, and audiences.

The author also emphasizes the growth of research on framing in climate change communication and the need for a systematic review to take stock of existing studies and guide future research. By examining frames of communicators, journalists, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, the review aims to identify the most salient frames across frame locations. This approach allows for an assessment of the cultural framing repository and identifies any conceptual misfit across frame locations. The author suggests that field-specific insights from the study on framing in climate change communication can contribute to the broader understanding of framing in communication research.

The study will utilize a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches, specifically content analysis, drawing on 25 years of published literature on climate change framing.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the study by highlighting the significance of framing in communication research, the need for systematic reviews, and the specific focus on framing in climate change communication. It also outlines the goals and methodology of the study and provides a rationale for its importance and relevance.
