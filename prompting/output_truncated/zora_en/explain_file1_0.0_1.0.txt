In this introduction, the author discusses the concept of reference in conversation and how it is commonly expressed through noun phrases (NP REs). They explain that during interactive communication, changes can be observed in the NP REs produced by speakers. These changes are referred to as "changes-in-interaction." 

The first type of change-in-interaction discussed is lexical convergence, where speakers' contributions become more similar in terms of both vocabulary and grammatical constructions used. This phenomenon has been linked to the cognitive process of aligning linguistic representations, as described by the Interactive Alignment Model.

The second change-in-interaction observed is referential contraction, where interlocutors tend to shorten their contributions. The author refers to this as "referential contraction" and explains that it often occurs alongside lexical convergence.

The focus of this chapter is primarily on referential contraction and its structural changes in NP REs over multiple rounds of interactive dialogue. The research questions addressed include: 1) To what extent do speakers' NP REs get shortened during a dialogic interaction? Which elements are subject to shortening? 2) What structural changes can be observed in the production of NP REs across four rounds of an interactive referential communication task?

To investigate these questions, a referential communication task was designed that involved spoken dialogues over four rounds. Participants repeatedly referred to the same visual stimuli. An example from the resulting corpus illustrates a typical shortening process observed throughout the interaction.

The study aims to describe general tendencies regarding preferred grammatical structures for NP REs as speakers converge on forms of expression and shorten their contributions. Specifically, it focuses on types and forms of modifying and descriptive elements within NP RE constructions throughout the interaction.

The trajectory of change observed in this study shows a shift from post-head clausal elements (e.g., "it's green") in earlier rounds to a greater frequency of phrasal (pre-)modification (e.g., "green") in later rounds. This change is referred to as "compression" and encompasses both the shortening process and the shift in structural preferences.

The introduction also discusses previous research on change-in-interaction, particularly related to compression in NP REs. Theoretical approaches such as the Interactive Alignment Model and discussions of familiarity and accessibility are contextualized within experimental referential communication task studies.

The experimental set-up employed to elicit a corpus of spoken English dialogues is introduced, followed by an analysis of the structural changes in NP REs over the course of the interactions. The findings show that as NP REs get shortened, their structure changes from more elaborated clausal forms to more compressed phrasal forms.

Finally, these findings are discussed in relation to Biber and Clark's notion of compression as a response to conveying a large amount of information efficiently.
