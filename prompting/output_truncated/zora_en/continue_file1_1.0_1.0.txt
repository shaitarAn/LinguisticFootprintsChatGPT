In communication, noun phrases are frequently used as referring expressions. These noun phrase referring expressions (NP REs) can undergo changes during an interactive communication. Previous research has shown that speakers tend to converge on certain linguistic forms and, in the process, shorten their NP REs. The aim of this chapter is to investigate this shortening process and examine the structural changes that occur in NP REs.

To conduct this study, a corpus of spoken English was created using an experimental task where participants engaged in conversational dialogues while referring to visual stimuli. The data collected from these interactions revealed interesting patterns in how NP REs were shortened. Specifically, there was a decrease observed in longer clausal post-head elements as the conversation progressed. Conversely, there was a relative increase in the use of only premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification.

These observed changes suggest a shift in the type of structural modification present within the NP REs. Initially, speakers tended to produce more clausal elements associated with structural elaboration. However, as the interaction continued, there was a decrease in these clausal elements and an increase in phrasal modification, indicating a move towards structural compression.

The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of how language users adapt their referring expressions during interactive communication. By observing how NP REs change structurally over time, we gain insights into how individuals streamline their speech towards more efficient and concise forms.

In conclusion, this chapter examines the phenomenon of post-head compression in noun phrase referring expressions within interactive communication contexts. Through an analysis of data from an experimentally elicited corpus of spoken English dialogues, it demonstrates that interlocutors tend to shorten their NP REs over time by reducing clausal elements and increasing phrasal modification. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of language production during conversations and shed light on how communicative efficiency influences linguistic structure adaptation.
