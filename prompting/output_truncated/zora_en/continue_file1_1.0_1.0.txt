In communication, the use of referring expressions is essential for effective and efficient interaction. Noun phrases (NPs) often serve as the central component of these referring expressions, allowing language users to identify and refer to specific entities or objects. However, previous research has shown that the use of NP referring expressions tends to change over the course of a communicative interaction.

One aspect of this change is the tendency for interlocutors to converge on certain linguistic forms, establishing routines in their conversations. This convergence allows for smoother and more fluid communication between speakers. As part of this convergence process, interlocutors also tend to shorten their NP referring expressions.

The present chapter aims to investigate this shortening process and examine the structural changes that accompany it in NP referring expressions. To do so, data from an experimentally elicited corpus of spoken English was analyzed. The corpus consisted of conversational dyads participating in a referential communication task where they repeatedly referred to visual stimuli.

The analysis revealed a clear pattern: interlocutors consistently shortened their NP referring expressions over the course of the dialogues. More specifically, there was a noticeable decrease in longer clausal post-head elements as well as an increase in premodified NPs and shorter phrasal postmodification.

This trend indicates a shift in the type of structural modification employed by speakers within their NP referring expressions. At the beginning stages of interaction, speakers were found to produce more clausal elements within their NPs. These clausal elements are associated with structural elaboration and may include additional information or clauses related to the entity being referred to.

However, as interactions progressed, there was a decline in clausal elements and an increase in phrasal modification within NP referring expressions. Phrasal modification involves modifying an NP using shorter phrases or adjectives instead of full clauses.

These findings suggest that speakers engage in a process known as post-head compression when shortening their NP referring expressions during interactive communication. Post-head compression refers to the phenomenon where speakers condense and reduce longer, more elaborate structures into shorter and more streamlined forms.

This structural change has important implications for the efficiency of communication. By compressing their NP referring expressions, speakers can convey the same referential information with fewer words. This aids in faster processing and comprehension for both speakers and listeners.

The results of this study contribute to our understanding of how referring expressions evolve in interactive communication. By uncovering the structural changes that accompany the shortening process, we gain insights into how interlocutors adapt their language use to facilitate effective communication.

Future research could further explore this topic by examining different languages or contexts to determine if these findings apply universally or are influenced by specific linguistic or cultural factors. Additionally, investigating how these structural changes in NP referring expressions impact listener comprehension would provide further insight into the cognitive mechanisms underlying interactive communication.

In conclusion, this chapter highlights the phenomenon of post-head compression in noun phrase referring expressions during interactive communication. The analysis of a spoken English corpus revealed a clear pattern of shorter NPs with decreased clausal elements and increased phrasal modification over time. These findings shed light on how speakers adapt their language use to optimize communicative efficiency,
