1. Introduction

The development of imitation skills in early childhood has long been recognized as a critical factor in language development. Previous research has primarily focused on the relevance of infants' imitation skills during the first two years of life, particularly with respect to object- and language-based imitation (Meltzoff, 1988; Tomasello & Farrar, 1986). However, there has been limited exploration into how these imitative behaviors continue to influence language and sociocommunicative abilities as children grow older.

This study aims to investigate the joint relevance of multimodal imitation and object-based imitation on narratives and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-age children. Multimodal imitation refers to the ability to imitate various aspects of communication, such as gestural, prosodic, and lexical components (Tomasello & Carpenter, 2007). Object-based imitation pertains specifically to imitating actions related to objects or toys.

While previous studies have established a positive correlation between early imitation skills and language development in infancy (Meltzoff & Moore, 1977; Mundy et al., 1990), it remains unclear whether these associations persist or change throughout later stages of development. By examining preschoolers aged three to four years old, this study seeks to shed light on the ongoing relationship between multimodal/object-based imitation skills and narrative/sociopragmatic abilities beyond infancy.

Narrative abilities encompass children's capacity for constructing coherent stories with well-defined characters, settings, events, causes-and-effects relationships (Berman & Slobin, 1994). Sociopragmatic abilities refer to an individual's understanding and use of social conventions embedded within communication contexts (Bates et al., 1979). These two domains are crucial for effective social interaction and successful participation within a community.

Research exploring the association between narrative/sociopragmatic skills with multimodal/object-based imitation is scarce among preschool-aged children. Understanding the link between imitation and these sociolinguistic competencies in early childhood can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of language development.

The present study employs a correlational design, aiming to determine whether preschool-age children's ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues (gestural, prosodic, and lexical) is significantly related to their narrative and sociopragmatic skills. It hypothesizes that a stronger correlation will be observed between multimodal imitation and narrative/sociopragmatic abilities compared to object-based imitation.

By investigating the relationship between imitation skills and language-related competencies beyond infancy, this study extends recent research in the field of language development. It contributes to a broader conceptualization of imitation behaviors by highlighting the importance of prosodic, gestural, and verbal linguistic patterns as essential components for successful social communication.

Findings from this study may have implications for educational interventions aimed at enhancing narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschoolers. By better understanding how multimodal imitation relates to these key aspects of communication, educators can design targeted interventions that foster children's linguistic growth within social contexts.

In summary, this paper introduces an investigation into the joint relevance of multimodal/object-based imitation on narratives and sociopragmatic abilities among preschool-aged children. By examining the relationship between these variables beyond infancy, this study aims to enhance our understanding of how early imitation skills continue to shape language development throughout childhood.
