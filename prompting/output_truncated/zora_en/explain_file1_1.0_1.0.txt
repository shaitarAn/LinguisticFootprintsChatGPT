This introduction for the Zora article discusses the phenomenon of reference in conversation, specifically focusing on referring expressions with noun phrases (NP REs). It explains that as speakers interact, their NP REs undergo changes-in-interaction. The first change is lexical and grammatical convergence, which has been linked to the cognitive process of aligning linguistic representations. The second change is referential contraction, where interlocutors tend to shorten their contributions. The chapter primarily focuses on this process of shortening NP REs and aims to describe structural changes observed over multiple rounds of interactive dialogue.

The research questions addressed are: 1) To what degree do speakers' NP REs get shortened over the course of dialogic interaction? What elements are subject to shortening? 2) What structural changes can be observed in the production of NP REs across four rounds of interactive communication?

To investigate these changes-in-interaction, a referential communication task was conducted involving spoken dialogues over four rounds. A specific example illustrates how an initial longer NP RE gets shortened while converging on a specific form ("green dress shirt"). The focus is on how speakers change their preferred grammatical structure for producing NP REs as they converge and shorten them.

The study aims to describe general tendencies regarding modifying and descriptive elements in the construction of NP REs throughout the interaction. It demonstrates a trajectory from clausal elements (e.g., "it's green") to phrasal modification (e.g., "green") labeled as "compression." This term encompasses both shortening and changes in structural preferences.

Section 2 discusses previous research on change-in-interaction related to compression in NP REs. The experimental set-up employed for collecting spoken English dialogues is introduced in Section 3. Section 4 presents an analysis showing that as NP REs are shortened, their structures shift from more elaborate clausal forms to more compressed phrasal forms.

Finally, in Section 5, the findings are discussed in relation to the notion of compression as a change in response to conveying a large amount of information efficiently. It connects these findings with Biber and Clark's (2002) concept of compression and its relevance for expert audiences.
