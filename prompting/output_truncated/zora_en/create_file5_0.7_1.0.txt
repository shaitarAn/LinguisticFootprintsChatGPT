1. Introduction

The phonetic properties of Swiss Standard German (SSG) have received limited attention despite its status as one of the official languages in Switzerland. While there exist some studies on Alemannic (ALM) dialects, most of them focus on consonants rather than vowels. This general lack of research calls for further investigation into the vowel inventories of ALM dialects and their influence on the respective varieties of SSG regarding vowel quality.

In light of this, the present study aims to explore an alternative research question within this domain: How does regional variation in ALM dialects shape the vowel qualities observed in SSG varieties? Specifically, we seek to examine how certain dialect regions affect the transfer and adaptation of vowel qualities from ALM to SSG varieties.

To achieve our goals, a comparative acoustic analysis will be conducted between four selected ALM dialects and their corresponding SSG varieties. The study will involve recording eight speakers (four male and four female) from different regions: Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Each speaker will produce three repetitions for each vowel sound under investigation, resulting in a corpus comprising 1,632 tokens.

The primary objective is twofold: Firstly, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis comparing the long-vowel inventories across these four ALM dialects along with their respective SSG varieties based on acoustic measurements. By doing so, we intend to contribute new insights into the understudied area of Swiss German phonetics.

Secondly, this study seeks to investigate to what extent interference from ALM dialects shapes vowel qualities in corresponding SSG varieties spoken within specific regional contexts. By examining both similarities and differences between these two linguistic levels—dialectal variation versus standard variety—we can gain a deeper understanding of language contact phenomena between traditional Alemannic speech forms and standardized Swiss German.

Based on preliminary observations made by previous researchers who primarily focused on consonants, it is expected that ALM vowel quality will be transferred to SSG varieties in some dialect regions. Specifically, previous studies have suggested that Chur and Brig exhibit a higher degree of similarity between the vowel qualities found in their respective ALM dialects and SSG varieties.

However, we hypothesize that the vowel qualities observed in Bern and Zurich SSG varieties may deviate from those of their corresponding ALM dialects. In particular, it is anticipated that certain vowel qualities—such as <a>—will be fronted in the SSG variety of either dialect. Furthermore, potential variation is expected to arise with regards to the realization of <ä>, which may manifest as both [ɛː] and [æː], while <o> might be pronounced farther back.

By systematically analyzing these regional variations using acoustic measurements, this study aims to contribute valuable insights into Swiss German phonetics by shedding light on how Alemannic influences shape vowel quality within corresponding SSG varieties. Ultimately, this research aims to fill an important gap in the existing literature while contributing to our understanding of language contact phenomena within Switzerland's linguistic landscape.
