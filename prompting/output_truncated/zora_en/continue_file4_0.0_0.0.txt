Imitation is a fundamental aspect of human development, particularly in the acquisition of language and social communication skills. Previous research has shown that infants' early imitation skills, such as object- and language-based imitation, are predictive of later language development. However, there is a lack of research examining the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors in preschool-aged children.

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between multimodal imitation skills, object-based imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities in preschoolers. Multimodal imitation refers to the ability to imitate various components of communication, including gestures, prosody, and lexical patterns. Object-based imitation, on the other hand, involves imitating actions with objects.

A total of thirty-one typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children participated in the study. They were assessed on four tasks: multimodal imitation, object-based imitation, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities. The researchers hypothesized that there would be a significant relationship between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative and sociopragmatic abilities, but not between object-based imitation skills and these language and sociocommunicative skills.

The results of the study supported the researchers' hypotheses. It was found that preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues, such as gestures, prosody, and lexical patterns, was strongly related to their narrative and sociopragmatic skills. However, there was no significant relationship between object-based imitation skills and these language and sociocommunicative abilities.

These findings suggest that imitation behaviors in the field of language development should be conceptualized more broadly, taking into account not only object-based imitation but also the imitation of multimodal cues. This highlights the importance of considering the gestural, prosodic, and verbal linguistic patterns in children's imitation abilities.

Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the role of imitation in preschool children's language and social communication development. It emphasizes the significance of multimodal imitation skills in the acquisition of narrative and sociopragmatic abilities. Further research in this area could explore the specific mechanisms through which imitation influences language and social communication skills, as well as potential interventions to enhance these skills in children with developmental delays or disorders.
