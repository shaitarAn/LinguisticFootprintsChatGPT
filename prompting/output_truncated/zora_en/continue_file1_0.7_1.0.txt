In the realm of communication, speakers often use noun phrases as referring expressions (NP REs) to convey their intended message. However, research has shown that the use of NP REs can change over the course of an interaction. Specifically, speakers tend to converge on linguistic forms and shorten their NP REs in the process. This chapter aims to explore this shortening phenomenon and examine the structural changes that occur within NP REs.

To investigate this topic, a corpus of spoken English was created through an experimental task where participants engaged in conversational dyads and repeatedly referred to visual stimuli. The data from these interactions revealed that interlocutors indeed shortened their NP REs as the dialogues progressed.

One notable change observed was a decrease in longer clausal post-head elements within the NP REs. Initially, speakers tended to include more elaborate clausal elements in their referring expressions. These clausal elements provide additional information about the referent but also contribute to structural complexity.

However, as the interaction continued, there was a noticeable shift towards shorter phrasal postmodification within NP REs. This suggests a move towards structural compression as interlocutors aimed for more concise and efficient communication.

Moreover, there was an increase in the use of only premodified NP REs over time. This means that speakers relied more on premodification – modifying the noun with adjectives or other modifiers before any postmodification – rather than including extensive post-head elements.

Overall, these findings indicate that there is a systematic pattern of structural change within NP REs during interactive communication. Initially, speakers may opt for more elaboration by incorporating clausal post-head elements into their referring expressions. However, as they strive for efficiency and convergence with their interlocutors' linguistic forms, they gradually transition towards shorter phrasal modification and rely on premodification alone.

These observations have important implications for our understanding of how language users adapt and optimize their communication strategies during interactive exchanges. By shortening and compressing their NP REs, speakers are able to convey their intended message more efficiently while still maintaining mutual understanding with their interlocutors.

Furthermore, these findings contribute to the broader field of referential communication research by shedding light on the structural changes that occur within NP REs. By uncovering these patterns, we gain a deeper understanding of the cognitive processes involved in producing and comprehending referring expressions.

In conclusion, this chapter has explored the phenomenon of post-head compression in noun phrase referring expressions during interactive communication. Through analysis of an experimentally elicited corpus, it was observed that speakers tend to shorten their NP REs over time by decreasing clausal elements and increasing phrasal modification. This indicates a shift towards structural compression and optimization in communication strategies. These findings enhance our understanding of how language users adapt and optimize their communication during interactive exchanges and contribute to the broader field of referential communication research.
