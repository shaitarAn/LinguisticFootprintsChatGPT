1. Introduction

In the realm of communication, language users frequently employ noun phrases at the center of their referring expressions (NP REs). These NP REs serve as a means to refer to specific entities or objects within a given context. Previous research has demonstrated that over the course of a communicative interaction, interlocutors tend to modify their use of NP REs, with speakers converging on linguistic forms and shortening their expressions in the process (REF).

While existing studies have shed light on this phenomenon, there remains an unexplored research question: How does post-head compression in noun phrase referring expressions impact interactive communication? This study aims to investigate this question by examining the structural changes that occur within NP REs during conversational interactions.

To address this research question, we will analyze data from an experimentally elicited corpus of spoken English. The corpus consists of conversational dyads engaged in a referential communication task where they produce repeated references to visual stimuli. By focusing on these dialogues, we can observe how interlocutors adapt and modify their NP REs throughout the course of interaction.

The primary objective is to examine whether there is evidence for post-head compression within NP REs and how it manifests structurally. Specifically, we will explore whether there is a decrease in longer clausal post-head elements as well as an increase in premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification over time.

The investigation into these structural changes aims to provide insights into how speakers adapt their language use during interactive communication. By understanding how speakers compress their referring expressions over time, we can gain valuable knowledge about the dynamics and mechanisms underlying effective communication.

Furthermore, this study contributes to our understanding of linguistic routines established during interactive discourse. Previous research has shown that speakers tend to converge on certain linguistic forms when engaging in conversation (REF). By examining how these routines are established through shortening processes within NP REs, we can gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that drive linguistic convergence.

The findings from this study have implications for various fields, including psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and communication studies. Understanding how speakers modify their NP REs during interactive communication can shed light on the cognitive processes involved in language production and comprehension. Additionally, these insights can inform our understanding of how language use varies across different social contexts and between individuals.

In summary, this paper aims to investigate the impact of post-head compression in noun phrase referring expressions on interactive communication. By analyzing data from an experimentally elicited corpus of spoken English, we will examine the structural changes that occur within NP REs over time. The findings will contribute to our understanding of linguistic routines established during conversation and provide insights into the dynamics underlying effective communication.
