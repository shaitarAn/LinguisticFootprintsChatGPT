Climate change is a complex and urgent issue that requires effective communication strategies to engage the public and prompt action. Over the past 25 years, there has been a significant increase in research on framing climate change. Framing, as a concept in communication research, refers to the way messages are constructed to shape how individuals interpret and understand an issue. However, despite the growing body of literature on framing climate change, there is a lack of consensus on how to define and apply framing in this particular context.

This systematic review aims to address this gap by examining the trends and patterns of framing in climate change communication, specifically focusing on the production of frames, the content of frames, the frames adopted by different audiences, and the effects of framing. By analyzing 275 peer-reviewed articles, this review employs both quantitative and qualitative methods of content analysis to gain a comprehensive understanding of the state of framing in climate change communication.

One key finding of this review is that the potential for framing to bridge different perspectives and foster dialogue has not been fully utilized in climate change communication research. While framing has been extensively studied in other domains of communication research, such as politics and health, its potential to bridge differing perspectives in the context of climate change has not been fully explored. This conceptual gap limits our ability to effectively communicate and engage individuals across various stakeholder groups in addressing climate change.

The review also highlights the need for future research to focus on the conceptual (mis)fit between different frame locations. By examining the alignment or misalignment of frames produced by various actors, the content of frames, the frames adopted by different audiences, and the framing effects, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding climate change communication.

In conclusion, this systematic review offers a comprehensive analysis of the framing of climate change communication over the past 25 years. It points out the lack of consensus on how to define and apply framing in this context and identifies the untapped potential of framing as a bridging concept. The findings of this review underscore the need for further research to explore the conceptual (mis)fit between frame locations and provide directions for future studies. Ultimately, by harnessing the power of framing to bridge perspectives and engage diverse audiences, we can enhance the effectiveness of climate change communication and drive action towards mitigating the impacts of climate change.
