Climate change is a pressing global issue that requires effective communication strategies to raise awareness and promote action. Over the past few decades, researchers have focused on understanding how the framing of climate change can influence public opinion and behavior. However, despite the growing body of literature on framing, there is still a lack of consensus and clear definitions in this field, making it challenging to synthesize the theoretical and empirical findings.

This systematic review aims to address this gap by examining the trends of framing in climate change communication over the past 25 years. To provide a comprehensive understanding, the review considers different aspects of framing, including frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects. By comparing frames across these different locations, the study explores the potential of framing as a bridging concept that can connect different perspectives and facilitate effective communication about climate change.

To conduct this review, a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches was employed, utilizing content analysis of peer-reviewed literature on the framing of climate change. The review analyzed a total of 275 articles, covering a wide range of topics and methodologies. The findings of this review revealed several important insights into the current state of framing research in the context of climate change.

One key observation is that the potential of framing as a bridging concept has not been fully utilized in climate change communication. While framing has been widely studied, the integration of different frame locations has been limited. This limitation creates a conceptual mismatch and hinders the development of a holistic understanding of framing in the context of climate change.

Moreover, the review identified a lack of consistency in the definitions and operationalization of frames in the literature. This inconsistency further complicates the synthesis of findings and makes it challenging to compare and generalize across different studies. To address this issue, future research should strive for clearer definitions and standardized measures of frames in the context of climate change communication.

Additionally, the review highlighted the need for more research on framing effects in climate change communication. While there have been numerous studies investigating the impact of frames on public opinion and behavior, there is still limited understanding of the underlying processes and mechanisms. Future research should aim to explore the cognitive and emotional processes through which frames influence individuals' attitudes, beliefs, and actions related to climate change.

The findings of this review have important implications for climate change communication. By recognizing framing as a bridging concept, researchers and practitioners can enhance the effectiveness of their communication strategies. Adopting an integrated approach that considers multiple frame locations can facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of framing and its potential to influence public opinion and behavior.

In conclusion, this systematic review provides valuable insights into the state of framing research in climate change communication. By examining the trends and limitations in the literature, the study highlights the need for a more integrated and cohesive approach to framing. Through clearer definitions, standardized measures, and a focus on framing effects, researchers and practitioners can enhance their communication strategies and effectively address the urgent problem of climate change.
