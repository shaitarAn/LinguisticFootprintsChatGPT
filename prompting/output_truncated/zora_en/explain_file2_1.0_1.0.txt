The introduction of this Zora article discusses the concept of framing and its importance in communication research. It highlights that although many studies refer to framing, there is a lack of consistent definitions, leading to a variety of phenomena falling under this conceptual umbrella. This diversity complicates efforts to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights in communication research.

The article suggests that systematic reviews can help overcome these problems by identifying trends, research gaps, and guiding future research. However, existing reviews on framing have not fully utilized one unique characteristic of the framing approach: its bridging potential. Framing allows for considering the entire communication process and bridging different perspectives such as strategic communication, journalistic cognition and reporting, audience frames, framing effects, as well as broader cultural contexts.

The focus then shifts to the importance of examining the cultural framing repository through systematic review specifically in relation to climate change. Climate change communication is highly relevant due to its global significance and challenges in engaging audiences while frames also influence support for actions.

Additionally, the unobtrusiveness, complexity, scientific uncertainty surrounding climate change require effective connections between experts, policy-makers and audiences. Framing is seen as a means to break through communication barriers in this context.

Furthermore researchers have an expectation that studying framing helps develop communication strategies for target audiences and support actions against climate change effectively. The authors emphasize that exploring framing across frame locations is essential for this purpose.

The introduction also points out that research on framing in climate change communication is growing steadily making a systematic review necessary for future research guidance. Previous studies have looked at framings by communicators and journalists as well as frame content analysis from audience perspectives providing scope for assessing across frame locations.

Considering the limited number of systematic reviews available on framing within overall communication research field further adds weightage towards conducting this study on climate change.

Lastly researchers contend that potential variations exist in how framing applies across subtopics within specific fields such as health communication which should be explored along with framing in climate change communication. The aim is to conduct a systematic review on framing of climate change and compare findings with overall communication research to harness framing's potential as an integrative bridging concept.

The study seeks to connect research on frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects across various sources of literature over a period of 25 years using both quantitative and qualitative approaches of content analysis.
