1. Introduction

The role of imitation skills in language development has been extensively studied in infants, with a particular focus on object- and language-based imitation during the first two years of life. However, there is a paucity of research examining the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors later on in development, particularly in preschool-aged children. This gap in knowledge calls for further investigation into the relationship between multimodal imitation skills (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components) and their impact on narrative performance and sociopragmatic abilities.

While previous studies have established a link between early imitation skills and language development in infants, it remains unclear whether this association persists as children grow older. Moreover, little attention has been given to the specific contributions of different types of imitation (e.g., object-based vs. multimodal) to narrative abilities and sociopragmatics during the preschool years.

To address these gaps in understanding, this study aims to explore the relationship between preschoolers' multimodal imitation skills (i.e., their ability to imitate socially relevant cues through gestures, prosody, and verbal linguistic patterns) and their narrative performance as well as sociopragmatic abilities. By investigating these associations within a single cohort of typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children using standardized assessment tasks, we seek to provide valuable insights into how different forms of imitation may influence language acquisition and social communication during early childhood.

The findings from this study will contribute to our understanding of the broader conceptualization of imitation behaviors within the field of language development by highlighting the significance of integrating prosodic, gestural, and verbal linguistic patterns when examining preschoolers' imitative capacities. Furthermore, by elucidating the specific links between multimodal imitation skills and narrative performance/sociopragmatic abilities at this developmental stage, our research will shed light on potential intervention strategies that can enhance language learning outcomes for young children.

In summary, this study aims to investigate the relationship between preschoolers' multimodal imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities. By examining these associations, we hope to advance our understanding of the role of imitation in language development and provide insights into effective interventions for promoting optimal language acquisition during early childhood.
