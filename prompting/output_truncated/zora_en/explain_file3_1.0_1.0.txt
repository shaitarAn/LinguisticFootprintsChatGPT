The introduction to this Zora article discusses the unique characteristics of the Insular Celtic languages, specifically their complex phonological and morphological elements. It mentions that these languages have been described as having a "sentence word," indicating that rather than individual words, groups of words are accentuated in these languages. This can lead to a loss of "phonological autonomy" for individual words, meaning that they become bound within larger linguistic units.

The article suggests that compared to other European languages, early Insular Celtic languages have a larger number of phonologically and morphologically bound formatives. It mentions incorporated adjectives or adverbs as examples of these bound elements. Additionally, there is significant phonological and morpho-phonological interaction between the components of a phrase.

However, while broad descriptions touch upon these aspects, they often lack specific criteria for defining "wordhood" or "phonological autonomy." The article points out that contemporary native grammars also do not provide explicit definitions for wordhood. For example, early Irish grammars did not have an equivalent concept to the modern idea of a word; their basic unit was called "focal," which referred to any type of syntactic group. Similarly, Middle Welsh grammars offer little insight into defining words - instead referring to syllables and correct utterances.

The author highlights recent typological research on wordhood which shows that some languages may lack a single unified word domain. Languages can have no clear-cut concept of wordhood or conflicting domains where multiple entities are considered words.

Based on ongoing research in this field [REF], the study aims to investigate the potential characteristics resembling words in the verbal complex structure present in Middle Welsh prose texts from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. Poetry will be used alongside prose as sources for analysis since it may reveal interesting differences between genres and provide additional insights.

To narrow down the scope, only finite verbal structures will be examined because different parts of speech within the same language can exhibit variations in wordhood patterns. In Middle Welsh, the verbal complex refers to the finite verb and its associated elements, such as conjunctions, polarity markers, and various markers related to tense and agreement.

The study is divided into three main sections. Section 2 explains the research approach taken in this study. Section 3 delves into the morphological structure within the verbal complex, analyzing its constituent elements. Lastly, Section 4 discusses phonological and prosodic processes that occur within the verbal complex and how they align with the morphological structure outlined in Section 3.

The final section of the paper, Section 5, summarizes and discusses findings from previous sections while also proposing potential avenues for further study on this topic.

In conclusion, this introduction provides an overview of what will be explored in this Zora article - primarily focusing on Insular Celtic languages' unique linguistic features related to wordhood. It establishes a need for more specific criteria defining words or phonological autonomy within these languages. The article then outlines its objectives to investigate Middle Welsh prose texts' word-like properties by analyzing their finite verbal structures' morphology and phonology.
