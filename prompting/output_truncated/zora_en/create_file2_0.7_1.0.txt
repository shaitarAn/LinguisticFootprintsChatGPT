1. Introduction

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time, with far-reaching implications for societies, economies, and ecosystems worldwide. As the scientific consensus on the causes and consequences of climate change has solidified over the past few decades, there has been a growing recognition of the need to effectively communicate this complex issue to various stakeholders. Effective communication is crucial for raising public awareness, influencing policy decisions, and mobilizing collective action towards mitigating and adapting to climate change.

While there has been a surge in research exploring various aspects of climate change communication in recent years, there remains a lack of consensus on how best to frame this multifaceted issue. Framing refers to the process through which information is presented in order to shape individuals' perceptions and understanding of an issue (Entman, 1993). It involves selecting certain aspects or perspectives while excluding others in order to influence how people interpret and respond to that issue (Nisbet & Huge, 2006).

Existing studies on framing in climate change communication have provided valuable insights into different aspects such as frame production (e.g., media framing), frame content (e.g., emphasis on risks vs. opportunities), audience frames (e.g., individual responsibility vs. collective action), and framing effects (e.g., attitude formation or behavior change) (Chong & Druckman, 2007; Nisbet et al., 2010). However, despite these contributions, a lack of consistent definitions and frameworks hampers the synthesis of theoretical and empirical insights from this body of literature.

This paper aims to address these gaps by conducting a systematic review that examines trends in framing research within the context of climate change communication over the past 25 years. By adopting an interdisciplinary approach drawing from both quantitative content analysis methods as well as qualitative approaches such as thematic analysis, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview that can facilitate better understanding across different disciplinary perspectives.

The overarching goal of this study is to harness the bridging potential of framing as a concept in order to compare and contrast frames across different frame locations. By analyzing frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects within the wider cultural framing repository, we can gain insights into how different stakeholders engage with climate change communication and identify areas where further research is needed.

In doing so, this study seeks to contribute to the ongoing dialogue surrounding effective climate change communication by shedding light on the conceptual (mis)fit between different frame locations. By examining how these frames align or diverge from each other, we can identify potential gaps in understanding and explore avenues for future research that can enhance the effectiveness of climate change communication efforts.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides an overview of existing literature on framing within the context of climate change communication. Section 3 outlines our methodological approach for conducting a systematic review based on 25 years' worth of peer-reviewed literature. In Section 4, we present our findings regarding trends in framing research specific to climate change communication. Finally, Section 5 discusses the implications of these findings and offers directions for future research in order to bridge existing conceptual gaps.

In conclusion, effective climate change communication requires a
