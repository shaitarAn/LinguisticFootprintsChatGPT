1. Introduction

The urgent need to address the challenges posed by climate change has spurred a significant increase in research on various aspects of this multifaceted issue. One such area of study that has gained considerable attention is the concept of framing, which examines how climate change is portrayed and understood within different communication contexts. Framing research offers valuable insights into how individuals perceive and interpret information related to climate change, and its findings can inform effective communication strategies for raising awareness, changing attitudes, and promoting sustainable behaviors.

However, despite the growing body of literature on framing in the context of climate change communication, there remains a lack of consensus regarding its precise definition and understanding. This lack of clarity hampers efforts to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights from previous studies. To overcome this challenge, it is crucial to conduct a systematic review that not only identifies trends in framing research within the domain of climate change but also compares these trends with those observed in broader reviews encompassing various domains of communication research.

The aim of this paper is to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive systematic review based on 25 years (1995-2020) of peer-reviewed literature on framing in relation to climate change. By applying both quantitative content analysis techniques and qualitative approaches, we will analyze 275 articles published during this time period to gain a deeper understanding about how frames have been employed across different aspects (i.e., frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects) within the field.

This study aims not only to summarize existing knowledge but also shed light on potential avenues for future research within the realm of framing as applied specifically to climate change communication. As such, we will examine whether researchers have fully explored the bridging potential inherent in framing as a concept â€“ that is, whether they have effectively utilized frames as tools for reconciling divergent perspectives between various stakeholders involved in addressing climate change issues.

By critically evaluating existing literature on framing's bridging potential, we will highlight any conceptual (mis)fits between different frame locations and propose directions for future research that can help bridge these gaps. Ultimately, our findings will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of framing as a bridging concept in climate change communication and provide valuable insights for practitioners seeking to engage diverse audiences in meaningful conversations about this critical global challenge.
