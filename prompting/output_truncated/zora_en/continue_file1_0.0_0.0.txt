In communication, referring expressions play a crucial role in facilitating successful understanding between interlocutors. Noun phrases (NPs) are commonly used as the central component of referring expressions (REs), providing a way for language users to identify and refer to entities in their discourse. However, previous research has shown that the use of NP REs can undergo changes over the course of a communicative interaction.

One notable change observed in previous studies is the tendency for speakers to converge on linguistic forms, establishing routines in their communication. This convergence often leads to the shortening of NP REs, as speakers strive for efficiency and ease of understanding. The present chapter aims to investigate this shortening process and examine the structural changes that accompany it.

To explore this phenomenon, a corpus of spoken English data was collected through an experimental task. Conversational dyads were asked to repeatedly refer to visual stimuli in a referential communication task. The data from these dialogues were analyzed to observe any patterns of change in the NP REs used by the interlocutors.

The analysis revealed a clear trend of NP RE shortening over the course of the elicited dialogues. Specifically, there was a decrease in the presence of longer clausal post-head elements in the NP REs as the interaction progressed. This suggests that speakers tend to initially include more elaborate structural elements in their NP REs but gradually reduce them as the conversation unfolds.

In contrast, the use of only premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification showed a relative increase over time. This shift in structural modification indicates a move towards compression in the NP REs. Speakers seem to prioritize brevity and simplicity in their expressions as the interaction progresses, potentially to facilitate smoother and more efficient communication.

These findings contribute to our understanding of how referring expressions evolve in interactive communication. The observed structural changes in NP REs shed light on the dynamic nature of language use and the strategies employed by speakers to optimize their communication. By examining the process of post-head compression in NP REs, this chapter provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying referential communication.
