1. Introduction

In recent years, there has been significant interest in investigating the correlation between imitation skills and language development in infants and young children. Prior research has primarily focused on the relevance of infants' early imitation abilities, including object-based and language-based imitation, for the acquisition of language skills (Smith & Jones, 2010; Johnson & Williams, 2012). However, relatively few studies have systematically compared the joint relevance of these imitative behaviors later on in development.

The present study aims to expand upon this existing body of research by exploring the association between preschool children's multimodal imitation skills and their narrative performance and sociopragmatic abilities. Multimodal imitation refers to the ability to imitate gestures, prosody (intonation patterns), as well as lexical components such as words or phrases. By examining how preschoolers' capacity to mimic socially relevant multimodal cues relates to their linguistic and socio-communicative competencies, this study seeks to contribute a deeper understanding of the role that imitation plays in early language acquisition.

Narrative abilities are crucial for effective communication at any age; they allow individuals to construct coherent and meaningful stories that convey specific information or emotions (Peterson & McCabe, 1983). Previous research suggests a strong link between narrative proficiency and various cognitive processes such as theory-of-mind understanding (Liesbrock et al., 2016) and vocabulary development (Silva et al., 2018). Given this evidence, it is plausible that narrative performance may be influenced by one's ability to imitate socially-relevant multimodal cues during early childhood.

Sociopragmatic abilities refer specifically to an individual's capacity for using appropriate communication strategies within social contexts while taking into account cultural norms and expectations (Bateson et al., 2021). These skills encompass not only verbal behaviors but also non-verbal elements like gaze direction, facial expressions, vocal intonation patterns or body language. To date, limited research has focused on the relationship between sociopragmatic abilities and imitation skills in preschoolers. Therefore, exploring this association will provide valuable insights into the developmental trajectory of socio-communicative competencies and its connection to multimodal imitation.

To achieve our research objectives, a correlational study design was employed. A sample of typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children was recruited, totaling thirty-one participants. In order to assess their multimodal imitation skills, object-based imitation skills, narrative abilities, and sociopragmatic abilities, each child participated in four standardized tasks developed specifically for this study.

This study hypothesizes that preschool children who exhibit stronger abilities to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues will also demonstrate higher levels of narrative proficiency and sociopragmatic competence. Moreover, it is anticipated that narrative performance will be more strongly associated with multimodal imitation than with object-based imitation.

By investigating the associations between these domains – multimodal imitation, narrative performance, and sociopragmatic abilities – this research extends our understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in early language acquisition and its broader social implications. Furthermore, it contributes to a growing body of literature that suggests a comprehensive framework for understanding the role of imitation behaviors within the field of language development.

In conclusion: Insight gained from this investigation may have far-reaching implications for educational interventions designed to enhance communication skills in young children by incorporating tailored strategies addressing both linguistic elements as well as social aspects.
