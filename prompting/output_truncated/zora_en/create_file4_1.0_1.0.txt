Title: The Role of Parent-Child Interaction in Multimodal Imitation Skills and Language Development in Early Childhood

Abstract: The significance of imitation skills in infants and its impact on language development has been extensively studied. However, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the association between parent-child interaction, multimodal imitation skills, and language development during early childhood. This research aims to explore the relationship between parent-child interaction patterns, multimodal imitation abilities (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components), and language development in preschool-aged children.

1. Introduction

Language acquisition is a complex process that encompasses various aspects of communication skills such as comprehension, production, pragmatics, and narrative competence (Bavin et al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2020). Extensive research has focused on understanding how children acquire language during their early years of development. One particular area of interest is the role of imitation abilities as an influential factor within this developmental trajectory.

Imitation serves as a fundamental mechanism through which infants learn about their environment (Meltzoff & Moore 1977). Previous studies have highlighted the importance of object-based imitation skills as early markers for later language acquisition (Kaye & Bowerman, 1984; Woodward et al., 2000). However, growing evidence suggests that a broader conceptualization encompassing not only object-based but also multimodal imitation may provide deeper insights into children's linguistic competence during preschool years.

Multimodal imitation involves mimicking multiple dimensions simultaneously while perceiving or producing specific communicative behaviors such as gestures, prosody variations within speech patterns, and lexical choices (Dickerson et al., 2016; Özyürek et al., 2018). These cues are critical for successful sociocommunicative interactions where nonverbal elements play a significant role alongside verbal communication. Despite this relevance within naturalistic social contexts often experienced by young children, the joint influence of multimodal imitation and its association with language development in early childhood remains understudied.

Furthermore, it is imperative to recognize the role of parent-child interaction as a crucial context for language learning during this developmental stage (Rowe et al., 2018; van den Dries et al., 2020). Parental models and interactions provide scaffolding and linguistic input that shape a child's emerging communicative abilities (Baker et al., 2019; Hoff & Tian, 2005). Considering this interactive nature of early language learning, examining how parent-child interaction patterns relate to children's multimodal imitation skills and subsequent language development offers valuable insights into our understanding of these complex processes.

Thus, this study aims to investigate the association between parent-child interaction patterns observed during preschool years, children's multimodal imitation abilities (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components), narrative
