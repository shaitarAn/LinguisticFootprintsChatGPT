The introduction of this Zora article discusses the linguistic characteristics of the Insular Celtic languages, specifically their unique features related to sentence structure, phonological and morphological bound formatives, and the interaction between elements within a phrase. It highlights that while these languages have been described using various terms, such as "sentence word," "phonological autonomy," and "weakly polysynthetic," there is a lack of clear criteria for defining "wordhood" or "phonological autonomy" in these languages. The article also mentions that early Irish and Middle Welsh grammars did not have a concept of "word" as it is understood in modern linguistics. The introduction then states the objective of the study, which is to investigate the word-like properties of the verbal complex in Middle Welsh prose, focusing on manuscripts from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. The study will analyze the morphological and phonological boundaries, interdependencies, and processes within the verbal complex. The introduction concludes by outlining the organization of the study into three main sections: the approach taken, the morphological structuring of the verbal complex, and the phonological and prosodic processes within the verbal complex. The final section summarizes the findings and suggests further avenues of study.
