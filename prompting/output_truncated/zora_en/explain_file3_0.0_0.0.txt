The introduction of this Zora article discusses the unique characteristics of the Insular Celtic languages, specifically focusing on their linguistic structure and the concept of "wordhood." The author highlights that these languages have been described as having a "sentence word," a term used to describe their strong group accent and the loss of phonological autonomy for individual words. Additionally, the Insular Celtic languages are characterized as "weakly polysynthetic," meaning they have a large number of phonologically and morphologically bound formatives, including incorporated adjectives or adverbs.

However, the author notes that these broad descriptions lack a clear set of criteria for defining "wordhood" or "phonological autonomy." Native grammars of the Insular Celtic languages also do not provide a definition of wordhood, with early Irish grammars using the term "focal" to refer to any kind of syntactic group, and Middle Welsh grammars equating the concept of a word with syllables.

The introduction then mentions that recent typological research has shown that languages may lack a unified word domain, meaning there may not be a single phonological, morphological, and syntactic entity that can be unambiguously called a word. Based on this background, the study aims to investigate the potential word-like properties of the verbal complex in Middle Welsh prose, specifically focusing on manuscripts from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. The study will also explore the differences between prose and poetry in order to gain additional insights.

The restriction to finite verbal structures in Middle Welsh is based on the observation that wordhood patterns may vary between different parts of speech within the same language. The verbal complex, defined as the finite verb and its satellites, can contain various grammatical markers such as conjunctions, polarity markers, and P- and T-markers. The author provides an example of a verbal complex consisting of eight markers, illustrating the complexity of the structure.

The study is organized into three main parts: Section 2 explains the approach taken in the study, Section 3 discusses the morphological structuring of the verbal complex, and Section 4 explores the phonological and prosodic processes within the verbal complex and how they relate to the morphological structure. The final section, Section 5, summarizes and discusses the findings of the study and suggests potential future avenues of research.
