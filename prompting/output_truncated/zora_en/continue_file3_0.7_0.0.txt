The study of wordhood in languages has always been a complex task. Different languages have different ways of organizing their linguistic structures, and this is particularly evident in the case of older Insular Celtic languages like Middle Welsh. These languages have a large amount of bound elements and exhibit a wide array of phonological interactions within their morphological and phrasal structures.

The purpose of this article is to provide a philological study of the distribution of phonological and morphological domains in the Middle Welsh verb, with the aim of understanding the role of individual words in the grammar of this language. To achieve this, we will first discuss the current typological research on wordhood, as well as the problems and limitations of studying wordhood in corpus languages.

2. Typological Research on Wordhood

Typological research on wordhood has shown that the concept of a "word" can vary greatly across languages. Some languages have clear boundaries between words, while others have more fluid boundaries or even lack a clear concept of wordhood altogether. This has led to the realization that the term "word" is not universally applicable and may not be the most useful tool for describing the grammars of certain languages.

3. Problems and Limitations of Studying Wordhood in Corpus Languages

Studying wordhood in corpus languages presents several challenges. First, the nature of corpora means that they may not always capture all possible instances of a language's structures. This can make it difficult to determine the boundaries of words and identify word-like domains.

Second, the presence of bound elements in languages like Middle Welsh further complicates the study of wordhood. These bound elements can attach to other elements and form complex verbal complexes, making it difficult to determine where one word ends and another begins.

4. Morphological and Phonological Word-like Domains in Middle Welsh

Despite the challenges, a thorough investigation of the Middle Welsh verbal complex reveals several structures that could be considered "word-like" based on the distribution of phonological and morphological domains. These structures exhibit characteristics such as phonological unity and morphological coherence, suggesting that they function as cohesive units in the language.

However, it is important to note that the term "word" may not accurately capture the nature of these structures. The concept of wordhood, as traditionally understood in European languages, may not be applicable to the grammatical organization of Middle Welsh. Instead, it may be more useful to describe these structures as morphological and phonological domains that play specific roles within the language's grammar.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, the distribution of phonological and morphological domains in the Middle Welsh verb challenges the traditional understanding of wordhood. The structures identified in this study exhibit characteristics of cohesion and unity, but the term "word" may not accurately capture their nature.

This study highlights the importance of considering the specific linguistic features and structures of a language when studying wordhood. The concept of a "word" is not universally applicable and may not be the most useful tool for describing the grammars of all languages. Instead, a more nuanced approach that takes into account the unique characteristics of each language is necessary.
