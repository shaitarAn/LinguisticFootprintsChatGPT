The study of wordhood and its relevance in the grammatical structures of languages has been a topic of great interest for linguists. In particular, the Insular Celtic languages, including Middle Welsh, have posed unique challenges in understanding the distribution of phonological and morphological domains within their verbs.

The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive examination of the morphological and phonological word-like domains in the Middle Welsh verbal complex. By drawing on typological research on wordhood and addressing the methodological issues associated with studying wordhood in corpus languages, we hope to shed light on the nature of word structures in Middle Welsh.

2. Background

Middle Welsh, like other Insular Celtic languages, exhibits a significant number of bound elements within its verbal morphology. This phenomenon, coupled with the intricate phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures, has led some researchers to question the role of individual words in the grammars of these languages.

To address this issue, we will first provide an overview of current typological research on wordhood. This will allow us to establish a framework for analyzing the distribution of phonological and morphological domains in Middle Welsh verbs.

3. Methodology

Studying wordhood in corpus languages presents several challenges. The lack of standardized criteria for determining word boundaries, the potential for language change over time, and the limitations of available corpora all affect the accuracy and reliability of analyses.

In this study, we have adopted a multi-dimensional approach to overcome these challenges. We have carefully selected a diverse corpus of Middle Welsh texts, covering a range of genres and time periods. We have also applied various analytical techniques, including morphological segmentation, phonological analysis, and statistical modeling, to identify and analyze word-like structures within the verbal complex.

4. Findings

Our analysis of the Middle Welsh verbal complex reveals the presence of several structures that can be labeled as 'words' based on the established typological criteria. However, these structures do not encompass the entirety of the verbal complex, highlighting the limitations of the term 'word' in synchronic descriptions of Middle Welsh.

We have identified morphological and phonological domains within the verbal complex that exhibit characteristics of word-like units. These domains often involve bound elements and exhibit interactions that resemble those found in typical word structures. However, they do not align neatly with traditional notions of what constitutes a word.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, our study of the distribution of phonological and morphological domains within the Middle Welsh verbal complex suggests that the term 'word' is not particularly useful in
