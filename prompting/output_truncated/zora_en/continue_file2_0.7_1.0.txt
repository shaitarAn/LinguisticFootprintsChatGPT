Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, with far-reaching consequences for the planet and its inhabitants. As such, it has become a topic of extensive research and communication efforts aimed at raising awareness, promoting understanding, and driving action. One key aspect of effective communication on climate change is framing - the way in which information is presented and interpreted.

Framing refers to the process by which individuals or groups construct meaning through language and symbols. It involves selecting certain aspects of a complex issue and making them more salient while downplaying or ignoring others. In the context of climate change communication, framing can shape public perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors towards this issue.

The field of framing research has grown significantly over the past few decades, with numerous studies focusing specifically on climate change. However, despite this growth in literature, there remains a lack of consensus on what exactly constitutes framing and how it should be studied. This lack of definitional clarity makes it challenging to synthesize insights from different studies.

To address this challenge, this systematic review aims to provide an overview of trends in framing research on climate change over a 25-year period (1995-2020). Drawing on 275 peer-reviewed articles from various disciplines such as communication studies, psychology, sociology, and environmental science, we analyze how framing has been conceptualized and operationalized in these studies.

One unique contribution of this review is its focus on bridges between different frame locations - frame production (e.g., media organizations), frame content (e.g., messages), audience frames (e.g., interpretations), and framing effects (e.g., changes in attitudes or behaviors). By comparing frames across these different locations within the wider cultural framing repository framework proposed by Entman (1993), we aim to uncover potential gaps or inconsistencies that may hinder effective climate change communication.

Our analysis reveals that while there has been considerable attention given to frame production (i.e., who frames climate change and how), there is limited research on audience frames and framing effects. This suggests a missed opportunity to fully understand the complex process of framing and its impact on individuals' perceptions and actions.

Furthermore, we find that different frame locations often employ different theoretical frameworks, concepts, and methods. This lack of integration across frame locations hinders our ability to build a comprehensive understanding of framing in climate change communication.

To address these issues, we propose several directions for future research. First, there is a need for more studies that examine audience frames and framing effects to better understand how different frames are interpreted by various segments of the population and their influence on attitudes and behaviors.

Second, efforts should be made to bridge the conceptual gap between different frame locations by adopting a more integrated approach. This could involve developing common theoretical frameworks or concepts that can be applied across frame locations or exploring new methodologies that allow for more holistic analyses.

Finally, interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial in advancing framing research in climate change communication. By bringing together scholars from diverse disciplines such as communication studies, psychology, sociology, environmental science, and others, we can leverage their respective expertise to develop innovative approaches to studying framing.

In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the importance
