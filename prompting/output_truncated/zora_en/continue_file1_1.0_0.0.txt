In interactive communication, it is common for language users to employ noun phrases as referring expressions (NP REs). These allow individuals to refer to specific entities or concepts in the ongoing conversation. However, previous research has illustrated that the use of NP REs undergoes changes during the course of a communicative interaction. Speakers often converge on linguistic forms, establishing routines, and consequently, abbreviate their NP REs in the process.

This chapter aims to explore the process of shortening NP REs and investigate the structural modifications that occur alongside this phenomenon. The study utilizes data from a corpus of spoken English that was experimentally elicited. Conversational dyads engaged in a referential communication task where they repeatedly made references to visual stimuli. By analyzing these dialogues, we can observe how interlocutors progressively reduce the length of their NP REs.

The analysis reveals that interlocutors indeed exhibit a tendency to shorten their NP REs over the course of the elicited dialogues. Specifically, there is a noticeable decline in the inclusion of longer clausal post-head elements. These elements are typically associated with structural elaboration and contribute to a more detailed and comprehensive description. However, as the interaction continues, speakers increasingly omit such clausal elements, indicating a shift towards structural compression.

Furthermore, the study also highlights an increase in the use of exclusively premodified NP REs and shorter phrasal postmodification. Initially, speakers may include more pre- and postmodifiers within their NP REs. However, as the conversation unfolds, there is a relative rise in the use of premodification only, along with a reduction in the length and complexity of phrasal postmodification. This shift in structural modification reinforces the notion of compression, as it suggests a more concise and streamlined form of expression.

The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of how NP REs evolve within interactive communication. The observed changes indicate that speakers tend to move towards more efficient and concise forms of reference. As the conversation progresses, interlocutors converge on common linguistic patterns and streamline their expressions. This process of compression serves to facilitate smooth and efficient communication, enabling participants to convey information effectively while minimizing cognitive load.

The implications of this research extend beyond theoretical linguistics. Understanding the structural changes in NP REs can have practical applications in various domains, such as natural language processing and human-computer interaction. By recognizing the patterns of compression in referring expressions, software and systems can be designed to better interpret and generate effective communication. Additionally, this research sheds light on the dynamics of interactive communication, providing insights into how individuals adapt and adjust their linguistic behaviors during the course of a conversation.

In conclusion, this chapter investigates the structural changes that occur in NP REs during interactive communication. The analysis of a corpus of spoken English reveals a tendency towards shortening and compression of NP REs over the course of a conversation. This shortening process involves a decrease in clausal post-head elements and an increase in premodification and shorter phrasal postmodification. These findings contribute to our understanding of how referring expressions evolve in interactive communication and have practical implications for various fields.
