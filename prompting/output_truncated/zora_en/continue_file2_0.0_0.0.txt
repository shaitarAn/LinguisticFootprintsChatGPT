Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and effective communication about this issue is crucial for generating awareness and inspiring action. Framing, as a concept in communication research, has gained significant attention in recent years as a tool for understanding how messages about climate change are constructed and interpreted. However, despite the growing body of literature on framing in climate change communication, there is a lack of consensus on its definition and application.

This systematic review aims to address this gap by examining the trends and patterns in framing research on climate change over the past 25 years. By comparing the findings from this review to those of broader communication research, we can identify the unique characteristics and challenges of framing in the context of climate change.

To conduct this review, a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches, such as content analysis, will be employed. The review will draw on a comprehensive selection of peer-reviewed literature on the framing of climate change, totaling 275 studies. By analyzing the frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of how framing is used in climate change communication.

One of the key findings of this review is the underutilization of framing's bridging potential in climate change communication research. Framing has the power to bridge different perspectives and facilitate dialogue between stakeholders with diverse viewpoints. However, the existing literature has not fully explored this potential, and there is a conceptual mismatch between the different frame locations.

The review will delve into this conceptual (mis)fit and discuss the implications for future research. By identifying the gaps and limitations in current framing research on climate change, this review will provide directions for future studies. It is essential to harness framing's bridging potential to foster effective communication and collaboration in addressing the challenges of climate change.

In conclusion, this systematic review aims to contribute to the understanding of framing as a bridging concept for climate change communication. By synthesizing the existing literature and highlighting the gaps and opportunities, this review will provide valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers working in the field of climate change communication.
