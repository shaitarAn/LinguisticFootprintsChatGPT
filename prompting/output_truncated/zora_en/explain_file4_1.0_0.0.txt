This introduction sets the stage for a study on imitation abilities in young preschool children and their relationship to language and sociopragmatic skills. It begins by highlighting the importance of imitation in human culture and development, emphasizing its role as a learning mechanism for infants and adults. The study aims to expand on previous research by examining different types of imitation skills (language-based multimodal imitation and object-based imitation) that have not been extensively studied together. Additionally, the study focuses on young preschoolers, a crucial age group for linguistic and social development that has not been actively studied in terms of imitation abilities.

The introduction reviews previous literature that demonstrates the link between imitation behaviors and language and sociopragmatic abilities. It highlights studies that show the connection between vocal imitation and language production and comprehension, motor imitation behaviors and language comprehension, and imitation of actions involving physical objects and the acquisition of vocabulary. The introduction also mentions studies related to sociopragmatic skills, showing that imitative behaviors contribute to the prediction of later social communication outcomes.

Furthermore, the introduction discusses previous studies that compare the relevance of language-based and object-based imitation skills, suggesting that language-based imitation has stronger links to language abilities. It emphasizes the social function of imitation and how gestures with communicative significance are more accurately imitated than non-communicative movements.

The introduction concludes by stating the need for an integrative multimodal view of language-based imitation, which includes gestural, prosodic, and verbal/lexical components. It emphasizes the importance of studying imitation behaviors in the early preschool years, as these abilities continue to play a key role in social communication. The researchers propose that preschoolers' ability to perform the multimodal imitation of socially relevant events is positively correlated with language and sociopragmatic skills.

Overall, the introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the existing research on imitation abilities and highlights the gaps in knowledge that the present study aims to fill. It establishes the importance of investigating imitation from an integrated multimodal perspective and sets the main hypothesis that language-based imitation abilities will be related to complex language and sociopragmatic measures in preschoolers.
