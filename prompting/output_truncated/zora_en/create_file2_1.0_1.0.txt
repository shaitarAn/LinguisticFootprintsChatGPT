Title: Exploring the Role of Framing in Climate Change Debates: A Fresh Approach

Abstract:
In recent years, the field of climate change communication has witnesseda surge of studies focusing on how this pressing global issue is framed. However, the lack of clear definitions and a coherent framework for analyzing framing strategies presents a challenge to understanding and synthesizing theoretical and empirical findings. This systematic review aims to address this critical gap by examining trends in framing within climate change communication research and comparing it with broader reviews on communication research as a whole. By leveraging framing's potential as a bridging concept, we analyze frames across various frame locations including frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects within the larger cultural framing repository.

Drawing upon an extensive body of peer-reviewed literature spanning 25 years (n = 275), we utilize both quantitative and qualitative methods to conduct a comprehensive content analysis. Our findings reveal that despite widespread engagement with the subject matter, existing research has failed to fully harness framing's potential as an effective tool for perspective integration. Consequently, we explore the underlying conceptual mismatches across different frame locations in order to shed light on this missed opportunity for cross-disciplinary synthesis.

Building upon the insights gained from our analysis, we highlight significant avenues for future research exploration within this unexplored terrain. In particular, our study underscores the need for greater emphasis on utilizing framing techniques that encourage dialogue between divergent perspectives on climate change. By doing so, researchers can foster a more nuanced understanding that transcends disciplinary boundaries while facilitating constructive conversations about potential solutions.

1. Introduction:

Climate change continues to dominate political agendas worldwide due to its far-reaching implications for societies and ecosystems alike (IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report). As scientific consensus solidifies around anthropogenic causes underlying changing climatic patterns (Stocker et al., 2014), effective communication becomes paramount in mobilizing collective action towards sustainable development (Hulme & Mahony, 2010). However, the complex nature of this issue presents significant challenges for effective communication and engagement at both individual and societal levels (Leiserowitz et al., 2010).

Effective climate change communication requires careful selection and framing of messages to shape public perceptions, beliefs, and subsequent behavioral responses (Nisbet & Myers, 2007). Framing theory has emerged as a powerful tool in understanding how different aspects of an issue are emphasized or downplayed to influence public opinion. By analyzing the construction of communication messages within differing social contexts, framing research offers insights into the mechanisms that shape public attitudes
