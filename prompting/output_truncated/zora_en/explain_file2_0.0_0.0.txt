This introduction is discussing the concept of framing in communication research and the need for a systematic review on the framing of climate change. 

The first paragraph highlights that framing is a popular theoretical approach in communication research, but there is a lack of consensus on its definition and scope. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights in the field. The paragraph also mentions that previous reviews on framing have not fully utilized its bridging potential, which allows for a comprehensive understanding of the communication process.

The second paragraph explains that the study will focus on the framing of climate change for several reasons. Firstly, climate change is a significant global problem, and understanding its communication is crucial. Secondly, climate change communication is challenging due to its complexity and scientific uncertainty, and framing can help overcome these communication barriers. Additionally, studying framing in climate change communication can contribute to developing effective communication strategies and supporting actions to combat climate change.

The third paragraph justifies the need for a systematic review in the field of framing in climate change communication. It mentions that research on framing in this area is growing, and a systematic review can provide a comprehensive overview and guide future research. It also notes that there are limited systematic reviews available for framing in communication research overall, and it is important to assess if field-specific applications exist.

The final paragraph outlines the objectives of the present study. It aims to conduct a systematic review on the framing of climate change, comparing the findings to reviews in communication research overall. The study will focus on the most salient frames across different aspects of communication (frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects) to understand the cultural framing repository and identify any conceptual misfit. The study will use a combination of quantitative and qualitative content analysis, drawing on 25 years of published literature on climate change framing.
