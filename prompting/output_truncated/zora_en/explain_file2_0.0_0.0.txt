The introduction of this Zora article begins by highlighting the significance of framing as a theoretical approach in communication research. It mentions that while many studies refer to framing, there is a lack of consistent definitions, leading to a variety of phenomena being categorized under this concept. This lack of clarity poses challenges for synthesizing theoretical and empirical insights in communication research.

To address these challenges, systematic reviews are conducted to identify common trends, research gaps, and guide future research. However, the available reviews have not fully utilized one of the unique characteristics of framing: its bridging potential. Framing has the ability to consider the entire communication process, including strategic communication by different actors, journalistic cognitions and reporting, audience frames, framing effects, and the broader cultural contexts in which frames emerge.

The article argues that by systematically reviewing how framing has been applied across different locations in the communication process, insights can be gained about the cultural framing repository. This refers to the competitive environment of salient and culturally/cognitively available frames. The locations in the communication process where frames can be identified include the communicator, the text/message, the receiver, and the culture.

The authors then explain that they will focus their systematic review on the framing of climate change. They justify this choice by stating that climate change is one of the most important global problems, and understanding its communication is highly relevant. They mention that audiences rely on various sources for information about climate change but find it difficult to engage with and understand. Frames play a role in shaping audience perceptions and actions related to climate change.

Climate change is also described as a special topic due to its complexity, scientific uncertainty, and the need for connections between experts, policy, sources of information, and audiences. Framing is seen as a tool to break through communication barriers in this context. Additionally, studying framing in climate change communication is expected to help develop communication strategies, build consensus, and support actions to combat climate change.

The authors note that research on framing in climate change communication is growing steadily, and a systematic review will help take stock of existing studies and guide future research. They mention that previous research has explored frames of communicators, journalists, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, allowing for an assessment across different locations in the communication process.

The introduction also highlights the limited number of systematic reviews available for framing in communication research overall. The authors argue that attention should be given to whether common trends observed in other fields of communication research are also evident in framing research on climate change communication. They suggest that field-specific insights can contribute to the understanding of framing in communication research as a whole.

The article concludes by stating that the present study will conduct a systematic review on the framing of climate change and compare its findings to reviews covering framing in communication research overall. The focus will be on identifying the most salient frames across different locations in the communication process to harness framing's potential as an integrative bridging concept. The aim is to connect research on frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing
