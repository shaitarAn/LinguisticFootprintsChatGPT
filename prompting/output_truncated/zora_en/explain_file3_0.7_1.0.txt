This introduction provides an overview of the topic and aims of the study, which is focused on investigating the properties of the verbal complex in Middle Welsh prose. The author begins by highlighting various characterizations that have been used to describe Insular Celtic languages, such as having a 'sentence word' or being 'weakly polysynthetic'. These descriptions emphasize that compared to other European languages, Insular Celtic languages have a larger number of phonologically and morphologically bound formatives.

However, the author points out that these broad descriptions lack specific criteria for defining 'wordhood' or 'phonological autonomy', which are important concepts in understanding language structure. Native grammars of Insular Celtic languages also do not provide clear definitions of wordhood. For example, early Irish grammars did not have a concept corresponding to the modern notion of a word; instead, they used "focal" to refer to any kind of syntactic group. Similarly, Middle Welsh grammars equated words with syllables and described them as parts of correct utterances.

The introduction then highlights recent typological research on wordhood that shows how some languages may lack a unified word domain and can have multiple conflicting domains. Based on this research and previous work in the field, this study focuses on investigating potential word-like properties within the verbal complex of Middle Welsh prose manuscripts from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.

The study specifically focuses on finite verbal structures because different parts of speech within a language can exhibit varying patterns related to wordhood. The verbal complex in Middle Welsh is defined as consisting of the finite verb along with its satellites (associated markers). An example sentence illustrating this complex structure is provided.

The introduction outlines how the study is organized into three main sections: Section 2 explains the approach taken in conducting this investigation; Section 3 discusses morphological structuring within the verbal complex; and Section 4 explores phonological and prosodic processes operating within this complex and how they relate to the morphological structure. The final section, Section 5, will summarize and discuss the findings of the study and propose potential future research directions.

Overall, this introduction sets the stage for a detailed investigation into word-like properties within the verbal complex of Middle Welsh prose manuscripts, providing background information on previous characterizations of Insular Celtic languages and highlighting the need for clearer criteria in defining wordhood.
