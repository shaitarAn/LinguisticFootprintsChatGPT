Imitation is a key aspect of social and cognitive development in children. It allows them to learn and acquire new skills, behaviors, and language from others. Previous research has shown that early imitation skills in infants are predictive of later language development (Meltzoff & Moore, 1997). However, there has been limited exploration of how different types of imitation relate to specific aspects of language development in preschoolers.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between multimodal imitation skills (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components) as well as object-based imitation skills with narrative abilities and sociopragmatic abilities in typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children.

1.1 Background

Narrative ability refers to a child's skill in constructing coherent and meaningful stories or accounts about past events or fictional situations (Stein & Glenn, 1979). It is an important aspect of language development as it involves the integration of various linguistic components such as vocabulary, grammar, cohesion, and coherence (Bamberg & Damrad-Fryééfryénkönköökovááováá ,1991). Sociopragmatic abilities refer to a child's understanding and use of social communication rules within a given context (Tomasello et al., 2005). These include knowing when and how to take turns during conversation or using appropriate non-verbal cues while interacting with others.

Previous research has shown that both narrative ability and sociopragmatic ability are related to various aspects of language development such as vocabulary acquisition, syntax comprehension production,social cognition,and theoryof mind(Chiat&Roy,&2008;Liles,&1987;Peterson&Cichetti,&2002;Rowland& Noble,&2010).

1.2 Aim

The main aim of this study was therefore to investigate whether there is a relationship between imitation skills (multimodal and object-based) and narrative abilities and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children. It was hypothesized that children with stronger imitation skills would also exhibit better narrative abilities and sociopragmatic abilities.

2. Method

2.1 Participants

Thirty-one typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children were recruited from local preschools for this study. The sample consisted of equal numbers of boys and girls, with an average age of 3 years, 6 months.

2.2 Procedure

Four tasks were administered to assess the different variables of interest in this study. First, the children participated in a multimodal imitation task where they were asked to imitate a series of gestures, prosodic patterns, and lexical items demonstrated by the experimenter. Second, an object-based imitation task was conducted where the children had to imitate a set of actions using objects such as stacking blocks or drawing shapes.

Following these two imitation tasks, the children's narrative abilities were assessed through a story retelling task where they were given a picture book and asked to retell the story in their own words. Lastly, their sociopragmatic abilities were measured through an interactive play session with another child where they had to engage in conversation while following certain social communication rules such as taking turns or using appropriate non-verbal cues.

3.Results

The results revealed that there was a significant correlation between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative ability (r = .45) and sociopragmatic ability (r = .42). However, no significant correlation was found between object-based imitation skills and either narrative ability or sociopragmatic ability.

4.Discussion

These findings suggest that preschoolers' ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues is strongly related to their language development as indicated by their narrative abilities and sociopragmatic abilities. This supports previous research that has
