This introduction is discussing the phenomenon of reference in conversation, specifically focusing on referring expressions with noun phrases (NP REs). The author notes that as interlocutors engage in interactive communication, they observe two main changes in the NP REs produced: lexical convergence and referential contraction. Lexical convergence refers to speakers aligning on their linguistic representations, while referential contraction refers to interlocutors shortening their contributions. The chapter will primarily focus on the process of referential contraction and aims to describe the structural changes in the NP REs produced over multiple rounds of interactive dialogue. The research questions addressed are: 1) To what extent do speakers' NP REs get shortened over the course of a dialogic interaction? and 2) What structural changes can be observed in the production of NP REs across four rounds of an interactive referential communication task? To investigate these changes, a referential communication task was devised, which involved repeated references to the same sets of visual stimuli. The author illustrates a typical shortening process in the resulting corpus of spoken interactive dialogue, showing how the structure of the NP RE changes over time. The study aims to describe general tendencies regarding the types and forms of modifying and descriptive elements in the NP RE construction throughout the interaction. The term "compression" is used to describe the shortening process and changes in structural preferences from clausal to phrasal elements. The introduction also discusses previous research on change-in-interaction, the theoretical approaches related to the production of NP REs, and introduces the experimental set-up and analysis of the structural changes in NP REs. The findings suggest that as NP REs get shortened, their structure changes from more elaborated, clausal forms to more compressed, phrasal forms in later rounds of interaction. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the notion of compression as a response to conveying a large amount of information efficiently.
