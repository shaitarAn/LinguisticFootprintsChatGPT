The introduction of this Zora article provides background information on the linguistic characteristics of Insular Celtic languages, specifically in terms of their sentence structure and the large number of phonologically and morphologically bound formatives. It notes that there is a lack of consensus on what constitutes a "word" in these languages and that early Irish and Middle Welsh grammars do not provide a clear definition of wordhood. The introduction mentions that recent typological research has shown that languages may lack a unified word domain.

The study described in the article aims to investigate the word-like properties of the verbal complex in Middle Welsh prose, focusing on manuscripts from the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. Poetry will also be used for comparison and additional insights. The restriction to finite verbal structures is based on the observation that wordhood patterns may vary between different parts of speech in the same language.

The introduction provides an example of a complex verbal structure in Middle Welsh and mentions the various markers and elements that make up the verbal complex. It states that the study is organized into three main parts: explaining the approach, discussing the morphological structuring of the verbal complex, and discussing the phonological and prosodic processes within the verbal complex. The final section summarizes the findings and suggests further avenues of study.
