1. Introduction

The phenomenon of post-head compression in noun phrase referring expressions (NP REs) has been a topic of interest in the field of linguistics and communication studies. Previous research has shown that during interactive communication, language users tend to converge on linguistic forms and shorten their NP REs over the course of a conversation (REF). This process of shortening has been observed to involve structural changes in the NP REs, indicating a shift in the type of structural modification they contain (REF).

While previous studies have focused on the general patterns of shortening and structural changes in NP REs, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the specific factors that influence this process. This paper aims to address this gap by investigating the role of contextual factors in post-head compression of NP REs in interactive communication.

The present study builds upon previous research by examining data from an experimentally elicited corpus of spoken English. The corpus consists of conversational dyads engaged in a referential communication task, where they produce repeated references to visual stimuli. By analyzing the dialogues in this controlled experimental setting, we can gain insights into the specific contextual factors that contribute to the shortening and structural changes in NP REs.

The research question guiding this study is: How do contextual factors influence the process of post-head compression in NP REs during interactive communication?

To address this research question, we will investigate the following sub-questions:

1.1 What are the specific contextual factors that influence the shortening of NP REs?
1.2 How do these contextual factors relate to the structural changes observed in NP REs?
1.3 Are there any patterns or regularities in the use of NP REs across different contextual conditions?

To answer these questions, we will conduct a quantitative analysis of the corpus data, focusing on the length and structure of NP REs in relation to the contextual factors. We will also consider the role of interlocutor dynamics and the influence of the referential communication task on the shortening process.

The findings of this study will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the process of post-head compression in NP REs. By identifying the specific contextual factors that influence this process, we can shed light on the cognitive and communicative processes involved in interactive communication. Furthermore, this research has implications for the development of computational models of language production and understanding, as well as for the design of effective communication strategies in various domains, such as human-computer interaction and second language acquisition.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of the relevant literature on post-head compression in NP REs and the role of contextual factors. Section 3 describes the methodology employed in this study, including the data collection procedure and the coding scheme. Section 4 presents the results of the quantitative analysis, followed by a discussion of the findings in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper by summarizing the main findings, discussing their implications, and suggesting directions for future research.
