1. Introduction

Vowel quality is a crucial aspect of language variation and change. Understanding the phonetic properties of regional dialects and their influence on standard varieties is essential for comprehending the dynamics of language variation within a speech community. While considerable research has been conducted on the phonetic properties of Swiss Standard German (SSG), there remains a paucity of studies investigating the impact of regional Alemannic (ALM) dialects on the vowel qualities of SSG.

Previous phonetic studies on ALM dialects have predominantly focused on consonantal features, leaving a significant gap in knowledge concerning vowel qualities. Addressing this research gap, the present study aims to examine the long-vowel inventories of four ALM dialects and their respective SSG varieties with a particular focus on vowel quality. By conducting a comparative acoustic analysis, this research not only contributes to our understanding of the phonetic characteristics of ALM and SSG vowels but also explores the extent to which ALM dialects influence the vowel qualities of SSG varieties.

To achieve these goals, data were collected from a total of eight speakers (four male and four female) representing the dialect regions of Bern, Chur, Brig, and Zurich. Each participant was recorded producing each vowel three times, resulting in a comprehensive corpus comprising 1,632 tokens.

The findings of this study reveal that vowel quality in SSG varieties is influenced by ALM dialects to varying degrees across the different regions. Notably, in the dialect regions of Chur and Brig, the vowel qualities of ALM are largely transferred to their respective SSG varieties. However, in the SSG varieties spoken in Bern and Zurich, certain vowel qualities do not align with the corresponding ALM ones, particularly with regards to the fronting of <a> in the SSG variety of either dialect. Moreover, the SSG <ä> in Bern displays variations between [ɛː] and [æː], while <o> tends to be realized more posteriorly.

This research contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between regional dialects and standard varieties. By shedding light on the phonetic properties of vowel qualities in ALM dialects and their impact on SSG varieties, this study provides new insights into language variation and change within the Swiss linguistic context. The findings have implications for sociolinguistic and phonetic research, as well as for language documentation and preservation efforts.
