Title: Framing the Impact of Climate Change on Biodiversity: A Comprehensive Review of Literature

Abstract: The urgency of addressing climate change has led to a proliferation of studies examining the framing of this complex issue. However, the lack of clear definitions and conceptual frameworks in framing research has hindered the synthesis of theoretical and empirical insights. This systematic review aims to bridge this gap by exploring the framing of climate change communication specifically in relation to its impact on biodiversity. By comparing frames across different frame locations, including frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, this review draws on 25 years of peer-reviewed literature (n = 275) to provide a comprehensive analysis of the framing of climate change and its implications for biodiversity. The findings reveal a significant gap in utilizing framing's potential to bridge perspectives in this context. Therefore, this review not only examines the conceptual (mis)fit between frame locations but also offers directions for future research in order to enhance our understanding of the framing of climate change and its impact on biodiversity.

1. Introduction

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems and human societies. The scientific consensus on the reality and severity of climate change has prompted a surge in research aimed at understanding its causes, impacts, and potential solutions. Within this vast body of literature, the concept of framing has emerged as a valuable tool for analyzing how climate change is communicated and understood by different stakeholders.

Framing refers to the process by which individuals, organizations, and media outlets select and emphasize certain aspects of an issue while downplaying or omitting others, thereby shaping how the issue is perceived and understood by audiences (Entman, 1993). By examining the frames employed in climate change communication, researchers have sought to uncover the underlying assumptions, values, and narratives that influence public opinion, policy decisions, and collective action.

While numerous studies have explored the framing of climate change, there remains a lack of consensus on how to define and operationalize framing in this context. This conceptual ambiguity has hindered the synthesis of findings and limited our understanding of the broader implications of framing for climate change communication. Moreover, existing reviews of framing research in climate change have primarily focused on general trends and have not fully explored the potential of framing as a bridging concept.

This paper aims to address these gaps by conducting a comprehensive review of the literature on
