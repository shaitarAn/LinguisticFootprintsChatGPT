The introduction of this Zora article begins by highlighting the significance of framing as a theoretical approach in communication research. It mentions that while many studies refer to framing, there is often a lack of clear definitions, leading to a diversity of phenomena being included under this concept. This poses challenges for synthesizing theoretical and empirical insights in communication research.

To address these challenges, systematic reviews are conducted to identify common trends, research gaps, and guide future research. However, previous reviews on framing have not fully utilized one unique characteristic of the framing approach: its bridging potential. Framing can consider the entire communication process and bridge different interdisciplinary perspectives such as strategic communication by various actors, journalistic cognitions and reporting, audience frames, framing effects, and broader cultural contexts.

The article argues that by systematically reviewing how framing has been applied across different frame locations (communicator, text/message, receiver/audience), we can gain insights into the cultural framing repository - the competitive environment where salient frames emerge. The author refers to Entman's framework which identifies frame locations in the communication process.

The choice to focus on climate change as a specific topic for this review is justified based on several reasons. Firstly, climate change is considered one of the most important global problems today. Audiences rely on various sources for information about climate change but find it difficult to engage with and understand due to its complexity and scientific uncertainty. Frames play a role in shaping audience support for actions related to climate change.

Secondly, research on framing in climate change communication is growing steadily; therefore conducting a systematic review will benefit future research in this field. Previous studies have explored communicator's frames, journalist's frames, frame content analysis as well as audience frames and framing effects - allowing for an assessment across different frame locations.

Thirdly,the availability of limited systematic reviews on framing in overall communication research suggests that attention should be given to whether common trends observed elsewhere are also evident in studies on framing in climate change communication. Field-specific insights can contribute to the understanding of framing in communication research as a whole.

The present study aims to conduct a systematic review on the framing of climate change and compare its findings with reviews covering framing in communication research overall. It also focuses on identifying the most salient frames across different frame locations to harness framing's potential as an integrative bridging concept. By examining frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, the study aims to provide indications of the cultural framing repository and identify any conceptual misfit across frame locations.

To achieve these goals, the study will utilize both quantitative and qualitative approaches of content analysis drawing from 25 years of published literature on climate change framing.
