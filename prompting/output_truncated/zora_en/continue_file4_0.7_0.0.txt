The ability to imitate is considered an essential aspect of early language development. Previous research has focused on the imitation skills of infants, particularly between 9 to 20 months old, and their relationship to language development. However, there is a lack of studies that examine the long-term effects of imitation skills on language development in preschool-aged children.

This correlational study aims to investigate whether preschool children's imitation skills, specifically multimodal imitation (including gestural, prosodic, and lexical components) and object-based imitation, are related to their narrative and sociopragmatic abilities. Narrative abilities refer to a child's ability to tell coherent and structured stories, while sociopragmatic abilities encompass the understanding and use of social and pragmatic aspects of language.

Thirty-one typically developing 3- to 4-year-old children participated in this study. They were assessed using four tasks: a multimodal imitation task, an object-based imitation task, a narrative task, and a sociopragmatic task. The multimodal imitation task assessed the children's ability to imitate gestures, prosody (intonation, stress, and rhythm), and lexical items. The object-based imitation task focused on the children's ability to imitate actions involving objects. The narrative task assessed the children's ability to construct and tell a coherent story. The sociopragmatic task examined the children's understanding and use of social and pragmatic aspects of language, such as turn-taking, politeness, and appropriate use of language in different contexts.

The results of this study revealed a significant relationship between multimodal imitation skills and both narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool-aged children. However, there was no significant relationship found between object-based imitation skills and these language and sociocommunicative skills. This suggests that the ability to imitate socially relevant multimodal cues, including gestures, prosody, and lexical items, is strongly related to language and sociocommunicative development in preschoolers.

These findings support the notion that imitation behaviors should be conceptualized more broadly in the field of language development. It highlights the importance of considering not only verbal linguistic patterns but also prosodic and gestural cues in understanding how children acquire language and develop sociocommunicative skills. By integrating these different aspects of imitation, researchers and practitioners can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the role of imitation in language development and tailor interventions accordingly.

In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the link between multimodal imitation skills and narrative and sociopragmatic abilities in preschool children. It emphasizes the importance of considering a broader range of imitation behaviors in the study of language development and suggests that interventions targeting imitation skills may have positive
