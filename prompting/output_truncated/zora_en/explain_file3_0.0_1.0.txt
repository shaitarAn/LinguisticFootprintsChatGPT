The introduction of this Zora article discusses the linguistic characteristics of the Insular Celtic languages, specifically their unique features related to sentence structure and word formation. It mentions that these languages have been described as having a "sentence word" or a strong group accent, which affects the individual words' phonological autonomy. The article also notes that compared to other European languages, Insular Celtic languages have a larger number of phonologically and morphologically bound formatives, including incorporated adjectives or adverbs.

However, the broad descriptions of these language characteristics lack specific criteria for defining "wordhood" or "phonological autonomy." Native grammars of early Irish and Middle Welsh also do not provide clear definitions for these concepts. The article highlights that recent typological research has shown that some languages may lack a unified word domain and can have multiple conflicting domains.

Based on current work in this field, the study aims to investigate the potential word-like properties of the verbal complex in Middle Welsh prose during the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. Poetry will be used as well to compare differences between genres or gain additional insights not found in prose. The focus is on finite verbal structures because different parts of speech within a language can exhibit varying patterns of wordhood.

The Middle Welsh verbal complex is defined as consisting of the finite verb and its satellites (associated markers). The example provided illustrates eight markers within this complex, including subordinating conjunctions, negative markers, object markers, resultative markers, TAM (tense-aspect-mood) markers, agreement markers, and bound pronouns. These markers will be discussed further in Section 3.

The study is organized into three main parts: Section 2 explains the approach taken in this study; Section 3 discusses the morphological structuring of the verbal complex; and Section 4 explores phonological and prosodic processes within this complex while mapping onto its morphological structure outlined in Section 3. The final section, Section 5, summarizes and discusses the findings of the study and suggests potential future research directions.
