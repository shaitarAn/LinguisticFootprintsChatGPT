Title: Assessing the Efficacy of Climate Change Communication Strategies: A Call for Systematic Review

Abstract: Climate change is an urgent global issue that necessitates effective communication strategies to engage diverse audiences and foster collective action. The concept of framing has gained significant attention in climate change communication research, enabling scholars to analyze and understand the different perspectives and narratives that surround this complex problem. However, despite the growing body of literature on framing and climate change, there remains a lack of clarity and consensus on key definitions within the field. This systematic review aims to address this gap by examining the efficacy of various communication strategies employed in the context of climate change, using framing as a conceptual lens.

1. Introduction

Effective communication is crucial in addressing the challenges posed by climate change. As public awareness and understanding of the issue continue to grow, it becomes imperative to ascertain which communication strategies are most effective in engaging and mobilizing individuals and communities towards meaningful action. While previous research has explored the role of information provision, risk communication, and narratives in climate change communication, this study seeks to examine the efficacy of various communication strategies through the lens of framing.

Framing, as a theoretical concept, offers a promising approach to understanding how individuals interpret and make sense of climate change information. The way in which an issue is framed can influence how it is perceived, understood, and acted upon by different audiences. By systematically reviewing the literature on framing and climate change communication, this study aims to identify the key framing strategies employed, assess their effectiveness, and shed light on potential gaps and opportunities for future research.

The systematic review will draw upon a comprehensive range of peer-reviewed literature spanning the past two decades, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of the evolving discourse on framing in climate change communication. By combining quantitative and qualitative content analysis methodologies, the review will provide a robust synthesis of existing research, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape and identifying areas requiring further investigation.

In this paper, we argue that assessing the efficacy of climate change communication strategies is essential for informing policy, practice, and future research in this domain. By examining the existing literature on framing and climate change communication, we aim to advance understanding of effective strategies for engaging diverse audiences, fostering collective action, and ultimately facilitating the sustainable transformation required to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
