1. Introduction

The impacts of climate change have become increasingly evident, rendering it one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Addressing this complex issue requires effective communication strategies that can engage diverse stakeholders and prompt collective action. Over the past few decades, researchers have turned their attention to understanding the role of framing in climate change communication. Framing, as a theoretical and analytical concept, offers a promising avenue to bridge divergent perspectives on climate change and enhance communication effectiveness.

However, despite the burgeoning research on framing in climate change communication, a lack of consensus and clarity surrounding definitions and frameworks has hindered the synthesis of theoretical and empirical insights. This poses a significant challenge for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage framing strategies to address climate change.

This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by conducting a systematic review of the framing literature in the context of climate change communication. By drawing on 25 years of peer-reviewed literature, encompassing a comprehensive analysis of 275 studies, this review offers a comprehensive assessment of the current state of knowledge on framing in climate change communication. Moreover, it seeks to identify key areas of convergence and divergence and provide a roadmap for future research and practice.

2. Research Question

In light of the existing research highlighting the importance of framing in climate change communication, our study poses the following research question: How can framing be effectively utilized as a bridging concept to enhance climate change communication strategies across diverse stakeholders?

3. Significance of the Research Question

The urgency of climate change demands an interdisciplinary approach that combines scientific knowledge with effective communication strategies. Framing, as a bridging concept, has the potential to facilitate this integration by offering a common language and framework for understanding and addressing different perspectives on climate change. By exploring the role of framing in climate change communication, this study seeks to contribute to the development of evidence-based strategies that can enhance the effectiveness of climate change communication initiatives.

4. Methodology

This study adopts a systematic review approach to assess existing literature on framing in the context of climate change communication. The systematic review methodology is well-suited to identify key trends, gaps, and patterns within a body of literature, providing a comprehensive understanding of the state of knowledge on a particular topic.

The review will encompass both quantitative and qualitative analyses, drawing on a range of content analysis techniques to identify and assess the various frames used in climate change communication. We will analyze not only the production and content of frames but also their reception and effects on different audiences. By examining frame locations such as frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, this review aims to offer a holistic perspective on the framing of climate change communication.

5. Expected Contributions

This study expects to make several significant contributions to the field of climate change communication. Firstly, by synthesizing the existing literature on framing in this context, it aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of the theoretical and empirical advancements made thus far. Secondly, by identifying gaps and challenges in the framing literature, it will guide future research efforts in refining and
