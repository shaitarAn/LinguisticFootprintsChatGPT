1. Introduction

Climate change is a critical global issue that has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its far-reaching and potentially devastating consequences. As the urgency to address this complex problem grows, so does the need for effective communication strategies that can engage diverse audiences and facilitate meaningful action. Framing, as a theoretical construct, has emerged as a promising concept in climate change communication research, offering a lens through which to understand and analyze the various ways in which information is presented, interpreted, and understood by different stakeholders.

While studies on framing in the context of climate change have proliferated, the lack of consistent definitions and frameworks has hindered the synthesis of theoretical and empirical insights. This calls for a systematic review that not only explores the trends and patterns of framing in climate change communication but also examines its potential to bridge perspectives and promote more effective communication strategies.

The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of the literature on the framing of climate change, drawing on 25 years of peer-reviewed research. By analyzing a diverse range of studies encompassing frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, this review seeks to shed light on the current state of framing research in climate change communication and identify areas for future exploration.

2. Background

Climate change communication is a complex and multifaceted endeavor, involving the dissemination of scientific information, public engagement, policy advocacy, and behavior change. The success of these communication efforts depends not only on the accuracy and credibility of the information presented but also on how it is framed. Framing refers to the process by which individuals and organizations select, emphasize, and interpret certain aspects of an issue, thereby influencing how it is understood and evaluated by others.

In the context of climate change, framing can play a crucial role in shaping public perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors. Different frames can evoke different emotions, highlight different aspects of the issue, and appeal to different values and motivations. For example, a frame that emphasizes the potential economic benefits of transitioning to renewable energy sources may resonate more with individuals who prioritize economic growth, while a frame that highlights the social and environmental impacts of climate change may be more persuasive for those concerned about social justice and sustainability.

3. Research Gap and Objectives

While previous reviews have examined framing research in the broader field of communication, there is a need for a dedicated review that specifically focuses on framing in the context of climate change. By analyzing a large body of literature spanning 25 years, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of framing research in climate change communication.

Furthermore, this review seeks to explore the potential of framing as a bridging concept, capable of fostering dialogue and understanding across different frame locations. By comparing frames across frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, this review aims to identify areas of congruence and dissonance, highlighting the conceptual (mis)fit between different frame locations. Through this analysis, we hope to provide insights into how framing can be leveraged to bridge perspectives and facilitate more effective communication strategies in the
