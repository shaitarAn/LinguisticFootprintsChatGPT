Climate change is a pressing global issue that requires effective communication strategies to engage and mobilize the public. Framing, as a concept in communication research, has gained significant attention in recent years as a potential tool for understanding and shaping public discourse on climate change. However, despite the increasing number of studies on framing climate change, there is a lack of consensus on its definition and application, making it difficult to synthesize theoretical and empirical insights.

This systematic review aims to address this gap by examining trends in framing climate change communication over the past 25 years. By comparing the framing of climate change to framing research in general, this review seeks to harness framing's power as a bridging concept that can facilitate the integration of different perspectives and approaches. The review focuses on four key frame locations: frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, within the broader context of cultural framing.

To conduct this review, a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches to content analysis was employed. A total of 275 peer-reviewed articles on the framing of climate change were analyzed, covering a wide range of topics and methodologies. The findings of this review revealed several key insights.

Firstly, the review found that framing research on climate change has not fully utilized framing's potential as a bridging concept. The conceptual fit between frame locations, such as frame production and frame content, was often lacking, leading to inconsistencies and gaps in the literature. This suggests a need for greater integration and harmonization of framing research in the context of climate change.

Secondly, the review identified several dominant frames that have emerged in the literature on climate change communication. These include frames emphasizing the scientific consensus on climate change, the economic costs and benefits of mitigation and adaptation measures, the moral and ethical dimensions of climate change, and the role of individuals and communities in addressing the issue. These frames reflect different aspects of the climate change discourse and highlight the diversity of perspectives and approaches within the field.

Thirdly, the review found that framing effects in climate change communication are complex and multifaceted. While some studies have shown that certain frames can influence public opinion and behavior, others have found limited or contradictory effects. This highlights the need for further research to understand the conditions under which framing can be effective in shaping public attitudes and actions towards climate change.

Based on these findings, several directions for future research are proposed. Firstly, there is a need for greater conceptual clarity and consistency in framing research on climate change. This includes developing a shared understanding of key concepts and terminology, as well as establishing clear frameworks for analyzing and comparing frames across different locations.

Secondly, future research should aim to integrate different frame locations and perspectives within the wider cultural framing repository. This can be achieved through interdisciplinary collaborations and the adoption of mixed-methods approaches that combine quantitative and qualitative analyses.

Lastly, future research should explore the role of framing in influencing policy and decision-making on climate change. This includes examining how different frames are adopted and contested by various stakeholders, as well as investigating the factors that shape
