Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and effective communication about this issue is crucial for raising awareness and inspiring action. Framing, as a concept in communication research, has gained significant attention in recent years as a way to shape public understanding and perception of climate change. However, despite the growing body of literature on framing in climate change communication, there is a lack of clear definitions and conceptual frameworks, making it challenging to synthesize the existing knowledge.

This systematic review aims to address this gap by analyzing and comparing trends in framing research in the context of climate change with those observed in broader communication research. By examining different aspects of framing, including frame production, frame content, audience frames, and framing effects, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of how framing operates in climate change communication.

To conduct this review, a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches using content analysis is employed. The analysis draws on 25 years of peer-reviewed literature, comprising a total of 275 studies on the framing of climate change. By analyzing these studies, we can identify patterns and trends in framing research and explore how the concept has been utilized in the field of climate change communication.

One key finding of this review is that the potential of framing as a bridging concept has not been fully realized in the context of climate change. Framing has the power to bridge different perspectives and facilitate dialogue between various stakeholders, but this aspect has been underutilized in existing research. The conceptual misfit between different frame locations, such as frame production and audience frames, has hindered the effective use of framing as a bridging tool.

In light of these findings, this review will discuss the challenges and opportunities for utilizing framing as a bridging concept in climate change communication. By addressing the conceptual misfit and exploring ways to integrate different frame locations, future research can enhance the effectiveness of framing in bridging perspectives and fostering meaningful dialogue on climate change.

In conclusion, this systematic review provides a comprehensive analysis of framing in climate change communication over the past 25 years. By contrasting trends in framing research with broader communication research, this review highlights the potential of framing as a bridging concept. The findings suggest that there is room for improvement in utilizing framing to bridge perspectives in climate change communication. Through further research and conceptual refinement, framing can become a powerful tool for promoting understanding,
