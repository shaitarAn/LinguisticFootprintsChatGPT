1. Introduction

The distribution of phonological and morphological domains in languages has been a topic of great interest among linguists and philologists. Many studies have examined the relationship between phonological and morphological structures, particularly in European languages. However, the role of individual words in the grammars of older Insular Celtic languages, such as Middle Welsh, remains a subject of debate.

Previous research on Insular Celtic languages has revealed a large number of bound elements and intricate phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures. These findings have led some researchers to question the significance of individual words in the grammatical system of these languages. Consequently, the concept of "wordhood" has been challenged, prompting the need for a more in-depth investigation into the morphological and phonological word-like domains in Middle Welsh.

The present study aims to address the question of whether the term "word" is a useful construct for the synchronic description of Middle Welsh. This investigation builds upon current typological research on wordhood and considers the challenges and limitations of studying wordhood in corpus languages. By undertaking a thorough examination of the morphological and phonological domains within the Middle Welsh verbal complex, this study seeks to provide an extensive analysis of the structures that could potentially be labeled as "words" based on the empirical evidence.

To achieve this objective, the study adopts a multidisciplinary approach that combines insights from linguistics, philology, and typology. By bringing together these diverse perspectives, we aim to shed light on the nature of word-like units in Middle Welsh and contribute to the ongoing scholarly discourse on the distribution of phonological and morphological domains in this language.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a comprehensive overview of previous research on wordhood in Insular Celtic languages and discusses the major findings and theoretical frameworks that have shaped our understanding of this topic. Section 3 outlines the methodological considerations and challenges inherent in studying wordhood in corpus languages. This section also introduces the Middle Welsh verbal complex as the primary focus of our analysis. Section 4 presents the empirical findings derived from the investigation, highlighting the structures that exhibit characteristics of word-like units within the Middle Welsh verbal complex. Section 5 critically evaluates the empirical evidence and discusses the extent to which the term "word" is applicable to the synchronic description of Middle Welsh. Finally, Section 6 offers concluding remarks and suggestions for further research.

By examining the distribution of phonological and morphological domains in the Middle Welsh verbal complex, this study aims to contribute to our understanding of the nature of wordhood in Insular Celtic languages. Ultimately, this research seeks to shed light on the broader theoretical debates surrounding the role of individual words in language structure and provide valuable insights into the grammar of Middle Welsh.
