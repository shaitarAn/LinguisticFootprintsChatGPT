Title: The Role of Verb Phrases in Middle Welsh Syntax: A Syntactic Study of Complex Predicate Structures

Abstract: The distribution and organization of phonological and morphological domains in the Middle Welsh verb have been a subject of extensive philological analysis. Previous investigations on the presence of bound elements in Insular Celtic languages and the intricate phonological interactions within morphological and phrasal structures have raised doubts regarding the significance of individual words in these grammars. Drawing on recent typological research on wordhood and a critical examination of the challenges associated with studying wordhood in corpus languages, this article presents an in-depth exploration of the syntactic and phonological properties of complex predicate structures in Middle Welsh. By investigating various linguistic constructs that potentially fulfill the criteria for being regarded as 'words,' this study reveals that the application of the term "word" for synchronic description of the Middle Welsh language is of limited utility.

1. Introduction

The study of wordhood and its role in language structure has long intrigued linguists and philologists alike. Central to this inquiry is the underlying question of how morphological and phonological elements combine to form meaningful units of communication. Traditional assumptions posit that words serve as the fundamental building blocks of language, whose boundaries are typically identifiable based on morphological and phonological criteria. However, as many scholars have observed, the older Insular Celtic languages, including Middle Welsh, exhibit an abundance of bound elements within their verbal complexes and a complex interplay of phonological processes within morphological and phrasal structures.

The rich linguistic tradition of the Middle Welsh language provides a fertile ground for investigating the nature and extent of the distribution and organization of verbal constituents in this particular grammatical system. Building upon recent typological research on wordhood and taking into account the methodological challenges inherent in studying wordhood in corpus languages, this study aims to delve into the distributional patterns and structural characteristics of the Middle Welsh verb phrases. Specifically, we will explore the morphological and phonological domains within these complex predicate structures, questioning the applicability and utility of the term "word" for synchronic descriptions of Middle Welsh.

By demonstrating that the concept of a discrete word form proves inadequate for the accurate characterization of the Middle Welsh verb, this research opens up new pathways for understanding the complex nature of linguistic structures in language evolution and typological diversity. Through this investigation, we seek to contribute novel insights into the organization of syntactic structures and the study of verbal
