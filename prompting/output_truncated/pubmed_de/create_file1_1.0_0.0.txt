The Impact of Climate Change on Biodiversity: Building a Global Information Infrastructure

Abstract: Climate change poses a significant threat to biodiversity worldwide, making it essential to conduct extensive research to understand the implications and take appropriate measures. Consequently, numerous research projects have been initiated globally to address this issue. However, the abundant and diverse information available often makes it challenging to obtain a comprehensive overview of the various research activities and their findings. In response to this challenge, the "Global Biodiversity Research Initiative" (GBRI) has established a task force aimed at ensuring easier access to climate change and biodiversity-related research data. The task force incorporates the principles of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to facilitate faster communication of research outcomes. Key objectives of the task force include creating a study portal with metadata, research instruments, study documents, results, and publications, as well as a search engine for preprint publications. Additionally, the initiative aims to develop a framework for linking research and monitoring data, providing services for improved handling of image data, and implementing standardized analysis routines for harmonized quality assessments. The ongoing development of this infrastructure will enhance the discoverability and management of global research on the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Furthermore, the advancements made within the GBRI task force can be applied to other research areas, as the challenges addressed are generic to the discoverability and handling of research data.

1. Introduction

Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues of our time, with far-reaching consequences for the Earth's ecosystems and biodiversity. The increasing emission of greenhouse gases and the resultant rise in temperature have led to a wide range of ecological disruptions, including altered weather patterns, melting of polar ice caps, and changes in precipitation levels. Such changes have a profound impact on the distribution and abundance of species, with potential cascading effects on entire ecosystems.
