This clinical case describes a patient with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (ICD 10 F20.3) who was treated with Haloperidol and Diazepam. The patient exhibited rebellious and self-destructive behavior, occasionally requiring restraint. The patient had a late start to nutrition management and was underweight with a BMI of 17.57 kg/m2. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not present. The patient's mother reported weight loss as the patient refused food and only consumed cigarettes and coffee. Albumin levels were imbalanced, but signs of fluid accumulation were absent. The subjective global assessment (SGA) classified the patient as severely malnourished. The patient received energy, protein, and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) with a gradual increase in intake. Micronutrient supplements including vitamin A, vitamin C, and zinc were also given. Despite nutritional support, the patient continued to lose weight over the first two weeks of hospitalization, with a decline in serum albumin levels. At the end of the fourth week, the patient's weight had further decreased, and on the 28th day, the patient's weight was 33 kilograms with a serum albumin level of 2.1 gr/L. Due to the patient's unstable appetite and lack of cooperation with enteral access, partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) was administered. However, the patient's BMI continued to decline, and on the 42nd day, the patient's weight dropped to 32 kilograms with a serum albumin level of 2 gr/L. Granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed on the 66th day, leading to the decision not to continue with skin graft surgery. At this point, the patient had lost 24% of body weight (BMI 11.96 kg/m2) and displayed severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss. Despite these physical changes, the patient's overall and mental condition showed relative improvement, leading to discharge from the hospital.
