Case 2: Mr. JW, a 25-year-old male from the Kaila tribe, was admitted to the hospital after experiencing sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. The patient had a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled with oral medications. He reported no other significant medical conditions or use of medications.

The patient presented with paroxysmal abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He denied any recent trauma or prior abdominal surgeries. On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and sweaty, with tenderness and guarding over the right upper quadrant of his abdomen. Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated white blood cell count and increased levels of liver enzymes.

He was initially managed for possible cholecystitis and given intravenous fluids and analgesics. However, further investigation with an abdominal ultrasound revealed an absence of the gallbladder and multiple calculi within the common bile duct. Additionally, there were small cystic lesions found in the liver.

Upon further inquiry, the patient disclosed that he was the only child of parents who were first cousins. Although he initially denied any family history of similar symptoms or conditions, careful probing revealed that his father had experienced recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and had been diagnosed with gallstones.

Genetic counseling and testing were arranged for the patient and his family members. The results confirmed a diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic liver disease (ARPLD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts.

The patient underwent surgical intervention to relieve the obstructive symptoms caused by the calculi within the common bile duct. Postoperatively, he was referred to a hepatologist for long-term management and follow-up of his ARPLD, including regular imaging studies to monitor the progression of liver cysts and potential liver transplantation.

In conclusion, Mr. JW, a young male with a history of diabetes mellitus, presented with acute abdominal pain. His unique clinical characteristics, family history, and imaging findings led to the diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic liver disease. Genetic counseling and ongoing medical management are crucial in ensuring optimal outcomes for patients with this rare condition.
