Case 2: Mrs. EF, a female infant born to a 27-year-old para 1 mother, belonging to the Samburu tribe, was delivered at term in a local health center through a spontaneous vaginal delivery. The baby cried immediately after birth and had a birth weight of 2.8kg. At the age of 6 hours, she was referred to the hospital due to an unusual skin condition observed at birth. The mother had received regular antenatal care, and there were no reported complications during pregnancy. She denied any use of medications, traditional remedies, or herbs during her pregnancy.

Mrs. EF was the first child of her parents, who were married in a monogamous relationship. They both belonged to the same Samburu tribe, and there was no known consanguinity within the family. The parents were devastated by the unexpected skin findings and were seeking answers to understand their daughter's condition.

Upon arrival at the hospital, Mrs. EF was examined by the pediatric team. The baby's skin appeared abnormal, characterized by severe blistering, and areas of skin loss were noticeable across her body. The skin on her face, trunk, and limbs seemed loosely attached, making it prone to shearing and tearing even with minimal touch or friction. Additionally, there were multiple areas on the scalp without any visible skull bones.

The medical team suspected a genetic disorder called epidermolysis bullosa (EB) based on the clinical presentation. EB is a rare inherited condition that affects the fragile skin and mucosal surfaces. It is categorized into several subtypes depending on the specific genes involved and the level of skin fragility.

The baby was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) to manage her complex needs. The nursing team took great care during handling and provided meticulous wound care, as even minor friction could lead to additional skin damage and scarring. The team also coordinated closely with other specialists including dermatologists and geneticists to confirm the diagnosis and plan for long-term management.

Further investigations were conducted to determine the subtype of EB and assess any associated complications. Skin biopsies were taken to examine the ultrastructure of the skin and confirm the diagnosis. Genetic testing was ordered to identify the specific gene mutation responsible for the condition. The results revealed that Mrs. EF had a severe form of EB known as recessive dystrophic EB, caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene.

The multidisciplinary team worked together to develop an individualized care plan for Mrs. EF. This involved the regular application of non-adherent dressings, the use of specialized wound care products, and the administration of appropriate pain management. Nutritionists were involved to ensure adequate caloric intake and modification of the diet to meet the patient's specific needs.

Counseling and support were provided to Mrs. EF's parents to help them cope with the challenges of caring for a child with EB. They were educated about meticulous skin care, dressing changes, potential complications such as infection and scarring, and genetic counseling for future family planning.

Mrs. EF's journey was anticipated to be challenging as she grew older, requiring ongoing multidisciplinary care and support. The medical team aimed to optimize her quality of life and mitigate the impact of EB on her overall development. Through a collaborative approach between healthcare professionals and her dedicated family, Mrs. EF embarked on a path toward
