Case 3: Baby ZK, a female infant from the Ogoni tribe, was delivered at term in a hospital by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 28-year-old primigravida mother. The baby cried immediately after birth and weighed 2.5kg. At the time of delivery, it was noted that a significant portion of the baby's scalp was missing along with part of the skull bone. The pregnancy was uncomplicated, and the mother denied using any medications during her pregnancy.

Physical examination revealed an irregularly shaped defect on the vertex of the scalp overlying the parietal bone bilaterally, extending to the occipital region. The defect measured approximately 7 x 6 cm in size and was covered with a thin layer of yellow membrane. Additionally, Baby ZK had low set ears and appeared irritable.

Further examination showed a tense anterior fontanelle and signs of respiratory distress. However, other systems appeared normal upon initial assessment.

Based on these findings, a tentative diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible associated complications such as meningitis or other congenital anomalies was made.

Baby ZK received routine care according to established protocols which included administration of oxygen for respiratory support, intravenous fluids for hydration, and antibiotics at meningitis doses to prevent any potential infection.

The patient's respiratory distress gradually subsided, allowing for initiation of oral feeds which were well tolerated throughout her hospital stay. A multidisciplinary team consisting of neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons became involved in formulating plans for future intervention which involved raising a flap cover to facilitate autologous skin grafting onto the defect site previously observed on Baby ZK's scalp.

To further investigate potential underlying abnormalities or associated anomalies present in this case, additional diagnostic tests were performed including a babygram (radiograph), an abdominopelvic scan (ultrasound), as well as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The babygram and abdominopelvic scan results were within normal limits, providing reassurance regarding the health of major organ systems. However, the brain MRI revealed an absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally extending from approximately 2 cm behind the anterior fontanelle down to the posterior fontanelle, resulting in a sizable defect measuring approximately 7.5 cm x 6 cm (anteroposterior x transverse). Notably, subcutaneous scalp tissues were not visualized in this region; however, there was dural overlay overlying the brain parenchyma in these areas. The remaining cranial vault bones including occipital, frontal, and temporal bones appeared intact without any abnormalities.

No intra-axial or extra-axial masses or collections were observed during interpretation of images from Baby ZK's brain MRI. Additionally, no areas of abnormal enhancement were noted on contrast imaging sequences. The cortical sulci (grooves), sylvian fissures (brain fissures), basal cisterns (spaces at base of skull), and ventricles all appeared normal in size and shape within standard parameters.
