Clinical Case: Schizophrenia and Severe Malnutrition

This clinical case involves a patient diagnosed with schizophrenia, specifically type ICD 10 F20.3. The patient was prescribed Haloperidol 1.5 mg and Diazepam 5 mg daily to manage their symptoms. However, due to the patient's rebellious and self-destructive behavior, occasional physical restraints were necessary.

The nutrition management for this patient was initiated after a week of hospitalization, which can be considered late considering the severity of malnutrition present in the initial assessment. With a weight of 40 kg and height of 150 cm, the body mass index (BMI) was calculated to be 17.57 kg/m^2 - indicating that the patient was underweight.

No gastrointestinal symptoms or signs were found during the initial assessment; however, further information regarding dietary intake over the past two weeks and weight changes over six months could not be obtained. The patient's mother claimed that he had refused any food offered to him during this time period, relying only on smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee.

Laboratory results showed an albumin level of 3.6 gr/L with imbalanced electrolyte levels but no signs of fluid accumulation were observed. According to the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool used for malnutrition evaluation in hospitalized patients, this patient belonged to group C - severely malnourished.

Following these findings, energy and protein supplementation were started at a rate of 30 kcal/kg gradually increasing up to 50 kcal/kg divided between oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) in a ratio of 50:50 respectively.

In addition to energy and protein supplementation, micronutrient supplements including vitamin A (100,000 units for one week), vitamin C (100 mg three times daily), and zinc (20 mg once daily) were administered as well.

Despite following this nutritional plan during early weeks of hospitalization, the patient continued to experience weight loss. By the end of the second week, his body weight had dropped to 36 kilograms and albumin level declined to 2.7 gr/L. On the 28th day, his weight further decreased to 33 kilograms with a serum albumin level of 2.1 gr/L.

Given the persistence of weight loss and worsening albumin levels, adjustments were made in terms of oral intake and ONS ratio which was modified to be 70:30 respectively.

The patient's unstable appetite posed a challenge during treatment and enteral access was difficult due to patient non-cooperation with medical procedures. Furthermore, analgesics and sedatives failed to effectively manage their pain or aggression.

To address protein needs adequately despite these difficulties, partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) was administered.

However, despite these interventions, the patient's BMI continued to decline reaching an alarming low value of 11.96 kg/m^2 on day 42 with a body weight of only 32 kilograms and a serum albumin level as low as 2 gr/L.

On day 66, granulation tissues appeared on the wound bed indicating some healing progress; however, considering both the mental condition due to schizophrenia and severe malnutrition status presenting muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss - it was decided not to proceed with skin graft surgery at this stage.

Ultimately, after losing approximately a quarter (24%) of their initial body weight along with significantly depleted serum albumin levels (2.5 gr/L), signs indicated that discharge from hospital could be considered as their general mental condition had relatively improved compared t earlier stages despite ongoing physical deterioration related to malnourishment.

In conclusion,
