This clinical case describes a patient who was diagnosed with schizophrenia (ICD 10 F20.3) and was being treated with Haloperidol and Diazepam. The patient exhibited rebellious and self-destructive behavior, which occasionally required restraint. After a week of hospitalization, it was determined that the patient's nutritional status was underweight, with a body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m2.

The patient did not show any gastrointestinal symptoms or signs but had lost weight over the past few months as reported by the mother. The patient's dietary intake in the last two weeks could not be obtained, but it was stated that he only consumed cigarettes and coffee.

The initial nutrition assessment using the subjective global assessment (SGA) tool classified the patient as severely malnourished (group C). The treatment plan included providing energy and protein starting from 30 kcal/kg gradually increasing to 50 kcal/kg, divided into oral nutrition and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) in a ratio of 50:50. Additionally, micronutrient supplementation consisting of vitamin A, vitamin C, and zinc was given.

Despite providing nutritional support, including supplements for protein needs through partially parenteral nutrition enriched with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), the patient continued to lose weight throughout hospitalization. By day 42nd of hospitalization, his body weight dropped to 32 kilograms while his serum albumin level declined to 2 gr/L.

On day 66th granulation tissues were seen on wound bed showing improvement however considering his mental status at this point further surgical intervention such as skin graft surgery was decided against due to significant muscle wasting , subcutaneous fat loss , malnutrition indicated by serum albumin level at that moment still persistently low(<3g/L)

Ultimately, despite losing approximately 24% of his body weight during hospitalization with severe muscle wasting and subcutaneous fat loss, the patient's general and mental condition improved to some extent. As a result, the patient was discharged from the hospital.

It is important to note that this case highlights the challenges in managing nutrition in patients with psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia. The patient's poor appetite, refusal of food, and difficulty with enteral access made it difficult to provide adequate nutrition and prevent further weight loss. Additionally, the patient's aggressive behavior limited their response to pain relief measures and impacted their overall clinical management.
