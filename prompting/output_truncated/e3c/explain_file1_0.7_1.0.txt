This clinical case involves a young woman who has a history of callosotomy, which is a surgical procedure to control seizures. At the age of 18, she experienced her first seizure since the callosotomy during a laser treatment for her port wine birthmark. She was then prescribed carbamazepine, an antiepileptic medication, and has not had any further seizures since.

Her parents report that despite having normal development in infancy, she struggled academically and is barely literate. There are no significant findings in her family history except for her elder sister having a port wine stain on her face, but no investigations were done regarding this.

The patient is also being treated for anxiety disorder and chronic headaches with medications such as ketiapin and venlafaxine. Additionally, she takes NSAID drugs for pain relief. While the headaches showed slight improvement in severity after one week of treatment, the frequency remained unchanged.

On physical examination, several findings were noted:

1. Facial nevus: Choroid angioma on the right forehead, right eyelid nasal wing and cheek.
2. Gingival overgrowth: Bright red enlargement of the gums on the right side with blanching upon pressure.
3. Mild asymmetry in extremities: The left arm and leg are slightly smaller than their counterparts on the right side.
4. Hemiparesis: Weakness affecting both upper and lower extremities on the same (left) side.
5. Glaucoma: Diagnosis of glaucoma in the right eye.
6. Anxiety disorder signs observed during psychiatric examination.

Neurological examination did not reveal any other remarkable findings except for hemiparesis (weakness on one side). Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy (shrinkage) in the right hemisphere along with irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area.

Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere, along with diffuse atrophy on the same side. Further MRI images showed asymmetry in calvarial thickness, with the right hemisphere appearing smaller compared to the left. Extensive venous formations were also observed around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle, as well as at various other locations.

Based on a Proteus intelligence test, she scored 75 points and was considered to be mildly mentally retarded.
