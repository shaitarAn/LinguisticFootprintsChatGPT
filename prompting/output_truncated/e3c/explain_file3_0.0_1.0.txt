This clinical case involves a 35-year-old man with a history of mental illness, specifically schizophrenia. He was transferred to the hospital after attempting suicide by setting himself on fire. As a result, he suffered burns on approximately 38% of his total body surface area (TBSA), including his face, neck, upper extremities, thighs, legs, and trunk.

Upon admission to the hospital, the patient weighed 40 kg and had a height of 150 cm. This resulted in a body mass index (BMI) of 17.57 kg/m2, which is considered underweight. The patient's psychiatric condition was managed with Haloperidol and Diazepam medications.

The patient exhibited rebellious and self-destructive behavior at times and required occasional restraint for safety reasons. Due to these behavioral issues and possibly other factors related to his mental illness or burn injuries, nutrition management was delayed until one week after hospitalization.

The initial nutrition assessment revealed that the patient had not been consuming adequate food during the previous two weeks. His mother reported that he only smoked cigarettes and drank coffee during this time period. The patient's albumin level was measured at 3.6 g/L with imbalanced electrolyte levels.

Based on subjective global assessment (SGA), which evaluates nutritional status based on various criteria such as weight loss and physical signs of malnutrition, the patient fell into group C indicating severe malnourishment.

To address his nutritional needs, energy intake started at 30 kcal/kg per day but gradually increased to reach 50 kcal/kg per day over time. Protein intake also began at 2 g/kg per day but followed a similar gradual increase pattern as energy intake did.

Both oral nutrition (food) and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) were provided in equal proportions initially but later modified to have more emphasis on ONS due to difficulties with oral intake by the patient.

In addition to energy and protein, the patient received micronutrient supplementation including vitamin A, vitamin C, and zinc. These supplements aim to support wound healing and overall nutritional status.

Despite these interventions, the patient continued to experience weight loss during the early weeks of hospitalization. By the end of the second week, his body weight dropped to 36 kg with a serum albumin level of 2.7 g/L. On day 28, his body weight further decreased to 33 kg with a serum albumin level of 2.1 g/L.

The patient's appetite remained unstable throughout treatment, and he had difficulty cooperating with enteral access (feeding through tubes). He also experienced pain and increased aggression that did not respond well to analgesics (pain medications) or sedatives.

To address his protein needs more effectively, partially parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) was administered. However, despite these efforts, his BMI continued to decline.

On day 42, granulation tissues started forming on the wound bed indicating
