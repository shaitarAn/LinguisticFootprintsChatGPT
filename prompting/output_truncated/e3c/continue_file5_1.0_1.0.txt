Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 38.5Â°C, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed a generalized maculopapular rash over the body and eyelids. There were no palpable lymph nodes or hepatosplenomegaly. The respiratory examination was unremarkable with clear breath sounds bilaterally.

The patient reported that his symptoms started abruptly one week ago with high-grade fever and a rash that initially appeared on his trunk before spreading to other parts of the body including the eyelids. He described the rash as mildly itchy but not painful.

In addition to fever and rash, he experienced intermittent headaches accompanied by neck pain which worsened upon flexion or movement. He also complained of a sore throat and dry cough without any sputum production or hemoptysis. Furthermore, he mentioned having watery diarrhoea for one day prior to his admission but it had resolved spontaneously.

A thorough review of systems did not reveal any significant past medical history or chronic illnesses in this previously healthy individual. The patient denied any recent travel within or outside South Africa, exposure to sick contacts or animals, sexual activity or high-risk behaviors such as drug use.

Laboratory investigations were initiated upon admission which included complete blood count (CBC), renal function tests (RFTs), liver function tests (LFTs) and serological testing for infectious diseases including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

CBC revealed leukopenia with lymphopenia (white blood cell count: 3 x10^9/L; lymphocyte count: 0.6 x10^9/L), thrombocytopenia (platelet count: 120 x10^9/L) and normal hemoglobin level (13 g/dL). The patient's RFTs and LFTs were within normal limits. Serology for HIV was negative.

Considering the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide, a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was obtained. The patient was placed on droplet precautions in a single isolation room until the results were available.

In the meantime, symptomatic treatment was initiated to address fever and pain. The patient received acetaminophen for temperature control and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen for headache and neck pain relief. He was also advised to maintain good oral hydration by consuming fluids regularly.

Within 24 hours, the RT-PCR test result confirmed that the patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicating that he had contracted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 

The medical team at CHBAH continued to monitor his vital signs closely, paying particular attention to any respiratory distress or worsening symptoms. Fortunately, over the course of his hospital stay which lasted approximately two weeks due to mild disease progression requiring observation and supportive care only; no complications occurred. The rash gradually resolved without intervention.

The patient remained in isolation until two subsequent RT-PCR tests performed 24 hours apart came back negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA confirming viral clearance according to local guidelines before discharge from hospital.

Educational materials regarding COVID-19 prevention strategies including hand hygiene, mask usage in public spaces, social distancing measures, and self-isolation criteria were provided extensively by healthcare providers to ensure adequate knowledge upon discharge.

Follow-up arrangements were made with primary care providers who would continue monitoring their patients' health post-discharge while adhering strictly with local regulations surrounding COVID-19 such as quarantine restrictions if needed.

This case highlights the importance of considering COVID-19 as a potential diagnosis
