This patient is a 21-year-old female with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS). She initially presented with frequent non-pulsating headaches that had been occurring for the past two years. These headaches responded to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and were not worsened by physical activity. There were no accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura.

The patient has a history of seizures, which began on the fifteenth day of life and led to her diagnosis of SWS. At the age of 6, she underwent callosotomy surgery to control her seizures. However, at age 18, she experienced a seizure during laser treatment for her port wine birthmark. Since then, she has been taking carbamazepine and has remained seizure-free.

In terms of cognitive development, the patient's parents reported that she had normal development during infancy but struggled in school and is currently barely literate. Her family history is unremarkable except for her elder sister having a port wine stain on her face.

On examination, characteristics associated with SWS were observed: facial nevus (a birthmark) on the right forehead, right eyelid nasal wing, and cheek. Intraoral examination revealed overgrowth of gingiva (gums) on the right side, which appeared reddish in color and blanched upon applying pressure due to angiomatous enlargement.

The patient also exhibited mild asymmetry in her extremities; specifically, her left arm and leg appeared slightly smaller than those on the right side. Hemiparesis (weakness) was present in both upper and lower extremities but only affected this smaller side.

Her ophthalmological evaluation indicated glaucoma in her right eye.
A psychiatric examination revealed signs consistent with an anxiety disorder.
Neurological examination showed no significant findings apart from hemiparesis.

Radiological investigations found diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere on cranial CT scans and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Brain MRI with gadolinium enhancement revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere along with diffuse atrophy. Other findings included thickening of the right calvaria (skull bone) compared to the left and asymmetrically smaller right hemisphere.

Further examination with T2 weighted MRI showed extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle, as well as at Gallen vein localization, Willis polygon localization (anterior to third ventricle), and temporooccipital area.

Lastly, a proteus intelligence test was performed, which yielded a score of 75 points indicating mild mental retardation.

In summary, this young woman presented with a range of symptoms consistent with Sturge-Weber Syndrome, including frequent headaches, seizures since infancy (despite prior surgery), hemiparesis affecting her left side due to asymmetry in brain development, glaucoma in her right eye, facial nevus (birthmark), excessive growth and reddening of gingiva on one side of her mouth. These observations were confirmed through radiological investigations showing vascular abnormalities in multiple regions of
