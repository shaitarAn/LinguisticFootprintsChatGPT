Based on the clinical case you provided, it seems like the patient has a complex medical condition involving several different symptoms and findings. Let's break down the information:

Medical History:
- At age 6, she underwent callosotomy, a surgical procedure to control her seizures.
- At age 18, during laser treatment for her port wine birthmark (a type of vascular birthmark), she experienced her first seizure since the callosotomy.
- She was subsequently prescribed carbamazepine, an antiseizure medication, at a daily dose of 400 mg and has remained seizure-free since then.

Developmental Background:
- Despite normal development in infancy, she struggled academically and is barely literate.

Family History:
- Her elder sister also has a port wine stain but does not exhibit any other symptoms typically associated with Sturge Weber Syndrome (SWS), which is often associated with this type of birthmark. No research or investigation has been done regarding her sister's birthmark.

Current Medications:
- Ketiapin (quetiapine) 25 mg daily for anxiety disorder
- Venlafaxine 75 mg daily for both anxiety disorder and chronic headaches
- NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) - specific drug not mentioned

Physical Examination Findings:
1. Facial nevus: A discoloration or mole-like growth caused by choroid angioma that affects the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek.
2. Gingival overgrowth: Enlargement of gum tissue on the right side with angiomatous features.
3. Extremity asymmetry: Slight size difference between left arm/leg compared to their counterparts on the right side; hemiparesis present in both upper and lower extremities of equal size.
4. Ophthalmological evaluation: Diagnosed with glaucoma in the right eye.

Radiological Findings:
- Cranial CT scans: Diffuse atrophy (shrinking) in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured cortical calcifications in the right occipital area.
- Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI: Revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere, along with diffuse atrophy. Axial T1 and T2 weighted images showed asymmetry in calvarial thickness between left and right sides, extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle, and various vascular formations at different locations.

Psychiatric Evaluation:
- Signs of anxiety disorder identified.

Intelligence Testing:
- She scored 75 points on a Proteus intelligence test, suggesting mild mental retardation.

Based on these findings, it appears that this patient may have Sturge Weber Syndrome (SWS), a rare neurological disorder characterized by abnormal blood vessel formation along with other associated symptoms. SWS can affect various aspects of an individual's health including seizures (which led to her callosotomy), cognitive development (intellectual disability), glaucoma, skin abnormalities (facial nevus), gingival overgrowth, hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body), and radiological findings
