This clinical case describes a young woman who has had a complex medical history involving various neurological and physical symptoms. At the age of 6, she underwent a callosotomy procedure to control her seizures. Callosotomy is a surgical procedure in which the corpus callosum, the bundle of nerve fibers connecting the two hemispheres of the brain, is partially or completely severed.

When she was 18 years old and underwent laser treatment for her port wine birthmark, she experienced her first seizure since the callosotomy. Following this seizure, she was prescribed carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant medication commonly used to treat epilepsy.

Since starting carbamazepine at a daily dose of 400 mg, she has not experienced any further seizures. However, her parents note that despite having normal development in infancy, she struggled academically and has low literacy skills.

The patient's family history does not reveal any significant medical conditions except for her elder sister also having a port wine birthmark on her face. It's important to note that no research has been done regarding the causes or associations of this birthmark in their family.

In addition to taking carbamazepine for seizure control, the patient is also prescribed other medications for anxiety disorder and chronic headaches. Ketiapin (quetiapine) at a dose of 25 mg per day is used for anxiety disorder while venlafaxine is given at 75 mg per day as treatment for both anxiety disorder and chronic headaches. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are also included in her medication regimen.

After one week on this treatment plan, there seems to be some improvement in terms of headache severity but no change in frequency. Physical examination reveals several notable findings including facial nevus (a type of birthmark caused by blood vessels), overgrowth of gingiva (gums), and mild asymmetry on her extremities with hemiparesis (weakness or paralysis) on the left side.

Further evaluations reveal that she has glaucoma in her right eye and imaging studies, such as cranial CT scans and MRI, show significant abnormalities on the right hemisphere of her brain. These abnormalities include diffuse atrophy (shrinkage), cortical calcifications, dilated pial venous vascular structures, and extensive venous formations around various brain areas.

Psychiatric examination confirms an anxiety disorder, while neurological examination aside from the weakness on her left side is unremarkable. Additionally, a proteus intelligence test reveals she has scored 75 points and is considered to have mild mental retardation.

From this comprehensive clinical assessment, it appears that this patient may be experiencing symptoms related to Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). SWS is a rare congenital condition characterized by neurological abnormalities like seizures due to abnormal blood vessel development in the brain. The characteristic port wine birthmark seen in both sisters may be suggestive of SWS.

In conclusion, this case presents a young woman with a complex medical history involving callosotomy for seizure control and subsequent development of new-onset seizures after laser treatment for a port wine birthmark. She also exhibits physical findings consistent with SWS including facial nevus, gingival overgrowth, asymmetry in extremities with hemiparesis on the left side, glaucoma in one eye, and significant imaging abnormalities in the right hemisphere of her brain. The patient has comorbid psychiatric conditions like anxiety disorder as well as mild mental retardation. Overall management involves antiepileptic medication for seizure control along with treatment for associated symptoms such as anxiety disorder
