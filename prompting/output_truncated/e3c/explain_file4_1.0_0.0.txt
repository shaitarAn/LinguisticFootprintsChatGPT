In the first clinical case, a 30-year-old teacher gave birth to a baby with a large defect on the scalp and other signs of abnormalities. The baby had low set ears, irritability, tense anterior fontanelle, and respiratory distress. The diagnosis was aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis. The baby received routine care including oxygen, fluids, antibiotics, and wound dressing. Neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons were involved in the management. Imaging showed absence of bone in the parietal region of the skull. Plans were made for future intervention with skin grafting. The baby was discharged after 18 days for follow-up at specialty clinics.

In the second clinical case, a baby was referred at 48 hours of life due to the absence of part of the skull bone noticed at birth. The parents had no known family history of congenital anomalies. The baby had multiple clinical findings, including a subcutaneous tissue defect on the scalp, leaking of cerebrospinal fluid, desquamating skin, hypoplastic finger and toe nails, dilated abdominal wall veins, and a heart murmur. A working diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies, including cutis aplasia and a ventricular septal defect, was made. Sepsis was also present. Due to financial constraints, some diagnostic tests could not be done. Treatment included antibiotics and wound care. Complications included CSF leakage and meningitis, which resolved over time. Plans were made for mesh and flap cover, but the baby unfortunately died 7 days after discharge.

These cases describe infants with congenital anomalies affecting the scalp and skull bones. In both cases, detailed clinical examinations, imaging, and multidisciplinary management were performed to diagnose and provide appropriate care.
