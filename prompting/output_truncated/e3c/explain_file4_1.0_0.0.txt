Case 1: Baby NU is a male infant who was referred to a hospital at the age of 4 hours due to an absence of skin and skull bone noticed at birth. The pregnancy was supervised and uneventful, and the mother reported not using any medications during pregnancy. Ultrasound scans during the second trimester were normal. The baby was the third child of parents in a monogamous consanguineous family setting. Physical examination revealed a large defect on the scalp with a yellow layer of membrane covering it. The baby also had low set ears, irritability, tense anterior fontanelle, and respiratory distress. A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis was made. The baby received routine care including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and dressing with sofra-tulle and normal saline soaked gauze. The respiratory distress subsided, and the baby was eventually able to tolerate oral feeds. Multidisciplinary team management was done, and brain imaging showed absence of parietal bone and subcutaneous scalp tissues in the affected area. The brain in the region was overlaid by the dural meninges, and other brain structures were normal. Plans were made for future intervention to raise a flap cover for autologous skin grafting. The baby was discharged after 18 days for follow-up at specialty clinics.

Case 2: Baby YA is a Hausa infant who was referred to a hospital at 48 hours of life due to the absence of part of the skull bone noticed at birth. The baby was delivered at home, and there was no overt trauma to the head during delivery. The baby was the third child of parents in a monogamous, non-consanguineous setting. The parents did not have a known family history of congenital anomalies, and the older siblings were alive and well. Physical examination revealed a midline subcutaneous tissue defect of the scalp extending from the frontal to the occipital area, with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) indicating likely dural involvement. The baby also had desquamating skin, hypoplastic finger and toe nails, visible dilated abdominal wall veins, and a grade 3 systolic cardiac murmur. A working diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies including congenital cutis aplasia, congenital heart disease (ventricular septal defect), and meningitis was made. The baby tested positive for Providencia species and E. coli in the blood and CSF. Due to financial constraints, some diagnostic tests such as brain MRI, echocardiography, and chromosomal studies could not be done. The baby received treatment with antibiotics and wound care. Complications included CSF leakage and meningitis, which resolved over time. Plans were made for a mesh and flap cover, but the baby was discharged upon the parents' request and unfortunately passed away 7 days later.

Both cases involve infants with congenital
