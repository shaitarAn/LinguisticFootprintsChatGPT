In the first clinical case, a baby was born with a large defect on the scalp, specifically on the vertex of the scalp over the parietal bone bilaterally extending to the occipital region. This defect measured approximately 10 x 8 cm in the midline and 6 x 6 cm in the occipital region. The baby also had low set ears, was irritable, had a tense anterior fontanelle, and was experiencing respiratory distress. A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita, along with possible meningitis, was made.

Aplasia cutis congenita is a rare condition characterized by the absence of skin in certain areas, typically on the scalp. In this case, the defect on the baby's scalp was covered by a yellow layer of membrane. The respiratory distress experienced by the baby was likely due to the skull defect.

The baby received routine care, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics at meningitis doses. The dressing on the scalp defect consisted of sofra-tulle and normal saline soaked gauze. Over time, the baby's respiratory distress improved, and oral feeds were introduced and tolerated well. The multidisciplinary team, which included neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons, managed the condition.

Imaging studies, such as a babygram and an abdominopelvic scan, were performed and showed normal results. However, the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally, extending from 2 cm behind the anterior fontanelle to the posterior fontanelle. The subcutaneous scalp tissues were not visualized, but the brain in this region was covered by the dural meninges. The cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brain stem structures appeared normal.

Based on these findings, the conclusion was that the baby had aplasia cutis congenita. The burns and plastic unit, along with the neurosurgeons, made plans for future intervention, including raising a flap cover for autologous skin grafting. The baby was eventually discharged home after 18 days of admission with oral antibiotics and daily wound dressing, for follow-up at specialty clinics.

In the second clinical case, a baby was referred for the absence of part of the skull bone noticed at birth. The baby was delivered at home, and there was no overt trauma to the head during delivery. The baby was the third child of the parents and was born at term. At presentation, the baby exhibited signs of being very ill, including fever, cyanosis, and hypertonicity. There was a midline subcutaneous tissue defect on the scalp, extending from the frontal to the occipital area and the right parietal region. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage was also observed.

In addition to the skull defect, the baby had other congenital anomalies, such as desquamating skin, hypoplastic finger and toe nails, visible dilated abdominal wall veins, and a ventricular septal defect (a hole in the heart). A working diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies, including aplasia cutis congenita, congenital heart disease, and meningitis, was made. Further investigations, such as brain MRI, echocardiography, and chromosomal studies, could not be done due to financial constraints.

The baby was treated with parenteral antibiotics, and the scalp wound was cleaned daily and dressed with betadine. Complications, including CSF leakage and meningitis, eventually resolved over time. The burns and plastic unit planned for prolene mesh/titanium mesh and latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap cover in the future. The baby was discharged to the parents upon request but
