This clinical case involves a 36-year-old pregnant woman who presented with a 3-month history of abdominal pain. The pain was located in the upper part of her abdomen and gradually worsened over time. She also experienced occasional radiation of the pain to her chest. The woman had significant weight loss but did not have early satiety, jaundice, fever, itch, or spontaneous bleeding. She denied any history of blood transfusion, alcohol consumption, or smoking. There were no respiratory, cardiovascular, or urogenital symptoms.

On examination, the woman appeared wasted and had mild pallor. She had a slight yellowish tinge to her skin (jaundice) but was well hydrated and had no palpable lymph nodes. She had palmar erythema (redness of the palms of her hands) but no clubbing (abnormal enlargement of the fingertips) or parotid enlargement. Her abdomen was distended, particularly in the upper half, and there were visible distended veins on the anterior abdominal wall. Her liver was enlarged, hard, nodular, and tender, with an irregular edge. A bruit (abnormal sound) was heard over the liver. There was also mild ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen) and edema in her lower legs.

The woman was 27 weeks pregnant, and her baby's heart rate was regular. Laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL, a white blood cell count of 10,200 cells/dL, and elevated liver enzymes (GGT and AST). Her total protein and albumin levels were low, and her INR (a measure of blood clotting) was slightly elevated. She tested positive for HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) but negative for HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen). Her HBV DNA level (viral load) was also high. She tested positive for VDRL (a test for syphilis) but had not undergone TPHA (a confirmatory test for syphilis). Her AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) level was extremely high (>50,000 KU/L). She tested negative for HIV and HCV.

An abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic (dark) lesions. The liver size was increased, and there was mild ascites. A pelvic scan confirmed a 27-week, 3-day-old fetus with active fetal movements.

The initial diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) in pregnancy. However, upon further evaluation, it was determined that the woman had hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation (liver function failure) during pregnancy. She was managed with pain medication, diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone), and lamivudine (to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B).

The plan was to allow the pregnancy to continue until at least 32 completed weeks to improve the chances of neonatal survival. However, due to the progressive and unbearable abdominal pain, the pregnancy was terminated at 30 weeks and 3 days through successful induction of labor. The outcome was a stillbirth with a weight of 1.2
