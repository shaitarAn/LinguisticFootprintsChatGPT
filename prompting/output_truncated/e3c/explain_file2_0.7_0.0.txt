In this clinical case, we have a female patient who presented with various symptoms and findings during examination. The patient does not have a known history of diabetes, hypertension, or any chronic illness. She denies alcohol consumption and smoking. There were no respiratory, cardiovascular, or urogenital symptoms present. However, on examination, several clinical signs were noted.

The patient exhibited wasting, mild pallor, and a tinge of jaundice. She was well hydrated and had no fever or palpable lymph nodes. Palmer erythema (redness of the palms) was observed, but there was no clubbing (enlargement of the fingertips) or parotid enlargement (swelling of the salivary gland). The respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.

Abdominal examination revealed gross distention with a distorted upper half and visibly distended veins on the anterior abdominal wall draining away from the umbilicus. The liver was enlarged and hard, with nodules and an irregular edge. Mild tenderness and a bruit (abnormal sound) were detected upon auscultation. The spleen was not palpable, but there was mild ascites (abnormal fluid buildup in the abdomen) and bipedal edema (swelling of the lower limbs). The symphysio fundal height (measurement of the uterus) was 26 cm, indicating a breech presentation of a 27-week, 3-day-old fetus. The fetal heart rate was regular at 134 bpm.

Rectal and vaginal examinations did not reveal any abnormalities. Based on the initial findings, a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) in pregnancy was made. Laboratory assessment showed low hemoglobin levels, normal white blood cell count with differential, normal platelet count, low total protein and albumin levels, and elevated liver enzymes (GGT and AST). The INR (International Normalized Ratio) was elevated, indicating impaired blood clotting. The patient tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and negative for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The HBV DNA level (viral load) was also high. The patient tested positive for VDRL (syphilis screening test) but TPHA (confirmatory test) was not performed. Alphafetoprotein (AFP), a tumor marker, was significantly elevated.

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions. The liver size was enlarged, and there was mild ascites. Pelvic ultrasound confirmed the presence of a 27-week, 3-day-old fetus with active fetal movements. A revised diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation in pregnancy was made.

The patient was managed with analgesics for pain relief, as well as furosemide and spironolactone to manage fluid retention. Lamivudine, an antiviral medication, was added to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B
