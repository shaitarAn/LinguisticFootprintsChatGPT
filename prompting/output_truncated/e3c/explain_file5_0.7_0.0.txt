Clinical Case Summary:

This clinical case involves a previously healthy 17-year-old African male who presented with a one-week history of fever, rash, headache, neck pain, sore throat, dry cough, and diarrhea. He had no history of joint pain, oral or nasal ulcers, or urethral discharge. The patient had no prior medical admissions, surgeries, significant medication use, or recreational drug use. He had no known contact with COVID-19 but had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal.

On examination, the patient appeared ill and had a high heart rate, low blood pressure, and high temperature. He had a generalized rash over his body and eyelids, as well as conjunctivitis. The abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal, and there were no signs of jaundice, lymphadenopathy, or meningism. The initial diagnostic tests showed elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers. Blood and urine cultures were negative, and a lumbar puncture, chest radiograph, and abdominal sonar were normal. The first echocardiogram (ECHO) showed a structurally normal heart with normal function.

The patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and hydrocortisone. However, due to persistently low blood pressure, an audible gallop rhythm, and elevated cardiac troponin-T levels, a repeat ECHO revealed reduced heart function, chamber dilation, and regurgitation. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and dobutamine were started to improve heart function, and a steroid pulse was initiated. Serological testing confirmed the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Doxycycline and ceftriaxone were discontinued, and colchicine was added to cover for myopericarditis. The patient showed clinical improvement, with resolution of fever, rash, and normalization of inflammatory markers. He was discharged on prednisone, aspirin, and colchicine.

During follow-up, the patient had fully recovered with no residual symptoms. A repeat ECHO showed improved heart function, and the prednisone was gradually tapered off.

In summary, this case describes a young male patient who presented with a febrile illness, rash, and cardiac involvement. The initial diagnosis was suspected to be MIS-C (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children), which is associated with COVID-19. The patient responded well to treatment and had a complete recovery.
