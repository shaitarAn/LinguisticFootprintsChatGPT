This clinical case involves a young woman who had a history of callosotomy at the age of 6 to control her seizures. Callosotomy is a surgical procedure in which the corpus callosum, a structure that connects the two hemispheres of the brain, is partially or completely severed. This procedure is often performed in patients with severe epilepsy to prevent the spread of seizures from one hemisphere to the other.

At the age of 18, she underwent a laser treatment to remove a port wine birthmark. However, this procedure triggered her first seizure since the callosotomy. Following this seizure, she was prescribed carbamazepine, an antiepileptic medication, at a daily dose of 400 mg. It is important to note that she has not had any seizures since starting this medication.

According to her parents, despite having a normal development during infancy, she struggled academically and had difficulty graduating from elementary school. She is described as being barely literate. Additionally, her elder sister also had a port wine stain on her face, but there were no other significant findings related to this condition in the family. No research has been done regarding her sister's birthmark.

In terms of her psychiatric health, she was prescribed ketiapin and venlafaxine for anxiety disorder and chronic headaches. She was also taking NSAID drugs. While the treatment slightly decreased the heaviness of her headaches, the frequency remained the same. On physical examination, a facial nevus (a type of birthmark) was observed on her right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. Intraoral examination revealed an overgrowth of gingiva (gums) on the right side, which appeared bright red and showed blanching upon applying pressure, suggesting angiomatous enlargement.

Furthermore, mild asymmetry was observed in her extremities, with her left arm and leg being slightly smaller in proportion and showing hemiparesis (weakness or partial paralysis) affecting both the upper and lower extremities on the same side. On ophthalmological evaluation, she was diagnosed with glaucoma in her right eye. A psychiatric examination revealed signs of anxiety disorder, while her neurological examination did not show any remarkable findings apart from the hemiparesis.

Various imaging studies were performed to further investigate her condition. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy (shrinkage) in the right hemisphere of her brain and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere, along with the diffuse atrophy on the same side. Additionally, axial T1 and T2 weighted MRI scans showed right calvarial (skull) thickness compared to the left side, as well as extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle and at various other locations.

Based on these findings, she underwent a proteus intelligence test, which yielded a score of 75, indicating mild mental retardation. Mental retardation, also known as intellectual disability, is a condition characterized by limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviors. In this case, it is likely that the combination of her underlying condition and the surgical intervention for epilepsy has contributed to her cognitive impairment.

In conclusion, this clinical case involves a young woman who underwent callosotomy for seizure control at a young age. Following a laser treatment for a birthmark, she experienced a seizure and was subsequently prescribed carbamazepine, which successfully prevented further seizures. However,
