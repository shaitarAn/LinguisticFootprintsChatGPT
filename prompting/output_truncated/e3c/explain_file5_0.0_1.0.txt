This clinical case describes a patient who presented with various symptoms and underwent diagnostic assessments to determine the cause of their illness. Here is a breakdown of the key points:

Patient Profile:
- No prior medical admission, surgery, or significant medication/recreational drug use.
- Grade ten scholar.
- Recent travel to Kwa-Zulu Natal two weeks prior.

Clinical Findings:
- Ill-looking patient with a blood pressure of 103/44 mmHg, heart rate of 123 beats per minute, and temperature of 39.5Â°C.
- Restless with no evidence of cognitive dysfunction.
- Generalized maculopapular rash observed over the torso, upper back, limbs, and palmar surface of the hands.
- Non-tender erythematous desquamating lesions over the eyelids and bilateral conjunctivitis.
- Normal abdominal and respiratory examinations with no jaundice or lymphadenopathy.
- Normal cardiovascular examination except for sinus tachycardia.

Diagnostic Assessment:
- Prior treatment with ceftriaxone and IV paracetamol without improvement.
- Blood investigations showed rising levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers. Blood and urine cultures were negative.
- Lumbar puncture was normal along with chest radiograph and abdominal sonar findings.
-The first echocardiogram revealed a structurally normal heart but subsequent echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction (EF) at 10% with global hypokinesia.

Diagnosis:
The initial wide differential diagnosis included viral infections such as HIV seroconversion, acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV); bacterial infections caused by Group A streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, other gram-negative bacteria, rickettsia, leptospirosis or malaria. Non-infectious differential diagnoses considered were Kawasaki-like disease (KD), adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Ultimately, the diagnosis of MIS-C (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children) was made based on the elevated temperature, rising inflammatory markers, and cardiac involvement.

Therapeutic Intervention:
- Intravenous fluid boluses were administered initially but discontinued due to no significant response.
- Empiric antibiotic treatment with doxycycline and ceftriaxone.
- Hydrocortisone was started but later discontinued due to concern for infection.
- Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was initiated along with a dobutamine infusion and diuresis to counter fluid overload.
- IV methylprednisolone pulse therapy was given for three days.
- Colchicine added for possible associated myopericarditis.
- Aspirin and enoxaparin were added for thrombotic risk.

Follow-up and Outcomes:
The patient showed clinical improvement with resolution of symptoms. Repeat echocardiogram showed improved EF. Prednisone was tapered down over time. The patient recovered fully without residual symptoms.
