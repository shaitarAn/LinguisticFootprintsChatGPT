Case 2: Mr. JM, a 45-year-old male from the rural village of Kibwezi, presented to the clinic with complaints of progressive weakness and difficulty walking. He reported that his symptoms started approximately six months ago and have been gradually worsening since then. Mr. JM is married with three children and works as a farmer.

Upon further inquiry, it was revealed that Mr. JM had no significant medical history or previous hospitalizations. He denied any history of trauma or exposure to toxic substances. His family history was unremarkable for any neurological disorders.

On physical examination, Mr. JM appeared thin and weak but was fully conscious and oriented to time, place, and person. Neurological examination revealed muscle wasting in both upper and lower limbs, particularly in the proximal muscles such as the shoulders and hips. Muscle strength was significantly reduced in all four limbs (grade 3/5), with associated hypotonia.

Further investigations were conducted to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms. Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests (RFTs), electrolytes, thyroid function tests (TFTs), vitamin B12 levels, folate levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were all within normal limits.

An electromyography (EMG) test was performed which showed evidence of myopathic changes characterized by low amplitude motor unit potentials with early recruitment pattern suggestive of a primary muscle disorder rather than a peripheral neuropathy.

Based on these findings, a muscle biopsy was recommended to confirm the diagnosis suspected to be muscular dystrophy or another myopathy disorder.

During counseling sessions with Mr.JM's family members about potential genetic causes for his condition; it came to light that there is consanguinity between his parents who are first cousins from neighboring villages.

In conclusion, Mr.JM, a 45-year-old male farmer from Kibwezi, presented with progressive weakness and muscle wasting. Initial investigations have ruled out common causes of muscle weakness, and further evaluation with a muscle biopsy is planned to confirm the suspected diagnosis of a primary muscle disorder. The consanguinity between his parents raises the possibility of an underlying genetic cause for his condition. Further genetic testing may be considered in the future to provide more insight into the exact etiology of his symptoms.
