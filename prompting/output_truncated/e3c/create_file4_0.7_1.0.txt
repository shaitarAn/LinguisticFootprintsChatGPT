Case 3: Baby XY, a female infant from the Zulu tribe, was referred to the hospital at 6 hours of age due to a congenital skull defect noticed at birth. The baby was delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 28-year-old para 1 mother. At birth, the baby cried vigorously and weighed 2.8kg. The pregnancy was uncomplicated, and the mother denied any medication use during pregnancy.

Physical examination revealed a large irregularly shaped defect on the vertex of the scalp overlying the parietal bone bilaterally, extending towards the occipital region. The defect measured approximately 9 x 7 cm in size in the midline and extended to approximately 5 x 5 cm in the occipital region. A thin layer of yellowish membrane covered part of the defect. Additionally, low set ears were observed upon examination.

The baby appeared irritable with a tense anterior fontanelle and exhibited signs of respiratory distress. However, other systems examined were unremarkable.

A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible underlying meningitis was made based on clinical findings. The baby received standard care as per protocol including administration of oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics at meningitis doses. Dressings using sofra-tulle and normal saline soaked gauze were applied to promote wound healing.

Over time, respiratory distress subsided and oral feeds were gradually introduced without any complications or intolerance observed.

A multidisciplinary team consisting of neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons collaborated for further management planning. Various imaging studies were performed including a babygram and an abdominopelvic scan which showed normal results.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally from approximately 2 cm behind the anterior fontanelle down to posterior fontanelle resulting in an area measuring approximately 8.3 cm x 5.3 cm. The subcutaneous scalp tissues were not visualized, but the brain in this region was overlaid by the dural meninges. However, no other abnormalities were noted in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum or brainstem structures.

The patient's condition was consistent with aplasia cutis congenita based on imaging findings. Plans for future intervention included raising a flap cover for autologous skin grafting, which would be performed by the burns and plastic unit and neurosurgeons.

After 18 days of hospitalization and successful wound management with oral antibiotics and daily dressing changes, baby XY was discharged home for follow-up at specialty clinics to monitor progress and ensure proper healing of the defect.
