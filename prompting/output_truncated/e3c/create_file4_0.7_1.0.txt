Case 2: Mrs. AB, a 34-year-old female from the Tawana tribe, delivered a full-term male infant at a local hospital via spontaneous vaginal delivery. This was her third pregnancy, and she had two living children. The baby weighed 3.2kg and cried vigorously after birth. However, concerns arose when it was noticed that the baby had absent fingers on both hands.

The mother sought medical attention for her newborn son at the age of 6 hours due to the abnormality in his hands. Throughout her pregnancy, Mrs. AB received regular antenatal care and reported no complications or use of any medications, whether orthodox or herbal remedies. An ultrasound scan performed during the second trimester did not reveal any abnormalities.

The parents of this child were part of a closely-knit community where consanguineous marriages were common practice; in fact, Mrs. AB and Mr. BC were first cousins themselves.

Upon examination by healthcare professionals, it was discovered that besides having absent fingers on both hands, the baby also exhibited other physical anomalies such as an underdeveloped lower jaw (micrognathia) and small ears (microtia). Furthermore, he had difficulty breathing due to narrowing in his upper airway.

Further investigations including genetic testing were initiated to determine the underlying cause of these congenital anomalies observed in Baby XY.

This case highlights the importance of thorough prenatal care and screening for congenital abnormalities even in seemingly uncomplicated pregnancies within consanguineous families like Baby XY's parents belonging to the Tawana tribe.
