A 28-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder was transferred from a local psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt by hanging 4 days prior to admission. She suffered from extensive burns covering a significant portion of her total body surface area (TBSA). The burn injuries involved multiple regions, including her face and neck (6%), both upper extremities (9%), right thigh and lower leg (5%), left thigh (3%), and most of her anterior and posterior trunk (15%). The patient was admitted to the burn unit for specialized care and required multiple surgical interventions for wound management.

Upon admission, the patient presented with signs of significant distress, including agitation, anxiety, and depression, which were exacerbated by her burn injuries. The initial assessment revealed full-thickness burns in approximately 20% of her TBSA, with partial-thickness burns in the remaining affected areas. The burns on her face and neck were particularly concerning due to their potential impact on vital functions such as breathing and eating.

During her 66-day hospitalization, the patient underwent a total of six debridement surgeries to remove necrotic tissue and promote wound healing. Each procedure necessitated meticulous care and attention to prevent infection and further complications. In addition to surgical interventions, the patient received comprehensive wound care, including dressing changes, application of topical agents, and pain management.

Throughout her hospital stay, the patient's psychiatric condition was closely monitored. Collaborative efforts between the burn care team and the psychiatric team were employed to provide appropriate mental health support, medication management, and psychotherapy. The patient's emotional well-being was addressed through regular counseling sessions, ensuring she received the necessary support to cope with the traumatic event and its aftermath.

Physical rehabilitation was initiated early on to prevent contractures and maintain the patient's joint mobility. Physical therapists and occupational therapists collaborated to develop a comprehensive rehabilitation plan tailored to her specific needs. This included range of motion exercises, splinting, and gradual reintroduction to functional activities.

The patient's recovery was slow but progressive. With the combined efforts of the interdisciplinary team, her wounds gradually started to heal, and she showed signs of improved emotional stability. Throughout her hospitalization, her care was focused on wound healing, pain management, prevention of complications, and addressing her mental health needs.

Upon discharge, the patient was referred to an outpatient burn clinic and a long-term psychiatric care facility for continued monitoring and support. The importance of ongoing psychiatric treatment, adherence to wound care instructions, and regular follow-up visits were emphasized to ensure optimal
