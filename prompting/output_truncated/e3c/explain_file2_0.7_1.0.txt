This clinical case describes a patient who presented with various symptoms and signs, leading to a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) in pregnancy. Here is a breakdown of the key information:

Patient background:
- The patient has no known chronic illnesses such as diabetes or hypertension.
- She denies alcohol consumption and smoking.
- There are no apparent symptoms related to the heart, lungs, kidneys, or reproductive system.

Clinical examination findings:
- Wasting (unexplained weight loss), mild pallor (pale appearance), and a tinge of jaundice (yellowing of the skin).
- Well hydrated, not feverish, and no palpable lymph nodes.
- Palmer erythema (redness of the palms), but no clubbing (enlarged fingertips) or parotid enlargement (swelling of salivary glands).
- Normal respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological examinations.
- Grossly distended abdomen with distorted contour in the upper half. Visibly distended veins on the anterior abdominal wall draining away from the umbilicus.
- Enlarged liver below costal margin with hard texture, nodules on its surface. Mild tenderness noted with a bruit heard on auscultation.
- Spleen not palpable but mild ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen) present along with edema in both legs up to mid-shin level.

Pregnancy-related findings:
- Symphysio fundal height measured at 26 cm indicating gestational age around 26 weeks. The fetus was in breech presentation.
- Fetal heart rate was regular at 134 beats per minute.
- Rectal and vaginal examinations were unremarkable.

Laboratory assessments:
Hemoglobin level: 10.3 g/dL
White blood cell count: 10,200 cells/dL
Neutrophils: 59.3%
Lymphocytes: 26.1%
Monocytes: 10.1%
Eosinophils: 2.7%
Platelet count: 350,000/ÂµL
Liver function tests revealed raised GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) levels, while bilirubin was within normal range.
Total protein and albumin levels were low at 44 g/L and 29 g/L, respectively.
INR (international normalized ratio) was elevated at 1.3, indicating impaired blood clotting.
HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) was positive, indicating a hepatitis B infection. HBeAg (hepatitis B e-antigen) was negative with HBV DNA viral load of 126869 IU/mL.
VDRL test for syphilis was positive but TPHA test not performed.
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), a tumor marker, was significantly elevated at >50,000 KU/L.

Imaging:
Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions. Liver size measured around 17.2 cm with mild ascites present.
Pelvic scan confirmed the presence of a fetus aged approximately 27 weeks and three days old with active movements.

Management and outcomes:
The patient received analgesia to manage pain along with furosemide and spironolactone to address fluid retention in the abdomen and legs due to liver dysfunction.
Lamivudine, an antiviral medication for hepatitis B, was added to prevent transmission of the infection from mother to child.
