This clinical case involves a female patient who presented with various symptoms and was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) during pregnancy. The patient had no known chronic illnesses, such as diabetes or hypertension, and denied any alcohol consumption or smoking. She also had no history of Hepatitis infection.

Upon examination, the patient exhibited wasting, mild pallor, and a tinge of jaundice. She appeared well hydrated, had no fever or palpable lymph nodes, but showed signs of palmar erythema. However, there were no clubbing or parotid enlargement observed. The respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.

The abdominal examination revealed gross distention with a distorted contour in the upper half and visibly distended anterior abdominal wall veins draining away from the umbilicus. The liver was enlarged 12cm below the costal margin with a span of 17cm. It was hard with nodular texture and an irregular edge. Mild tenderness was observed along with a bruit on auscultation. The spleen was not palpable but there was mild ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) present along with bipedal edema up to mid-shin.

In terms of obstetric findings, the symphysio fundal height measured 26 cm indicating gestational age while longitudinal lie and breech presentation were noted. Fetal heart rate was regular at 134 bpm.

Laboratory assessment showed hemoglobin levels within normal range (10.3 g/dL), white blood cell count slightly elevated at 10200 cells/dL (with neutrophils comprising majority), platelet count normal at 350000/Î¼L but raised GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) and AST (aspartate transaminase) levels indicating liver dysfunction.

Additional laboratory tests indicated low total protein level (44 g/L) along with low albumin level (29 g/L). INR (international normalized ratio), a measure of blood clotting ability, was slightly elevated at 1.3. HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen) was positive indicating the presence of Hepatitis B infection, while HBeAg (Hepatitis B e antigen) was negative. The viral load of HBV DNA was measured to be 126869 IU/mL. VDRL test for syphilis came back positive but TPHA (Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay) test was not performed. Alphafetoprotein (AFP) levels were found to be significantly elevated at >50000 KU/L.

The abdominal ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions, confirming the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma. The liver size measured 17.2 cm and mild ascites were also observed on the scan.

A revised diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation in pregnancy was made based on these findings.

Management for this patient included analgesia to alleviate pain, as well as furosemide and spironolactone to address fluid accumulation caused by liver dysfunction and portal hypertension associated with advanced cirrhosis.

Additionally, lamivudine, an antiretroviral medication used against HIV and hepatitis B infection, was added to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B during childbirth.

The initial plan was to allow the pregnancy to continue until at least 32 completed weeks in order to improve neonatal survival chances. However, due to progressive abdominal pain that became unbearable for the patient, the pregnancy had to be terminated at 30 weeks and 3 days through successful induction of labor.

Unfortunately, the outcome resulted in a fresh stillbirth weighing 1.2 kg. Post-delivery pain markedly reduced and after five days in hospital care she was discharged home. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up visit at the gastrointestinal clinic.

The patient attended the clinic at 2 and 4 weeks post-discharge but was
