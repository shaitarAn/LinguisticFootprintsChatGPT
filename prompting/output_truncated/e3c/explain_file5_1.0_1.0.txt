This clinical case describes a young patient who presented with a variety of symptoms and was ultimately diagnosed with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), which is associated with COVID-19. 

The patient had no significant medical history, surgeries, or drug use, but had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal. On examination, the patient was ill-looking and had a maculopapular rash on several areas of the body, conjunctivitis, and other symptoms such as fever and tachycardia.

Initial diagnostic assessments included blood investigations that showed elevated markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers. However, blood cultures and other tests were negative.

The differential diagnosis considered various viral and bacterial infections but also non-infectious conditions like Kawasaki-like disease or systemic lupus erythematosus.

Despite initial treatment with antibiotics and paracetamol without improvement, the patient's condition worsened over time. A repeat echocardiogram revealed significant heart abnormalities including reduced ejection fraction and pericardial effusion. Based on serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at this point in the course of illness confirmed acute infection preceded by antibodies against spike protein.

Treatment involved intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) over 72 hours along with supportive measures like dobutamine infusion to support cardiac function. Intravenous methylprednisolone was given for three days for its anti-inflammatory effects.

Over time, the patient's condition improved clinically with decreasing inflammatory markers. Other medications like colchicine were added to manage possible associated myopericarditis. The patient was discharged on a tapering dose of prednisone along with aspirin.

At follow-up appointments two weeks later, the patient had fully recovered with no residual symptoms. Follow-up echocardiography showed significant improvement in heart function.

This case highlights the importance of considering MIS-C in children who present with acute febrile illness and multi-organ involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment can lead to good outcomes, as seen in this case.
