This clinical case describes a 17-year-old African male who presented to the hospital with various symptoms. He had a one-week history of fever, generalized rash on the body and eyelids, intermittent headache with neck pain, sore throat, dry cough, and a day history of diarrhea. The patient had no prior medical admissions or surgeries and did not report any significant medication or recreational drug use.

Upon examination, the patient appeared ill with abnormal vital signs including a low blood pressure (103/44 mmHg), elevated heart rate (123 beats per minute), and high temperature (39.5Â°C). He had a generalized maculopapular rash on his torso, limbs, hands' palmar surface, as well as erythematous desquamating lesions over the eyelids with bilateral conjunctivitis. His abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal.

The diagnostic assessment included blood investigations which revealed rising levels of CRP (C-reactive protein), PCT (procalcitonin), WCC (white cell count), ferritin, LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), and D-dimers. However, blood and urine cultures remained negative. Other tests performed such as lumbar puncture (including viral panel) showed normal results along with chest radiograph and abdominal sonar.

The initial differential diagnoses considered were viral infections such as HIV seroconversion or acute infections caused by EBV (Epstein-Barr virus), HSV (herpes simplex virus), or CMV(cytomegalovirus). Bacterial infections caused by Group A streptococci or Neisseria meningitidis were also considered along with other gram-negative bacteria,rickettsial diseases like leptospirosis or malaria infection.They also considered non-infectious causes such as Kawasaki-like disease(KD) , adult onset still's disease(AOSD)and systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE).

Therapeutic intervention involved giving fluid boluses of crystalloid, and monitoring urine output and lactate levels as markers of tissue hypoperfusion. Antibiotic treatment with doxycycline for rickettsial disease and ceftriaxone was continued. Hydrocortisone was initially started but then discontinued due to infection concerns. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), dobutamine infusion, diuresis, and IV methylprednisolone pulse were administered to address the patient's worsening cardiac condition. The patient also received aspirin and enoxaparin for thrombotic risk.

The patient showed improvement over time with a decrease in fever, inflammatory markers, LDH, and ferritin levels. A repeat echocardiogram revealed improved heart function with a higher ejection fraction (EF). The patient was discharged on prednisone, aspirin, and colchicine.

During follow-up in the rheumatology outpatient clinic two weeks later, the patient had fully recovered with no residual symptoms. His repeated echocardiogram showed further improvement in heart function. The prednisone dosage was gradually decreased over four weeks before discontinuation.

Overall, it seems that this case involves an initially healthy 17-year-old male who presented with multiple symptoms including fever,rash,bodyache which led to suspected diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children(MIS-C) based on clinical presentation alongwith high CRP,PCT,ferritin levels alongwith low EF on echocardiography however other differentials also considered.Hence appropriate interventions were initiated including intravenous medications,and combination therapies which resulted in clinical
