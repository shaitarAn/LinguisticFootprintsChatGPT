Upon further examination, the patient's medical history revealed that she had been diagnosed with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) shortly after birth. SWS is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the presence of a port-wine stain birthmark on the face, typically affecting the upper eyelid and forehead. It is also associated with abnormalities in the blood vessels of the brain, leading to various neurological symptoms.

The patient's primary complaint was the persistent and frequent occurrence of non-pulsating headaches over the past two years. These headaches were not accompanied by any nausea or aura-like symptoms, and they were relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The pain was described as bilateral, generalized, and pressing in quality, lasting for several hours at a time. The absence of worsening symptoms with physical activity was a notable finding.

In addition to her headaches, the patient had a history of seizures that began on the fifteenth day of life. These seizures were described as tonic-clonic contractions, which are characterized by sudden and violent muscle contractions followed by loss of consciousness. The presence of seizures at such an early age was a significant indicator of SWS, prompting the diagnosis.

Sturge-Weber Syndrome is a complex disorder that affects multiple systems in the body. It is primarily caused by a somatic mutation in the GNAQ gene, leading to abnormal development of blood vessels in the brain, skin, and eyes. The characteristic port-wine stain birthmark is a result of dilated blood vessels in the affected area.

The neurological manifestations of SWS can vary widely among individuals. In addition to seizures and headaches, patients may experience developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, visual impairments, and motor abnormalities. The severity and progression of symptoms can also vary, making each case unique.

Given the patient's history of seizures and the presence of headaches, further investigations were warranted to assess the extent of her neurological involvement. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, which revealed the classic findings associated with SWS. The imaging showed leptomeningeal angiomas, which are abnormal blood vessels on the surface of the brain, as well as cortical atrophy, indicating loss of brain tissue.

The treatment approach for SWS is multidisciplinary, involving a team of specialists including neurologists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, and geneticists. The primary goal of treatment is to manage the symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life. In the case of headaches, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may provide temporary relief, but long-term management may require the use of preventive medications such as beta-blockers or antiepileptic drugs.

Seizure control is another crucial aspect of managing SWS. Antiepileptic medications are commonly prescribed to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures. In some cases, surgical intervention may be considered to remove or disconnect the affected brain tissue responsible for the seizures.

Regular follow-up appointments and monitoring are essential to track the progression of symptoms and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Genetic counseling may also be offered to the patient and her family to discuss the risk of passing on the condition to future generations.

In conclusion, the 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome presented with a history of frequent non-pulsating headaches and a previous diagnosis of seizures. The presence of these symptoms, along with the characteristic port-wine stain birthmark and the findings on brain imaging, confirmed the diagnosis of SWS. A multidisciplinary approach involving
