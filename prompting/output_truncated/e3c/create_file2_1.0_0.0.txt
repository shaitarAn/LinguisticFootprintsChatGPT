A 42-year-old male office worker, with no prior medical history, presented to our facility with a three-month history of epigastric abdominal pain. The pain was gradual in onset, dull, and persistent. Over the past few months, the intensity of the pain had gradually increased, though the patient could not identify any specific factors that exacerbated or relieved the symptoms. He reported sporadic radiation of the pain to his chest, which occasionally caused mild discomfort. 

Aside from the abdominal pain, the patient also noticed significant weight loss over the past three months. However, he denied experiencing any early satiety, jaundice, fever, itch, or spontaneous bleeding. There was no history of blood transfusion, and the patient had been taking his routine multivitamin from the pharmacy. 

Upon further inquiry, the patient described occasional indigestion and mild heartburn following heavy meals. He admitted to consuming a diet rich in fatty and processed foods, as well as an unhealthy amount of carbonated beverages. However, he denied any excessive alcohol intake or tobacco use.

The patient's vital signs were within normal range with a blood pressure of 124/78 mmHg, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F). Physical examination revealed tenderness upon palpation in the epigastric region, without any rebound or guarding. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed normoactive bowel sounds with no audible bruits. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Given the clinical presentation, the differential diagnoses included gastric ulcers, gastritis, and even pancreatic cancer. Further investigations were warranted to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. Blood tests, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and pancreatic enzymes, were ordered. Results revealed anemia with low hemoglobin levels and a slightly elevated liver enzyme, alanine aminotransferase (ALT).

To further evaluate the patient's symptoms, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was scheduled. The procedure identified an ulcerated mass in the stomach, near the lesser curvature. Biopsy samples were obtained for histopathological analysis, and the patient was commenced on a proton pump inhibitor to alleviate symptoms temporarily.

Histopathological examination of the biopsy samples revealed adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Following a multidisciplinary approach, the patient was referred to an oncologist for further management. Staging investigations, including computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, were conducted to determine the extent of the disease. Unfortunately, the CT scan identified metastatic lesions in the liver, indicating advanced-stage gastric cancer.

Given the stage of the disease and the patient's overall health, a palliative approach was discussed with the patient and his family. Symptomatic management was initiated, focusing on pain control and improving the patient's quality of life. The patient was referred to a palliative care team to provide holistic support during this difficult period.

In summary, a 42-year-old male office worker presented with a three-month history of epigastric abdominal pain and weight loss. Evaluation revealed the presence of an ulcerated mass in the stomach, which was subsequently determined to be advanced-stage gastric cancer with hepatic metastasis. A palliative care approach was initiated to provide the patient with the best possible support and symptom management.
