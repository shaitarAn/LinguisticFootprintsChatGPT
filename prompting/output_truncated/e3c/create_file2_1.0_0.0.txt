A 47-year-old male accountant with a history of hypertension and obesity presented to our clinic with a complaint of chronic abdominal pain. The pain had been bothering him for the past 4 months, gradually increasing in intensity. The patient described the pain as a dull ache, persisting throughout the day without any significant relief. Interestingly, he noted occasional radiation of the pain to his back.

During this period, the patient had experienced an unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds. However, he denied any associated symptoms such as early satiety, jaundice, fever, itch, or spontaneous bleeding. Notably, there was no history of recent blood transfusions.

Upon further investigation, the patient revealed that he had been compliant with his prescribed antihypertensive medications but was not currently taking any over-the-counter pain relievers. He denied any history of excessive alcohol consumption or illicit drug use.

Physical examination revealed a slightly overweight patient with stable vital signs. Upon palpation, mild tenderness was elicited in the epigastric region, but no guarding or rigidity was present. There were no signs of hepatosplenomegaly or jaundice. The remainder of the systemic examination was unremarkable.

Given the patient's history of hypertension and obesity, as well as the presence of chronic abdominal pain with weight loss, the initial differential diagnosis includes conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatic pathology (such as chronic pancreatitis), or malignancy.

Further investigations were ordered, including laboratory tests, such as complete blood count, liver function tests, pancreatic enzymes, and a lipid profile. Imaging studies, such as an abdominal ultrasound and possibly a computed tomography (CT) scan, were also planned to better evaluate the patient's abdominal structures.

Appropriate management was initiated, focusing on pain relief, addressing any underlying conditions, and providing supportive care. The patient was advised to follow a healthy diet, avoid trigger foods, and adhere to his blood pressure management regimen.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor the patient's symptoms, evaluate the results of laboratory and imaging studies, and reassess the treatment plan accordingly. Close collaboration with a multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterology and radiology specialists, was also coordinated for a comprehensive and holistic approach to the patient's care.

This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough clinical assessment, diligent investigations, and prompt management to ensure the accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of patients presenting with such symptoms.
