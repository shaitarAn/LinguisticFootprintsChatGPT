A 42-year-old female accountant gravida 2 para 1 at 34 weeks gestation presented to our facility. She complained of a 4-month history of upper abdominal pain, which was gradual in onset, persistent, and crampy. The pain had progressively worsened over time, with no relieving or aggravating factors, but intermittent radiation to her back. She denied any significant weight loss, early satiety, jaundice, fever, itch, or spontaneous bleeding. The patient had no history of blood transfusion and was compliant with her routine prenatal vitamins from the antenatal clinic. She had no known chronic illnesses, was a non-smoker, and did not consume alcohol. There were no respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurological symptoms. On examination, she appeared well-nourished, with no signs of pallor or jaundice. She was afebrile, well-hydrated, and had no palpable lymph nodes. Abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen with a visibly engorged vein running across the upper half of her abdomen. The liver was palpable, enlarged 10 cm below the costal margin, and had a nodular texture. There was mild tenderness on palpation, but no bruit was detected. The spleen was not palpable, and no ascites or edema was noted. The fundal height measured at 34 cm, corresponding to the gestational age, with a cephalic presentation. Fetal heart rate was 140 bpm and regular. Rectal and vaginal examinations were unremarkable. 

Based on the clinical presentation and findings, a presumptive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in pregnancy was made. Laboratory evaluations revealed a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL, white blood cell count of 8,900 cells/dL, with normal differentials. Platelet count was within normal limits. Liver function tests showed elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) but normal bilirubin levels. Total protein and albumin levels were within normal range. Coagulation profile demonstrated a prolonged INR of 1.5. Initial viral screening, including HIV and Hepatitis C, were negative. However, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was positive, and the HBV DNA level was 57,231 IU/mL. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were significantly elevated, measuring at 48,000 ng/mL. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions, measuring 15 cm in size. No evidence of ascites was found. A revised diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of cirrhosis and decompensation during pregnancy was made.

The patient was managed with analgesics for pain relief, as well as close monitoring of liver function, fetal well-being, and fluid balance. Lamivudine was initiated to prevent the transmission of hepatitis B to the newborn. The plan was to continue the pregnancy until at least 37 weeks to optimize neonatal outcomes, but due to the worsening pain and compromised maternal condition, an elective cesarean section was performed at 35 weeks. A live-born female neonate weighing 2.4 kg was delivered with no immediate
