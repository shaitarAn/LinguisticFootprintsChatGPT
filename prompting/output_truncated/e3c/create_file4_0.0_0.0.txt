Case 2: Mr. JM, a 45-year-old male from the rural village of Zalika, presented to the local health clinic with complaints of progressive weakness and difficulty walking. He reported that these symptoms had been present for the past six months and had gradually worsened over time. Mr. JM was previously healthy and had no significant medical history. He denied any recent illnesses or injuries.

Upon further questioning, Mr. JM revealed that he had noticed a change in his gait, with a tendency to drag his right foot while walking. He also mentioned experiencing occasional numbness and tingling in his right leg. He denied any bladder or bowel dysfunction, visual disturbances, or cognitive changes. There was no family history of similar symptoms.

On physical examination, Mr. JM appeared well-nourished and in no acute distress. His vital signs were within normal limits. Neurological examination revealed decreased muscle strength in the right lower limb, with a power of 4/5 compared to the left side. Deep tendon reflexes were brisk bilaterally, and plantar reflexes were extensor on the right side. Sensory examination showed decreased pinprick sensation in the right leg, extending from the knee down to the foot.

Given the progressive nature of his symptoms and the presence of neurological deficits, Mr. JM was referred to a tertiary care hospital for further evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine was performed, which revealed multiple hyperintense lesions in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord, consistent with demyelination.

Further laboratory investigations were conducted to determine the underlying cause of the demyelinating process. Complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, and thyroid function tests were all within normal limits. Serum vitamin B12 levels were also normal. However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed an elevated protein level and the presence of oligoclonal bands, suggestive of an inflammatory process.

Based on the clinical presentation, radiological findings, and CSF analysis, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) was made. Mr. JM was started on disease-modifying therapy to slow the progression of the disease and manage his symptoms. He was also referred to a physiotherapist for gait training and strengthening exercises.

During subsequent follow-up visits, Mr. JM reported a gradual improvement in his symptoms. His muscle strength in the right leg improved to 4+/5, and he experienced fewer episodes of numbness and tingling. Repeat MRI scans showed a reduction in the number and size of the demyelinating lesions.

In conclusion, Mr. JM presented with progressive weakness and difficulty walking, which were attributed to demyelination of the central nervous system. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was made based on clinical, radiological, and CSF findings. With appropriate treatment and rehabilitation, Mr. JM experienced a positive response and improvement in his symptoms. Regular monitoring and adherence to therapy were emphasized to ensure optimal long-term outcomes.
