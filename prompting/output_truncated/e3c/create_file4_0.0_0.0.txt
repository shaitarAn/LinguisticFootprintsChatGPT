Case 2: Mr. JM, a 45-year-old male from the rural village of Zalika, presented to the local clinic with complaints of progressive weakness and difficulty walking. He reported a history of unexplained falls and noticed a gradual decline in his ability to perform daily activities over the past six months. Mr. JM had no significant past medical history and denied any use of medications or herbal remedies.

Upon physical examination, Mr. JM appeared thin and frail. Neurological examination revealed muscle weakness and atrophy, particularly in the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished, and there was evidence of sensory loss in a stocking-glove distribution. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable.

Further investigation revealed that Mr. JM was the second child of parents who were first cousins. His parents belonged to the same small community in Zalika, where consanguineous marriages were common. Mr. JM's mother had an uneventful pregnancy, and there were no reported complications during delivery. He was born at term and weighed 3.5kg. However, his parents did recall that he had delayed motor milestones during infancy.

Given the clinical presentation and consanguineous background, a suspicion of a genetic disorder was raised. Genetic testing was performed, and the results confirmed the diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). CMT is a hereditary neuropathy characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, typically affecting the distal extremities.

Mr. JM was referred to a neurologist for further management and genetic counseling. The neurologist recommended physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and improve mobility. Additionally, Mr. JM and his family were educated about the genetic nature of CMT and the potential risks of consanguineous marriages in their community.

In conclusion, Mr. JM presented with progressive weakness and difficulty walking, ultimately diagnosed as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. This case highlights the importance of considering genetic disorders in patients with consanguineous backgrounds and emphasizes the need for genetic counseling and education within affected communities.
