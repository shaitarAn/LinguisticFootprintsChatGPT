Case 3: baby XY, a female infant from the Mbuti tribe, was delivered at term in a hospital by spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 28-year-old primigravida mother. The baby cried vigorously at birth and weighed 2.8kg. She was referred at the age of 6 hours due to a noticeable absence of skin and skull bone. The pregnancy was closely monitored and uneventful, and the mother denied the use of any medications, both orthodox and herbal, throughout her pregnancy. Ultrasound scans performed during the second and third trimesters showed no abnormalities. The parents were not related and had no family history of congenital anomalies.

Upon physical examination, a large irregularly shaped defect was observed on the vertex of the scalp, extending over the parietal and occipital regions. The defect measured 9 x 7 cm in the midline and 5 x 5 cm in the occipital region. A thin yellow membrane covered the exposed area. The baby had low set ears, was irritable, and exhibited a tense anterior fontanelle. Respiratory distress was also noted. However, the examination of other systems revealed no abnormalities. A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis was made.

The baby received routine care according to the hospital's protocol, including oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics at meningitis doses. The wound was dressed with sofra-tulle and normal saline soaked gauze. The respiratory distress gradually subsided, and the baby tolerated oral feeds well. A multidisciplinary team, including neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons, was involved in the management of the case. Babygram and abdominopelvic scans were performed and showed no abnormalities. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally, extending from 2 cm behind the anterior fontanelle down to the posterior fontanelle. The defect measured 8.3 cm x 5.3 cm (AP X TR). The subcutaneous scalp tissues were not visualized, but the brain in this region was overlaid by the dural meninges. The occipital, frontal, and temporal bones of the cranial vault, as well as their overlying scalp tissues, were unaffected. The cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brain stem structures appeared normal in morphology and signal intensity. No masses or collections were observed, and no abnormal enhancement was seen. The cortical sulci, sylvian fissures, basal cisterns, and ventricles appeared normal in calibre, outline, and intensity. The orbits and retro-orbital structures were within normal limits. The final conclusion was consistent with aplasia cutis congenita.

The burns and plastic unit, along with the neurosurgeons, planned for future intervention in the form of raising a flap cover for autologous skin grafting. After 18 days of admission, the baby was discharged home on oral antibiotics and daily wound dressing, with scheduled follow-up appointments at the specialty clinics.
