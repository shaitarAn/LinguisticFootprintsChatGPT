Case 3: baby XZ, from the Igbo tribe, was brought to the hospital at 6 hours of age due to a concerning finding noticed at birth. The baby was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 28-year-old primigravida mother. At birth, the baby weighed 2.8kg and cried vigorously. The pregnancy was closely monitored and uneventful, with the mother denying any use of medications during pregnancy.

On physical examination, a noticeable defect was observed on the scalp over the frontal and parietal bones, measuring approximately 7 x 5 cm. The defect had an irregular shape and was covered by a yellowish membrane. Additionally, the baby had low set ears and a tense anterior fontanelle. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Given the findings, a diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita was considered. The baby was immediately started on routine care, including oxygen supplementation, intravenous fluids, and antibiotic therapy to prevent meningitis. The wound was dressed with appropriate dressings soaked in normal saline.

Further investigations were conducted to assess the extent of the condition. A babygram and an abdominopelvic scan were performed and showed no abnormalities. However, due to financial constraints, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could not be done.

The multidisciplinary team, consisting of neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons, was involved in the management of the baby. Plans were made for future intervention, including raising a flap cover for autologous skin grafting. The baby remained in the hospital for 18 days, receiving oral antibiotics and daily wound dressing. The parents were provided with instructions for follow-up at specialty clinics.

In conclusion, baby XZ presented with aplasia cutis congenita, a condition characterized by the absence of skin and skull bone. The interdisciplinary team worked together to provide appropriate care and planned for future interventions to improve the baby's condition.
