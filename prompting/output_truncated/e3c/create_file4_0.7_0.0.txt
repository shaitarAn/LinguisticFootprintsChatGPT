Case 2: Mr. JW, a 55-year-old male from the rural town of Kibowa, presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. He was brought in by his son, who noticed that his father was becoming increasingly weak and unable to eat or drink.

The patient had a past medical history significant for diabetes and hypertension, both of which were well-controlled with medications. He denied any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. His family history was unremarkable, with no known consanguineous relationships.

On physical examination, Mr. JW appeared pale, sweaty, and in significant distress. His vital signs showed a fever of 39.5°C (103.1°F), heart rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. His abdomen was distended and tender to palpation, with guarding and rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant.

Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 18,000/mm³ (reference range: 4,500-11,000/mm³) with a left shift, indicating an acute infection. His blood glucose level was slightly elevated at 160 mg/dL (reference range: 70-140 mg/dL), consistent with his known history of diabetes. Other routine blood tests, including liver and renal function, were within normal limits.

Based on the clinical presentation and examination findings, a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. Mr. JW was immediately started on intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential intra-abdominal infection. An urgent surgical consultation was also requested.

An abdominal ultrasound was performed, revealing a dilated appendix with thickened walls and the presence of peri-appendiceal fluid collection. These findings were consistent with acute appendicitis. The surgical team confirmed the diagnosis and the patient was taken to the operating room for an emergency appendectomy.

During the surgery, the appendix was found to be severely inflamed and perforated. A thorough abdominal washout was performed, and the appendix was safely removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the surgical ward for post-operative care.

In the post-operative period, Mr. JW received intravenous antibiotics for five days to complete a course of treatment. He was closely monitored for any signs of infection or complications. His pain gradually subsided, and he was able to tolerate a regular diet without any issues. His blood glucose levels were closely monitored and managed with his usual antidiabetic medications.

On the fifth post-operative day, Mr. JW's vital signs stabilized, and he showed signs of clinical improvement. He was discharged home with appropriate post-operative instructions and a follow-up appointment scheduled with the surgical team.

This case highlights the importance of prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention in cases of acute appendicitis. Early recognition of the signs and symptoms, along with appropriate investigations, can lead to successful management and a favorable outcome for the patient.
