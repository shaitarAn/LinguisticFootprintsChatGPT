Clinical Case: A 35-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of chronic migraine admitted to our clinic. He presented with a 5-year history of recurrent headaches. The patient reported experiencing pulsating headaches, which were typically unilateral and localized to the right temple region. The intensity of the pain ranged from moderate to severe, often leading to disruption in his daily activities.

The patient had tried various over-the-counter analgesics, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, but found minimal relief. Triptans were also ineffective in alleviating his symptoms. Unlike tension-type headaches, physical activity did not exacerbate his pain.

There were no associated symptoms like nausea or vomiting accompanying the headache attacks. Additionally, he denied any visual disturbances or sensory changes preceding or during the episodes.

The family history for headache disorders was positive; both his mother and sister experienced similar migraine-like symptoms. However, there was no significant medical history apart from occasional episodes of stress-related anxiety.

Upon further investigation into his medical records, it was discovered that he had a previous diagnosis of depression and had been prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for management.

During physical examination, no abnormalities were noted except for mild tenderness upon palpation over the right temple area during an active headache episode.

Based on these findings and in accordance with International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) criteria for chronic migraine without aura, a diagnosis of chronic migraine was made.

Treatment options discussed included lifestyle modifications such as regular sleep patterns and stress reduction techniques. Pharmacological interventions involving preventive medications like beta-blockers or tricyclic antidepressants were also considered due to their efficacy in managing chronic migraines.

In conclusion, this case highlights a 35-year-old male patient presenting with recurrent pulsating headaches localized to the right temple region consistent with chronic migraines without aura. Family history played a significant role in supporting this diagnosis while ruling out other potential causes. The patient's treatment plan will focus on a multidisciplinary approach, combining lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy to effectively manage his chronic migraine symptoms.
