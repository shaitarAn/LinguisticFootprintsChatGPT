Clinical Case: A 35-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of Migraine presenting with chronic headaches admitted to our clinic. He had a 5-year history of frequent pulsating headaches. The patient reported that his headache was partially relieved with over-the-counter pain medications, but the intensity and frequency of the headaches had been progressively worsening over time. There were no specific triggers identified for his headaches, and they were not associated with any physical activity.

The patient complained of occasional nausea during severe episodes but denied experiencing any aura-like symptoms preceding the onset of his headaches. The duration of each headache episode varied from a few hours to several days, significantly impacting his daily activities and overall quality of life. The pain was predominantly unilateral, localized around the temple area, and described as throbbing in nature.

Upon further inquiry into family history, it was revealed that both his mother and sister also suffered from migraines; however, there were no other significant medical conditions reported within the family.

In addition to chronic migraines, the patient disclosed a past medical history of depression and anxiety disorder for which he had been receiving treatment for several years. He denied any recent changes in medication or therapy sessions that could potentially explain an exacerbation in his migraine symptoms.

During physical examination, no abnormalities were noted except for mild tenderness upon palpation over the temporal region bilaterally. Neurological examination findings were within normal limits without any focal deficits or signs suggestive of increased intracranial pressure.

Further investigations included routine blood tests which revealed no significant abnormalities including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests (RFTs), electrolytes panel, thyroid function tests (TFTs), and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.

Based on clinical presentation consistent with chronic migraines along with negative findings on physical examination and routine laboratory investigations ruling out secondary causes such as infection or inflammation, a diagnosis of chronic migraine was made.

The patient was started on a prophylactic medication regimen consisting of a beta-blocker (propranolol) and advised to maintain a headache diary to monitor the frequency, duration, and severity of his headaches. Additionally, he was educated about lifestyle modifications including regular sleep patterns, stress reduction techniques, and dietary changes that may help in managing his migraines.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled to assess the response to treatment and make any necessary adjustments in the management plan. The patient was also referred for psychological counseling to address any underlying emotional factors that could potentially contribute to his migraine symptoms.

In conclusion, this case highlights the clinical presentation of a 35-year-old male patient with chronic migraines. It emphasizes the importance of thorough history-taking, physical examination findings, and appropriate investigations in reaching an accurate diagnosis. Migraine management involves both pharmacological interventions for acute attacks as well as preventive measures tailored to each individual's needs. A multidisciplinary approach involving healthcare professionals from various specialties is crucial in providing comprehensive care for patients suffering from chronic migraines.
