On examination, the patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient appeared fatigued but was alert and oriented. There were no signs of respiratory distress or meningismus.

The physical examination revealed a diffuse maculopapular rash over the trunk, extremities, and face, including the eyelids. The rash was non-blanching and not pruritic. The throat examination showed mild erythema without exudates or tonsillar enlargement. Neck stiffness was noted upon flexion but there were no focal neurological deficits.

Laboratory investigations showed leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.2 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4-11 x 10^9/L) with lymphopenia (0.8 x10^9/L; normal range:1-4 x10^9/L). Platelet count was within normal limits at 200 x10^9/L (normal range:150-450 x10^9/L). Liver function tests demonstrated mild elevation in liver enzymes with alanine transaminase (ALT) of 68 U/L (normal range: <40 U/L) and aspartate transaminase (AST) of 56 U/L (normal range:<40 U/L).

Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, further investigations were initiated to determine the cause of these symptoms.

A nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test was performed to rule out COVID-19 infection due to the ongoing pandemic. Additionally, serological tests for viral infections including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were requested.

The patient was started on supportive care, including intravenous fluids and antipyretics to manage his symptoms. Isolation precautions were implemented in accordance with hospital protocols until infectious etiologies could be ruled out.

Further clinical evaluation and investigations are required to establish the definitive diagnosis and guide appropriate management for this patient.
