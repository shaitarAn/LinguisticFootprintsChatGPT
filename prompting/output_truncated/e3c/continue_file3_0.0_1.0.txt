During his hospitalization, the patient received extensive wound care and underwent multiple skin grafting procedures to promote healing and prevent infection. The medical team closely monitored his vital signs, administered pain medication, and provided psychological support to address the underlying mental health issues that contributed to his suicide attempt.

The initial debridement surgeries were performed to remove necrotic tissue and prepare the wounds for grafting. The burns on his face and neck required delicate care due to their sensitive nature. Special attention was given to ensure proper healing of these areas, as they can significantly impact a person's physical appearance and self-esteem.

As the patient's condition stabilized, he was gradually introduced to physical therapy sessions aimed at improving mobility in his upper extremities and lower limbs. These sessions included exercises designed to increase range of motion, strengthen muscles, and prevent contractures from forming.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient received comprehensive psychiatric evaluations by a multidisciplinary team consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and nurses specializing in mental health care. They worked together with the burn unit staff to develop an individualized treatment plan that addressed both his physical injuries and mental health needs.

In addition to regular counseling sessions focused on coping strategies for managing depression and anxiety related to body image changes resulting from burn injuries, the patient was prescribed appropriate psychotropic medications under close supervision by psychiatrists. This integrated approach aimed at addressing both aspects of his condition helped facilitate a more holistic recovery process.

As time progressed, significant improvements were observed in both the physical healing of the burns as well as in the patient's mental well-being. He began participating in group therapy sessions with other burn survivors where he found solace in sharing experiences with individuals who had gone through similar challenges.

After 66 days of intensive treatment and rehabilitation efforts within a supportive environment that prioritized both physical recovery and psychological well-being, it was determined that he could be discharged from the hospital. However, follow-up appointments with his mental health care team and burn specialists were scheduled to ensure continued progress and provide ongoing support.

The patient's journey from a mentally ill individual who attempted suicide by fire to someone on the path of recovery was a testament to the dedication and expertise of the medical professionals involved. It highlighted the importance of an integrated approach that addresses both physical and mental health needs in order to achieve optimal outcomes for patients with complex conditions.
