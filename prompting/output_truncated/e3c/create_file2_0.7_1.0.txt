Clinical Case: A 42-year-old male office worker presented to our facility with a chief complaint of epigastric abdominal pain persisting for the past two months. The pain had gradually intensified, becoming dull and persistent. The patient reported no specific triggers or relieving factors but mentioned occasional radiation to his chest.

Upon further inquiry, the patient revealed that he had experienced significant weight loss over the past few months without any associated symptoms such as early satiety, jaundice, fever, itchiness or spontaneous bleeding. He denied any history of blood transfusion and reported compliance with his routine hematinic supplements prescribed by his primary care physician.

The patient's medical history was unremarkable except for a diagnosis of hypertension that was well-controlled with medication. He denied any known allergies and had no family history of gastrointestinal diseases. Socially, he consumed alcohol occasionally but denied using tobacco or recreational drugs.

On physical examination, the patient appeared slightly pale but otherwise in stable condition. His vital signs were within normal limits and he displayed no signs of distress or acute illness. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness on palpation in the epigastric region without guarding or rebound tenderness.

Given these findings, initial diagnostic tests were ordered to ascertain the cause of the patient's symptoms and weight loss. Laboratory investigations revealed mild normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 11g/dL) along with normal liver function tests (bilirubin level within normal range). Tumor markers including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were also within normal limits.

To further evaluate his condition, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed which showed diffuse erythematous mucosa in the gastric body along with reduced rugal folds compared to previous endoscopic images from two years ago when he underwent screening due to reflux symptoms at that time.

Biopsy samples were obtained from the gastric mucosa, which revealed chronic gastritis with no evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection or dysplasia. Given the persistent abdominal pain and weight loss, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was conducted to assess for any structural abnormalities.

The CT scan showed a thickened gastric wall with irregularities and focal nodular enhancement in the antrum region. There were no signs of lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis. Based on these findings, a multidisciplinary team including gastroenterologists and surgeons concluded that further investigation was warranted.

In summary, this case presents a 42-year-old male office worker with chronic epigastric abdominal pain and significant weight loss. Initial investigations revealed mild normocytic anemia without any hepatic dysfunction. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy demonstrated diffuse erythematous mucosa in the gastric body and reduced rugal folds compared to previous images. Biopsy results indicated chronic gastritis without Helicobacter pylori infection or dysplasia. The CT scan displayed thickening of the gastric wall with focal nodular enhancement in the antrum region, prompting further evaluation by specialists.

Further diagnostic tests such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or positron emission tomography (PET) may be considered to determine if there is any underlying malignancy causing these symptoms; however, additional investigations are necessary before reaching a definitive diagnosis and initiating appropriate management for this patient's condition.
