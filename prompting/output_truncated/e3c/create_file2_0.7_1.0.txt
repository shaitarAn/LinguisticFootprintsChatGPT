A 42-year-old male accountant, gravida 0 para 0, presented to our clinic with a chief complaint of persistent epigastric abdominal pain for the past four months. The pain had a gradual onset and was described as dull in nature. Over time, it had progressively worsened without any identifiable relieving or aggravating factors. The patient also reported occasional radiation of the pain to his chest.

In addition to the abdominal pain, he mentioned experiencing significant weight loss during this period. However, he denied any associated symptoms such as early satiety, jaundice, fever, itchiness or spontaneous bleeding. The patient had no history of blood transfusion and was not taking any regular medications.

Upon further inquiry into his medical history and lifestyle habits, it was revealed that the patient had been a heavy smoker for over ten years but quit smoking six months ago due to concerns about his health.

On physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness on palpation in the epigastric region without any signs of peritonitis or organomegaly. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable.

Given the patient's persistent epigastric abdominal pain along with weight loss and a history of heavy smoking in the recent past, further investigations were ordered to evaluate potential causes. A complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), and renal function tests (RFTs) were performed which all showed results within normal limits.

To determine if there could be an underlying gastrointestinal cause for these symptoms, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was scheduled for further evaluation of his upper digestive tract including esophagus and stomach.

Pending those results and considering other differential diagnoses such as gastritis or peptic ulcer disease related to his previous smoking habit; malignancy-related conditions like gastric cancer; or even less common etiologies such as pancreatic disorders like chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, the patient was advised to maintain a healthy diet and avoid any potential irritants such as spicy or fatty foods.

Follow-up appointments were scheduled to review the endoscopy results and further manage the patient's symptoms accordingly. In the meantime, close monitoring of his weight, pain intensity, and any new associated symptoms was recommended.

This case highlights a middle-aged male with persistent epigastric abdominal pain and weight loss. Although initial investigations were inconclusive, further evaluation is necessary to identify any underlying gastrointestinal pathology.
