Clinical Case: A 39-year-old male accountant, gravida 1 para 0 at 25 weeks gestation, presented to our facility with a chief complaint of persistent epigastric abdominal pain for the past two months. The pain was gradual in onset, dull in nature and had progressively worsened over time. There were no specific relieving or aggravating factors reported by the patient. He denied any radiation of pain to the chest or any associated symptoms such as weight loss, early satiety, jaundice, fever, itchiness or spontaneous bleeding.

The patient had no significant medical history and was not known to have diabetes or hypertension. He denied any history of alcohol consumption or smoking. There were no cardiorespiratory nor urogenital symptoms reported by the patient. On physical examination, he appeared well-nourished and hydrated with no signs of distress. Vital signs were within normal limits and there were no palpable lymph nodes.

Abdominal examination revealed distension with a distorted contour in the upper half of the abdomen along with visibly dilated anterior abdominal wall veins draining away from the umbilicus. The liver was enlarged measuring 13cm below the costal margin with a span of 16cm. On palpation, it felt hard and nodular with irregular edges and mild tenderness on deep palpation but without a bruit on auscultation.

Laboratory assessment showed hemoglobin levels within normal range at 12g/dl and white blood cell count at 9,200 cells/dl; neutrophils accounted for 58%, lymphocytes for 28%, monocytes for10% and eosinophils for2%. Platelet count was normal at350000/ul.The bilirubin level was also within normal limits but gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were elevated(4 times upper limit). Total protein and albumin levels were low, measuring 42g/L and 28g/L respectively. International normalized ratio (INR) was slightly elevated at 1.3.

Further investigations revealed a positive hepatitis B surface antigen(HBsAg) and negative hepatitis B e antigen(HBeAg). The patient's HBV DNA level was measured to be 180,000 IU/ml (viral load). Tests for HIV and HCV came out negative. Abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged liver with heterogeneous coarse texture and multiple hypoechoic lesions. The liver measured 16cm in length with mild ascites observed on the scan.

Given the findings, a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation in pregnancy was made. The patient was managed with analgesia along with furosemide, spironolactone, and lamivudine to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B infection. A plan was made to continue the pregnancy until at least 32 completed weeks to improve neonatal survival chances.

However, due to worsening abdominal pain that became unbearable for the patient, it was decided to terminate the pregnancy at 30 weeks and three days through successful induction of labor. Unfortunately, the outcome resulted in a fresh stillbirth weighing 1.2kg.

Post-delivery, the patient experienced significant relief from
