Upon admission, a thorough physical examination was conducted on the patient. The examination revealed no abnormalities in her vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Neurological examination showed no focal deficits or signs of motor or sensory impairment.

Given the patient's history of seizures and the presence of non-pulsating headaches, further investigations were deemed necessary. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed to assess the electrical activity of the brain. The results showed interictal epileptiform discharges, confirming the presence of ongoing seizure activity.

To evaluate the etiology of the headaches, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was ordered. The MRI revealed characteristic findings of Sturge-Weber syndrome, including leptomeningeal enhancement in the occipital and parietal lobes, as well as cortical atrophy and calcifications in the affected areas. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome.

Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), also known as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the presence of facial vascular birthmarks (port-wine stains) and abnormalities in the brain. It is caused by the somatic mutation of the GNAQ gene, leading to the overgrowth of blood vessels in the affected areas. This overgrowth can result in a variety of neurological symptoms, including seizures, developmental delays, and headaches.

Treatment for Sturge-Weber syndrome aims to manage the associated symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life. In the case of our patient, the primary concern was the control of her seizures and headaches. Antiepileptic medications, such as carbamazepine, were initiated to help manage the seizure activity. Additionally, she was advised to avoid triggers, such as sleep deprivation and stress, which can exacerbate seizures.

For the management of her headaches, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were prescribed for acute pain relief, as they had previously proven effective for the patient. However, due to the chronic nature of her headaches, a preventive treatment strategy was also employed. The patient was started on a low-dose tricyclic antidepressant, such as amitriptyline, which has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of chronic headaches.

Furthermore, the patient was referred to a neurologist specializing in headache management for further evaluation and to explore alternative treatment options. The neurologist recommended keeping a headache diary to track the frequency, duration, and severity of her headaches. This information would help identify any patterns or triggers that could be addressed to further improve her management.

In addition to medical interventions, the patient was also provided with psychological support and counseling. Living with a chronic condition such as Sturge-Weber syndrome can be challenging, and it is essential to address the emotional and psychological well-being of the patient. Support groups and counseling services were offered to help the patient cope with her condition and any associated difficulties.

During her stay at the clinic, the patient's seizures were successfully controlled with antiepileptic medications, and her headaches showed a significant reduction in frequency and intensity with the initiation of preventive treatment. Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor her progress and make any necessary adjustments to her treatment plan.

In conclusion, the case of the 21-year-old female patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome presented with a history of non-pulsating headaches and a diagnosis of seizures. Through a thorough evaluation, including EEG and brain MRI, the presence of ongoing seizure activity and characteristic findings of SWS were
