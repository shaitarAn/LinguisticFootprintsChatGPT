Upon admission, the patient underwent a thorough physical examination. Vital signs were within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.5Â°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient appeared fatigued but was alert and oriented.

The examination revealed a diffuse maculopapular rash over the patient's body, including the palms and soles. The rash was non-blanching and not pruritic. There were no signs of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. The patient had mild pharyngeal erythema without tonsillar exudate. Auscultation of the lungs revealed clear breath sounds bilaterally, and there were no murmurs or other abnormal heart sounds.

Laboratory investigations were initiated to further evaluate the patient's condition. Initial blood tests showed mild leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.8 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.5-11.0 x 10^9/L) and a lymphocyte count of 1.0 x 10^9/L (normal range: 1.5-4.0 x 10^9/L). Other blood parameters, including liver function tests, renal function tests, and electrolyte levels, were within normal limits. A chest X-ray was performed, which showed no signs of pulmonary infiltrates or other abnormalities.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and findings, a provisional diagnosis of viral infection was made. The differential diagnosis included several viral illnesses, such as dengue fever, Zika virus infection, and chikungunya fever, which are known to cause similar symptoms and rash patterns. Additional laboratory tests were ordered to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.

The patient was placed on supportive management, including adequate hydration, antipyretics for fever control, and symptomatic relief for headache and sore throat. Strict infection control measures were implemented to prevent the spread of the suspected viral infection. The medical team closely monitored the patient's clinical progress and continued to investigate the underlying cause of his symptoms.

Further test results, including serological assays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, were pending and would provide more conclusive evidence for the diagnosis. The medical team remained vigilant and prepared to adapt the treatment plan based on the final diagnosis and further clinical developments.
