On physical examination, the patient was found to have a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F) and a generalized maculopapular rash. The rash was non-pruritic and involved the trunk, extremities, and face, including the eyelids. His conjunctiva appeared injected, but there was no evidence of oral ulcers, nasal discharge, or genital lesions. The patient had mild cervical lymphadenopathy and tenderness on palpation of the neck. His lung and heart sounds were normal, and there were no signs of hepatosplenomegaly.

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the medical team at CHBAH suspected an infectious etiology. Blood tests were ordered, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and viral serology. The complete blood count revealed leukopenia with lymphopenia, while liver function tests showed mild elevation of liver enzymes. Initial viral serology tests for common infections, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), were negative.

Further investigation was warranted to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. A chest X-ray was performed and showed no abnormalities. Lumbar puncture was also performed to assess for central nervous system involvement. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis with mildly elevated protein levels. The Gram stain and culture were negative for bacterial pathogens. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for common viral pathogens, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), was negative.

Given the negative viral serology and PCR testing, the medical team considered other possible etiologies. Given the patient's recent travel history within South Africa, a tick-borne illness was suspected. The patient reported camping in a rural area and recalled being bitten by several ticks during his trip. Blood samples were sent for serological testing for tick-borne pathogens, including Rickettsia species and Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease.

While awaiting the serological results, the patient's symptoms persisted. He continued to have intermittent fever, headache, neck pain, and a dry cough. His rash remained unchanged. The medical team initiated supportive care, including antipyretics and analgesics, and closely monitored his vital signs. The patient's hydration status was also closely monitored, and intravenous fluids were administered as needed.

After several days, the serological results returned positive for Rickettsia africae, the causative agent of African tick-bite fever (ATBF). This confirmed the medical team's suspicion of a tick-borne illness. The patient was started on doxycycline, an antibiotic effective against Rickettsia, and his symptoms gradually improved over the course of treatment.

The patient's case highlights the importance of considering tick-borne illnesses in patients presenting with fever, rash, and a history of tick exposure, especially in endemic areas. Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment are crucial in managing these infections to prevent complications. Healthcare providers should also educate patients about preventive measures, such as wearing protective clothing and using insect repellents, when visiting tick-infested areas.

In conclusion, this case illustrates the clinical presentation and management of a 17-year-old African male with African tick-bite fever. Prompt recognition and appropriate treatment led to the resolution of symptoms and a successful outcome for the patient. Continued awareness and vigilance regarding tick-borne illnesses are essential for healthcare providers in endemic areas to provide optimal care for their patients.
