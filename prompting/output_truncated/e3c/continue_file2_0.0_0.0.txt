On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and had a distended abdomen. There was tenderness on palpation in the epigastric region, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. Bowel sounds were normal, and there were no palpable masses or organomegaly.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, further investigations were ordered. Laboratory tests revealed a mild normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL (normal range: 12-15 g/dL). Liver function tests were within normal limits, and there were no abnormalities in the coagulation profile. Serum amylase and lipase levels were also normal.

An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed a large, hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreas. The mass appeared to be invading the surrounding structures, including the duodenum and common bile duct. There were no signs of metastasis to the liver or other distant organs.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was suspected. The patient was referred to an oncologist for further evaluation and management. A computed tomography (CT) scan was scheduled to assess the extent of the tumor and to determine if it was resectable.

During the CT scan, it was confirmed that the tumor was locally advanced and not amenable to surgical resection. The oncologist discussed the treatment options with the patient, which included chemotherapy and radiation therapy to help shrink the tumor and alleviate symptoms.

The patient was started on a chemotherapy regimen consisting of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. She tolerated the treatment well, with only mild nausea and fatigue as side effects. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor the response to treatment and manage any adverse effects.

Over the next few months, the patient's abdominal pain gradually improved, and she regained some of the weight she had lost. Repeat imaging showed a partial response to chemotherapy, with a reduction in the size of the tumor. The patient continued with her treatment, and her pregnancy was closely monitored by the obstetric team.

At 36 weeks gestation, the patient went into spontaneous labor and delivered a healthy baby boy. The delivery was uneventful, and both mother and baby were stable. The patient's oncologist decided to continue the chemotherapy after a short break to allow for recovery from childbirth.

The patient's treatment continued for several more months, with regular imaging showing further reduction in the size of the tumor. She experienced occasional episodes of abdominal pain, but they were less frequent and less severe than before. The patient remained hopeful and determined to fight the cancer for
