On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and fatigued. Her vital signs were stable, and her abdomen was gravid with a fundal height corresponding to 27 weeks gestation. There were no visible signs of trauma or distension, and fetal movements were noted. 

Further examination revealed mild tenderness on palpation in the epigastric region, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. The liver and spleen were not palpable, and there were no signs of ascites. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed normal bowel sounds.

Given the patient's symptoms of chronic abdominal pain, weight loss, and radiation to the chest, further investigations were warranted to determine the cause. Initial laboratory tests were ordered, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and serum amylase and lipase levels. These tests would help assess for any underlying systemic or gastrointestinal disorders.

Additionally, an abdominal ultrasound was scheduled to further evaluate the patient's upper abdominal pain. The ultrasound would provide information regarding the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and other abdominal organs, potentially identifying any structural abnormalities or lesions.

While awaiting the results, the patient was advised to maintain a healthy diet and stay hydrated. She was also educated about the importance of regular antenatal visits and the potential need for further intervention if any concerning findings were discovered.

After a few days, the laboratory results were available. The complete blood count showed mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, and normal white blood cell and platelet counts. Liver function tests were within normal limits, and serum amylase and lipase levels were also normal.

The abdominal ultrasound revealed an enlarged spleen, measuring 15 cm, which was consistent with pregnancy-related changes. However, it also identified a hypoechoic mass in the region of the pancreas, measuring approximately 3 cm. This finding raised concern for a pancreatic tumor or cyst.

In light of these findings, a referral to a gastroenterologist was made for further evaluation and management. The patient was scheduled for a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen to obtain a more detailed image of the pancreatic lesion and determine its nature.

The case of this pregnant farmer with chronic epigastric pain and weight loss highlights the importance of thorough evaluation and investigation in such cases. While pregnancy-related changes can account for certain symptoms, it is crucial not to overlook potential underlying pathologies. Prompt referral and collaboration with specialists can help ensure appropriate management and the best possible outcome for both the mother and the unborn child.
