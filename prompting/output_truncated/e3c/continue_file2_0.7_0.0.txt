On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and had a distended abdomen. There was tenderness in the epigastric region, and the liver was palpable 2 centimeters below the right costal margin. The rest of the examination, including cardiovascular and respiratory systems, was unremarkable. 

Given the patient's symptoms, history of weight loss, and physical examination findings, further investigations were warranted to determine the cause of her abdominal pain and distension. Initial laboratory investigations revealed a mild normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL. Liver function tests were within normal limits, ruling out liver dysfunction as the cause of the patient's symptoms. 

An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed hepatomegaly with diffusely increased echogenicity and a coarse liver texture. There were no focal lesions or evidence of biliary obstruction. The gallbladder and spleen were normal in size and appearance. Additionally, the ultrasound revealed ascites and dilated intrahepatic bile ducts, indicating the presence of portal hypertension. 

Based on these findings, a provisional diagnosis of cirrhosis was made. However, it was important to determine the underlying etiology of the cirrhosis, as there are various causes, including viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders. 

Further investigations were conducted to determine the cause of the cirrhosis. Serology for viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C) was negative. Autoimmune markers, including antinuclear antibodies and anti-smooth muscle antibodies, were also negative. Liver biopsy was performed to assess the severity and stage of the cirrhosis, as well as to identify any specific histological features that could guide the diagnosis. 

The liver biopsy revealed features consistent with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by progressive destruction of the small bile ducts within the liver. This diagnosis was supported by the presence of positive antimitochondrial antibodies, a specific marker for PBC. 

The patient was started on ursodeoxycholic acid, a medication that slows the progression of PBC and improves liver function. She was also referred to a hepatologist for further management and monitoring of her liver disease. Given her pregnancy, close monitoring of both the patient and the fetus was essential. 

The patient was counseled regarding the potential risks associated with PBC during pregnancy, including preterm labor, intrauterine growth restriction, and exacerbation of liver disease. Regular antenatal visits were scheduled to closely monitor her liver function, fetal growth, and well-being. 

Throughout her pregnancy, the patient's abdominal pain improved gradually, and she did not experience any complications related to PBC. At 38 weeks gestation, she underwent an uncomplicated elective cesarean section and delivered a healthy baby girl. 

Postpartum, the patient's liver function tests were closely monitored, and she continued on ursodeoxycholic acid to manage her PBC. She was also advised to avoid alcohol and maintain a healthy lifestyle to minimize further liver damage. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor her liver function, assess disease progression, and provide ongoing management. 

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering liver diseases, including autoimmune conditions, in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain and hepatomegaly during pregnancy. Prompt diagnosis, appropriate management, and close monitoring can lead to favorable outcomes for both the mother and the baby.
