Patient information
On the 3rd October 2021, a previously healthy, 24-year-old Asian female was admitted to the medical ward at St. Mary's Hospital, New York City. The patient was transferred from a local clinic due to ongoing symptoms and a deteriorating condition. She presented with a three-day history of high-grade fever, generalized rash all over her body and face, persistent headache accompanied by neck stiffness, sore throat, and an unproductive cough. Additionally, she reported experiencing watery diarrhea for the past two days. There were no complaints of joint pain or any oral or nasal ulcers.

Medical History
The patient had no significant medical history prior to this admission. She had never been hospitalized before and had not experienced any similar episodes in the past.

Social History
The patient lived with her family in an urban area of New York City and worked as a teacher at a local school. She denied any recent travel outside the city or close contact with individuals who were ill.

Physical Examination
Upon arrival at St. Mary's Hospital, the patient appeared fatigued and mildly dehydrated. Her temperature was measured at 39°C (102°F). A thorough examination revealed a diffuse maculopapular rash covering her trunk, limbs, and face including eyelids. The rash did not blanch on pressure nor did it have any specific distribution pattern.

The patient complained of moderate neck pain when attempting flexion or extension movements; however, there was no limitation in range of motion observed during examination.

Laboratory Findings
Initial laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 15 × 10^9/L) with neutrophil predominance (80%), while lymphocyte count remained within normal limits (20%). Liver function tests were unremarkable except for slightly elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (350 U/L).

Diagnostic Assessment
Given the clinical presentation, the patient was suspected to have a viral illness with systemic involvement. Differential diagnoses included viral exanthems, such as measles or rubella, as well as infectious mononucleosis or an enteroviral infection.

Further investigations were ordered, including serological testing for common viruses associated with exanthematous illnesses and a throat swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. In the meantime, the patient was placed in contact isolation to prevent potential transmission to healthcare workers and other patients.

Management
Supportive care measures were initiated immediately upon admission. The patient received intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and paracetamol for fever control. Bed rest and close monitoring of vital signs were implemented.

Outcome
The results of serological testing came back positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), confirming infectious mononucleosis as the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. The PCR analysis
