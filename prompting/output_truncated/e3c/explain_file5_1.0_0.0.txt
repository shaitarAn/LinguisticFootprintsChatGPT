This clinical case describes a patient who presented with several concerning symptoms. The patient is a grade ten scholar with no prior medical admission, no history of surgery, and no significant medication or recreational drug use. Although there was no known contact with COVID-19 cases, the patient had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal two weeks prior.

Upon examination, the patient appeared ill and had a blood pressure of 103/44 mmHg, a heart rate of 123 beats per minute, and a temperature of 39.5Â°C. The patient was restless but showed no signs of cognitive dysfunction. A maculopapular rash was observed over the torso, upper back, limbs, and palmar surface of the hands. The rash was non-tender, and there were erythematous desquamating lesions over the eyelids and bilateral conjunctivitis. The abdominal, respiratory, and cardiovascular examinations were normal.

Initial diagnostic assessments included blood investigations, which revealed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers. However, blood and urine cultures remained negative, and the lumbar puncture, viral panel, chest radiograph, and abdominal sonar all appeared normal. The first echocardiogram (ECHO) showed a structurally normal heart with normal systolic function.

Given the clinical findings and laboratory results, several differential diagnoses were considered. These included viral infections such as HIV seroconversion, acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), or cytomegalovirus (CMV), as well as bacterial infections caused by Group A streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, other gram-negative bacteria, rickettsia, leptospirosis, or malaria. Non-infectious differentials such as Kawasaki-like disease (KD), adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were also considered.

Therapeutic interventions included intravenous fluid boluses, but the patient did not respond significantly. Doxycycline and ceftriaxone were initiated empirically, and hydrocortisone was started but discontinued due to concern for infection. With the development of cardiac symptoms, a repeat ECHO revealed significant cardiac abnormalities, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered along with other supportive measures. Serological testing confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

The patient showed improvement with treatment, and follow-up assessments revealed complete resolution of symptoms, including the rash. A repeat ECHO showed improved heart function, and the patient was weaned off medication gradually. On follow-up in the rheumatology outpatient clinic, the patient had fully recovered with no residual symptoms.
