During his hospitalization, the patient received intensive wound care and burn management. The primary goal was to prevent infection and promote wound healing. The medical team implemented a comprehensive treatment plan that included daily dressing changes, antibiotic therapy, pain management, and physical therapy.

The patient's burns were assessed regularly for signs of infection or worsening tissue damage. In cases where necrotic tissue was present, debridement surgeries were performed to remove the dead tissue and promote healthy skin growth. These surgeries helped to improve the overall appearance and functionality of the affected areas.

Throughout his stay, mental health professionals worked closely with the patient to address his underlying mental illness. Psychotherapy sessions were conducted regularly to provide emotional support and help him cope with the traumatic event that led to his suicide attempt.

Additionally, a multidisciplinary approach involving social workers, occupational therapists, and psychiatrists was employed to assist in his rehabilitation process. Occupational therapists played a crucial role in helping him regain independence by providing adaptive devices for daily activities such as eating and grooming.

As time progressed, the patient's wounds began to heal gradually. During this period of recovery, he underwent extensive physical therapy sessions aimed at improving mobility in his upper extremities as well as regaining strength in his lower body.

After 66 days of hospitalization under constant medical supervision and psychological support, the patient showed significant progress both physically and mentally. He had successfully overcome multiple challenges associated with severe burns while also addressing his underlying mental health condition.

Upon discharge from the hospital setting, a comprehensive aftercare plan was put into place involving regular outpatient check-ups with various specialists including dermatologists for scar management and psychologists for ongoing counseling sessions.

This case serves as an example of how proper medical intervention combined with psychological support can lead individuals struggling with mental illness towards recovery from self-harm incidents like attempted suicide by fire. It highlights the importance of addressing both physical injuries as well as underlying mental health conditions in order to achieve a holistic approach to patient care.
