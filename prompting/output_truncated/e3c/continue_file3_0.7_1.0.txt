During his 66-day hospitalization, the 35-year-old mentally ill man received extensive medical care and underwent five debridement surgeries to treat the full- and partial-thickness injuries he sustained in his suicide attempt by fire. The medical team worked tirelessly to provide him with the necessary treatments and support for his physical and emotional recovery.

Upon admission, the patient's injuries were assessed to determine the extent of damage caused by the fire. It was found that approximately 38% of his total body surface area (TBSA) was affected, including significant burns on his face and neck (5%), both upper extremities (8%), right thigh (4%), left thigh and leg (3%), as well as a substantial portion of his anterior and posterior trunk (16%).

The initial priority for the medical team was to stabilize him both physically and mentally. Due to the severity of his burns, specialized wound care techniques were employed immediately to prevent infection, promote healing, and alleviate pain. This involved regular dressing changes using sterile techniques, application of topical medications such as silver sulfadiazine cream or mafenide acetate solution, and continuous monitoring for signs of complications.

In addition to wound management, pain control played a crucial role in managing this patient's condition. Burn injuries can cause excruciating pain due to nerve damage caused by heat exposure. A multidisciplinary approach involving pharmacological interventions like opioids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with psychological support from mental health professionals helped ensure adequate pain relief throughout his hospital stay.

Psychiatrists also played an integral part in this patient's treatment plan. Understanding that he had attempted suicide prior to admission highlighted the importance of addressing underlying mental health issues alongside physical recovery efforts. Regular psychiatric evaluations were conducted throughout his stay in order to assess any changes in mood or suicidal ideation.

The patient's journey included not only physical healing but also emotional support through counseling sessions with psychologists specializing in trauma. These sessions aimed to help him cope with the aftermath of his suicide attempt and develop healthy coping mechanisms for the future.

The debridement surgeries, performed over a period of time, involved removing dead or damaged tissue from the burns to promote healing. This process required careful precision and expertise to minimize scarring and maximize functional outcomes. The medical team worked closely with plastic surgeons to ensure that the patient's wounds were properly cleaned and prepared for grafting procedures.

As his hospitalization continued, physical therapy played an essential role in helping him regain mobility and functionality in affected areas. Physiotherapists worked diligently with the patient, using various exercises and techniques designed to improve range of motion, strength, and overall functionality.

Throughout his 66-day stay in the hospital, this mentally ill man received comprehensive care from a dedicated team of healthcare professionals who prioritized both physical recovery as well as mental health support. Their collective efforts ensured that he received appropriate treatment for his burn injuries while also addressing underlying psychological issues.

Upon discharge from the hospital, this patient was referred to outpatient mental health services where he could continue receiving support on an ongoing basis. Follow-up appointments were scheduled with plastic surgeons for wound check-ups and potential scar management interventions such as scar revision surgeries or laser treatments.

The case of this mentally ill man serves as a reminder of the importance of holistic care when treating
