Clinical Case: A 34-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) presented to our clinic with complaints of chronic headaches. He had a history of recurrent non-pulsating headaches that had been occurring for the past 3 years. The headache episodes were not associated with nausea, vomiting, or any visual disturbances. The pain was described as bilateral, generalized, and pressing in nature. Over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs provided some relief from the pain.

The patient's medical history revealed that he was diagnosed with SWS at birth due to the presence of a port wine stain birthmark on his face and upper body. He had also experienced seizures during infancy, characterized by tonic-clonic contractions. At the age of 6, he underwent a callosotomy procedure to control his seizures.

At age 28, he underwent laser treatment to remove his port wine stain birthmark and subsequently experienced his first seizure since undergoing callosotomy. He was started on carbamazepine (400 mg daily), which effectively controlled his seizures thereafter.

According to reports from family members, his developmental milestones were normal during infancy; however, he struggled academically and barely graduated from high school due to learning difficulties.

On physical examination, facial nevi were observed on both sides of his face along with an overgrowth of gingiva on the right side which appeared bright red in color and showed blanching upon pressure application suggestive of angiomatous enlargement. Mild asymmetry was noted in the size of his extremities; specifically, left arm and leg were slightly smaller than their counterparts on the right side. Hemiparesis affecting both upper and lower extremities was present only on the left side.

Ophthalmological evaluation revealed glaucoma in his right eye while psychiatric examination indicated signs consistent with an anxiety disorder. Neurological examination did not reveal any remarkable findings, except for the observed hemiparesis.

Cranial CT scans demonstrated diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere, along with diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 weighted cranial MRI showed increased calvarial thickness on the right side compared to the left, and asymmetrically smaller size of the right hemisphere. Additionally, T2 weighted MRI revealed extensive venous formations around corpus of the right lateral ventricle and at Gallen vein localization. Widespread vascular formations were also seen at perivascular space anterior to third ventricle at Willis polygon localization and at the right temporooccipital area near quadrigeminal cistern localization.

Psychometric testing using a proteus intelligence test was performed and yielded a score of 70 points, indicating mild intellectual disability.

In summary, this case presents a 34-year-old male patient with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) who presented with chronic headaches accompanied by
