Clinical Case: A 32-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of tension-type headaches presenting at our clinic. He has been experiencing frequent non-pulsating headaches for the past two years. The patient reports that his headaches are usually relieved by over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and do not worsen with physical activity. He denies any associated symptoms such as nausea or aura-like sensations during these episodes. The duration of his headaches typically lasts for several hours, causing him significant discomfort.

The patient describes the pain as bilateral, generalized, and pressing in quality, similar to a tight band around his head. These sensations often lead to difficulty concentrating on tasks at hand and may result in mild irritability. Despite experiencing these recurrent headaches, he denies any impact on his daily activities or disruption of sleep patterns.

Upon further inquiry into the patient's family history, there is no reported evidence of recurrent headaches among immediate family members. However, he does recall a distant cousin who had occasional migraines but no other documented cases within relatives.

In addition to his current chief complaint of tension-type headaches, the patient also reveals a previous medical history of seizures during infancy when he was approximately three months old. Described as tonic-clonic contractions that lasted for several minutes each time they occurred, these seizure episodes ultimately led to a diagnosis of epilepsy at an early age.

On thorough evaluation and diagnostic workup during infancy for epilepsy management purposes by pediatric specialists, no specific etiology or underlying cause was identified apart from idiopathic epilepsy associated with developmental delays early on in life; however subsequent investigations were unremarkable including normal neuroimaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans taken subsequently which showed no structural abnormalities within the brain.

Apart from these early-life seizures that eventually resolved with antiepileptic medication therapy after three years from onset without any further recurrence since then along with normal neurodevelopmental milestones achieved subsequently; there have been no other significant neurological events or symptoms reported by the patient.

In terms of his current presentation, a thorough physical examination was performed, including vital signs and neurological assessment. Findings from the examination were unremarkable except for mild tenderness noted upon palpation in the cervical spine region, likely due to muscle tension and stress-related factors. The remainder of his physical examination demonstrated no abnormalities.

Given his clinical presentation, which aligns with the criteria for tension-type headaches according to International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3), further investigations including blood tests and neuroimaging studies are not indicated at this stage. The patient was provided with education regarding headache triggers, lifestyle modifications, and non-pharmacological strategies such as stress reduction techniques and adequate sleep hygiene to help manage his symptoms effectively.

A follow-up appointment was scheduled for four weeks to assess any changes in symptomatology or response to non-pharmacological interventions implemented during this period. Should there be inadequate response or worsening of symptoms despite conservative measures, further evaluation may be considered to rule out other potential etiologies contributing to his recurrent headaches.

In summary, we present a case of a 32-year-old male patient with tension-type headaches resembling features described in previous literature. Although he also carries a history of childhood epilepsy that resolved spontaneously without any subsequent recurrence or associated neurological deficits detected on long-term follow-up assessments; an association between these two conditions remains
