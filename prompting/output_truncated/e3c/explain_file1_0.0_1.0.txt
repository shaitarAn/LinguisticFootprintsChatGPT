This clinical case describes a 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). SWS is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the presence of a facial birthmark called a port wine stain, as well as abnormalities in the brain and eyes.

The patient presented with frequent non-pulsating headaches that had been occurring for the past two years. These headaches were relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and were not worsened by physical activity. There were no accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura. The pain was bilateral, generalized, and pressing in quality.

The patient also had a history of seizures since infancy, which led to her diagnosis of SWS. At six years old, she underwent callosotomy surgery to control her seizures. However, at 18 years old, she experienced another seizure after undergoing laser treatment for her port wine stain. Since then, she has been prescribed carbamazepine to prevent further seizures.

In addition to her neurological symptoms, the patient had cognitive impairments. Despite having normal development during infancy, she struggled academically and was considered mildly mentally retarded based on intelligence testing.

Physical examination revealed several characteristic features of SWS including facial nevus (port wine stain), gingival overgrowth on one side of the mouth due to angiomatous enlargement (abnormal blood vessel growth), and mild asymmetry in her extremities with hemiparesis (weakness) on one side.

Further investigations such as cranial CT scans and MRI revealed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere of the brain along with irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI showed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere along with widespread vascular formations around different areas of the brain.

On ophthalmological evaluation, glaucoma was diagnosed in the patient's right eye. Additionally, she was also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and was prescribed medications such as ketiapin and venlafaxine to manage her anxiety symptoms.

Overall, this case highlights the various clinical manifestations of Sturge-Weber syndrome, including neurological symptoms such as seizures and headaches, cognitive impairments, facial birthmark (port wine stain), ocular abnormalities like glaucoma, and vascular abnormalities in the brain. Treatment typically involves managing symptoms with medications and addressing any associated complications.
