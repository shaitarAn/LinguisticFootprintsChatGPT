This clinical case involves a young woman who had a callosotomy procedure at the age of 6 to control her seizures. Callosotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting the corpus callosum, which is the bundle of nerves connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. This procedure is sometimes done in cases where seizures cannot be controlled with medication alone.

At the age of 18, she had her first seizure since the callosotomy during a laser treatment for her port wine birthmark. Following this seizure, she was prescribed carbamazepine, an antiepileptic medication, and has not experienced any further seizures since then.

The patient's parents report that despite having normal development in infancy, she has struggled academically and has limited literacy skills. There is no significant family history except for her elder sister also having a port wine stain on her face.

In addition to epilepsy, this patient also has other medical conditions. She takes ketiapin and venlafaxine for anxiety disorder and chronic headaches. She also takes NSAID drugs for pain relief.

On physical examination, several findings were noted: facial nevus (a type of birthmark) on multiple areas of her face due to choroid angioma (abnormal blood vessels), gingival overgrowth (enlarged gums) on one side of her mouth with angiomatous enlargement (enlargement due to abnormal blood vessels), mild asymmetry in size between her left and right arm/leg with hemiparesis (weakness or paralysis) affecting both upper and lower extremities on the same side.

Further evaluations revealed glaucoma in her right eye and imaging studies showed diffuse atrophy (shrinkage) in the right hemisphere of her brain along with irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications (abnormal calcium deposits) in the right occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures (abnormal blood vessels) on the right hemisphere, as well as diffuse atrophy on the same side. Additional MRI findings included asymmetrical calvarial thickness (skull thickness) with the right side being thicker than the left, extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle, and widespread vascular formations in various locations.

Psychiatric evaluation showed signs of anxiety disorder, and a proteus intelligence test was performed which indicated mild mental retardation with a score of 75.

Based on this information, it appears that this patient has a complex medical condition involving epilepsy, cognitive impairment, facial nevus due to choroid angioma, gingival overgrowth with angiomatous enlargement, hemiparesis affecting both upper and lower extremities on one side of her body, glaucoma in her right eye, and various
