This clinical case involves a young woman who has a history of callosotomy at the age of 6 to control her seizures. Callosotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting the corpus callosum, which is the bundle of nerves connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. This procedure is often performed in individuals with severe epilepsy to prevent seizures from spreading between the two sides of the brain.

At the age of 18, she had her first seizure since undergoing callosotomy during a laser treatment for her port wine birthmark. Following this seizure, she was prescribed carbamazepine at a daily dose of 400 mg and has not experienced any further seizures since then. Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic medication commonly used to treat various types of seizures.

According to her parents, despite having normal development during infancy, she struggled academically and barely graduated from elementary school. She also has difficulty with literacy skills. It's important to note that there may be various factors contributing to these difficulties, and it would require further evaluation by specialists such as psychologists or educational therapists to determine their exact cause.

In terms of family history, there was nothing significant except for her elder sister having a port wine stain on her face. Port wine stains are birthmarks caused by abnormal blood vessels in the skin and are typically harmless. However, in some cases, they can be associated with underlying conditions such as Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). No research or evaluation regarding SWS was done for her sister's birthmark.

The patient herself has been prescribed medications for anxiety disorder and chronic headaches. She takes ketiapin at a daily dose of 25 mg and venlafaxine at 75 mg for anxiety disorder management along with NSAID drugs for headache relief. After one week on this treatment regimen, there was slight improvement in headache heaviness but no change in frequency.

During her physical examination, several findings were noted. She had a facial nevus on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. A nevus is a type of birthmark or mole caused by an overgrowth of cells in the skin. In this case, it occurred due to choroid angioma, which is an abnormal collection of blood vessels in the eye.

Intraoral examination revealed gingival overgrowth on the right side with a bright red color that blanched upon applying pressure. This suggests angiomatous enlargement, which means there is an abnormal increase in blood vessels within the gums.

On her extremities, mild asymmetry was observed with her left arm and leg being slightly smaller than their counterparts on the right side. She also exhibited hemiparesis (weakness) in both upper and lower extremities on the same side.

Ophthalmological evaluation revealed glaucoma in her right eye. Glaucoma is a condition characterized by increased pressure within the eye that can lead to vision loss if not properly managed.

Psychiatric examination indicated signs of anxiety disorder while neurological examination did not reveal any remarkable findings except for hemiparesis.

Imaging studies such as cranial CT scans and gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI provided further insights into her condition. The CT scans showed diffuse atrophy (shrinkage) in the right hemisphere along with irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications (abnormal calcium deposits) in the right occipital area.

The MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures (enlarged veins near the surface of the brain)
