Patient Information:

On the 1st November 2021, a previously healthy, 35-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the medical ward at Hope General Hospital. The patient presented with a two-week history of fatigue, low-grade fever, joint pain, and a diffuse rash over her body. She complained of occasional headaches and a dry cough, but denied any sore throat or gastrointestinal symptoms. There was no history of recent travel, no known contact with COVID-19 cases, and no significant medical history or medication use.

Clinical Findings:

Upon examination, the patient appeared fatigued and had a blood pressure of 118/78 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and a temperature of 37.8Â°C. She had multiple tender, swollen joints with limited range of motion. A maculopapular rash was observed over her trunk, extremities, and face. The rash was pruritic but non-blanching. The rest of the physical examination, including cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological assessments, was unremarkable.

Diagnostic Assessment:

Initial blood tests revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell count (WBC). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests were negative. No evidence of infection was found on blood and urine cultures. A chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were normal. The patient underwent an ultrasound-guided joint aspiration, which showed inflammatory synovial fluid with no evidence of crystals or infection.

Diagnosis and Differentials:

Based on the clinical findings and diagnostic tests, a working diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was made. Other differentials considered included systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis.

Therapeutic Intervention:

The patient was started on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain and inflammation control. Methotrexate, a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), was initiated to slow down the progression of RA. The patient received education about the disease, its management, and the importance of early and regular follow-ups.

Follow-Up and Outcomes:

The patient was regularly monitored in the rheumatology outpatient clinic. Over the course of several months, her symptoms improved, and the rash gradually resolved. Her joint pain and swelling significantly decreased, and she experienced improved mobility. The methotrexate dosage was adjusted based on clinical response and laboratory monitoring. Regular laboratory tests, including complete blood counts and liver function tests, were performed to monitor for potential side effects of the medication. The patient adhered to the treatment regimen and engaged in physical therapy exercises to maintain joint flexibility.

At her most recent follow-up appointment, six months after the initial presentation, the patient reported being in remission with minimal joint symptoms. She expressed satisfaction with her treatment outcome and her ability to resume her normal activities. She currently continues on low-dose methotrexate and regular follow-ups with her rheumatologist to ensure disease control and early detection of any potential flare-ups.
