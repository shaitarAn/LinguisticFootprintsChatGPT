Patient Information:

On the 15th September 2021, a previously healthy, 25-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the medical ward at St. Mary's Hospital. The patient presented with a two-week history of fever, fatigue, and joint pain. She reported a recent trip to a rural area where she had been camping and hiking. There was no history of recent illness, surgery, or medication use. The patient works as a teacher and has no known allergies.

Clinical Findings:

Upon examination, the patient appeared tired and had a temperature of 38.8Â°C. She had mild swelling and tenderness in her wrists and knees bilaterally. There was no evidence of skin rash, oral ulcers, or lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood cell count (WBC). Other blood parameters, including liver function tests and renal function, were within normal limits.

Diagnostic Assessment:

Given the patient's symptoms and recent outdoor activities, a wide differential diagnosis was considered. Infectious causes, including tick-borne diseases like Lyme disease, were at the top of the list. Other possibilities included viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV). Non-infectious causes, such as autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), were also considered.

Therapeutic Intervention:

The patient was started on empirical antibiotics to cover potential tick-borne illnesses. Doxycycline was initiated at a dose of 100 mg twice daily. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were prescribed to manage the joint pain and inflammation. The patient was advised to rest and maintain hydration.

Follow-up and Outcomes:

Over the course of several days, the patient's fever subsided, and her joint pain improved significantly. Laboratory tests showed a decrease in inflammatory markers, including CRP and ESR. A serological test for Lyme disease was performed and returned positive for antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, confirming the diagnosis. The patient completed a two-week course of doxycycline and continued to experience improvement in her symptoms. At a follow-up appointment one month later, she reported being symptom-free and was able to resume her normal activities without limitations.
