Upon examination, baby NU appeared well-nourished and active. However, a thorough physical examination revealed a significant defect in the development of his skull and skin. The absence of these structures was evident, leaving the underlying brain exposed.

Further investigations were conducted to determine the cause of this congenital anomaly. Genetic testing was recommended due to the consanguineous relationship between the parents. Additionally, imaging studies such as CT scans and MRI were scheduled to assess the extent of the malformation and evaluate any associated abnormalities.

During counseling sessions with the parents, it was explained that this condition is known as anencephaly - a severe neural tube defect resulting in incomplete development of the brain and skull bones. The exact cause of anencephaly is not always clear but can be influenced by genetic factors, environmental exposures during pregnancy, or a combination thereof.

The parents expressed their concern about future pregnancies and whether they would be at risk for similar complications. Genetic counseling services were provided to address their questions and provide guidance on family planning options.

In addition to genetic counseling, supportive care was initiated for baby NU. This included measures to protect his exposed brain tissue from infection or injury by covering it with sterile dressings. A multidisciplinary team consisting of pediatric neurologists, plastic surgeons, neonatologists, and nurses collaborated closely to ensure comprehensive care for baby NU's unique needs.

Despite all efforts made by healthcare professionals involved in his care, it became apparent that baby NU's condition was incompatible with life outside of intensive medical support due to its severity. Palliative care discussions were held with his parents regarding comfort measures that could be implemented while ensuring he experienced minimal pain or distress during his limited time with them.

Baby NU's story serves as a reminder of how complex congenital anomalies can be and how important it is for healthcare providers to offer comprehensive support not only medically but also emotionally during such challenging times for families affected by these conditions.
