Upon arrival at the hospital, baby NU was immediately assessed by a team of healthcare professionals. The absence of skin and skull bone was confirmed, revealing a rare and complex condition known as congenital absence of skin and skull (CASS). This condition occurs when the normal development of these structures is disrupted during fetal development.

The medical team conducted a thorough examination to assess the extent of the abnormalities. They found that not only were there missing portions of skin and skull bone, but there were also other associated anomalies. Baby NU had underdeveloped facial features, including a small nose and ears. Additionally, his limbs appeared shorter than average.

Given the complexity of his condition, baby NU's case was discussed with various specialists including pediatric surgeons, geneticists, and neonatologists. It was determined that immediate surgical intervention would be necessary to protect his exposed brain tissue from infection and further damage.

During this time, additional information about baby NU's family history came to light. His parents were first cousins in a monogamous consanguineous relationship. This raised concerns about potential genetic factors contributing to his condition.

Genetic counseling was offered to both parents in order to provide them with information about their increased risk for having children with inherited disorders due to their close familial relationship. The counselor explained that consanguinity increases the likelihood of inheriting recessive genetic mutations from shared ancestors.

Further investigations were initiated to identify any underlying genetic abnormalities that may have contributed to baby NU's condition. Genetic testing revealed a mutation in a gene responsible for normal embryonic development called TP63 gene mutation which is associated with EEC syndrome (ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting syndrome).

The diagnosis provided some clarity for baby NU's parents but also brought forth new challenges as they grappled with understanding how this could have happened despite an uneventful pregnancy.

With all this information at hand, an interdisciplinary team consisting of plastic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and pediatricians formulated a comprehensive treatment plan for baby NU. The immediate priority was to perform a surgical procedure called debridement to remove any non-viable tissue and cover the exposed brain with a sterile dressing.

Following this initial surgery, baby NU would require multiple reconstructive surgeries over the course of his childhood to address the missing skin and skull bone. These procedures would aim to improve his appearance, protect his brain, and promote normal growth and development.

The medical team also emphasized the importance of long-term follow-up care for baby NU. This would involve regular monitoring of his
