A 42-year-old male accountant, Mr. Johnson, presented to our facility with a chief complaint of persistent abdominal pain for the past 2 months. The pain was located in the epigastric region and had a gradual onset. Mr. Johnson described the pain as dull and constant, which had progressively worsened over time. He also reported occasional radiation of the pain to his chest.

In addition to the abdominal discomfort, Mr. Johnson mentioned experiencing significant weight loss over the past few months without any associated symptoms such as early satiety, jaundice, fever, itchiness or spontaneous bleeding episodes. He denied any history of blood transfusion and reported being compliant with his routine hematinic supplements prescribed by his primary care physician.

Upon further inquiry into his medical history, it was revealed that Mr. Johnson had no known allergies or chronic illnesses but did have a family history of gastric cancer in his paternal grandmother.

Physical examination findings were unremarkable except for mild tenderness on palpation in the epigastric region without any signs of peritonitis or organomegaly.

Given these clinical findings and considering Mr. Johnson's age and risk factors including persistent abdominal pain with radiation to the chest along with significant weight loss but absence of other alarming symptoms like jaundice or early satiety; further investigations were warranted.

Laboratory investigations including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests (RFTs), amylase levels, and tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were ordered to assess for any underlying pathology contributing to his symptoms.

Imaging studies such as an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or computed tomography (CT) scan may be considered based on initial laboratory results to evaluate for possible causes like peptic ulcer disease, gastritis or even malignancy given family history.

Mr. Johnson was advised about these investigations and the need for follow-up appointments to discuss the results and further management options. He was also counseled about lifestyle modifications including dietary changes, stress reduction techniques, and regular exercise.

In conclusion, Mr. Johnson, a 42-year-old male accountant with persistent epigastric abdominal pain, weight loss, and radiation of pain to the chest presented to our facility. Given his clinical presentation and risk factors such as family history of gastric cancer, further investigations were initiated to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.
