A 42-year-old male construction worker, gravida 0 para 0, presented to our facility with a chief complaint of epigastric abdominal pain. The pain had been bothering him for the past four months and was described as gradual in onset, dull, and persistent. Over time, the pain had progressively worsened without any identifiable relieving or aggravating factors. He also reported occasional radiation of the pain to his chest.

The patient mentioned that he had experienced significant weight loss over the past few months but denied any associated symptoms such as early satiety, jaundice, fever, itchiness or spontaneous bleeding. He had no history of blood transfusion and was not taking any medications regularly.

Upon further inquiry into his medical history, it was revealed that he had a family history of gastric cancer in his paternal grandmother who passed away from the disease at an advanced age. This information raised concerns about potential genetic predisposition.

Physical examination findings were unremarkable except for mild tenderness on palpation over the epigastric region. Laboratory investigations showed no abnormalities in liver function tests or complete blood count; however, a fecal occult blood test came back positive.

Given these clinical findings and risk factors for gastric cancer (including age above 40 years old and family history), further diagnostic workup was initiated. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed which revealed an ulcerated mass located in the lesser curvature of the stomach measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter.

Biopsy samples were obtained during endoscopy and sent for histopathological examination which confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Staging investigations including computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis were subsequently performed to assess tumor extent and rule out metastasis.

The CT scan showed no evidence of distant metastasis; however, it did reveal regional lymph node involvement adjacent to the primary tumor site. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with stage II gastric cancer.

A multidisciplinary team consisting of surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists discussed the case and recommended a treatment plan. Given the early stage of the disease, surgical resection was considered as the primary treatment modality. The patient underwent a subtotal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection.

Postoperatively, he recovered well without any major complications. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen confirmed complete tumor removal with clear margins and negative lymph nodes. The final pathological staging was pT2N0M0 (stage IB).

Following surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated to reduce the risk of recurrence. The patient tolerated chemotherapy well without significant side effects and completed six cycles as planned.

Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor for any signs of recurrence or treatment-related complications. The patient also received nutritional counseling to manage potential long-term consequences of gastrectomy on his dietary intake.

In conclusion, this case highlights a 42-year-old male construction worker who presented with chronic epigastric pain and weight loss. Through appropriate diagnostic investigations, he was diagnosed with early-stage gastric cancer and successfully treated with surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Early detection and prompt management played a crucial role in achieving favorable outcomes for this patient.
