Clinical Case: A 45-year-old woman with severe asthma presenting with exacerbation requiring hospitalization

A 45-year-old woman with a known history of severe asthma was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a severe exacerbation of her symptoms. The patient had a history of multiple hospital admissions in the past due to her poorly controlled asthma. She presented to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness for the past three days.

Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient was tachypneic, using her accessory muscles to breathe, and had an audible expiratory wheeze. Her oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, and her peak flow measurement was significantly decreased from her baseline. Her vital signs were notable for a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and an increased heart rate of 110 beats per minute.

The patient was immediately started on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula to improve her oxygenation. She was also given high-dose inhaled bronchodilators, including short-acting beta-agonists and anticholinergic agents, to help relieve her symptoms. Despite these initial interventions, her symptoms did not improve, and she was subsequently admitted to the medical ward for further management.

During her hospitalization, the patient continued to require high doses of inhaled bronchodilators, oral steroids, and systemic corticosteroids to control her asthma exacerbation. She was closely monitored by nursing staff and received regular respiratory treatments, along with close monitoring of her oxygen saturation and peak flow measurements. Despite these interventions, her symptoms persisted and showed little improvement.

Given the severity of her asthma exacerbation and the lack of response to conventional therapy, the patient was referred to the hospital's respiratory therapy team for assessment. They recommended the initiation of continuous nebulized bronchodilator therapy to deliver a continuous stream of medication to her lower airways. This intervention, along with the regular administration of systemic corticosteroids, started to show some improvement in the patient's symptoms over the following days.

Throughout her hospital stay, the patient was also closely monitored for any signs of respiratory distress, such as decreased breath sounds, increased work of breathing, or altered mental status. Regular chest X-rays were performed to rule out any complications such as pneumothorax or pneumonia, which may worsen her respiratory status. Additionally, she received daily bedside spirometry to assess her lung function and guide the adjustments in her treatment plan.

After a 10-day hospitalization, the patient's symptoms improved significantly, and she was able to be weaned off continuous nebulized bronchodilators. Her oxygen saturation improved to 94% on room air, and her peak flow measurements returned close to her baseline. She was discharged home with a stepped-up medication regimen, including inhaled bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and regular follow-up appointments with her primary care physician and pulmonologist to ensure adequate management of her asthma.

In conclusion, this case highlights the management of a severe asthma exacerbation in a 45-year-old woman who required aggressive bronchodilator therapy, systemic corticosteroids, and close monitoring of her respiratory status. The use of continuous nebulized bronchodilator therapy proved to be beneficial in her case. Asthma exacerbation can often be challenging to manage, and close collaboration between the healthcare team, patient, and the respiratory therapy team played a crucial role in achieving successful outcomes for this patient.
