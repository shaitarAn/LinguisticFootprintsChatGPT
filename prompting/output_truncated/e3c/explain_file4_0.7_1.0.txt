In the first clinical case, a 30-year-old mother and 35-year-old father with no history of congenital anomalies in the family gave birth to a baby with an irregularly shaped defect on the scalp. The defect measured 10 x 8 cm in the midline and 6 x 6 cm in the occipital region. The baby also had low set ears, irritability, a tense fontanelle, and respiratory distress. A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis was made.

The baby received routine care including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics for meningitis, and wound dressing. The respiratory distress improved, oral feeds were started and well tolerated. A multidisciplinary team including neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons managed the baby's care. Imaging tests showed absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally but normal brain structures.

Future interventions were planned for raising a flap cover for autologous skin grafting. The baby was discharged after 18 days of admission on oral antibiotics and daily wound dressing for follow-up at specialty clinics.

In the second clinical case, a newborn named YA was referred at 48 hours of life due to absence of part of the skull bone noticed at birth. There was no trauma during delivery or known family history of congenital anomalies. The baby presented with fever, cyanosis (bluish discoloration), hypertonicity (increased muscle tone), subcutaneous tissue defect on the scalp extending from frontal to occipital area with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Other findings included desquamating skin (skin peeling), hypoplastic finger and toe nails (underdeveloped nails), dilated abdominal wall veins, and a systolic heart murmur indicating ventricular septal defect.

A working diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies including aplasia cutis congenita along with ventricular septal defect and meningitis was made. Blood and CSF cultures showed infection with Providencia species and E. coli, respectively. Abdominal ultrasound was normal, but further imaging and chromosomal studies couldn't be done due to financial constraints.

The baby received treatment with antibiotics and wound care for the scalp defect. Complications included CSF leakage and meningitis, which resolved over time. Planned interventions involved mesh coverings for the defect using prolene or titanium mesh along with a musculocutaneous flap cover from the latissimus dorsi muscle.

The patient was discharged upon parental request after 35 days of admission but unfortunately died 7 days after discharge.

In both cases, aplasia cutis congenita (a condition characterized by localized absence of skin) was present along with other complications such as meningitis in the first case or ventricular septal defect in the second case.
