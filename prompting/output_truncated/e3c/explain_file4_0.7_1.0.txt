In the first clinical case, a 30-year-old teacher gave birth to a baby with an irregularly shaped defect on the scalp. The defect measured 10 x 8 cm in the midline and 6 x 6 cm in the occipital region. The baby also had low set ears, irritability, tense anterior fontanelle (soft spot on the skull), and respiratory distress. A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis was made.

Aplasia cutis congenita is a rare condition characterized by localized absence of skin at birth. In this case, it affected the vertex of the scalp over the parietal bone bilaterally extending to the occipital region. A yellow layer of membrane covered the defect. The patient received routine care including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics for possible meningitis, and wound dressing.

The baby's respiratory distress improved over time, oral feeds were started and tolerated well. Multidisciplinary team management involving neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons was conducted. Imaging tests such as a babygram (X-ray) and an abdominopelvic scan were normal except for the aplasia cutis congenita on brain MRI.

The brain MRI showed absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally with an area of defect measuring 8.3 cm x 5.3 cm (AP X TR). However, no abnormalities were found in other parts of the brain or surrounding structures.

The conclusion based on these findings was that it was consistent with aplasia cutis congenita. Plans were made for future intervention involving raising a flap cover for autologous skin grafting.

In Case 2, a newborn baby from Hausa tribe was referred at 48 hours old due to absence of part of skull bone noticed at birth. The delivery occurred at home without significant head trauma or known risk factors during pregnancy such as herbal medication use or radiation exposure. The baby had a midline subcutaneous tissue defect of the scalp extending from the frontal to occipital area, with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggesting dural involvement.

Additional physical findings included desquamating skin, hypoplastic finger and toe nails, visible dilated abdominal wall veins, and a grade 3 systolic cardiac murmur. A diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies including aplasia cutis congenita, ventricular septal defect (congenital heart disease), and meningitis was made.

The baby tested positive for Providencia species and E. coli in both blood and CSF cultures, indicating sepsis. Abdominal ultrasound was normal; however, brain MRI, echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart), and chromosomal studies could not be done due to financial constraints.

Treatment involved parenteral antibiotics for meningitis and wound care for the scalp defect using betadine. Complications such as CSF leakage and meningitis were managed over time. Plans were made for prolene mesh/titanium mesh placement with latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap cover in the future.

Unfortunately, despite being discharged after 35 days on admission at parents' request, the baby died 7 days post-discharge.

In both cases presented here, aplasia cutis congenita was observed as a primary condition affecting the scalp's skin development at birth. However, Case 2 also involved additional congenital anomalies such as ventricular septal defect in the heart system.

It is important to note that these clinical cases highlight rare conditions that require multidisciplinary management involving specialists from various fields such as neurosurgery, plastic surgery, burns unit specialists along with nursing care teams providing wound management and antibiotic administration protocols following hospital protocols specific to each case.
