On admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Physical examination revealed bilateral conjunctival injection without exudates or discharge. The patient had an erythematous maculopapular rash over his face, trunk, and extremities.

Laboratory investigations showed a leukocyte count of 12,000 cells/mm³ with a normal differential count. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were elevated at 30 mg/L (normal range <5 mg/L). Liver function tests and renal function tests were within normal limits.

Given the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation, further investigations were initiated to determine the cause of his illness. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for respiratory viral panel testing including influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Blood cultures were also obtained to rule out bacterial infection.

In addition to these tests, serological screening for common infectious diseases such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and syphilis was performed.

The patient was started on supportive therapy including antipyretics for fever control and intravenous fluids for hydration. He was placed in isolation precautions until further investigation results could guide appropriate management.

The medical team at CHBAH is closely monitoring the patient's condition while awaiting test results to establish a definitive diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes viral infections such as dengue fever or chikungunya due to the presence of rash and arthralgia-like symptoms; however, other possibilities like meningitis or sepsis cannot be ruled out at this stage.

The patient's family has been informed about the ongoing investigations and is being provided with regular updates on his progress. The medical team remains committed to providing the best possible care and ensuring a prompt diagnosis for the patient's condition.
