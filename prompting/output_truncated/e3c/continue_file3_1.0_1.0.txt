During his hospitalization, the man received comprehensive burn wound care to promote healing and prevent infection. The initial focus was on stabilizing his condition and addressing any immediate life-threatening injuries. Intravenous fluids were administered to maintain hydration and replace lost fluids due to the burns.

The patient underwent multiple debridement surgeries, where dead tissue (eschar) was removed from the burned areas to facilitate healing. These procedures were essential in reducing the risk of infection while promoting granulation tissue formation and ultimately graft acceptance.

Additionally, frequent dressing changes were performed using specialized dressings that provide a moist wound environment conducive to healing. Pain management played a crucial role in ensuring the patient's comfort throughout this intensive treatment process. A range of analgesics, including opioids, local anesthetics, and non-opioid medications such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), were utilized as appropriate.

During his hospital stay, the multidisciplinary team closely monitored the patient for signs of infection or other complications associated with extensive burn injuries. Infection prevention measures included rigorous hand hygiene compliance for medical staff during wound care procedures, sterile dressing technique adherence, and administration of prophylactic antibiotics when necessary.

Physical therapy sessions were initiated early on in order to preserve joint mobility and prevent contractures (permanent shortening of muscles). Occupational therapists also worked with him to gradually regain functionality in his upper extremities through therapeutic exercises tailored specifically for burn rehabilitation patients.

Emotional support was also provided by psychiatric professionals who collaborated with the burn team throughout his hospitalization. Considering his history of mental illness that contributed to self-inflicted injuries previously leading up to this incident, consistent mental health assessment took place alongside regular evaluation from psychiatrists familiar with managing individuals struggling with psychiatric difficulties while recovering from severe burns.

Over time, as new healthy granulation tissue began forming around the wounds' edges, surgical intervention shifted towards skin grafting procedures. Split-thickness autografts - thin sheets of healthy skin harvested from the patient's unburned areas - were applied to cover the open wound areas. These grafts acted as a temporary protective barrier and promoted further wound healing.

With each subsequent surgery, improvements in wound closure, reduced risk of infection, and increased functionality were observed. The patient's mental health treatment plan was continuously adjusted according to his progress and evolving needs. A collaborative approach among all healthcare professionals involved ensured the best possible outcome for this mentally ill man who had endured such a traumatic incident.

After 66 days of intensive burn care, the patient was discharged from the hospital with comprehensive discharge instructions and continued outpatient mental health support arrangements in place to facilitate his ongoing recovery process. The multidisciplinary team remained engaged with follow-up appointments to monitor the healing progress and provide further guidance as
