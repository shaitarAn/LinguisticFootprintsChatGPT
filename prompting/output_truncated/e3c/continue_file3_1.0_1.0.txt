During his 66-day hospitalization, the medical team worked tirelessly to provide comprehensive care and support for the 35-year-old mentally ill man who had endured a devastating suicide attempt by fire. Upon admission, it became evident that his injuries were severe, affecting approximately 38% of his Total Body Surface Area (TBSA).

The man suffered from full-and partial-thickness burns on several regions of his body. The most notable areas affected included his face and neck accounting for 5% TBSA, both upper extremities covering 8% TBSA, right thigh encompassing 4% TBSA, left thigh and leg amounting to 3% TBSA, as well as a significant portion of his anterior and posterior trunk which constituted approximately 16% TBSA.

Immediate medical attention was crucial in order to prevent further complications and enhance the patient's chances of recovery. Upon admission, he was promptly taken into surgery for debridement - a procedure that involves removing dead or damaged tissue from wounds - in an effort to promote optimal wound healing.

Over the course of his hospitalization period, he underwent five debridement surgeries to address the extensive burns throughout various regions of his body. Each surgical intervention was performed meticulously by skilled surgeons specialized in burn care. These procedures aimed at reducing infection risk while facilitating wound healing through removal of necrotic tissue.

In addition to surgical interventions, a multidisciplinary team consisting of burn specialists, psychiatrists, nurses specializing in psychiatric care as well as an array of therapists collaborated closely with one another to provide holistic support for this particular patient.

Psychiatric interventions played a pivotal role throughout the gentleman's treatment journey due to him being mentally ill prior to this tragic event. Psychiatrists engaged with him regularly using talk therapy techniques tailored specifically towards individuals coping with mental health struggles compounded by traumatic experiences like self-harm attempts.

Nurses provided diligent wound care management around the clock, ensuring meticulous dressing changes and monitoring for any signs of infection. Pain management was also a key aspect of their care plan, aiming to alleviate his physical discomfort while promoting psychological well-being.

Physical and occupational therapists worked alongside the patient to gradually regain functionality and mobility in his affected extremities. This process involved gentle stretching exercises, range-of-motion activities, as well as adapting his daily routines to maximize independence while minimizing pain.

The burn team also collaborated closely with specialists in plastic surgery and wound care management. As the patient progressed through the healing stages of his burns, plastic surgeons became involved in reconstructive procedures to improve both aesthetics and functionality. These interventions included skin grafts, tissue expansion techniques, and scar revision surgeries.

Throughout his extended stay in the hospital, family support played an essential role in reinforcing motivation and fostering hope for a brighter future. Regular family meetings were conducted with psychiatrists present to address any concerns or questions they may have had regarding their loved one's mental health journey.

As this mentally ill man underwent comprehensive burn care treatment over 66 days including multiple debridement surgeries, he experienced significant physical healing along with ongoing psychological support for managing his underlying mental health condition. The collaborative efforts of the entire healthcare team proved indispensable in helping him find new hope on his path toward recovery from this traumatic event.
