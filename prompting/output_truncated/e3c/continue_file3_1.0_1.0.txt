During his hospital stay, the patient received specialized burn care from a multidisciplinary team consisting of burn surgeons, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, psychiatrists, and social workers. The primary aim of his treatment was to manage his physical wounds while also addressing his underlying mental health condition.

Immediately after admission, the patient underwent thorough debridement surgeries to remove any devitalized tissue and reduce the risk of infection. The initial surgery involved removing necrotic tissue from all affected areas of his body. Subsequent debridements were performed at regular intervals to ensure proper wound healing. As a result of these procedures, healthy granulation tissue began to form in the wound beds.

To aid in this process and prevent infections or complications, the patient received topical dressings such as silver sulfadiazine or hydrocolloids on open areas while non-adherent dressings were used on closed wounds. Regular wound cleaning and dressing changes were conducted by the nursing staff to maintain a clean environment around the burns.

Moreover, physiotherapy played a crucial role in maintaining joint mobility and preventing contractures during the healing process. Daily range-of-motion exercises were initiated for all affected joints including shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees,and ankles to improve flexibility.

Given that psychiatric support was equally important for the patient's recovery journey; he received close monitoring by psychiatrists who implemented appropriate medication management strategies alongside individual counseling sessions with trained psychologists. The psychiatric team aimed at stabilizing his mental health condition by addressing suicidal ideation as well as providing coping mechanisms for stressors related to both his recent suicide attempt and ongoing burn treatment.

Throughout his extended hospitalization period,the patient showed gradual improvement both physically and mentally.His wounds gradually healed with minimal scarring thanks to effective care interventions.Throughout this time,his rehabilitation program also included occupational therapy sessions aimed at reintegrating him into daily activities such as grooming,dressing himself,and writing.These sessions played a vital role in restoring his independence and overall well-being,adding to his successful recovery.

Overall, the multidisciplinary approach implemented by the healthcare team significantly contributed to the patient's healing process. The combination of wound management, psychosocial support, and rehabilitation services enabled this 35-year-old man to gradually regain his physical and mental health. Going forward, it remains vital for him to continue receiving long-term psychiatric care and counseling to prevent future relapses or crises.
