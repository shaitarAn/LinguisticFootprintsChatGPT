Title: A 42-year-old Woman with Bipolar Disorder Presenting with Self-inflicted Burns

Clinical Background:
Ms. A is a 42-year-old woman who was transferred from a local psychiatric hospital following a self-inflicted burn injury. She has a known history of bipolar disorder and had attempted suicide by fire approximately three days before admission to our facility. The patient sustained burns over various regions of her body, affecting an estimated total body surface area (TBSA) of approximately 40%.

Presenting Injury:
Ms. A's injuries are categorized as mixed-depth burns, involving both full-thickness and partial-thickness burns. The affected areas include her face and neck (estimated at 7%), both upper extremities (10%), right thigh (6%), left thigh and leg (4%), as well as the majority of her anterior and posterior trunk (13%). 

Hospitalization Course:
Upon admission, Ms. A was immediately admitted to the burn unit for comprehensive management of her injuries alongside specialized psychiatric care due to her mental health condition. Over the course of her hospital stay, she underwent five debridement surgeries to remove necrotic tissue and facilitate wound healing.

Treatment Timeline:
1. Day 1: Initial assessment, stabilization, pain management initiation.
2. Day 3: First surgical debridement performed.
3. Day 5: Wound dressings applied using silver sulfadiazine cream.
4. Day 10: Second surgical debridement performed along with application of autografts on selected areas.
5. Day 20: Third surgical procedure carried out for further debridement and grafting.
6. Day 35: Fourth surgical intervention conducted for skin graft reinforcement in critical areas.
7 .Day 50: Fifth surgery focused on scar revision procedures.

Psychiatric Management:
In collaboration with the psychiatric team, Ms.A's bipolar disorder was managed using mood stabilizers such as lithium and atypical antipsychotic medications. She received daily counseling sessions to address her emotional distress, coping strategies, and suicide prevention.

Length of Stay:
Ms. A required an extensive hospitalization period of 66 days due to the severity and extent of her burn injuries, as well as the need for concurrent psychiatric care.

Outcome:
Despite the challenging circumstances, Ms. A exhibited gradual improvement throughout her hospitalization course. Regular wound care, surgical interventions, pain management strategies, and psychiatric support played vital roles in facilitating her physical and mental recovery. Upon discharge from our facility, she was referred to a comprehensive rehabilitation program consisting of physical therapy for scar management and occupational therapy for functional restoration.

Conclusion:
This clinical case highlights the complex care provided to a 42-year-old woman with bipolar disorder who presented with self-inflicted burns involving multiple body regions. The multidisciplinary approach integrating burn management protocols with psychiatric interventions proved crucial in addressing both physical
