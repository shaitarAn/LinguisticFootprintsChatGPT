Clinical Case: A 32-year-old mentally ill woman was referred to our hospital after a suicide attempt by self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The patient had a history of bipolar disorder, classified as ICD 10 F31.9, and was not compliant with her medication regimen. She had sustained extensive injuries, with full-thickness burns involving approximately 45% of her total body surface area (TBSA). The burns affected her face and neck (6%), both upper extremities (10%), bilateral thighs and legs (8%), and anterior and posterior trunk (13%).

Upon admission, the patient weighed 55 kg with a height of 165 cm, resulting in a calculated body mass index (BMI) of 20.2 kg/m²—within the normal range. Due to the severity of her injuries, immediate surgical intervention was required to debride the burned tissue. A total of six debridement surgeries were performed over a period of three months.

The patient's nutrition status was assessed one week after admission due to the complexity of her injuries and initial stabilization requirements. No gastrointestinal symptoms or signs were observed during this assessment; however, it was reported that she had refused most food offerings during this time and relied on smoking cigarettes for appetite suppression.

Objective measurements indicated an albumin level within normal limits at 4 g/L but revealed imbalanced electrolyte levels due to fluid shifts as expected in burn patients.

Based on subjective global assessment (SGA), the patient fell into category B—moderately malnourished—due to recent weight loss caused by poor oral intake since admission.

To address nutritional deficiencies promptly, an enteral nutrition plan was initiated at an energy intake level of 25 kcal/kg per day along with protein supplementation at 1 g/kg per day via oral nutrition supplements (ONS). Additionally, micronutrient supplementation including vitamin A at a dose of 50,000 units for the first week, vitamin C at 100 mg twice daily, and zinc at 20 mg once daily was prescribed.

Despite aggressive nutritional support, the patient's weight continued to decline. By the end of the second week, her body weight had decreased to 52 kg with an albumin level of 3.8 g/L. To combat ongoing weight loss and malnutrition, the energy intake was increased to 30 kcal/kg per day with a protein target of 1.5 g/kg per day using a combination of oral nutrition and ONS in a ratio of 60:40.

Throughout her hospitalization period, the patient displayed erratic appetite patterns, often refusing enteral feedings and ONS due to pain and discomfort associated with her injuries. Multiple analgesics were administered; however, they provided limited relief from pain.

Due to persistent inadequate oral intake and progressive malnutrition despite maximum enteral support efforts, partial parenteral nutrition (PN) enriched with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) was introduced on day 21 to fulfill her protein requirements while
