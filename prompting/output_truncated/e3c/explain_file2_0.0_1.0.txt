This clinical case describes a patient who presented with various symptoms and signs that led to the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in pregnancy. The patient had no known chronic illnesses, such as diabetes or hypertension, and denied any alcohol consumption or smoking. She was also not aware of her hepatitis status.

Upon examination, the patient exhibited wasting, mild pallor, and a tinge of jaundice. However, she was well hydrated and had no fever or palpable lymph nodes. Palmer erythema (redness on the palms) was observed but there were no signs of clubbing (enlargement of fingertips) or parotid enlargement (swelling of salivary glands). Respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.

The abdomen examination revealed gross distension with a distorted contour in the upper half and visibly distended anterior abdominal wall veins draining away from the umbilicus. The liver was enlarged 12cm below the costal margin with a span of 17cm. It felt hard and nodular with an irregular edge and mild tenderness on palpation. A bruit (abnormal sound) was heard upon auscultation. The spleen was not palpable but there was mild ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen) and bipedal edema up to mid-shin.

Further assessment showed that she had a symphysio fundal height measuring 26 cm, indicating longitudinal lie (positioning of fetus along mother's spine) with breech presentation (baby's buttocks positioned to be delivered first). Fetal heart rate was regular at 134 beats per minute.

Laboratory tests revealed low hemoglobin levels at 10.3g/dl but normal bilirubin levels. White blood cell count showed neutrophils at 59.3%, lymphocytes at 26.1%, monocytes at 10.1%, and eosinophils at 2.7%. Platelet count was within the normal range at 350,000/ul. Total protein and albumin levels were low at 44g/L and 29g/L, respectively. The international normalized ratio (INR), a measure of blood clotting, was elevated at 1.3.

Further investigations revealed that the patient tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) but negative for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Her HBV DNA level was measured to be 126,869 IU/ml, indicating a high viral load. She tested negative for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Additionally, she had a positive VDRL test result (indicating exposure to syphilis) but TPHA testing was not performed.

Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions. The liver size measured 17.2cm with mild ascites present. Pelvic scan confirmed the presence of a fetus at approximately 27 weeks and three days gestation with active fetal movements.

Based on these findings, the revised diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation in pregnancy.

The patient's management included analgesia for pain relief as well as furosemide and spironolactone to manage ascites and edema associated with liver dysfunction. Lamivudine was also added to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B infection.

The initial plan was to allow the pregnancy to continue until at least 32 completed weeks in order to improve neonatal survival chances; however, due to progressive unbearable abdominal pain, the pregnancy was terminated successfully via induction of labor at 30 weeks and three days gestation. Unfortunately, this resulted in a stillbirth weighing approximately 1.2kg.

Post-delivery, the patient experienced marked reduction in pain and was discharged home after five days. She was scheduled for a follow-up visit at the gastrointestinal clinic but was lost to follow-up after two and four weeks post-discharge.
