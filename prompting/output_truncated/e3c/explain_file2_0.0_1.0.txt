This clinical case describes a 36-year-old pregnant woman who presented with a 3-month history of abdominal pain. The pain was located in the upper part of her abdomen and gradually worsened over time. She also experienced intermittent radiation of the pain to her chest. The patient had significant weight loss but no other associated symptoms such as early satiety, jaundice, fever, itch, or spontaneous bleeding.

Upon examination, the patient showed signs of wasting (weight loss), mild pallor (pale skin), and a tinge of jaundice (yellowing of the skin). Her abdomen was distended and had visibly distended veins on the anterior abdominal wall. The liver was enlarged and hard with nodules and an irregular edge. There was also mild tenderness in the liver area.

Further investigations revealed low levels of hemoglobin (HB) at 10.3g/dl, elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 10200 cells/dl with increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes, raised liver enzymes including gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), low levels of total protein and albumin, prolonged international normalized ratio (INR), positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) indicating hepatitis B infection with high viral load, positive VDRL test indicating syphilis infection but TPHA test not done yet for confirmation, elevated alpha-fetoprotein level (>50000KU/L) suggesting hepatocellular carcinoma.

Abdominal ultrasound showed an abnormal liver appearance with multiple hypoechoic lesions along with mild ascites. Pelvic scan confirmed a viable fetus at 27 weeks gestation.

The initial diagnosis made was hepatocellular carcinoma in pregnancy due to the presence of an enlarged liver with nodules on examination along with laboratory findings suggestive of liver dysfunction and high alpha-fetoprotein levels.

The patient was managed with pain relief medication, diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone) to manage ascites and edema, and lamivudine to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B. The plan was to continue the pregnancy until at least 32 weeks gestation for better neonatal outcomes. However, due to progressive unbearable abdominal pain, the pregnancy was terminated at 30 weeks and 3 days by inducing labor. The outcome was a stillbirth weighing 1.2kg.

After delivery, the patient's pain significantly reduced, and she was discharged home after five days. She had a follow-up visit scheduled at the gastrointestinal clinic but unfortunately was lost to follow-up after two visits.

It is important for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in pregnancy to receive appropriate management and follow-up care due to the complexity of their condition.
