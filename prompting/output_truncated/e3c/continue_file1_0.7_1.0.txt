Upon further examination, the patient's medical history revealed that she had been diagnosed with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) at a very young age. SWS is a rare congenital disorder characterized by abnormal blood vessel development in the brain, skin, and eyes. It typically presents with a facial birthmark called a port-wine stain, which was also present in this patient.

The patient's seizures during infancy were consistent with the neurological manifestations commonly associated with SWS. The attacks of tonic-clonic contractions indicated that she had experienced generalized seizures. These seizures are believed to be caused by abnormal blood flow and increased pressure in the affected areas of the brain.

In addition to her seizures, this young woman had been experiencing frequent non-pulsating headaches for the past two years. These headaches were not accompanied by nausea or other aura-like symptoms commonly seen in migraines. Furthermore, they did not worsen with physical activity but responded well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The pain was bilateral, generalized, and described as pressing in quality.

Given her medical history and symptoms, it was important to rule out other potential causes of her headaches such as migraines or intracranial hypertension. Migraine headaches typically have specific characteristics such as pulsating pain on one side of the head accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light or sound. Intracranial hypertension is a condition characterized by increased pressure within the skull that can cause persistent headaches.

To further evaluate her condition and determine an appropriate treatment plan, additional investigations were conducted. Imaging studies including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed to assess any structural abnormalities within her brain related to SWS or other potential causes for her symptoms.

The MRI revealed characteristic findings associated with SWS including leptomeningeal angiomas â€“ abnormal blood vessels located on the surface of the brain - as well as cortical calcifications known as "tram-track" calcifications. These findings provided further evidence supporting her diagnosis.

Given the patient's significant medical history, it was crucial to approach her treatment plan with care and consideration for all aspects of her condition. The management of SWS typically involves a multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists, dermatologists, ophthalmologists, and other specialists as needed.

For the management of her headaches specifically, a combination of pharmacological interventions and lifestyle modifications were recommended. NSAIDs could continue to be used for acute pain relief; however, caution was advised regarding their long-term use due to potential adverse effects.

Furthermore, stress-reduction techniques and relaxation exercises were suggested as non-pharmacological approaches that may help alleviate symptoms. Regular exercise and maintaining a balanced diet were also encouraged as these lifestyle changes have been shown to have positive effects on overall health and headache management.

Close monitoring by a neurologist would be necessary in order to assess the effectiveness of the treatment plan over time and make any necessary adjustments based on the patient's response.

In conclusion, this case highlights the complex nature of Sturge-Weber Syndrome and its associated symptoms. The presence of frequent headaches in this young woman with SWS required careful evaluation to differentiate them from other potential causes such as migraines or intracranial hypertension. A comprehensive treatment plan involving multiple specialties was implemented in order to address all aspects of her condition effectively. Continued monitoring will be essential in ensuring optimal management for this patient moving forward.
