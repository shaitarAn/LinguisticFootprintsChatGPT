This clinical case describes a patient who presented with various symptoms and signs that led to a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) during pregnancy. The patient had no known chronic illnesses, such as diabetes or hypertension, and denied any alcohol or smoking history. She also did not have any respiratory, cardiovascular, or urogenital symptoms.

On examination, the patient showed wasting (unintentional weight loss), mild pallor (pale appearance), a tinge of jaundice (yellowing of the skin), and palmar erythema (redness of the palms). There were no clubbing (enlargement of the fingertips) or parotid enlargement (swelling of the salivary glands). The abdomen was grossly distended (swollen) with visible distended veins on the anterior abdominal wall. The liver was enlarged, hard, nodular, and tender, with a bruit (abnormal sound) on auscultation. Mild ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) and bipedal edema (swelling of the lower extremities) were also present.

Further assessment revealed a fetal presentation of breech (baby positioned feet or buttocks first) and an elevated fetal heart rate. Laboratory tests showed low hemoglobin levels, elevated white blood cell count with increased neutrophils, low platelet count, abnormal liver function tests (raised GGT and AST), low total protein and albumin levels, and an elevated INR (a measure of blood clotting ability). The patient tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and had a high viral load of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. She also tested positive for VDRL (a test for syphilis) but TPHA (a confirmatory test for syphilis) was not done. The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, a tumor marker, was significantly elevated.

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions (dark areas). A pelvic scan confirmed the gestational age of the fetus. The revised diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation during pregnancy.

The patient was managed with pain relief medication, diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone) to manage ascites and edema, and lamivudine to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B. The plan was to continue the pregnancy until at least 32 weeks to improve the chances of neonatal survival. However, due to progressive abdominal pain, the pregnancy was terminated at 30 weeks and 3 days by inducing labor. The outcome was a stillbirth weighing 1.2kg. The patient's pain significantly reduced after delivery, and she was discharged home after 5 days. She was scheduled for a follow-up visit at the gastrointestinal clinic but was lost to follow-up after the initial post-discharge visits at 2 and 4 weeks.
