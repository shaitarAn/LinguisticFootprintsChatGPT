This clinical case describes a 36-year-old pregnant woman who presented with a 3-month history of abdominal pain. The pain was located in the upper part of her abdomen and gradually worsened over time. She also experienced intermittent radiation of the pain to her chest. The patient had significant weight loss but no other associated symptoms such as early satiety, jaundice, fever, itch, or spontaneous bleeding. She denied any history of blood transfusion, alcohol consumption, or smoking. On examination, she appeared wasted and had mild pallor and a tinge of jaundice. Her abdomen was distended, with visible distended veins on the anterior abdominal wall. The liver was enlarged, hard, nodular, and tender, with a bruit heard on auscultation. Mild ascites (fluid in the abdomen) and edema in the lower legs were also present. The initial diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) in pregnancy.

Laboratory tests revealed low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and had a high viral load of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, a tumor marker for liver cancer, was significantly elevated. Abdominal ultrasound showed a heterogeneous liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions, and a pelvic scan confirmed the gestational age of the fetus.

The patient was managed with pain relief medication, diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone) to manage the ascites and edema, and lamivudine to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B. The plan was to continue the pregnancy until at least 32 weeks to improve the chances of neonatal survival. However, due to the progressive and unbearable abdominal pain, the pregnancy was terminated at 30 weeks and 3 days by inducing labor. The outcome was a stillbirth weighing 1.2kg. The patient's pain significantly reduced after delivery, and she was discharged home after 5 days. She was scheduled for a follow-up visit at the gastrointestinal clinic but was lost to follow-up after the initial post-discharge visits at 2 and 4 weeks.
