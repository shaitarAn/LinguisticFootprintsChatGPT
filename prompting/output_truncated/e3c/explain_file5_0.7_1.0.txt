This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a fever, rash, and other symptoms. The patient was a grade ten scholar with no prior medical admissions or history of surgery. There was no significant medication or recreational drug use reported, and the patient had no known contact with COVID-19 cases.

On examination, the patient appeared ill and had a low blood pressure, high heart rate, and elevated temperature. They were restless but showed no signs of cognitive dysfunction. A maculopapular rash was observed on various parts of the body, including the torso, limbs, and hands. The rash was non-tender and accompanied by lesions over the eyelids and conjunctivitis.

Further investigations were conducted to determine the cause of the symptoms. Blood tests revealed elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers. However, blood and urine cultures came back negative for any infections. A lumbar puncture showed normal results as did chest radiographs and abdominal sonar.

Initially considering several infectious causes such as viral infections like HIV seroconversion or acute infections from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or herpes simplex virus (HSV), bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Neisseria meningitidis were also considered. Non-infectious differential diagnoses included Kawasaki-like disease (KD) or adult onset Still's disease (AOSD). Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was also considered due to fever, rash, and low complement levels.

Based on an elevated temperature along with rising CRP levels and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), a diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children/Adolescents Associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection(MIS-C) was made.

Treatment involved fluid administration but with no significant improvement in the patient's condition. Empiric antibiotics were given, and corticosteroids were initiated but later discontinued due to concerns of infection. A repeat echocardiogram revealed severe cardiac dysfunction, and the patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) along with dobutamine infusion and diuresis.

Serological testing confirmed the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, indicating a previous infection. The patient's condition improved gradually with resolution of fever, rash, and normalization of inflammatory markers. Aspirin and anticoagulant therapy were added due to thrombotic risk.

Follow-up visits showed complete recovery with no residual symptoms. The patient's echocardiogram showed improved cardiac function without pericardial effusion. Medications were tapered off gradually, and the patient returned to school.

In conclusion, this case describes a young individual who presented with symptoms consistent with MIS-C associated with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management led to successful recovery in this case.
