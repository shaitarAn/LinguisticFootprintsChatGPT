Clinical Case: A 55-year-old woman with severe burns following a house fire

Patient Profile:
Mrs. Emily Turner, a 55-year-old female, was admitted to the burn unit of our hospital after sustaining extensive burn injuries in a house fire. She has a history of depression and anxiety which had been managed with antidepressant medication until six months ago when she stopped taking her medications.

Presenting Condition:
The patient was found unconscious at the scene of the accident and brought to our hospital via emergency medical services. On arrival, she had significant full-thickness burns involving approximately 45% of her total body surface area (TBSA). The affected areas included her face and neck (7%), both upper extremities (12%), right thigh (6%), left thigh and leg (5%), as well as substantial portions of her anterior and posterior trunk (15%).

Initial Management:
After initial resuscitation with intravenous fluids to stabilize her blood pressure, Mrs. Turner underwent immediate assessment by our multidisciplinary team comprising plastic surgeons, nurses, psychiatrists, and psychologists. She underwent five debridement surgeries during her prolonged hospital stay spanning over 75 days.

Psychiatric Assessment:
Due to her psychiatric history as well as the nature of the injury itself, Mrs. Turner's mental health condition was closely monitored throughout her hospitalization period. An urgent psychiatric consultation led to the diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features in context with suicidal ideation.

Mrs. Turner's mental state deteriorated rapidly during the early phase of recovery from burns due to emotional trauma resulting from witnessing multiple family members succumb in the fire incident.

Management Plan:
Treatment for Mrs.Turner involved addressing both physical wound care and psychiatric needs simultaneously. Her burns were consistently attended by daily dressing changes along with topical antimicrobial therapy aimed at preventing infection in compromised tissues.

Psychiatric treatment consisted primarily of psychotherapy sessions conducted weekly by an experienced psychologist who specialized in trauma intervention. Pharmacotherapy, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and atypical antipsychotics, was initiated to manage her depressive symptoms and psychosis.

While Mrs. Turner's physical recovery progressed steadily with wound healing and rehabilitation exercises, her mental health required intensive interventions to prevent further psychological deterioration.

Outcome:
After a lengthy hospital stay accompanied by intensive psychiatric interventions, Mrs. Turner made significant progress in regaining both physical and mental well-being. Her depressive symptoms improved considerably over time with pharmacotherapy combined with psychotherapy sessions focused on emotional processing, coping skills development, and relapse prevention.

At the time of discharge, her burns had healed sufficiently for outpatient care management under the guidance of plastic surgeons specializing in reconstructive surgery for burn patients.

Conclusion:
This case illustrates the complex relationship between physical injuries and mental health in burn patients. The importance of integrated medical care involving a multidisciplinary team cannot be underestimated when managing individuals facing such significant challenges. By addressing not only the visible wounds but also providing comprehensive psychiatric support throughout treatment, healthcare providers can significantly contribute to optimal patient outcomes while enhancing their overall quality of life.
