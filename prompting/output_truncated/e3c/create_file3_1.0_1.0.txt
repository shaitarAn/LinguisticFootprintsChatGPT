Case Study: A 38-year-old woman with severe depression and history of self-harm

History:
The patient, a 38-year-old woman, was admitted to our psychiatric facility following a suicide attempt by self-inflicted injuries three days prior to admission. She presented with multiple full- and partial-thickness burns covering approximately 42% of her total body surface area (TBSA). The burns involved the face and neck (6%), both upper extremities (10%), right thigh (5%), left thigh and leg (4%), as well as the anterior and posterior trunk region (17%). Prior to admission, she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder according to DSM-5 criteria.

Clinical Course:
Upon admission, the patient was started on appropriate pharmacotherapy for depression, including sertraline 50 mg daily. Due to her history of self-destructive behavior during periods of extreme distress, intermittent physical restraints were employed for short periods to ensure her safety.

Nutritional Assessment:
The patient's nutrition status was evaluated within the first week of hospitalization. At baseline assessment, she weighed 48 kilograms with a height of 160 cm, resulting in a BMI of 18.75 kg/m2 - indicating being underweight. Although there were no apparent gastrointestinal symptoms or signs during evaluation; however, information regarding her recent dietary intake prior to admission or any weight changes over the last six months could not be obtained accurately due to inconsistent recall ability caused by her mental health condition.

Malnutrition Evaluation:
Accordingly subjective global assessment (SGA) tool classification at baseline indicated that she belonged in category B - moderately malnourished. Her serum albumin levels were within normal range at 3.9 g/L; however electrolyte imbalances were observed.

Nutrition Intervention:
A nutrition management plan had been initiated from this stage onwards based on calculated energy requirements starting at an initial rate of 25 kcal/kg gradually increasing to 35 kcal/kg, and protein needs at 1.2 g/kg were divided into oral nutrition intake and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) with a ratio of 60:40 respectively. Additionally, micronutrient supplementation including vitamin A (5000 IU), vitamin C (250 mg), and zinc (20 mg) daily was prescribed.

Progress:
During the first two weeks of hospitalization, the patient showed minimal improvement in her depressive symptoms but continued to exhibit low appetite resulting in weight loss. By the end of the second week, her body weight dropped to 45 kilograms while her serum albumin levels decreased to 3.2 g/L - indicative of ongoing malnourishment.

Challenging Course:
The patient's volatile mood and fluctuating appetite posed significant challenges to maintaining an optimal nutrition plan. Attempts to establish reliable enteral access were met with resistance as she displayed severe agitation during such procedures despite adequate analgesic medications and sedation attempts. Considering these limitations, partial parenteral nutrition with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) was initiated alongside ongoing enteral support for protein requirements.

Outcome:
Despite aggressive interventions, the patient's BMI continued its downward trend
