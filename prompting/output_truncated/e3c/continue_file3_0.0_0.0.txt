During his 66-day hospitalization, the 35-year-old mentally ill man received comprehensive care to address his physical and mental health needs. The primary focus was on managing his extensive burn injuries, which covered approximately 38% of his total body surface area (TBSA). These injuries included full- and partial-thickness burns on various parts of his body, including his face and neck (5%), both upper extremities (8%), right thigh (4%), left thigh and leg (3%), and most of his anterior and posterior trunk (16%).

Upon admission, the patient was in critical condition due to the severity of his burns. He had undergone an attempted suicide by fire just three days prior, which had resulted in significant tissue damage and potential complications. The medical team immediately initiated a series of debridement surgeries to remove necrotic tissue and prevent infection.

Over the course of his hospital stay, the patient underwent a total of five debridement surgeries. These procedures involved the careful removal of dead or damaged tissue to promote healing and reduce the risk of infection. Each surgery required meticulous attention to detail, as the burns covered multiple areas of the body, including sensitive regions such as the face and neck.

In addition to surgical interventions, the patient received extensive wound care to facilitate healing and prevent complications. This involved regular dressing changes, application of topical medications, and the use of specialized wound care products. The medical team closely monitored the patient's wounds for signs of infection or other complications, adjusting the treatment plan as necessary.

Beyond the physical aspects of his care, the patient also received comprehensive mental health support. Given his history of mental illness and the circumstances surrounding his suicide attempt, it was crucial to address his psychological well-being alongside his physical recovery. A multidisciplinary team, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers, worked together to provide counseling, therapy, and medication management.

The patient's mental health treatment aimed to address the underlying factors contributing to his suicide attempt and support his overall well-being. This involved individual therapy sessions to explore his thoughts and emotions, group therapy to connect with others facing similar challenges, and medication to manage any underlying mental health conditions.

Throughout his hospitalization, the patient's progress was closely monitored. Regular assessments were conducted to evaluate the healing of his burns, track his mental health stability, and ensure his overall well-being. As his physical condition improved, the focus shifted towards rehabilitation and functional recovery.

Physical therapy played a crucial role in helping the patient regain mobility and independence. The therapy sessions included exercises to improve range of motion, strength training, and activities to enhance coordination and balance. Occupational therapy was also provided to assist the patient in relearning daily activities and adapting to any functional limitations resulting from his injuries.

As the patient's hospital stay neared its end, a comprehensive discharge plan was developed to ensure a smooth transition to the community. This plan included referrals to outpatient mental health services, continued wound care, and ongoing physical and occupational therapy. The patient's support network, including family and friends, was actively involved in the planning process to provide a strong foundation for his continued recovery.

The 35-year-old mentally ill man's journey from attempted suicide by fire to his eventual discharge from the hospital was a challenging and complex one. However, with the dedicated care
