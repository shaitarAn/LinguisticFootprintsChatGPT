This clinical case describes a 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). SWS is a rare neurological disorder characterized by the presence of a facial birthmark called a port wine stain, neurological abnormalities, and eye problems.

The patient presented with a history of frequent non-pulsating headaches that had been occurring for the past two years. These headaches were relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and were not worsened by physical activity. There were no accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura. The headaches lasted for hours and were bilateral, generalized, and pressing in quality.

The patient also had a history of seizures since the fifteenth day of life, which led to the diagnosis of SWS. At the age of 6, she underwent a callosotomy procedure to control her seizures. However, at the age of 18, she experienced a seizure after undergoing laser treatment for her port wine birthmark. Since then, she has been prescribed carbamazepine, an antiepileptic medication, and has not had any seizures.

In terms of her cognitive development, the patient had a normal infancy but struggled academically and is considered to be mildly mentally retarded. She also had a family history of a port wine stain in her elder sister, but no further investigations were done regarding her sister's condition.

On physical examination, the patient had a facial nevus (port wine stain) on the right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. Intraoral examination revealed an overgrowth of gingiva (gums) on the right side, which appeared bright red and showed blanching upon pressure, suggesting angiomatous enlargement. There was also mild asymmetry in her extremities, with her left arm and leg being slightly smaller and exhibiting hemiparesis (weakness) on the same side. Ophthalmological evaluation revealed glaucoma in her right eye.

Psychiatric examination showed signs of an anxiety disorder, for which she was prescribed ketiapin and venlafaxine. She was also prescribed NSAIDs for her headaches. After one week of treatment, her headaches slightly decreased in intensity but the frequency remained the same.

Imaging studies, including cranial CT scans and MRI, revealed diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere, irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area, and multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere was also found to be smaller than the left, and there were extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle and other areas.

In summary, this patient with SWS presented with a history of frequent headaches, seizures, cognitive impairment, facial nevus, gingival overgrowth, hemiparesis, glaucoma, and anxiety disorder. The imaging studies confirmed the presence of brain abnormalities consistent with SWS. The patient's treatment included antiepileptic medication, NSAIDs, and medications for anxiety disorder.
