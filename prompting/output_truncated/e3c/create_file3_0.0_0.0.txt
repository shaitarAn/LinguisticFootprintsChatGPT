Clinical Case: A 45-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder was admitted to the hospital following a suicide attempt by overdose 4 days prior to admission. She sustained extensive burns involving approximately 42% of her total body surface area (TBSA). The burn injuries included her face and neck (6%), both upper extremities (10%), right thigh (5%), left thigh and leg (4%), and the majority of her anterior and posterior trunk (17%). The patient required an extended hospital stay of 70 days and underwent six debridement surgeries to manage her injuries.

The patient, Ms. A, had a long-standing history of bipolar disorder, characterized by recurrent episodes of depression and mania. She had been under the care of a psychiatrist and was prescribed mood stabilizers and antidepressant medications. Despite her treatment, she experienced a severe depressive episode, leading to her suicide attempt.

Upon admission, Ms. A was in a stable condition but exhibited signs of significant distress and emotional instability. Physical examination revealed extensive burns with varying degrees of injury. The burns on her face and neck were deep and involved the underlying tissues, while the burns on her upper extremities, thighs, and legs ranged from superficial to full-thickness injuries.

The patient's initial management involved immediate resuscitation and stabilization. Intravenous fluids were administered to maintain adequate hydration and electrolyte balance. Pain management was initiated using a combination of intravenous opioids and non-opioid analgesics. Ms. A was also started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent infection, considering the extensive nature of her burns.

Over the course of her hospitalization, Ms. A underwent multiple debridement surgeries to remove necrotic tissue and promote wound healing. Each surgery was performed under general anesthesia, and the wounds were meticulously cleaned and dressed with appropriate wound care products. The patient received regular physical therapy and occupational therapy to prevent contractures and maintain functional mobility.

Psychiatric support was an integral part of Ms. A's care throughout her hospital stay. She was closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric nurses. Individual and group therapy sessions were conducted to address her underlying mental health condition and provide coping strategies to manage her emotional distress.

As her physical and psychological condition improved, Ms. A's treatment plan was gradually transitioned to an outpatient setting. She was referred to a specialized burn rehabilitation center for ongoing wound care, scar management, and psychological support. Close follow-up with her psychiatrist was arranged to ensure optimal management of her bipolar disorder and prevent future
