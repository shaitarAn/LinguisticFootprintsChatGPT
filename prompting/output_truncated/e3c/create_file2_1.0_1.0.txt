A 42-year-old female teacher, gravida 3 para 2 at 25 weeks gestation, presented to our clinic with a chief complaint of chronic upper abdominal pain for the past 4 months. The pain was gradual in onset, dull in nature, and constant. There was no specific aggravating or relieving factor reported, but she did mention occasional radiation of the pain to her back. She denied any associated symptoms such as jaundice, fever, itching, or weight loss. There was no history of blood transfusion and she had been taking her routine prenatal vitamins from the antenatal clinic.

The patient had no known medical conditions including diabetes and hypertension. She denied any alcohol consumption or smoking history. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were normal upon initial assessment. Neurological examination also showed no abnormalities.

Physical examination revealed that she appeared well-nourished but had mild pallor. There were no palpable lymph nodes, clubbing of fingers/toes or parotid enlargement observed. Abdominal examination showed distention with an altered contour in the upper region along with prominent distended veins on the anterior abdominal wall away from the umbilicus area. On palpation of her liver revealed hepatomegaly measuring about 11 cm below costal margin with a span of 16 cm (enlarged) exhibiting hardness and nodularity along its edge leading to slight tenderness during examination.

Laboratory tests revealed hemoglobin levels at 11 g/dL and normal white blood cell count (8000 cells/dL), differential counts were within normal limits . Liver function tests indicated elevated GGT and AST levels (3 times upper limit). Total protein level was slightly low at 46 g/L while albumin measured at a lower range -27 g/L.Observered INR levels also showed slight elevation (1.2). Serology results showed positive HBsAg indicating hepatitis B infection; however HBeAg was negative and HBV DNA level measured 10000 IU/mL. Hepatitis C and HIV test results were both negative. Further imaging investigations were conducted, including an abdominal ultrasound which revealed a coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions. The liver size was increased â€“ measuring 16 cm - along with mild ascites.

Given the clinical presentation and findings, a provisional diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver during pregnancy was made for this patient. The management plan involved providing analgesia for pain relief along with prescribing furosemide and spironolactone to manage the ascites. Additionally, lamivudine was added to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the hepatitis B infection.

The initial goal was to continue the pregnancy until at least 32 completed weeks gestation in order to optimize neonatal survival chances. However, due to worsening unbearable abdominal pain, it was decided to terminate the pregnancy at 30 weeks and 3 days via successful induction of labor. The outcome resulted in a fresh stillbirth weighing approximately 1.5 kg.

Post-delivery, the patient experienced
