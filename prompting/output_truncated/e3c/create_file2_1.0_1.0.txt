A 42-year-old male accountant presented to the outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of chronic abdominal pain for the past 2 months. The patient reported that the pain had gradually developed and was primarily located in his left upper quadrant. He described it as a dull, persistent ache that occasionally radiated to his back.

Upon further inquiry, the patient mentioned experiencing intermittent episodes of nausea but denied vomiting or changes in appetite. There was no associated weight loss, early satiety, jaundice, fever, itchiness, or spontaneous bleeding. Upon reviewing his medical history, there were no records of blood transfusions and he reported taking routine multivitamins on a daily basis.

The patient's physical examination revealed tenderness upon palpation over the left upper quadrant. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count and liver function tests were within normal limits. A baseline ultrasound examination was performed which showed no significant abnormalities in the abdominal organs.

Given these findings and in consideration of our patient's symptoms and history, further diagnostic tests were ordered to investigate potential causes for his chronic abdominal pain. These included an upper endoscopy to assess for gastrointestinal abnormalities such as gastritis or peptic ulcers and an abdominal CT scan to evaluate possible structural abnormalities within the pancreas or surrounding areas.

We are currently awaiting results from these investigations in order to determine an accurate diagnosis for our patient's chronic abdominal pain. In future follow-up appointments, we will discuss treatment options based on these findings and continue managing any symptoms he may be experiencing during this time.
