This clinical case involves a patient who had a callosotomy at the age of 6 to control seizures, and at the age of 18, she experienced her first seizure since the surgery during a laser treatment for a birthmark. As a result, she was prescribed carbamazepine to prevent further seizures, and she has not had a seizure since starting this medication. However, her parents report that her development was normal during infancy but she struggled academically and is barely literate.

The patient's family history is unremarkable, except for her elder sister having a port wine stain birthmark on her face. No investigations were done regarding her sister's birthmark. The patient herself has a facial nevus (a mole-like birthmark) on her right forehead, right eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. She also has an overgrowth of gingiva (gums) on the right side of her mouth, which appears red and blanches (becomes pale) when pressure is applied, suggesting angiomatous enlargement. There is also mild asymmetry in her extremities, with her left arm and leg being slightly smaller and having hemiparesis (weakness) in both the upper and lower extremities on the same side.

The patient has been diagnosed with glaucoma in her right eye, and she is also being treated for anxiety disorder and chronic headaches. She is prescribed ketiapin and venlafaxine for anxiety, as well as NSAID drugs for her headaches. While the heaviness of her headaches decreased slightly after starting treatment, the frequency remains the same.

On neurologic examination, the patient only shows remarkable findings related to her hemiparesis. Cranial CT scans reveal diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI shows multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere, as well as the diffuse atrophy on the same side. There is also asymmetry in calvarial thickness, with the right side being thicker compared to the left, and the right hemisphere is smaller than the left. T2 weighted MRI reveals extensive venous formations around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle, the Gallen vein localization, and widespread vascular formations in perivascular spaces and specific areas of the brain.

The patient underwent a proteus intelligence test, which indicated a score of 75, suggesting mild mental retardation.

Based on the given information, it appears that this patient has a complex condition involving neurological, vascular, and developmental abnormalities. It is important for the medical team to continue evaluating and managing her symptoms
