This clinical case involves a 21-year-old female patient who has been diagnosed with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). The patient has been experiencing frequent non-pulsating headaches for the past two years. These headaches are relieved with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and are not worsened by physical activity. There are no accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura.

The patient's family history does not show any instances of headaches, but her elder sister has a port wine stain on her face, which is a common feature of SWS. The patient herself also has a facial nevus (a birthmark caused by a choroid angioma) on the right side of her forehead, eyelid, nasal wing, and cheek. A physical examination reveals right-sided gingival overgrowth, which is red in color and blanches when pressure is applied, indicating angiomatous enlargement.

Neurologically, the patient has a history of seizures that started in the fifteenth day of her life, which led to her diagnosis of SWS. At the age of 6, she underwent a callosotomy procedure to help control her seizures. However, at the age of 18, she experienced another seizure during laser treatment for her port wine birthmark. Since then, she has been taking carbamazepine daily and has not had any seizures. 

In addition to the headaches and seizures, the patient has neurological abnormalities. There is mild asymmetry in her left arm and leg, with hemiparesis (weakness) on the same side. On ophthalmological evaluation, glaucoma is diagnosed in her right eye. On a psychiatric examination, signs of anxiety disorder are observed.

Diagnostic imaging reveals several abnormalities. Cranial CT scans show diffuse atrophy in the right hemisphere of the brain and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the right occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI reveals multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the right hemisphere, along with diffuse atrophy on the same side. Axial T1 and T2 weighted MRI scans show various venous formations and vascular abnormalities in the right hemisphere, including around the corpus of the right lateral ventricle, at the Gallen vein localization, and at the right temporooccipital area in the quadrigeminal cistern localization. These findings are consistent with the characteristic vascular malformations seen in SWS.

The patient underwent a proteus intelligence test, which showed a score of 75, indicating mild mental retardation. This cognitive impairment is often associated with SWS.

To manage her symptoms, the patient is currently prescribed ketiapin for anxiety, venlafaxine for both anxiety disorder and chronic headaches, and NSAID drugs for headache relief. Although the treatment has slightly decreased the heaviness of her headaches after one week, the frequency remains the same.

In summary, this clinical case involves a young female patient with Sturge-Weber syndrome, experiencing frequent non-pulsating headaches along with seizures, glaucoma, cognitive impairment, and
