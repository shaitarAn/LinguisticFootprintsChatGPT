A 32-year-old male patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS) was admitted to our clinic complaining of frequent headaches. He had been experiencing non-pulsating headaches for the past 3 years, with no worsening of pain associated with physical activity. The headaches would usually respond to over-the-counter pain relievers. There were no accompanying symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or aura.

The patient had a history of seizures, which started when he was 2 years old. These seizures were characterized by tonic-clonic contractions and led to the diagnosis of SWS. At the age of 6, he underwent a callosotomy procedure to control his seizures. However, at 18 years old, during a laser treatment for his port wine birthmark, he experienced his first seizure since the callosotomy. To manage his seizures, he was prescribed carbamazepine at a daily dose of 400 mg, which effectively controlled his seizures.

According to the patient's family, his development during infancy was normal, but he struggled academically and had difficulty graduating from elementary school. He had no significant family history except for his younger brother, who also had a port wine birthmark but had not been evaluated for SWS.

In addition to his seizures and headaches, the patient had been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. He was currently taking 25 mg of ketiapin daily for anxiety and venlafaxine 75 mg daily for both anxiety and chronic headaches. He was also prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for headache relief.

On physical examination, a port wine birthmark was observed on the patient's left forehead, eyelid, and cheek. The intraoral examination revealed an overgrowth of gingiva on the left side, which was bright red and showed angiomatous enlargement. Mild asymmetry was noted in the patient's extremities, with his left arm and leg appearing slightly smaller than the right. He also exhibited hemiparesis, affecting both the upper and lower extremities on the same side. Ophthalmological evaluation confirmed the presence of glaucoma in his left eye.

Psychiatric evaluation revealed symptoms consistent with anxiety disorder. Neurological examination, apart from the hemiparesis, did not yield any remarkable findings. Cranial CT scans showed diffuse atrophy on the left hemisphere and irregular double-contoured gyriform cortical calcifications in the occipital area. Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI revealed multiple dilated pial venous vascular structures on the left hemisphere, along with diffuse atrophy on the same side. Additionally, axial T1-weighted cranial MRI demonstrated thickening of the left calvarium compared to the right, and the left hemisphere appeared to be asymmetrical, smaller than the right. T2-weighted MRI showed extensive venous formations surrounding the corpus of the left lateral ventricle, as well as widespread vascular formations in the perivascular space anterior to the third ventricle and the right temporooccipital area at the quadrigeminal cistern.
