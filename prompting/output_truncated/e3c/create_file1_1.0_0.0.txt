Patient: A 35-year-old male with the diagnosis of Chronic Migraine presented to our clinic complaining of debilitating headaches. 

Medical History: The patient had a 5-year history of recurrent headaches that occurred at least 15 days per month. These headaches were non-pulsating and not aggravated by physical activity. The patient found some relief with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, although the effectiveness was limited. There were no associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or photophobia. The patient reported that the headaches typically lasted for several hours and were characterized by a bilateral, pressing sensation. 

Family History: The patient had a positive family history of migraines, with his father and sister experiencing similar symptoms. 

Presenting Symptoms: In addition to the persistent headaches, the patient complained of increased sensitivity to light and sound during episodes. He also reported occasional episodes of blurred vision and visual disturbances, typically preceding the onset of the headache. 

Medical Examination: The patient underwent a thorough physical examination, which yielded normal results. Neurological examination revealed no abnormalities. 

Psychosocial History: The patient reported experiencing significant stress due to work and family-related issues. He also reported poor sleep patterns and irregular meal times. 

Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with Chronic Migraine, meeting the criteria for headache occurring for at least 15 days per month for more than three months, with at least eight days fulfilling criteria for migraine without aura. The visual disturbances and sensitivity to light and sound were consistent with the prodromal symptoms often observed in migraines. 

Treatment Plan: The patient was prescribed a comprehensive treatment plan that included lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining regular sleep patterns, adopting a healthy diet, and managing stress levels. A prophylactic medication, specifically a beta-blocker, was prescribed to prevent the onset of migraines. The patient was also advised on the use of abortive medication to alleviate symptoms during acute episodes. 

Follow-up: The patient was scheduled for regular follow-up visits to assess the effectiveness of the treatment plan and to address any concerns or modifications required. A multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, psychiatry, and pain management specialists was considered to provide comprehensive care and improve the patient's quality of life.
