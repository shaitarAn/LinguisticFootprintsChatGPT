A 45-year-old male patient with a known diagnosis of migraines presented to our clinic complaining of chronic headaches. He reported a two-year history of frequent, non-pulsating headaches. The patient mentioned that his headaches were usually relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and were not exacerbated by physical activity. He denied experiencing any accompanying symptoms such as nausea or aura.

The headaches typically lasted for several hours and were described as bilateral, generalized, and pressing in nature. The patient had no family history of headaches or any other significant medical conditions. He had not previously sought medical attention for his headaches and had been managing them on his own with over-the-counter pain medications.

Upon further inquiry, the patient revealed that he had experienced occasional visual disturbances during some of his headaches. These disturbances were described as flashing lights or zigzag lines, lasting for approximately 20 minutes and then resolving spontaneously. He denied any history of seizures or other neurological symptoms.

The patient's vital signs were within normal limits, and a thorough physical examination did not reveal any significant abnormalities. Based on the patient's clinical presentation and history, a provisional diagnosis of migraines without aura was made.

In order to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other potential causes, further investigations were ordered. These included blood tests to assess for any underlying metabolic or systemic conditions, as well as a brain MRI to evaluate the possibility of any structural abnormalities.

The patient was advised to maintain a headache diary to track the frequency, duration, and intensity of his headaches, as well as any potential triggering factors. Additionally, he was educated about lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a regular sleep schedule, avoiding known triggers (such as certain foods or stress), and practicing relaxation techniques.

A follow-up appointment was scheduled to review the results of the investigations and to discuss the patient's progress. Treatment options, including preventive medications and acute pain management strategies, would be considered based on the severity and frequency of the headaches and the patient's response to lifestyle modifications.

Overall, the management plan for this patient with chronic headaches involved a comprehensive approach, including patient education, lifestyle modifications, and pharmacological interventions. The aim was to reduce the frequency and intensity of his headaches, improve his quality of life, and provide long-term relief from his symptoms.
