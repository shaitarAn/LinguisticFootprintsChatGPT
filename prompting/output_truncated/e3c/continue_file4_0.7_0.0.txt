On examination, baby NU appeared pale and lethargic. The absence of skin and skull bone was evident, exposing the underlying brain tissue. The exposed brain tissue appeared healthy and covered with a thin membrane. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable, with no other visible abnormalities.

Further investigations were ordered to determine the underlying cause of the baby's condition. A complete blood count was done, revealing mild anemia. The electrolyte levels were within normal limits. Genetic testing was also initiated to assess for any possible genetic disorders or abnormalities.
