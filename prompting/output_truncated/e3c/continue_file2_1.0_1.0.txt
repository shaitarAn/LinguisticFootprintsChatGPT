On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and fatigued. Her vital signs were stable, including normal blood pressure and heart rate. The abdomen was mildly distended, with tenderness noted in the epigastric region. There was no rebound tenderness or guarding.

Further investigations were conducted to determine the cause of her symptoms. Laboratory tests revealed a mild microcytic hypochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9 g/dL (normal range: 12-15 g/dL). Liver function tests and renal function were within normal limits.

An ultrasound of the abdomen showed mild hepatomegaly with no evidence of any gallstones or biliary tract abnormalities. The liver parenchyma appeared diffusely echogenic but there were no focal lesions or signs of cirrhosis.

In light of these findings, a gastroenterologist was consulted for further evaluation. Considering her symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, and epigastric tenderness along with radiation to the chest, suspicion for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) pathology such as peptic ulcer disease or gastritis was raised.

To confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, an upper GI endoscopy was scheduled for the patient. During the procedure, it revealed multiple gastric erosions predominantly in the body region without any active bleeding identified at that moment.

Biopsy samples from different areas within her stomach were taken for histopathological examination to assess for infection or malignancy as contributing factors to her symptoms.

While awaiting these results, management included symptomatic relief through lifestyle modifications such as avoiding spicy foods and adopting small frequent meals instead of large ones to reduce the potential irritation on gastric mucosa.

The patient's pain gradually improved over time but weight loss continued despite these measures being followed diligently. Two weeks later when histopathological results became available; it showed features consistent with chronic gastritis attributed likely due to Helicobacter pylori infection. This organism is known to cause epigastric pain, peptic ulcers, and chronic inflammation of gastric mucosa.

Therefore, the patient was prescribed a regimen consisting of triple therapy including a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) such as omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for 14 days to eradicate H. pylori infection.

After completing the course of antibiotics, the patient's abdominal pain significantly improved within a matter of weeks. Repeat endoscopy performed four months later revealed complete healing of gastric erosions and no active infection by H. pylori.

The patient's weight loss stabilized and she continued with regular prenatal visits to monitor her pregnancy progress. The remainder of her antenatal period proceeded without any major complications and she successfully delivered a healthy baby at term gestation.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering upper GI pathologies in pregnant patients presenting with epigastric pain and associated symptoms. Early diagnosis through appropriate investigations such as an upper GI endoscopy allows for timely management with eradication therapy for H.
