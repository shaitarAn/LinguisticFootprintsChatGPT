Clinical Case: A 35-year-old male patient with the diagnosis of chronic migraine admitted to our clinic. He presented with a 5-year history of recurrent headaches. The patient reported experiencing headaches on most days of the month, with varying intensity. The headaches were not relieved by over-the-counter pain medications and were not exacerbated by physical activity.

The patient described the pain as a constant, throbbing sensation, predominantly on the right side of his head. He reported no associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or sound. The patient's family history was negative for any significant headache disorders.

In addition to the chronic headaches, the patient also reported experiencing occasional visual disturbances. He described seeing shimmering lights and zigzag lines in his visual field, which lasted for approximately 20 minutes before resolving spontaneously. These visual disturbances were not accompanied by any other neurological symptoms.

The patient denied any history of seizures or other neurological conditions. However, he did mention experiencing occasional episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness, particularly when standing up quickly. These episodes were transient and resolved spontaneously.

Upon further investigation, the patient revealed that his headaches often coincided with periods of increased stress and anxiety. He reported feeling overwhelmed at work and experiencing difficulty in managing his emotions. The patient had not sought medical attention for his headaches until now, as he believed they were a normal part of his life.

Physical examination of the patient was unremarkable, with no focal neurological deficits noted. Routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count and metabolic panel, were within normal limits.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation, a diagnosis of chronic migraine was made. The patient was educated about the nature of chronic migraine and the importance of stress management in its management. A comprehensive treatment plan was developed, including lifestyle modifications, stress reduction techniques, and prophylactic medication to prevent future migraine attacks.

The patient was referred to a headache specialist for further evaluation and management. Follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment plan and make any necessary adjustments.

In conclusion, this case highlights a 35-year-old male patient with a long-standing history of chronic migraine. The patient's symptoms, including recurrent headaches, visual disturbances, and occasional dizziness, were consistent with the diagnosis. The management of chronic migraine involves a multidisciplinary approach, focusing on both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to improve the patient's quality of life.
