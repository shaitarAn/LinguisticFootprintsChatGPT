Upon further examination, the patient's medical history revealed that she had been diagnosed with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) shortly after birth. SWS is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the presence of a port-wine stain birthmark on the face, typically affecting one side of the face. It is also associated with abnormalities in blood vessels in the brain and can lead to various neurological symptoms.

The patient's seizures during infancy were consistent with the known association between SWS and epilepsy. Epileptic seizures are a common manifestation of this syndrome and can present as tonic-clonic contractions, similar to what she experienced. The fact that her headaches started two years ago suggests that they may be related to her underlying condition.

Given her description of non-pulsating headaches that were relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), it is likely that these headaches are tension-type headaches rather than migraines. Tension-type headaches are often described as bilateral, pressing or tightening sensations without accompanying nausea or aura symptoms. The absence of worsening with physical activity further supports this diagnosis.

However, it is important to consider other potential causes for her headache symptoms given her complex medical history. The presence of SWS raises concerns about possible vascular abnormalities in the brain, which could contribute to headache development. Additionally, individuals with SWS may be at an increased risk for developing glaucoma due to abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye.

To further evaluate her condition and rule out any other underlying causes for her headaches, additional investigations were ordered. These included a comprehensive neurological examination, imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and eyes, as well as ophthalmologic evaluation for signs of glaucoma.

The MRI revealed characteristic findings associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome including leptomeningeal angioma - abnormal blood vessels on the surface of the brain - along with calcifications within the brain tissue. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of SWS and provided insight into the potential cause of her headaches.

Treatment for her headaches focused on both acute relief and long-term management. NSAIDs were continued as they had provided some relief in the past. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as stress reduction techniques, regular exercise, and adequate sleep were recommended to help minimize headache frequency and severity.

Given her history of seizures, it was important to ensure that she was receiving appropriate antiepileptic medication to control seizure activity. Close collaboration with a neurologist specializing in epilepsy was initiated to optimize her seizure management.

Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor her symptoms closely and adjust treatment as needed. The patient was also referred for genetic counseling to discuss the implications of Sturge-Weber syndrome for future family planning.

In conclusion, this 21-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome presented with frequent non-pulsating headaches that had been ongoing for two years. While tension-type headaches appeared to be the most likely cause based on clinical presentation, further investigations confirmed the presence of SWS-related abnormalities in the brain. Treatment involved a multidisciplinary approach focusing on acute headache relief, long-term management strategies, seizure control, and genetic counseling. Regular monitoring will be essential in ensuring optimal symptom control and overall well-being for this patient living with Sturge-Weber syndrome.
