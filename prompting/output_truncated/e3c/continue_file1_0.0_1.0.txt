Upon further examination, the patient reported experiencing occasional visual disturbances such as blurred vision and sensitivity to light during her headaches. She also mentioned that the intensity of her headaches had been gradually increasing over the past few months. 

Physical examination revealed no abnormalities in her neurological status, including normal cranial nerve function and intact reflexes. However, a thorough evaluation of her skin revealed characteristic port-wine stain birthmarks on the right side of her face and scalp, consistent with Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS). 

Given her history of seizures in infancy and now presenting with chronic headaches, a comprehensive workup was initiated to assess the extent of SWS involvement and determine appropriate management strategies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were ordered to evaluate for any structural abnormalities in the brain.

The MRI results showed evidence of leptomeningeal angioma involving both cerebral hemispheres on the affected side, confirming a diagnosis of SWS-related encephalopathy. This finding explained both her seizures in infancy and current headache symptoms.

To manage her chronic headaches associated with SWS, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted involving neurology, dermatology, ophthalmology, and pain management specialists. The patient was started on prophylactic medication targeting migraine prevention while also receiving regular follow-up care to monitor disease progression.

In addition to pharmacological interventions for headache control, non-pharmacological measures were implemented as well. These included lifestyle modifications such as stress reduction techniques and maintaining regular sleep patterns. The patient was also advised to avoid triggers known to exacerbate migraines such as certain foods or environmental factors.

Furthermore, given that she experienced visual disturbances during episodes of headache pain, ophthalmologic evaluations were conducted regularly to assess any potential complications related to ocular involvement in SWS.

Overall management focused not only on symptom relief but also on optimizing quality of life for this young woman living with SWS-related headaches. Regular monitoring allowed for timely adjustments in treatment plans as needed, ensuring the most effective and individualized care for her unique condition.
