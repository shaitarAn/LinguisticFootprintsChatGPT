Upon further examination, the patient reported experiencing occasional visual disturbances, such as blurred vision and sensitivity to light. She also mentioned episodes of numbness and tingling in her face and hands, which would last for a few minutes before subsiding. These symptoms were not associated with any specific triggers or activities.

The patient's medical history revealed that she had undergone multiple surgeries in infancy to address the physical manifestations of SWS, including port-wine stain removal and debulking of facial soft tissue hypertrophy. She had been regularly monitored by a neurologist for her seizures and was currently on antiepileptic medication.

Physical examination showed no significant abnormalities except for the presence of a large port-wine stain on the right side of her face, extending from her forehead to her chin. Neurological examination was unremarkable, with no signs of focal deficits or motor abnormalities.

Given the patient's history of headaches and associated symptoms, further investigations were warranted to determine their cause. A brain MRI scan was ordered to evaluate for any structural abnormalities or vascular malformations that could be contributing to her symptoms.

In addition to imaging studies, laboratory tests were conducted to rule out other potential causes of headaches such as hormonal imbalances or metabolic disorders. The results came back within normal limits, ruling out any underlying systemic conditions.

After reviewing all the findings from clinical evaluation and investigations, it was determined that the patient's headaches were likely related to SWS itself rather than being secondary to another condition. The bilateral nature of the headache along with its pressing quality suggested tension-type headache as opposed to migraines.

A multidisciplinary approach involving neurology and pain management specialists was initiated for comprehensive management of her symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions such as stress reduction techniques and lifestyle modifications were recommended alongside pharmacotherapy options tailored specifically for tension-type headaches.

Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled with both neurology and pain management specialists in order to monitor treatment response and adjust the management plan as needed. The patient was also provided with educational resources and support to better understand her condition and cope with its associated challenges.

Overall, the patient's case highlighted the importance of a thorough evaluation in patients with SWS presenting with headaches. By considering both the primary diagnosis and potential secondary causes, healthcare providers can develop an individualized treatment plan that addresses not only the symptoms but also improves overall quality of life for these patients.
