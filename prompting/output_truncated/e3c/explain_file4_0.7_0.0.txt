In both clinical cases, the babies presented with a condition called aplasia cutis congenita. Aplasia cutis congenita is a rare disorder characterized by the absence of skin in certain areas at birth. In the first case, the baby had a large defect on the scalp over the parietal bone bilaterally extending to the occipital region. The defect was covered by a yellow layer of membrane. The baby also had low set ears, irritability, tense anterior fontanelle, and respiratory distress. The diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis was made. The baby received routine care including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and dressing. The baby's condition improved, and future intervention with autologous skin grafting was planned.

In the second case, the baby was referred at 48 hours of life due to the absence of part of the skull bone noticed at birth. The baby had a midline subcutaneous tissue defect of the scalp extending from the frontal to the occipital area. There was leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a likely dural involvement. The baby also had other clinical findings such as desquamating skin, hypoplastic finger and toe nails, dilated abdominal wall veins, and a systolic cardiac murmur. The working diagnosis was multiple congenital anomalies including aplasia cutis congenita, congenital heart disease (ventricular septal defect), and meningitis. The baby was treated with antibiotics and wound care. Complications included CSF leakage and meningitis, which resolved over time. The burns and plastic unit planned for future intervention with mesh and flap cover, but unfortunately, the baby died 7 days after discharge.

These cases highlight the challenges in managing aplasia cutis congenita, especially when there are associated complications such as meningitis and congenital heart defects. The multidisciplinary team consisting of neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, and other specialists played a crucial role in the management of these babies.
