This clinical case discusses the presentation and management of a pregnant woman with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC is the most common type of primary liver cancer, and it typically arises in patients with underlying chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis. 

The patient in this case is initially described as not having any known chronic illnesses, including diabetes or hypertension. She is also not aware of her hepatitis status and denies alcohol consumption and smoking. Upon examination, a few clinical signs are noted. She displays wasting, mild pallor, a tinge of jaundice, and signs of mild ascites and bipedal edema (swelling in the lower legs). Additionally, she exhibits palmer erythema (reddening of the palms), consistent with liver dysfunction. There is no evidence of respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurological abnormalities.

An abdominal examination reveals a grossly distended abdomen with a distorted contour in the upper half. The anterior abdominal wall veins are visibly distended and draining away from the umbilicus. The liver is enlarged, measuring 12cm below the costal margin with a span of 17cm. It is hard, nodular, and tender, with an irregular edge and a bruit heard on auscultation. The spleen is not palpable. The fetus is found to be in a breech presentation, and the symphysio fundal height measures 26 cm, consistent with the gestational age of 27 weeks and 3 days. The fetal heart rate is regular at 134 bpm.

Laboratory assessment reveals a hemoglobin level of 10.3g/dl, a white blood cell count of 10200 cells/dl, and a platelet count of 350000/ul. Neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils are present in their respective percentages. The liver function tests show normal bilirubin levels, but raised gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, indicating liver damage. The total protein and albumin levels are low, and the International Normalized Ratio (INR) is slightly elevated at 1.3. Viral markers indicate the patient is positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) but negative for Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The Hepatitis B DNA level is also elevated at 126869 IU/ml. 

Further testing reveals a positive VDRL (syphilis) test, and an abdominal ultrasound identifies a heterogeneous coarse liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions. The liver measures 17.2cm, and there is mild ascites. A pelvic scan confirms the gestational age of the fetus.

Based on these findings, a revised diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation in pregnancy is made. Management includes providing analgesia for pain relief and medications such as furosemide and spironolactone to address ascites and edema. Additionally, lamivudine is added to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B. The plan is to allow the pregnancy to continue to at least 32 completed weeks to improve the chances of neonatal survival.

However, due to progressive and unbearable abdominal pain, the pregnancy is terminated at 30 weeks and 3 days through successful induction of labor. The outcome is a stillbirth weighing 1.2kg. Post-delivery, the patient experiences reduced pain and is discharged home after five days. She is advised to follow up at the gastrointestinal clinic.

Unfortunately, the patient is lost to follow-up after her two- and four-week post-discharge visits. This highlights the importance of ongoing care and monitoring for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, especially during periods of significant health challenges like pregnancy.

In conclusion, this clinical case illustrates the diagnosis and management of
