This case is about a 36-year-old pregnant woman who is a farmer and has been experiencing abdominal pain for the past three months. The pain is located in the upper abdomen, is dull and persistent, and has gradually worsened over time. She also reports intermittent radiation of pain to the chest. 

The patient has also experienced significant weight loss but denies other associated symptoms such as early satiety, jaundice, fever, itch, or spontaneous bleeding. She has no history of blood transfusion and is taking routine hematinic supplementation from the antenatal clinic. She has no known chronic illnesses, diabetes, or hypertension and denies using alcohol or smoking. 

On examination, the patient appears wasted, mildly pale, and has a slight jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). She is well hydrated, afebrile (no fever), and has no palpable lymph nodes. Other examinations, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological exams, are unremarkable. 

However, the abdomen is grossly distended, particularly in the upper half, with visibly distended veins on the anterior abdominal wall. The liver is enlarged, hard, nodular, and has an irregular edge. It is also slightly tender and has a bruit (abnormal sound) on auscultation. There is mild ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) and edema (swelling) in the lower legs. The spleen is not palpable. 

Further tests reveal a low hemoglobin level (10.3 g/dL), elevated white blood cell count (10,200 cells/dL) with an increased neutrophil percentage, raised liver enzymes (GGT and AST), low total protein and albumin levels, and an elevated INR (a measure of blood clotting). The patient tests positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and has a high viral load of HBV DNA. She also tests positive for VDRL (a test for syphilis) but TPHA (confirmatory test for syphilis) was not done. Alphafetoprotein (AFP), a tumor marker, is significantly elevated. HIV and HCV tests are negative. 

Abdominal ultrasound reveals that the liver is heterogeneous (having different tissue densities) with multiple hypoechoic lesions (dark areas). There is also mild ascites. Pelvic ultrasound confirms a 27-week, 3-day viable fetus with active fetal movements. 

Based on these findings, the initial diagnosis is hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) in the setting of pregnancy. The patient is managed with pain relief medication, diuretics (furosemide and spironolactone) to reduce fluid retention, and lamivudine to prevent mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B. The plan is to allow the pregnancy to continue until at least 32 completed weeks to improve the chances of neonatal survival. However, due to the progressive and unbearable abdominal pain, the pregnancy is terminated at 30 weeks and 3 days by inducing labor. A stillbirth weighing 1.2 kg is delivered, and the patient's pain is significantly reduced after delivery. She is discharged
