On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and had a distended abdomen. There was tenderness on palpation in the epigastric region, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. Bowel sounds were normal, and there were no signs of hepatosplenomegaly.

Given her symptoms and examination findings, further investigations were ordered. A complete blood count revealed mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL (normal range: 12-15 g/dL). Liver function tests showed elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, while other liver enzymes were within normal limits. Serum bilirubin levels were also within normal range.

An abdominal ultrasound was performed to evaluate the cause of her symptoms. The ultrasound revealed a dilated common bile duct measuring 1 cm in diameter with multiple gallstones visualized within the gallbladder. There was also evidence of cholelithiasis with associated sludge in the gallbladder lumen.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of choledocholithiasis was made. Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of stones within the common bile duct, which can cause obstruction leading to biliary colic and potentially more severe complications such as cholangitis or pancreatitis.

The patient was counseled about her condition and treatment options. Given her pregnancy status, it was decided that conservative management would be attempted initially due to concerns about potential risks associated with surgical intervention during pregnancy.

She was started on pain management using analgesics that are safe for use during pregnancy. Additionally, she received intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance.

A multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians, gastroenterologists, and general surgeons discussed her case extensively to determine the best course of action moving forward. It was decided that close monitoring would be necessary throughout her pregnancy until delivery could be safely performed.

The patient was educated about the signs and symptoms of complications such as cholangitis or pancreatitis, and instructed to seek immediate medical attention if any concerning symptoms arose. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor her condition and ensure the well-being of both the mother and fetus.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering uncommon causes of abdominal pain in pregnant patients. Choledocholithiasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a pregnant patient presents with epigastric pain, especially if associated with risk factors such as gallstones. Close collaboration between different specialties is crucial to ensure optimal management and outcomes for both mother and baby.
