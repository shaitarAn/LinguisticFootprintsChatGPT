On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and had a distended abdomen. There was tenderness in the epigastric region, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. Bowel sounds were normal, and there were no palpable masses or organomegaly.

Given her symptoms and examination findings, further investigations were ordered to determine the cause of her abdominal pain and weight loss. Blood tests revealed mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL) and normal liver function tests. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed a large mass in the pancreas with dilated bile ducts suggestive of obstructive jaundice.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was suspected. The patient was referred to an oncologist for further evaluation and management. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of a mass in the head of the pancreas with involvement of nearby blood vessels.

The oncologist discussed treatment options with the patient, taking into consideration her pregnancy status. Chemotherapy was not recommended due to potential harm to both mother and fetus. Instead, it was decided that she would undergo surgery after delivery.

Throughout her antenatal care, close monitoring was done to ensure both maternal and fetal well-being. Regular ultrasounds were performed to assess fetal growth and development.

At 38 weeks gestation, she went into spontaneous labor and delivered a healthy baby boy via vaginal delivery without any complications. The following week, she underwent surgery for removal of the pancreatic tumor.

During surgery, it was found that the tumor had invaded nearby blood vessels making complete resection impossible. However, as much as possible was removed without compromising vital structures.

Histopathology confirmed adenocarcinoma arising from pancreatic tissue with lymph node involvement indicating stage III disease according to TNM staging system for cancer classification.

Postoperatively, she received adjuvant chemotherapy to target any remaining cancer cells. The treatment was well-tolerated, and she did not experience any significant side effects.

Regular follow-up visits were scheduled with the oncologist to monitor her progress and response to treatment. Repeat CT scans showed no evidence of disease recurrence, and her tumor markers remained within normal limits.

The patient's abdominal pain gradually improved after surgery, and she regained her appetite. Her weight stabilized, and she started gaining back the weight she had lost.

Now, two years after her initial presentation, the patient continues to be in remission with no signs of disease recurrence. She is actively involved in farming activities while also taking care of her son.

This case highlights the challenges faced when managing pregnant patients with serious medical conditions such as pancreatic cancer. A multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians, oncologists, surgeons, and other healthcare professionals is crucial for ensuring optimal outcomes for both mother and baby.

In this particular case, early diagnosis played a significant role in successful management. Despite the advanced stage of the disease at presentation, timely intervention allowed for effective treatment without compromising maternal or fetal health.
