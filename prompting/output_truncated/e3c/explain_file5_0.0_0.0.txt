Clinical Case Summary:

A previously healthy 17-year-old African male presented to the hospital with a one-week history of fever, rash, headache, neck pain, sore throat, dry cough, and diarrhea. He had no history of joint pain, ulcers, or discharge. He had no prior medical admissions, surgeries, or significant medication or drug use. He had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal. On examination, he appeared ill with a high heart rate, low blood pressure, and high temperature. He had a rash on his body and eyelids, conjunctivitis, and desquamating lesions on his eyelids. His abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal, and his cardiovascular examination revealed a normal heart with a fast heart rate. Initial blood investigations showed elevated inflammatory markers and other blood parameters. Lumbar puncture, chest radiograph, and abdominal sonar were normal. The first echocardiogram showed a normal heart. Nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 were negative. The differential diagnosis included viral and bacterial infections, as well as non-infectious conditions like Kawasaki-like disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient received intravenous fluids and antibiotics, and doxycycline was added for possible rickettsial disease. Hydrocortisone was started but discontinued due to infection concerns. A repeat echocardiogram showed severe heart dysfunction, and the patient received intravenous immunoglobulin, dobutamine, and diuretics. Steroids were also initiated. Serological testing confirmed the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The patient's condition improved, and he was discharged on prednisone, aspirin, and colchicine. Follow-up showed complete recovery with no residual symptoms. The prednisone was gradually tapered, and the patient's heart function improved.
