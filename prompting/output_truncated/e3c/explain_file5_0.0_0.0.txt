This clinical case describes a patient who presented with a fever, rash, and other symptoms. The patient had no prior medical admissions, surgeries, or significant medication or recreational drug use. They were a grade ten scholar and had recently traveled to Kwa-Zulu Natal two weeks prior.

On examination, the patient appeared ill and had a low blood pressure, high heart rate, and high temperature. They had a rash on their torso, back, limbs, and hands, as well as conjunctivitis. The patient's abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal, and their cardiovascular examination revealed a normal heart with a fast heart rate. There were no signs of meningism or arthritis.

Initial diagnostic tests showed elevated levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimers. Blood and urine cultures were negative, and a lumbar puncture, chest radiograph, and abdominal sonar were normal. The first echocardiogram (ECHO) showed a structurally normal heart.

The differential diagnosis included viral and bacterial infections, as well as non-infectious conditions such as Kawasaki-like disease (KD), adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Based on the patient's symptoms, elevated temperature, and abnormal laboratory findings, a diagnosis of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) was made.

The patient received supportive care, including intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Steroids were initially started but discontinued due to concerns for infection. However, when the steroids were interrupted, the patient's fever returned. On day four of admission, a repeat ECHO showed significant heart abnormalities, and the patient was started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and a dobutamine infusion. They also received a steroid pulse and additional medications to manage the condition.

Serological testing confirmed the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, indicating a previous infection. The patient's condition improved over time, with resolution of symptoms, normalization of laboratory markers, and improvement in heart function. They were discharged on a tapering dose of steroids and other medications.

Follow-up appointments showed complete recovery, with no residual symptoms. The patient's heart function improved, and they were able to return to school. They will continue to be monitored in the coming months.

Informed consent was obtained from the patient to share their medical information and images without identifiable features.
