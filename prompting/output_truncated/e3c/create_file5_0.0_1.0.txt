Patient Information:

On the 15th October 2021, a previously healthy, 32-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the medical ward at St. Mary's Hospital in London, UK. The patient was transferred from a local clinic due to worsening symptoms and concerns about her overall condition. She presented with a two-week history of fever, fatigue, and a generalized rash over her body.

Medical History:

The patient had no significant medical history and was not taking any medications prior to this illness. She reported being in good health and leading an active lifestyle.

Presenting Symptoms:

The patient complained of persistent low-grade fever that had been fluctuating between 100°F (37.8°C) and 101°F (38.3°C) for the past two weeks. Alongside the fever, she experienced extreme fatigue that limited her daily activities.

Additionally, she noticed a widespread rash covering her body which started as small red spots but gradually progressed into larger patches over time. The rash also involved her eyelids causing mild swelling and discomfort.

The patient described intermittent headaches accompanied by neck pain that worsened with movement or prolonged sitting or standing positions. She also reported having a sore throat and dry cough for the past week.

Furthermore, she mentioned experiencing diarrhea for one day before the onset of other symptoms but denied any joint pain or swelling, oral ulcers, nasal discharge or sores on genitalia.

Physical Examination Findings:

Upon physical examination at admission, vital signs were stable except for an elevated temperature of 100.9°F (38.3°C). The patient appeared fatigued but alert with no signs of respiratory distress or cyanosis.

Skin examination revealed multiple erythematous macules scattered across her trunk and extremities which blanched upon pressure indicating non-palpable purpura lesions consistent with petechiae formation associated with vasculitis.

Her eyelids showed mild edema without conjunctival injection or discharge. The neck examination revealed tenderness on palpation of the cervical spine, particularly at the base of the skull.

Laboratory Investigations:

Initial laboratory investigations were conducted to further evaluate the patient's condition. Complete blood count (CBC) showed a mild leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12,500/mm³ (normal range: 4,000-11,000/mm³). Differential counts revealed an increased percentage of neutrophils and eosinophils.

Liver function tests and renal function tests were within normal limits. Serological tests for infectious diseases including HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and Epstein-Barr virus were negative.

Management:

The patient was started on supportive care including antipyretics for fever control and adequate hydration to manage her symptoms. A dermatology consult was requested to assess the rash further.
