On examination, baby NU appeared well nourished and active. However, there were visible deformities in the form of absent skin and skull bones, particularly in the facial region. Additionally, the baby had a cleft lip and palate. The absence of skin and skull bones resulted in exposed brain tissue, making the situation extremely delicate.

The medical team immediately initiated necessary steps to stabilize baby NU. They carefully covered the exposed brain tissue using a sterile dressing to prevent any infection. Intensive care was provided to monitor his vital signs, including respiration, heart rate, and temperature. The team also ensured proper hydration and nutrition for the infant.

Further investigations were carried out to determine the underlying causes of these congenital abnormalities. Genetic testing was ordered to explore any potential chromosomal abnormalities, as consanguineous marriages have a higher risk of genetic disorders. The parents were counseled about the importance of genetic testing and were reassured that the results would provide valuable information about the baby's condition.

In the meantime, consultations were sought from various specialists, including pediatric surgeons, plastic surgeons, and neurologists, to determine the best course of action for baby NU. It was agreed that surgery would be required to reconstruct the skull and facial bones and to repair the cleft lip and palate. However, due to the delicate nature of the situation and the risks involved, the surgery would need to be postponed until the baby's condition stabilized and he gained sufficient weight.

Throughout this challenging process, the parents received emotional support from a team of healthcare professionals, including psychologists and counselors. They were also provided with information about support groups and organizations that could offer assistance and guidance during their journey.

The case of baby NU highlighted the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors in the development of congenital abnormalities. The medical team continued their efforts to further investigate and manage his condition, while ensuring that the parents were well-informed and involved in the decision-making process at every step.
