Upon further examination, the patient's vital signs were stable and within normal range. Physical examination revealed no abnormal findings, including no signs of neurocutaneous involvement commonly seen in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). Neurological examination was normal except for a few subtle cutaneous lesions on the face that suggested possible underlying SWS.

The patient's medical history showed a regular follow-up with a neurologist due to her seizures. She had been on antiepileptic medication since the diagnosis. There were no reported episodes of seizures after infancy, and she was compliant with her medication regimen.

Given the long-standing history of non-pulsating headaches in this young woman, further investigation was warranted to determine the cause and appropriate treatment plan. The absence of associated symptoms such as nausea or aura made possibilities like migraine less likely. However, given that her headaches relieved with over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), it suggested a possible tension-type headache.

To rule out other potential causes or contributing factors for her headaches, additional workup was conducted. Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and thyroid function tests were all within normal limits. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed to evaluate brain electrical activity during sleep but came back unremarkable.

With no identifiable secondary cause for her headaches found thus far, clinical management focused on optimizing symptomatic relief while minimizing any potential side effects or drug interactions due to already existing antiepileptic medications.

Non-pharmacological approaches such as stress reduction techniques and improving sleep hygiene were recommended to complement any pharmacological interventions deemed necessary later on based on symptom severity and frequency assessment during subsequent follow-ups.

Given the pressing quality of pain described by the patient along with its bilateral distribution and relieving effect with NSAIDs, tension-type headache remained high on our differential diagnosis list despite its coexistence with SWS and previous history of seizures. Thus, a trial of tension-type headache-specific treatment (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants or cognitive-behavioral therapy) was considered as the next step in management.

The patient was counseled about these recommendations and scheduled for regular follow-up visits to monitor her progress closely. Furthermore, given her underlying SWS diagnosis, continued collaboration with specialists in neurology and dermatology would be crucial to address any potential complications or new findings associated with the condition.

In conclusion, this case underscores the complexity of managing headaches in the context of a chronic neurological condition like Sturge-Weber syndrome. A comprehensive approach involving multidisciplinary care is essential to optimize outcomes while considering each patient's unique symptoms, history, and medical needs.
