A 34-year-old male construction worker, gravida 2 para 1, at 28 weeks gestation, presented to our facility with a chief complaint of persistent epigastric abdominal pain for the past 2 months. The pain was described as dull and gradually worsening, with occasional radiation to the back. The patient reported no specific aggravating or relieving factors. There was no history of weight loss, early satiety, jaundice, fever, itch, or spontaneous bleeding. The patient had a history of hypertension but was not on any medications. He denied smoking or alcohol consumption. There were no respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurological symptoms, and he had no known exposure to chemicals or radiation.

On physical examination, the patient appeared well-nourished, with no signs of wasting. He had normal coloration and hydration, and his vital signs were within normal limits. Abdominal examination revealed gross distension with a distorted contour in the upper half. The anterior abdominal wall veins were visibly dilated and draining away from the umbilicus. The liver was palpable 10cm below the costal margin, with a span of 15cm. It felt hard, nodular, and tender on palpation. No bruit was auscultated. The spleen was not palpable, but mild ascites and bilateral lower extremity edema were noted. Fetal heart rate was 140bpm and regular. Rectal and genital examinations were unremarkable.

Based on initial findings, a provisional diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in pregnancy was made. Laboratory assessments revealed a hemoglobin level of 11.5g/dL, white blood cell count of 9,800 cells/dL (neutrophils 65.2%, lymphocytes 28.1%, monocytes 5.7%, eosinophils 1%), and platelet count of 280,000/Î¼L. Liver function tests showed elevated levels of AST and ALT (2 times upper limit), while total protein and albumin were within normal limits. Viral markers were negative for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were significantly elevated at 45,000 ng/mL. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a heterogeneous liver with multiple hypoechoic lesions, measuring 16cm in span. Mild ascites was also noted.

The final diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma on a cirrhotic liver with decompensation during pregnancy. The patient was managed with analgesics and supportive measures, including close monitoring of blood pressure and liver function. Due to the advanced stage of the disease and the risk of maternal and fetal complications, a multidisciplinary team recommended termination of the pregnancy at 30 weeks 5 days. The patient underwent successful induction of labor, resulting in the delivery of a stillborn fetus weighing 1.4kg.

Following delivery, the patient experienced a marked reduction in abdominal pain. He was discharged after 7 days and scheduled for a follow-up visit at the gastrointestinal clinic. Unfortunately, he did not attend the scheduled appointments and was lost to follow-up.
