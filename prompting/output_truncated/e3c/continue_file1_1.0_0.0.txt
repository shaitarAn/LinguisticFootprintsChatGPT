Upon further examination, the patient's physical examination was unremarkable, with no abnormalities noted in her cranial nerves, motor or sensory function, or reflexes. However, there were noticeable port wine stains on the patient's face and scalp, consistent with the characteristic findings seen in Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS). Additionally, a thorough neurological examination revealed some subtle neurological deficits, including mild muscle weakness and fine motor coordination difficulties on the left side of the body.

Given her history of headaches and previous diagnosis of SWS, a comprehensive diagnostic workup was initiated to further evaluate the nature and underlying cause of her headaches. This included a detailed review of the patient's medical history, as well as ordering several relevant investigations.

First, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain was performed to assess for any potential structural abnormalities. The results of the MRI revealed bilateral leptomeningeal angiomatosis, which is a hallmark feature of SWS. This finding confirmed the association between the patient's headaches and her underlying condition.

Next, an electroencephalogram (EEG) was conducted to evaluate the patient's history of seizures. The EEG showed intermittent paroxysmal epileptiform activity, which confirmed the presence of ongoing abnormal brain activity associated with the seizures.

In light of these findings, the patient's clinical presentation and diagnostic results were consistent with the diagnosis of SWS-related headaches and epilepsy. The treatment plan was subsequently tailored to address both her headache and seizure symptoms.

To alleviate her headache pain, the patient was advised to continue using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed, as these had provided some relief in the past. In addition, lifestyle modifications such as ensuring adequate hydration, regular sleep patterns, and stress management techniques were recommended to help minimize the frequency and severity of her headaches.

To manage her seizures, antiepileptic medications were prescribed, starting with a low dose of a broad-spectrum agent such as levetiracetam. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor the patient's response to treatment and to adjust the medication dosage as needed.

The patient was also referred for multidisciplinary care, including consultations with a neurologist specializing in headaches and epilepsy, as well as a dermatologist for evaluation and management of the cutaneous manifestations associated with SWS. Additionally, genetic counseling was arranged for the patient and her family to discuss the inheritance pattern and potential implications for future planning.

Overall, a comprehensive and individualized approach was adopted to address the varied aspects of the patient's condition. Through ongoing monitoring and collaborative care, the aim was to provide the patient with optimal symptom management, improve her quality of life, and ensure her overall well-being.
