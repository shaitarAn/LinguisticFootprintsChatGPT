On physical examination, the patient appeared pale and had a distended abdomen with visible dilated veins over the abdominal wall. There were no signs of jaundice or peripheral edema. Auscultation of the chest revealed normal breath sounds, and her blood pressure was within normal limits.

Based on her history and presentation, several differential diagnoses were considered including peptic ulcer disease, gallstones, pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal malignancy. Given her persistent abdominal pain and weight loss without associated symptoms such as early satiety or jaundice, further investigations were warranted to determine the underlying cause.

Initial laboratory investigations revealed a mild normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) with normal liver function tests and renal profile. A complete blood count showed no evidence of thrombocytopenia or leukocytosis.

An ultrasound examination of the abdomen was performed which showed hepatomegaly with multiple hypoechoic lesions in both lobes of the liver suggestive of metastatic disease. The gallbladder appeared unremarkable without evidence of stones or inflammation.

Given these findings, a computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered for further evaluation. The CT scan confirmed multiple hypodense lesions scattered throughout both lobes of the liver consistent with metastatic deposits (Figure 1). No other intra-abdominal abnormalities were noted.

In light of these findings, further investigations including tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and CA19-9 were requested to help identify the primary source of malignancy causing hepatic metastasis.

The patient's case was discussed with an oncologist who recommended a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis before initiating treatment options. A percutaneous ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed which revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells consistent with colorectal origin.

Following confirmation of colorectal cancer with hepatic metastasis, the patient was referred to an oncology center for further management. She underwent a multidisciplinary approach involving chemotherapy, surgical evaluation, and possible liver resection.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering malignancy in the differential diagnosis of persistent abdominal pain and weight loss. Prompt investigation with imaging modalities and tumor markers can aid in timely diagnosis and appropriate management planning. Early referral to specialized centers is crucial for optimal patient outcomes.
