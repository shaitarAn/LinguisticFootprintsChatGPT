Upon further examination, the patient appeared pale and emaciated. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the epigastric region with no palpable masses or organomegaly. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Given her presentation and history, several differential diagnoses came to mind. The first consideration was peptic ulcer disease (PUD) due to the epigastric pain and radiation to the chest. However, her lack of relief or aggravation by food intake made this less likely. Other possibilities included gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or even a pancreatic disorder.

To further investigate her symptoms and rule out any serious underlying condition, laboratory investigations were ordered. Complete blood count showed mild anemia with hemoglobin level at 10 g/dL (normal range: 12-15 g/dL). Liver function tests were within normal limits except for mildly raised alkaline phosphatase levels at 130 IU/L (normal range: <115 IU/L). Serum amylase and lipase levels were also within normal limits.

Considering her persistent abdominal pain despite conservative management from ANC, an ultrasound scan was performed to assess the abdominal organs. The scan revealed a dilated common bile duct measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter without any evidence of gallstones or biliary obstruction. The liver appeared normal in size and echotexture.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of choledocholithiasis was suspected - the presence of stones in the common bile duct leading to biliary system obstruction causing episodic pain radiating to the chest area. To confirm this diagnosis, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was recommended as it provides detailed visualization of the biliary tree.

While awaiting MRCP, the patient was managed conservatively with pain control using acetaminophen and reassurance about the safety of these medications during pregnancy. She was also advised on dietary modifications to prevent exacerbation of symptoms. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor her progress and ensure fetal well-being.

After a week, MRCP was performed and revealed multiple gallstones within the common bile duct causing partial obstruction. The largest stone measured approximately 1 cm in diameter. Based on these findings, a multidisciplinary team involving obstetricians, gastroenterologists, and general surgeons discussed the case.

Considering her advanced gestational age and persistent symptoms despite conservative management, it was decided that an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) would be performed under close monitoring in an expert center equipped to handle obstetric emergencies. This procedure involves removing or bypassing the stones using endoscopic techniques while maintaining fetal stability.

The patient underwent ERCP successfully without any complications. Multiple stones were extracted from the common bile duct, relieving her symptoms immediately. Post-procedure recovery was uneventful with complete resolution of her epigastric pain and chest radiation.

Regular antenatal care continued for appropriate monitoring of fetal growth and well-being until term delivery at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications.

In conclusion, this case highlights the importance of considering uncommon causes for common symptoms during pregnancy. Choledocholithiasis can present with atypical features such as epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the chest area in pregnant patients. Prompt diagnosis through imaging modalities like MRCP followed by timely intervention can lead to successful outcomes for both mother and baby while minimizing potential risks associated with invasive procedures during pregnancy.
