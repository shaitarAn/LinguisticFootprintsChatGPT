In both of these clinical cases, the babies presented with a congenital condition known as aplasia cutis congenita. This condition is characterized by the absence of skin in certain areas at birth. In Case 1, the baby had a large defect on the vertex of the scalp over the parietal bone bilaterally extending to the occipital region. The defect was covered by a yellow layer of membrane. The baby also had low set ears, irritability, tense anterior fontanelle (soft spot on top of the head), and respiratory distress.

In Case 2, the baby had a midline subcutaneous tissue defect of the scalp extending from frontal to occipital area and leaking cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Additionally, this baby had other anomalies including desquamating skin (skin peeling), hypoplastic finger and toe nails (underdeveloped nails), visible dilated abdominal wall veins, and a ventricular septal defect (a hole in between two chambers of the heart).

Aplasia cutis congenita can occur for various reasons. It may be due to genetic factors or environmental factors during pregnancy. In some cases, it may be associated with other syndromes or conditions such as Adams-Oliver syndrome or Patau's syndrome.

The management for these babies involved multidisciplinary team collaboration including neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons. In both cases, routine care was provided according to protocol which included oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids administration, antibiotics at meningitis doses due to possible meningitis involvement in Case 1.

In Case 1 specifically, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed absence of parietal bone towards vertex bilaterally extending from behind anterior fontanelle down to posterior fontanelle giving an area of defect measuring 8.3 cm x 5.3 cm. The brain structures were normal except for missing skull bones in the affected area.

In both cases, plans were made for future interventions to address the defects. In Case 1, a flap cover for autologous skin grafting was planned. In Case 2, prolene mesh/titanium mesh and latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap cover were planned.

Unfortunately, financial constraints prevented further investigations such as brain MRI, echocardiography (heart ultrasound), and chromosomal studies in Case 2. This highlights the importance of access to healthcare resources and financial support for comprehensive diagnostic evaluations.

Complications occurred in both cases including CSF leakage and meningitis which were managed with appropriate treatment. However, it is important to note that in Case 2, the baby died seven days after discharge from the hospital.

These clinical cases demonstrate the challenges faced by healthcare professionals when managing congenital anomalies such as aplasia cutis congenita. It emphasizes the need for early detection, multidisciplinary care, and access to necessary diagnostic tools and interventions to improve outcomes for these babies.
