In both of these clinical cases, the babies presented with a condition called aplasia cutis congenita. This is a rare condition characterized by the absence of skin in certain areas at birth. In the first case, the baby had a large defect on the scalp over the parietal bone bilaterally extending to the occipital region. The baby also had low set ears, irritability, a tense anterior fontanelle, and respiratory distress. A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis was made. The baby received routine care including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and wound dressing. The baby's respiratory distress improved, oral feeds were started, and the baby was eventually discharged home for follow-up.

In the second case, the baby was referred at 48 hours of life due to the absence of part of the skull bone noticed at birth. The baby was very ill, febrile, cyanosed, and hypertonic. There was a midline subcutaneous tissue defect of the scalp extending from the frontal to the occipital area. The baby also had other abnormalities including desquamating skin, hypoplastic finger and toe nails, dilated abdominal wall veins, and a heart murmur. A working diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies, including aplasia cutis congenita and congenital heart disease (ventricular septal defect), was made. The baby also had meningitis, which was treated with antibiotics. Unfortunately, due to financial constraints, further investigations such as brain MRI, echocardiography, and chromosomal studies could not be done. The baby received wound care and was planned for surgical intervention with mesh and flap cover. The baby was discharged but unfortunately died 7 days later.

Aplasia cutis congenita can occur in isolation or as part of a syndrome. It is believed to result from a disruption in the development of the skin and underlying tissues during fetal development. The exact cause is often unknown, but it can be associated with genetic factors, maternal trauma, vascular abnormalities, or exposure to certain medications or toxins during pregnancy. In some cases, there may be a family history of the condition or other congenital anomalies.

Treatment for aplasia cutis congenita depends on the size and location of the defect. In some cases, the defect may heal on its own with conservative management, such as wound care and dressing. In larger defects or cases with complications, surgical intervention may be necessary to close the defect and promote healing. This can involve techniques such as skin grafting or flap cover.
