Case 1: Baby NU is a male infant who was delivered at term in a hospital. At birth, it was noticed that he had an absence of skin and skull bone. The pregnancy was supervised and uneventful, and the mother did not use any medications except for antenatal drugs. The baby is the third child of parents in a monogamous consanguineous family setting. The mother had a history of a stillbirth during her first pregnancy, but no congenital malformations were seen in that baby. The physical examination revealed a large defect on the vertex of the scalp, with a yellow layer of membrane covering the defect. The baby also had low set ears, irritability, a tense anterior fontanelle, and respiratory distress. A diagnosis of aplasia cutis congenita with possible meningitis was made. The baby received routine care, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and dressing. The respiratory distress subsided, and the baby was eventually able to tolerate oral feeds. The baby had multidisciplinary team management, including neurosurgeons and plastic surgeons. Imaging tests showed the absence of parietal bone towards the vertex bilaterally, but the brain structures were normal. The plan for future intervention is to raise a flap cover for autologous skin grafting. The baby was discharged home after 18 days of admission for follow-up at specialty clinics.

Case 2: Baby YA is a Hausa male infant who was referred at 48 hours of life due to the absence of part of the skull bone noticed at birth. The baby was delivered at home without overt trauma to the head. The mother was 25 years old and unemployed, while the father was a hospital attendant. The baby is the third child of parents in a monogamous, non-consanguineous setting, and the two older siblings were alive and well. There was no known family history of congenital anomalies, and the mother did not use herbal medications or any other medication during pregnancy. Clinical findings at presentation included a very ill patient with fever, cyanosis, and a midline subcutaneous tissue defect of the scalp. There was also leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a likely dural involvement. The baby had other physical abnormalities, including desquamating skin, hypoplastic finger and toe nails, dilated abdominal wall veins, and a grade 3 systolic cardiac murmur. A working diagnosis of multiple congenital anomalies, including congenital cutis aplasia and congenital heart disease (ventricular septal defect), with meningitis was made. Sepsis screen yielded Providencia species and E. coli from blood and CSF, respectively. Abdominal ultrasound scan was normal, but further imaging tests and chromosomal studies could not be done due to financial constraints. The baby was treated with antibiotics and wound care. Complications included CSF leakage and meningitis,
