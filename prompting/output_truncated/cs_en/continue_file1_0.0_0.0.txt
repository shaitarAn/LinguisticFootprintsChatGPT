in the study had a history of less than 20 years in the equity market. This suggests that Asian family businesses are relatively new players in the public markets, but despite their short history, they have managed to outperform market indices.

The study found that Asian family businesses, on average, outperformed their respective market indices by a significant margin. Over a five-year period, the average annual return of Asian family businesses was 11.5 percent, compared to the average annual return of 8.9 percent for the market indices. This outperformance can be attributed to several factors.

Firstly, Asian family businesses tend to have a long-term perspective and a focus on sustainable growth. Unlike many publicly traded companies that are driven by short-term financial performance, family businesses prioritize the long-term success and continuity of the business. This long-term orientation allows them to make strategic decisions that may not yield immediate results but contribute to the long-term growth and stability of the company.

Secondly, family businesses often have a strong sense of identity and purpose. They are driven by a desire to preserve and build upon the legacy of their founders. This sense of purpose and commitment to the business can translate into a strong work ethic and a dedication to excellence. Family businesses are often known for their strong customer relationships, quality products or services, and a focus on innovation. These factors contribute to their ability to outperform market indices.

Furthermore, family businesses have the advantage of agility and flexibility. They can quickly adapt to changing market conditions and seize opportunities that may arise. This agility allows them to navigate through economic downturns and capitalize on emerging trends. In contrast, larger corporations may be burdened by bureaucracy and slow decision-making processes, which can hinder their ability to respond swiftly to market changes.

Another factor that contributes to the outperformance of Asian family businesses is their strong governance structures. Family businesses often have well-defined governance mechanisms in place, such as family councils or boards, to ensure effective decision-making and accountability. These structures help to mitigate conflicts of interest and promote transparency and fairness in the management of the business. Strong governance practices contribute to the overall stability and performance of family businesses.

It is important to note that not all Asian family businesses outperform market indices. The study also identified a group of underperforming family businesses that struggled to generate positive returns. These underperformers often faced challenges related to succession planning, governance issues, or a lack of strategic vision. However, the overall trend suggests that Asian family businesses have the potential to deliver strong financial performance and contribute significantly to the local economies.

In conclusion, the research conducted by the Credit Suisse Emerging Market Research Institute highlights the outperformance of Asian family businesses compared to market indices. Despite their relatively short history in the equity market, Asian family businesses have demonstrated their ability to generate above-average returns. Their long-term perspective, strong sense of purpose, agility, and effective governance structures contribute to their success. As Asian family businesses continue to grow and evolve, further research and analysis will be crucial in understanding their impact on the global economy and identifying best practices for their sustainable growth.
