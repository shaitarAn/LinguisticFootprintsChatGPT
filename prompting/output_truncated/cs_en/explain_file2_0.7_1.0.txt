This news article discusses three possible scenarios for the future of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and their potential impact on financial markets and risky assets.

The first scenario is described as a "worsening crisis possibly leading to a break-up of EMU." In this scenario, joint fiscal policies would be implemented, including more automatic transfers from stronger to weaker regions. There would also be joint guarantees for bonds issued by member governments, with the share of guaranteed bonds to be determined. Central supervision of budgetary policies and strict enforcement of deficit and debt rules would also be put in place. This scenario is seen as positive for financial markets, with an expected decrease in volatility and increase in risk appetite. It is anticipated that there would be a rally in all risky assets such as stocks and credits, with narrowing spreads on corporate bonds as well as emerging market and high yield bonds. The euro would appreciate while the US dollar and Swiss franc would depreciate.

The second scenario is referred to as "Muddling through." It involves a controlled Greek debt restructuring in stages, along with a slow recovery of confidence over time. The European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) changes are approved, fiscal consolidation plans are implemented in high debt countries, and bank sector re-capitalizations take place where needed. The European Central Bank (ECB) provides continued support through liquidity provisions and may cut interest rates if necessary. In this scenario, market volatility gradually decreases but periodic spikes can still occur on bad news. Government bond yields remain fairly low overall, but credit spreads stay elevated particularly in lower-rated segments. Currencies remain range-bound with some fluctuations within specific trading ranges.

The third scenario involves a potential restructuring of Greek debt beyond the current terms agreed upon by creditors. This could lead to increased risk aversion initially due to concerns about other weak countries' debts like Portugal's. Bank sector re-capitalizations become necessary along with ECB support through large-scale purchases of peripheral sovereign bonds and unlimited liquidity provisions. In the second phase of this scenario, Greece's public finances would be put on a sustainable path, allowing it to stay in the EMU. Market volatility temporarily spikes but then decreases after policy responses. Credit spreads widen sharply due to increased default risks, and liquidity stress and counterparty risk surge as bank collapses are factored in.

The article notes that the most favorable scenario is a full fiscal union with the introduction of a Eurobond market, but considers it unlikely. The least desirable outcome is a major global crisis leading to a break-up of EMU. The reality is expected to be somewhere between these two extremes, with Europe muddling through its debt and currency challenges.

Overall, the article highlights different possibilities for the future of EMU and their potential impact on financial markets and risky assets. It emphasizes that market conditions can change over time based on developments in the coming weeks and months.
