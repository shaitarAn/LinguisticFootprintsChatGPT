The news article discusses three scenarios that could potentially unfold in the Eurozone. The first scenario, referred to as the "most positive," involves the implementation of joint fiscal policies, joint guarantees for member governments' bonds, central supervision of budgetary policies, and strict enforcement of deficit and debt rules. In this scenario, it is expected that financial markets would experience a decrease in volatility and an increase in risk appetite. This would lead to a rally in risky assets such as stocks and credits, as well as narrowing spreads on corporate and emerging market bonds. The US dollar and Swiss franc would depreciate, while the euro would appreciate. German, Swiss, and US government bond yields would increase, while yields for peripheral countries like Italy and Spain would decline.

The second scenario, referred to as "Muddling through," describes a controlled restructuring of Greek debt, a slow recovery of confidence, and the implementation of fiscal consolidation plans in high debt countries. In this scenario, market volatility would gradually decrease, although periodic spikes may occur due to bad news. Liquidity and counterparty risk would also gradually decline. Credit spreads would remain elevated, particularly in lower-rated segments, and bank stocks would continue to underperform until re-capitalizations are implemented. Currencies would generally remain range-bound, with the euro to US dollar exchange rate trading between 1.30 and 1.40. Cyclical commodities would have low single-digit returns, and gold would offer moderate upside. Derivatives strategies would be more complicated to execute due to difficulties in hedging and structuring.

The third scenario is considered the least desirable and could potentially lead to a major global crisis. It involves a restructuring of Greek debt beyond the terms of the current debt exchange, bank sector re-capitalizations, and the need for massive liquidity support from central banks. In this scenario, market volatility would significantly increase, European stocks would fall, and government bond yields would rally. Credit spreads would widen sharply, and liquidity stress and counterparty risk would surge. The Swiss franc would appreciate against the euro, and cyclical commodities would fall sharply.

The article emphasizes that the likelihood of a full fiscal union and the introduction of a Eurobond market (Scenario 1) is relatively unlikely, while the worst-case scenario (Scenario 3) is also not expected to unfold. The reality is expected to be somewhere in between these two outcomes, with Europe working through its debt and currency challenges.

Please note that the article provides a general overview of the scenarios and their potential impacts on financial markets. The likelihood and specific details of each scenario may change over time as developments unfold in the Eurozone.
