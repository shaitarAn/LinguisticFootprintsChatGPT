This news article discusses a study that focuses on Asian family businesses and their impact on the market. It highlights several key findings about these businesses, including their growth potential, sector distribution, regional concentration, employment contribution, funding behavior, and long-term investment strategies.

The study reveals that Asian family businesses with a market capitalization of over 50 million US dollars were mostly listed after 2000. This is attributed to the fact that many family businesses in Asia are first-generation businesses compared to Europe and the USA where they are often in their fourth or fifth generation. The early stage of these Asian family businesses' lifecycles contributes to a growth bias among them.

The total market capitalization of Asian family businesses in the study has increased roughly six-fold between 2000 and 2010. This growth can be attributed to their entrepreneurial drive to seek growth opportunities through fundraising in capital markets. Additionally, since the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, there has been rapid development in the Asian capital market.

The study finds that Asian family businesses are more prevalent in traditional sectors such as Financials (banks and real estate), Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Consumer Staples. This is because historically family-controlled management tends to be conservative when it comes to innovation and investment in high-risk new ventures. However, South Korea, Taiwan, and India have higher concentrations of technology-related family businesses due to their technology-driven industrial structure.

Asian family businesses have limited exposure to energy-intensive sectors like telecom services and utilities due to restricted access for these industries controlled by state monopolies or highly regulated entities. Moreover, their risk-averse investment strategy also plays a role in limiting investments into these capital intensive industries.

Family businesses represent about 50 percent of all listed companies studied across Asia. South Asia has a higher concentration of such companies compared to North Asia (65 percent vs 37 percent). India has the largest number of reviewed family-owned businesses (67 percent) while Chinese family businesses account for the lowest percentage (13 percent) due to the country's state-owned economic structure.

As employers, family businesses hire 57 percent and 32 percent of all employees in South Asia and North Asia, respectively. However, as a percentage of the total labor force, their contribution is relatively small. This is because employment in Asia is mostly accounted for by the public sector, unlisted firms, and self-employment.

In terms of regional distribution within Asia, Singapore stands out with family businesses accounting for 63 percent of listed companies. Their total market capitalization accounts for 54 percent of the market total and 140 percent of nominal GDP â€“ second only to Hong Kong. Family-owned businesses also dominate corporate hirings in Singapore (61 percent).

The study shows that funding behavior differs between family businesses and non-family businesses across Asia. Family businesses rely more on bank lending rather than issuing bonds to finance their activities. In South Asia, there has been a significant increase in bond issuances by family businesses from 19 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2011. In contrast, North Asian family firms have remained stagnant at a share of around 20%, likely due to abundant liquidity available to them.

Family-run companies generally have credit ratings similar to non-family firms (BBB median rating) in South Asia but show greater disparity in North Asia where some have received high-single A ratings while non-family firms enjoy an A- rating on average.

Asian family-owned enterprises are characterized by long-term investment horizons rather than focusing solely on short-term earnings boosts. They prioritize long-term financial management over short-term share price performance which
