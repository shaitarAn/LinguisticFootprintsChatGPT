This news article discusses three possible scenarios for the future of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and their potential impact on financial markets.

The first scenario, referred to as the "Worsening crisis possibly leading to a break-up of EMU," describes a situation where joint fiscal policies are implemented to support weaker regions. This includes automatic transfers from stronger to weaker regions and joint guarantees for bonds issued by member governments. The share of guaranteed bonds would be determined, with an initial proposal of up to 60 percent of GDP. Additionally, there would be central supervision of budgetary policies and strict enforcement of deficit and debt rules outlined in the Maastricht Treaty. In this scenario, the EMU would experience a return to growth, leading to a decrease in volatility and an increase in risk appetite. This would result in a rally in risky assets such as stocks and credits, with narrowing spreads on corporate and emerging market bonds. The euro would appreciate, while the US dollar and Swiss franc would depreciate. German, Swiss, and US government bond yields would increase, while yields for peripheral countries like Italy and Spain would decline.

The second scenario, referred to as "Muddling through," describes a controlled debt restructuring for Greece and a slow recovery of confidence over a long period. In this scenario, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would undergo changes, fiscal consolidation plans would be implemented in high debt countries, and bank sector re-capitalizations would occur where needed. The European Central Bank (ECB) would provide continued support through liquidity provisions and potential interest rate cuts. While EMU growth would slow due to fiscal policy restrictions, recession would be avoided due to easier monetary policy. In this scenario, market volatility would gradually decrease, but periodic spikes could occur. Credit spreads would remain elevated, and stock performance would be mixed. Currencies would remain range-bound, with the euro and US dollar trading within a specific range. Cyclical commodities would have low single-digit returns, and gold would offer moderate upside. Derivatives strategies would be more complicated due to difficulties in hedging and structuring.

The third scenario, referred to as a "Major crisis," describes a situation where one country, such as Greece, exits the EMU, leading to a collapse of trust in Europe and a global credit crunch. Weaker Eurozone countries would default, and there could be deposit freezes to prevent bank runs. In this scenario, market volatility would increase significantly, European stocks would fall, and government bond yields would rally. Credit spreads would widen, and liquidity stress and counterparty risk would surge. Implementing derivatives and structured strategies would become challenging. The Swiss franc would appreciate against the euro, and the US dollar and Japanese yen would strengthen. Cyclical commodities would experience a sharp decline.

The article concludes by stating that the most favorable scenario, a full fiscal union and the introduction of a Eurobond market, is unlikely to occur. The least desirable outcome, a major global crisis, is also relatively unlikely. The reality is expected to be somewhere in between these two extremes, with Europe navigating its debt and currency challenges.

Overall, the article provides an analysis of the potential scenarios for the future of the EMU and their implications for financial markets.
