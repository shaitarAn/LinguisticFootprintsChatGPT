This news article discusses the issue of food waste in Switzerland and introduces a new packaging system developed by a start-up company called innveri. Currently, a significant amount of food, worth approximately four billion Swiss francs, ends up in domestic waste each year in Switzerland. Additionally, more than 50% of household garbage consists of food packaging that is often used for decorative or advertising purposes.

In response to this problem, innveri has created a new packaging system that will be launched on the Swiss market in spring 2012. This product aims to protect food from germs and bacteria while maintaining its visual appeal and quality, thereby extending its shelf life. Compared to conventional preservation methods, this new system allows food to be consumed for a period between twice and 20 times as long.

The innovative aspect of innveri's packaging system is twofold. Firstly, it makes active packaging accessible to households whereas it was previously only used in industry. Secondly, it does not produce any waste or require electricity consumption.

The new secondary packaging solution offered by innveri serves as an alternative to existing options such as aluminum foil, Tupperware, and small plastic bags. The company's goal is to provide customers with familiar elements while offering an easy-to-use high-quality system solution rather than just an individual product.

The idea for this product concept originated six years ago when Manfred Jüni was studying engineering sciences at the University of Applied Sciences in Fribourg. Jüni noticed the amount of pre-packed fresh foods he consumed that deteriorated quickly once opened and wondered if there was a way to seal them again or package fresh or cooked foods attractively like those found on store shelves.

After years of hard work and support from various institutions including the Institute for Value-based Enterprise (IVE) in Fribourg and Noventa AG based in Diepoldsau (innveri's main production partner), Jüni's dream of self-employment and entrepreneurship became a reality. Now, innveri has its headquarters in Murten and employs four people.

Although Jüni is focused on the launch of his packaging system, innveri is also involved in a pilot project with the city of Berne to reduce disposable packaging used in takeaways. The long-term objective is to minimize litter problems and waste mountains across all urban areas in Switzerland.

Jüni believes that there should be increased government support for early-stage firms like his to promote entrepreneurship and job creation. He notes that funding was one of the significant challenges he faced during the development of his product.

Overall, this article highlights the issue of food waste and introduces an innovative solution offered by innveri through their new packaging system. The company aims to reduce waste by extending the shelf life of food products while providing an easy-to-use alternative to traditional packaging options.
