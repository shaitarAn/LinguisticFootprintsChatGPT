This news article discusses three possible scenarios for the future of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and their potential impact on financial markets.

The first scenario, referred to as a "break-up of EMU," describes a situation where the crisis in the eurozone worsens to the point where it leads to a potential break-up of the monetary union. In this scenario, joint fiscal policies would be implemented, including automatic transfers from stronger regions to weaker ones. There would also be joint guarantees for bonds issued by member governments, with up to 60 percent of GDP being guaranteed initially. Central supervision of budgetary policies and strict enforcement of deficit and debt rules would also be put in place. This scenario is seen as positive for financial markets and risky assets, leading to a decrease in volatility and an increase in risk appetite. It is expected that there would be a rally in stocks and credits, with narrowing spreads on corporate bonds as well as emerging market and high yield bonds.

The second scenario described is referred to as "muddling through." This scenario involves controlled Greek debt restructuring over several stages, along with a slow recovery of confidence spread out over time due to unresolved underlying debt problems. Fiscal consolidation plans would be implemented in high-debt countries, while bank sector re-capitalizations would take place where needed. The European Central Bank (ECB) would provide continued support through liquidity provisions and potentially cutting interest rates. In this scenario, market volatility gradually decreases but periodic spikes may occur due to bad news. Credit spreads remain elevated while government bond yields decline slightly for countries like Italy and Spain.

The third scenario discussed is considered the least desirable outcome - a major crisis that could lead to global repercussions if not managed properly. This could involve one country exiting EMU or even Germany leaving which could cause an acute collapse of trust leading to credit crunches and global recession. Weaker Eurozone countries may default on their debts while deposit freezes are imposed to prevent bank runs. In this scenario, market volatility increases significantly, European stocks fall to or below 2009 levels, and government bond yields rally. Credit spreads widen sharply as default risks rise and liquidity stress and counterparty risk surge.

The article concludes by stating that the most favorable scenario would be a full fiscal union and the introduction of a Eurobond market, but it is considered unlikely. The least desirable outcome is a major crisis, which is also relatively unlikely to occur. The reality is expected to be somewhere in between these two extremes, with Europe muddling through its debt and currency challenges.

Overall, the article provides an analysis of different scenarios for the future of the eurozone and their potential impact on financial markets. It highlights the importance of fiscal policies, joint guarantees for bonds, central supervision of budgetary policies, and support from central banks in managing the crisis effectively.
