This news article discusses the issue of food waste in Switzerland and introduces a new packaging system developed by a start-up company called innveri. The article highlights that a significant amount of food, worth approximately four billion Swiss francs, ends up in domestic waste each year in Switzerland. Additionally, over 50% of household garbage consists of food packaging that is often used for decorative or advertising purposes.

In response to this problem, innveri has created a new packaging system that aims to protect food from germs and bacteria while maintaining its visual appeal and quality. This innovative packaging allows food to have an extended shelf life compared to conventional preservation methods. As a result, the food is more likely to be consumed rather than thrown away, contributing to waste reduction.

The innveri packaging system can be used for fresh produce, opened packages, and cooked food. What sets this product apart is its accessibility for households and its eco-friendly features. Unlike other options such as aluminum foil or plastic bags, the innveri solution does not produce any waste or require electricity consumption.

The founder of innveri, Manfred Jüni, came up with the idea while studying engineering sciences at the University of Applied Sciences in Fribourg. He was inspired by his own experience with pre-packaged meals and wondered if it would be possible to reseal opened packages or package fresh/cooked foods attractively like those found on store shelves.

After six years of development, innveri now has its headquarters in Murten on the Roland bakery site. The company employs four people and shares office space with MJ2B Architekten AG.

Jüni received support from various institutions during his entrepreneurial journey. The IVE (Institute for Value-based Enterprise) in Fribourg provided assistance early on through Claude Piccot and Osama Rifai who are currently involved with innveri AG as Chairman of the Board of Directors and CFO, respectively. Noventa AG, based in Diepoldsau, is innveri's main production partner.

While preparing for the launch of the packaging system, innveri is also involved in a pilot project with the city of Berne to reduce disposable packaging used in takeaways. The long-term objective is to address waste issues and litter problems across urban areas in Switzerland.

In conclusion, this news article highlights the problem of food waste and excessive food packaging in Switzerland. It introduces innveri's innovative packaging system that aims to extend the shelf life of food and reduce waste. The article also mentions the challenges faced by innveri during its development and emphasizes the need for increased support for early-stage firms in Switzerland.
