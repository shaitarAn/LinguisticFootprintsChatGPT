The article discusses the issue of food waste and excessive packaging in Switzerland. It highlights that a significant amount of food, worth approximately four billion Swiss francs, ends up in domestic waste each year. Additionally, more than 50% of household garbage consists of food packaging that is often used for decorative or advertising purposes.

To address this problem, a Seeland-based startup called innveri has developed a new packaging system that provides better protection for food against germs and bacteria, ensuring a longer shelf life. Compared to conventional preservation methods, this new packaging system allows food to be consumed for a period between two and 20 times longer, reducing the amount of food that is thrown away. The packaging system is suitable for fresh produce, opened packaging, and cooked food.

What sets innveri's packaging system apart is that it incorporates active packaging technology, which was previously only used in industries. The new system is easily accessible to households, does not produce any waste, and does not consume electricity. It serves as a substitute for limited options like aluminum foil, Tupperware, and plastic bags.

The article mentions that the concept for this packaging system originated from the founder, Manfred Jüni, who as a student frequently consumed ready meals and pre-packed fresh foods. He wondered if it would be possible to seal opened packaging again or package fresh and cooked foods attractively, similar to how they are found on grocery store shelves. Jüni's idea has materialized after six years of hard work, resulting in innveri establishing its headquarters in Murten, Switzerland.

The startup has received support from various organizations, including the Institute for Value-based Enterprise (IVE) in Fribourg and Noventa AG in Diepoldsau, their main production partner. Jüni emphasizes the challenges faced in terms of funding and the need for increased government support for early-stage companies, allowing them to promote entrepreneurship and create jobs. He also mentions that innveri is involved in a pilot project with the city of Berne to reduce disposable packaging in takeaways and aims to tackle litter and waste issues in urban areas across Switzerland.

The article concludes by highlighting that the launch of innveri's packaging system is imminent and expresses the company's excitement about finally seeing their product on store shelves.
