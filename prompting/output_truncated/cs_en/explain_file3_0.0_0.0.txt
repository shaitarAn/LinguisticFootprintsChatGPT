This news article discusses the issue of food waste in Switzerland and introduces a new packaging system developed by a start-up company called innveri. The article highlights that a significant amount of food, worth approximately four billion Swiss francs, ends up in domestic waste each year in Switzerland. Additionally, more than 50% of household garbage consists of food packaging, which is often used for decorative or advertising purposes.

In response to this problem, innveri has developed a packaging system that aims to protect food from germs and bacteria, while also maintaining its visual appeal and quality. This system allows food to have a longer shelf life compared to conventional preservation methods, which means that it can be consumed for a longer period of time. This, in turn, contributes to reducing food waste.

What makes innveri's packaging system innovative is that it can be used for fresh produce, opened packaging, and cooked food. The system utilizes active packaging, which was previously only used in the industry, and makes it accessible to households. Furthermore, the system does not produce any waste or consume electricity, making it an environmentally friendly solution.

The article mentions that the new packaging system is a substitute for existing options such as aluminum foil, Tupperware, and small plastic bags. The goal is to provide customers with a high-quality and cutting-edge system solution that is easy and quick to use.

The idea for this product concept originated from the founder of innveri, Manfred JÃ¼ni, who was inspired by his own experience of consuming pre-packaged foods. After years of hard work, innveri is now ready to launch its product on the market. The company is based in Murten and currently employs four people.

In addition to developing the packaging system, innveri is also involved in a pilot project with the city of Berne to reduce the use of disposable packaging in takeaways. The long-term objective is to reduce waste in urban areas across Switzerland.

The article concludes by highlighting the challenges faced by innveri, particularly in terms of funding and convincing potential investors. The founder emphasizes the need for increased support for early-stage firms in Switzerland to promote entrepreneurship and job creation.

Overall, this news article discusses the issue of food waste in Switzerland and introduces a new packaging system developed by innveri. The system aims to reduce food waste by providing better protection and longer shelf life for food products.
