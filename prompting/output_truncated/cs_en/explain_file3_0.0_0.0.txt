This news article discusses the issue of food waste in Switzerland and introduces a new packaging system developed by a start-up company called innveri. The article highlights that a significant amount of food, worth approximately four billion Swiss francs, ends up in domestic waste each year in Switzerland. Additionally, more than 50% of household garbage consists of food packaging, which is often used for decorative or advertising purposes.

In response to this problem, innveri has developed a packaging system that aims to protect food from germs and bacteria, while also maintaining its visual appeal and quality. This system allows food to have a longer shelf life compared to conventional preservation methods, which means that it can be consumed for a longer period of time. This, in turn, reduces food waste as more food is actually eaten rather than thrown away.

What makes innveri's packaging system innovative is that it can be used for fresh produce, opened packaging, and cooked food. The system utilizes active packaging, which was previously only used in the industry, and makes it accessible to households. Furthermore, the system does not produce any waste or consume electricity, making it a sustainable solution.

The article also mentions that innveri's packaging system is a substitute for existing options such as aluminum foil, Tupperware, and small plastic bags. The company aims to provide a high-quality and cutting-edge system solution that is easy and quick to use.

The idea for the product concept originated six years ago when the founder of innveri, Manfred Jüni, was studying engineering sciences and mechanical engineering. He noticed the amount of food packaging waste generated from ready meals and pre-packed fresh foods and started thinking about ways to seal the packaging again after it had been opened. This led to the development of the innveri packaging system.

Innveri has its head office in Murten and currently employs four people. The company has received support from the Institute for Value-based Enterprise (IVE) in Fribourg and has a production partner called Noventa AG. However, Jüni mentions that funding and convincing investors have been some of the biggest challenges for the company.

In addition to working on the launch of their packaging system, innveri is also involved in a pilot project with the city of Berne to reduce disposable packaging used in takeaways. The long-term objective is to reduce waste across all urban areas in Switzerland.

Overall, this news article highlights the issue of food waste in Switzerland and introduces innveri's innovative packaging system as a solution to reduce waste and extend the shelf life of food. The article also mentions the challenges faced by the company and their involvement in a pilot project to tackle waste in the takeaway industry.
