This news article discusses various aspects of data centers, including their cooling requirements, security measures, power supply backup systems, energy efficiency, and potential locations for future data centers.

The article begins by highlighting the need to cool data centers and ensure their security from both physical and online threats. It mentions that multi-core processors have increased the number of servers in a data center to a huge scale, comparable to a small city in terms of power demand. Data centers are often located in areas with inexpensive electricity and surplus supply.

To prevent complete shutdown in case of power line damage or other issues, data centers have backup power supplies such as rooms full of batteries and diesel generators. These backups provide enough time for the center to shut down properly or work with utility companies to restore power. The article emphasizes that downtime is inevitable but can be minimized through redundancy and diversification.

Large companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have multiple data centers spread around the world. In case one center faces problems due to natural disasters or other issues, their software architecture redirects work seamlessly to other functioning centers.

The article also introduces PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness), which measures the ratio of total energy consumed by a data center compared to just IT equipment consumption. Leading-edge centers now operate at PUEs around 1.2 or 1.25 compared to much higher values five years ago (around 4 or 5). This reduction is due to advancements in energy efficiency within support functions like cooling and electricity distribution.

Efforts are being made not only by large corporations but also by smaller companies deploying computing into clouds (like Amazon's EC2) to make their data centers more energy efficient. Some companies seek cleaner energy sources while others aim at cost savings through cloud deployment during peak demand periods.

When choosing locations for new data centers, factors like customer base, internet connectivity quality/costs, and electricity costs play crucial roles. Areas along national highways tend to have better connectivity due to existing cable infrastructure. Locations with cheap hydroelectric power, like Washington State in the US, are attractive for data center deployment. The article also mentions Africa as a region with fast-growing internet access but relatively fewer local data centers.

The author speculates on potential future developments in data centers, including the possibility of placing a million computers individually in people's closets instead of consolidating them under one roof. This concept suggests that companies like Google could provide users with computers that also execute cloud services.

In conclusion, the article provides insights into various aspects of data centers such as cooling requirements, security measures, backup power systems, energy efficiency improvements over time, and potential locations for future data centers. It highlights the importance of redundancy and diversification to minimize downtime and discusses efforts by companies to make their data centers more energy efficient.
