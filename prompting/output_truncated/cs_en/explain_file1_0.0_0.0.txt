This news article discusses a study that focuses on Asian family businesses and their impact on the region's economies. The study reveals that Asian family businesses have experienced significant growth in market capitalization between 2000 and 2010, largely due to their early stage of development and the less-developed capital markets in the region. Compared to family businesses in Europe and the USA, which are often in their fourth or fifth generation, many Asian family businesses are first-generation businesses. This early stage of development contributes to a growth bias among Asian family businesses.

The study also highlights that Asian family businesses are more prevalent in traditional sectors such as Financials (banks and real estate), Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Consumer Staples. This is because family-controlled management tends to be conservative in innovation and investment in high-risk new businesses. However, South Korea, Taiwan, and India have a higher concentration of technology-related family businesses due to their technology-driven industrial structures.

The article mentions that Asian family businesses have limited exposure to capital-intensive sectors such as energy, telecom services, and utilities. This is mainly due to the lack of access for Asian family businesses to gain control over these highly regulated and state monopolized industries. Additionally, family firms tend to be more risk-averse in their investment strategies, which influences their cautious approach towards capital-intensive industries.

The study finds that family businesses represent about 50 percent of all listed companies in the Asian economies analyzed. South Asia has a higher concentration of family businesses compared to North Asia, with India being home to the largest number of family businesses. However, family businesses account for a relatively small percentage of the total labor force, indicating that the majority of employment in Asia is provided by the public sector, unlisted firms, and self-employment.

In Singapore, family businesses play a prominent role in the domestic economy and capital market. They account for a significant percentage of listed companies, total market capitalization, and total corporate hirings. Historically, non-family businesses have been larger contributors to total fixed asset investments in Singapore. However, in 2009, investment outlays by family businesses surged, primarily due to investments in integrated resorts.

The article also highlights the funding behavior of family businesses compared to non-family businesses. Family businesses rely more on bank lending rather than issuing bonds to finance their activities. In South Asia, the share of family businesses' bond issuances has been rising, while in North Asia, it has stagnated due to abundant liquidity available to family businesses. Credit ratings of family businesses and non-family businesses differ significantly in North Asia, with some family businesses receiving high ratings.

Asian family businesses share common characteristics with their western counterparts, as they prioritize long-term investment horizons over short-term earnings. Family ownership provides stability and continuity in business ownership and management, allowing for long-term investment strategies that maximize firm value. This long-term focus encourages strategic investment in areas such as brand building, research and development, and human capital development.

Despite facing challenges such as the internet bubble crisis in 2002-2003 and the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, Asian family businesses have performed well. The study shows that total return of Asian family businesses during 2000-2010 was a cumulative 261 percent, outperforming local benchmarks in seven out of the ten Asian markets analyzed. This outperformance is driven by above-market average earnings growth and profitability.

Throughout the last decade, Asian family businesses have also delivered a higher average dividend yield spread compared to the market average, indicating their ability to create shareholder value.

In conclusion, the study highlights the significant role of Asian family businesses in the region's economies. Despite being in their early stages of development and facing challenges, these businesses have experienced substantial growth and have outperformed local benchmarks in many cases. Their long-term focus and commitment to strategic investment contribute to their success.
