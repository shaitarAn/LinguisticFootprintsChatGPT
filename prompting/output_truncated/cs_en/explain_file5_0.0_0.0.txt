This news article discusses the use of Big Data and its impact on personal privacy. It highlights how Big Data approaches, enabled by internet technologies, have made it faster, cheaper, and easier to gather and analyze large quantities of data compared to traditional methods. However, it also raises concerns about the risks to personal privacy that come with the use of Big Data.

The article mentions that these risks range from people knowing more about individuals than necessary to people wrongly inferring things about individuals based on their data. It suggests that privacy concerns could be one of the biggest barriers to the adoption of Big Data solutions in the long term.

The article then delves into the concept of privacy, stating that while feelings about privacy are deep-rooted in the industrialized West, the legal right to privacy is relatively recent. Privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the US Constitution, and whether it is implied is a matter of ongoing legal debate. The article mentions that US laws governing privacy are generally sector-specific and reflect the country's inclination towards self-regulation.

In contrast, Europe takes a more comprehensive and preventive approach to privacy protection. The European Convention on Human Rights explicitly guarantees respect for an individual's private and family life. The European Union requires its member states to ensure citizens' right to privacy. The EU is currently revising its Data Protection Directive to create a single law for all member states and to address new technologies like social networks and the cloud. The proposed law includes provisions such as obtaining explicit consent before processing data and giving individuals the right to delete their data.

The article also discusses how companies and individuals approach privacy. It mentions that financial firms take data protection seriously because it is their value proposition, while younger industries like social networks encourage users to share more information to enhance the network. The article highlights that companies' privacy policies are influenced by how they make money, with websites relying on advertising having an incentive to collect more data to target ads effectively.

The article emphasizes that consumers are becoming more aware of privacy issues and are willing to uninstall or refuse to install apps due to concerns about sharing private information. However, it also acknowledges that few people read privacy policies before using apps because they are long and complex.

The article then discusses a research group that combines Big Data techniques with crowdsourcing to examine privacy issues with smartphone apps. The group found that people often did not know what data their apps were collecting and were most uncomfortable when the use of their data was unexpected. It suggests that explaining the purpose of data in a concise and understandable manner can help alleviate users' concerns.

The article concludes by suggesting that individuals can protect their privacy by being more selective in what they share with others and periodically deleting web browser cookies. It also mentions that there are business opportunities in helping consumers manage their privacy online and with smartphones. However, it highlights the challenge posed by data collected in the physical world by sensors, such as wearable devices and smart cars, and emphasizes the need for better privacy laws to protect personal data in such scenarios.
