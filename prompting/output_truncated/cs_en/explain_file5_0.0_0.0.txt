This news article discusses the use of Big Data and its impact on personal privacy. It highlights how Big Data approaches, enabled by internet technologies, have made it faster, cheaper, and easier to gather and analyze large quantities of data compared to traditional methods. However, it also raises concerns about the risks to personal privacy that come with the use of Big Data.

The article mentions that these risks range from people knowing more about individuals than necessary to people wrongly inferring things about individuals based on their data. It suggests that privacy concerns could be one of the biggest barriers to the adoption of Big Data solutions in the long term.

The article then delves into the concept of privacy, stating that while feelings about privacy are deep-rooted in the industrialized West, the legal right to privacy is relatively recent. Privacy is not explicitly mentioned in the US Constitution, and its implication is currently a matter of legal debate. The article mentions that US privacy laws are generally sector-specific and reflect the country's inclination towards self-regulation.

In contrast, Europe takes a more comprehensive and preventive approach to privacy protection. The European Convention on Human Rights explicitly guarantees respect for an individual's private and family life. The European Union requires its member states to ensure citizens' right to privacy and is currently revising its Data Protection Directive to account for globalization and new technologies.

The article discusses the provisions of the draft General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, which includes requiring companies to obtain explicit consent before processing individuals' data and giving online users the "right to be forgotten." It also mentions that offending companies can be fined up to 2 percent of their global turnover.

The article highlights that the data technology landscape is rapidly evolving, with researchers working on systems that can gather data from real-world advertisements and TV sets. It also mentions the capabilities of smartphones to sense various aspects and access personal information.

The article states that how likely companies are to protect user data depends on the specific industry and their value proposition. Financial firms take data protection seriously, while younger industries like social networks encourage users to share more information to enhance their networks. The article also mentions that companies that derive revenue from advertising have an incentive to collect more data to target ads effectively.

The article acknowledges that consumers are becoming more aware of privacy issues and are willing to uninstall or refuse to install apps due to concerns about sharing private information. However, it also mentions that very few people read privacy policies before installing apps due to their length and complexity.

The article then discusses the research group's focus on combining Big Data techniques with crowdsourcing to examine privacy issues with smartphone apps. They found that people often did not know what data their apps were collecting and were least comfortable when the use of their data was unexpected. The article suggests that explaining the purpose of data in a glanceable form can lower users' concerns.

Finally, the article suggests that individuals can protect their privacy by being more selective in what they share with others and periodically deleting web browser cookies. It also mentions the potential business opportunities in helping consumers manage their privacy online and with smartphones. However, it highlights the challenge posed by data being collected in the physical world by sensors and emphasizes the need for better privacy laws to protect personal data adequately.

In summary, the article discusses the benefits and risks of using Big Data, the differences in privacy approaches between the US and Europe, the evolving data technology landscape, and the importance of privacy laws in protecting personal data.
