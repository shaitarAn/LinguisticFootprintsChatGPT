This news article discusses the characteristics and significance of family businesses in Asia. The study reviewed family businesses with a market capitalization of over 50 million US dollars, which were listed after the year 2000.

One key observation is that many Asian family businesses are first-generation businesses, meaning they are relatively new compared to family businesses in Europe and the USA, which can be in their fourth or fifth generation. This suggests that Asian family businesses are in an early stage of development, leading to a bias towards growth. The total market capitalization of Asian family businesses increased by approximately six times between 2000 and 2010.

The article also highlights that Asian family businesses are more prevalent in traditional sectors such as Financials (banks and real estate), Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Consumer Staples. This concentration can be attributed to conservative management practices within these sectors.

On the other hand, countries like South Korea, Taiwan, and India have a higher concentration of technology-related family businesses due to their technology-driven industrial structures. The analysis suggests that this is because these economies provide better opportunities for innovation and investment in high-risk new ventures.

Regarding sector exposure, Asian family businesses have limited presence in energy-intensive sectors like telecom services and utilities due to lack of control over highly regulated state monopolies. Family firms tend to follow a risk-averse investment strategy when considering opportunities within these capital-intensive industries.

The study finds that family-owned companies represent about 50 percent of all listed companies within Asia's markets. South Asia has a higher concentration with 65 percent compared to North Asia's 37 percent. India has the largest number of reviewed family-owned companies (67 percent), while China has the lowest percentage (13 percent) due to its state-owned economic structure.

Family-owned firms account for around 57 percent and 32 percent respectively for all employees hired by listed companies within South Asia and North Asia. However, as percentages relative to the total labor force, their contributions are minimal due to the dominance of the public sector, unlisted firms, and self-employment.

In terms of regional influence, Singapore stands out as family businesses represent a significant portion of the domestic economy and capital market. They account for 63 percent of listed companies in Singapore and hold 54 percent of the market's total capitalization.

The report also covers funding behavior differences between family-owned businesses and non-family businesses. Family firms rely more on bank lending rather than issuing bonds to finance their activities. However, South Asian family businesses have seen an increase in bond issuances from 19 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2011. In contrast, North Asian family businesses have remained stagnant at a share of 20 percent due to abundant liquidity available to them.

Family-owned firms are recognized for their long-term investment horizons and commitment as stakeholders. They prioritize long-term financial management over short-term earnings boosting strategies. This perspective allows them to focus on vital investments such as brand building, research and development, and human capital development.

Despite enduring bear markets during the internet bubble crisis (2002-2003) and global financial crisis (2008-2009), Asian family businesses achieved a cumulative return of 261 percent from 2000-2010 with a compound annual growth rate of 13.7 percent. Family businesses outperformed local benchmarks in seven out of ten Asian markets during this period.

Overall, this study emphasizes that family-owned businesses play a crucial role in Asia's economies by representing significant portions of listed companies' employees and contributing to market performance through steady growth strategies focused on long-term value creation.
