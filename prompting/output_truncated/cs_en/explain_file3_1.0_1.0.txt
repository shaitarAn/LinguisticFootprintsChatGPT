This news article discusses the issue of food waste and packaging waste in Switzerland and introduces a new packaging system developed by a start-up company called innveri. The article highlights that a significant amount of food, worth approximately four billion Swiss francs, ends up in domestic waste every year in Switzerland. Additionally, over 50% of household garbage is made up of food packaging, which is often used for decorative or advertising purposes.

In response to these challenges, innveri has developed a packaging system that provides better protection against germs and bacteria, extends the shelf life of food, and retains its visual appeal and quality. Compared to conventional preservation methods, this new system allows food to be consumed for twice to twenty times longer, reducing waste significantly.

What sets innveri's packaging system apart is its accessibility for households and its sustainable design. Previously used only in industry settings, active packaging can now be easily utilized by individuals at home without producing any additional waste or consuming electricity. The solution offers an alternative to other limited options such as aluminum foil, Tupperware containers, or small plastic bags commonly used for storage.

The founder of innveri was inspired by his own experience as a student consuming ready meals and pre-packaged foods. This led him to develop the concept of resealable packaging that could maintain the freshness of opened items or present fresh or cooked foods attractively like store-shelf products.

After six years since its inception as an idea during his studies at the University of Applied Sciences in Fribourg, innveri now has its headquarters in Murten on the Roland bakery site. The company employs four people and shares office space with another entrepreneurial venture owned by Manfred Jüni's brother.

Innveri received support from various institutions during its journey towards launching this new innovative product on the market. The Institute for Value-based Enterprise (IVE) in Fribourg provided assistance through Claude Piccot and Osama Rifai, who currently hold key positions in innveri AG. The company's main production partner is Noventa AG, based in Diepoldsau.

Although Jüni is focused on the upcoming launch of the packaging system, innveri is also involved in a pilot project with the city of Berne aimed at reducing disposable packaging used in takeaways. They aim to extend this initiative to other urban areas in Switzerland to tackle litter problems and reduce waste mountains.

Jüni emphasizes that funding and convincing investors have been significant challenges for innveri. He believes there is room for improvement regarding government start-up capital support for early-stage firms to promote entrepreneurship and job creation. Once these ventures achieve progress, they can then approach private-sector institutions or investors for further support.

Overall, the article highlights the problem of food waste and excessive packaging waste in Switzerland while introducing a promising solution developed by innveri that aims to address these issues effectively. It also sheds light on their journey as a start-up company and partnerships that have supported their endeavors thus far.
