This news article discusses the issue of food waste in Switzerland and introduces a new packaging system developed by a Seeland-based start-up called innveri. The article states that approximately four billion Swiss francs worth of food, which is equivalent to around 1,050 Swiss francs per household, ends up in domestic waste every year in Switzerland. Additionally, more than 50 percent of household garbage consists of food packaging, often used for decorative or advertising purposes. This amounts to an annual volume of food packaging waste of 3.6 million tons or 450 kg per resident.

innveri has developed a new packaging system that aims to address this problem. The product, which is set to be launched in spring 2012, provides food with better protection against germs and bacteria, helps retain its visual appeal and quality, and extends its shelf life. Compared to conventional preservation methods, food can be consumed for a period between two and 20 times longer, reducing the amount of food that is wasted.

What sets innveri's packaging system apart is that it can be used for fresh produce, opened packaging, and cooked food. The packaging utilizes active technology, which was previously only used in industry but is now made accessible to households. It is innovative in that it does not produce any waste or consume electricity, making it an environmentally friendly solution. The new packaging system serves as a substitute for existing options such as aluminum foil, Tupperware, and small plastic bags.

The article also discusses the journey of innveri and its founder, Manfred J端ni. J端ni came up with the idea for the packaging system six years ago while studying engineering sciences and mechanical engineering at the University of Applied Sciences in Fribourg. He was inspired by the idea of being able to reseal opened packaging and package fresh or cooked foods in an attractive way. Now, innveri has its headquarters in Murten and employs four people.

J端ni received support from the Institute for Value-based Enterprise (IVE) in Fribourg and has been assisted by Claude Piccot and Osama Rifai. He also received support from Noventa AG, which is now innveri's main production partner. Despite the challenges faced along the way, J端ni believes that more support should be given to early-stage firms in Switzerland to promote entrepreneurship and job creation.

In addition to developing the packaging system, innveri is involved in a pilot project with the city of Berne to reduce the volume of disposable packaging used in takeaways. The long-term goal is to reduce litter and waste across all urban areas in Switzerland.

In conclusion, this news article highlights the issue of food waste in Switzerland and introduces innveri's innovative packaging system that aims to extend the shelf life of food and reduce waste. The article also discusses the journey of innveri and the support it has received, as well as its involvement in a pilot project to tackle disposable packaging in takeaways.
