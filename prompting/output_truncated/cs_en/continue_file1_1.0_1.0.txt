in the study have a stock market listing history of less than five years, compared to only 17 percent in Europe and the USA.

This might suggest that Asian family businesses are relatively new players in the equity markets, which could be attributed to various factors such as cultural preferences for privately held businesses, lack of awareness or understanding about stock market listings, or simply a preference for maintaining control over their operations. However, despite their shorter history in public markets, these family businesses have proven to be resilient and successful.

The study found that Asian family businesses outperform market indices consistently. Over a five-year period ending in 2019, these companies achieved an average annual return on equity (ROE) of 16.1 percent compared to the MSCI Asia Pacific index's average ROE of 10.5 percent. This outperformance is significant and showcases the strength and profitability of family-owned enterprises in Asia.

One possible explanation for this outperformance is the long-term mindset and strategic decision-making inherent in many family businesses. Unlike publicly listed companies that may face short-term pressures from shareholders demanding immediate profits, family businesses can afford to take a more patient approach and focus on sustainable growth.

Moreover, many Asian family businesses benefit from strong ties within their local communities and economies. They often have deep-rooted relationships with suppliers, customers, and other key stakeholders built over generations. These networks provide them with invaluable resources such as reliable supply chains or preferential treatment when it comes to accessing financing or securing government contracts.

Another contributing factor is the emphasis on succession planning within Asian families. In many cases, these businesses are handed down through generations with careful consideration given to grooming successors who understand the company's values and long-term vision. This continuity ensures stability and reduces disruptions during leadership transitions.

Furthermore, another advantage that some Asian family businesses possess is their ability to adapt quickly to changing market conditions due to their lean structures and decentralized decision-making processes. This agility allows them to seize opportunities and navigate challenges more efficiently than large, bureaucratic corporations.

However, it is important to note that not all Asian family businesses are equally successful. The study also revealed a notable performance gap between different industries and countries. For example, family businesses in the technology sector outperformed those in traditional industries such as manufacturing or retail.

Additionally, there were variations in performance across different Asian countries. Family businesses from China demonstrated the highest average ROE of 18.2 percent, followed by Singapore with 17.8 percent and India with 15.3 percent.

In conclusion, despite the limited research on family businesses in Asia, this recent study by the Credit Suisse Emerging Market Research Institute sheds light on their impressive financial performance compared to market indices. The outperformance can be attributed to several factors such as long-term thinking, strong community ties, strategic decision-making processes, succession planning practices within families, and agility in adapting to market conditions. However, it is crucial for policymakers and academics to further explore these trends and gather more comprehensive data to understand how these family businesses contribute to the overall economic growth of Asia and identify areas for improvement or support where needed
