He is a condemned man about to die in a brutal way.", "prompt": "His crime: The killing of his lover's husband. \n\nThe judge: A local warlord in Kand, Afghanistan. \n\nThe executioner: The victim's father. \n\nA mobile phone video captured the grisly scene. \n\nMany have gathered to watch this act, sitting on dusty earth, in dappled shade. \n\nNawroz, wrapped in a white shawl, gets up from his prayer mat. His alleged victim's father is led by another man to Nawroz. \"Hold the gun right,\" the man tells the father.", "text": "Bang. \n\nNawroz falls to the ground. \n\nTwo more shots ring out. \n\nThe warlord ordered the man to pull the trigger twice, but he kept on, unable to deliver a swift fatal shot. \n\n\"Stop shooting, you donkey,\" the spectators say. \n\n\"He's still alive,\" says one. \n\nBut not for long. \n\nThis is not a video taken before 2001, in the days when the Taliban ruled and Kabul's stadium was reserved not for soccer, but public executions. It's from last month. \n\nAfter a decade of the U.S.-led war to defeat extremism in Afghanistan, feudal justice still exists. \n\nIn remote Kand, outside the reach of NATO or the Afghan government, warlord Mullah Mustafa and his men rule by the gun. Mustafa helps keep the Taliban at bay, the people say, so the government lets him run his own fiefdom. \n\nIt's not the sort of compromise the United States imagined a decade ago, bringing a type of justice that's swift and brutal. \n\nHuman Rights Watch has said that in large parts of Afghanistan, no formal judicial system is in place and only tribal and other customary forms of justice are practiced. \n\nAnd a scathing report issued last year by the International Crisis Group described Afghanistan's judicial system as being \"in a catastrophic state of disrepair. \n\n\"A growing majority of Afghans have been forced to accept the rough justice of Taliban and criminal power brokers in areas of the country that lie beyond government control. \"\n\nThe report went on to say that the United States has not paid the same attention to justice reform as it has to other aspects of nation building. \n\n\"Its investment in judicial institutions is modest, as opposed to the billions invested in standing up the Afghan army and police,\" the report said. \n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development allocated only 1% of its Afghanistan budget between 2002 and 2007 -- $64 million -- to supporting the establishment of rule of law, the report said. \n\nHuman rights monitors have pressed President Hamid Karzai's government to prioritize the establishment of a professional judiciary. But Nawroz's execution is more evidence that Afghanistan has a long way to go. \n\nThere have been other cases that have sparked outrage. \n\nIn 2006, Abdul Rahman was arrested and threatened with death for converting to Christianity. Last year, the Taliban ordered the first public executions by stoning since their fall from power -- a young couple who had eloped died in horrific fashion. \n\nJalaludin, who witnessed Nawroz's execution, said Mustafa gathered local mullahs to reach a verdict according to sharia, or Islamic law. \n\n\"The mullahs asked the father to forgive Nawroz and to take some of his family's land and women in compensation,\" he said. \"But the father refused, so the mullahs ordered an execution. \"\n\nNawroz tried to buy his release, but Mustafa refused, Jalaludin said. He's not one to take bribes. \n\nAfter the killing, Nawroz first said he had been helped by his cousins, according to Abdul Gafor, one of Nawroz's cousins. \n\n\"For that reason, we were interrogated and beaten a lot during the questioning,\" Gafor said. \n\nBut later, when questioned by Mustafa, Nawroz changed his story and said he had killed alone, Gafor said. \n\nAnother cousin, Sikander, wished for law and order. \n\n\"We'd like strong government,\" he said. \"There's no police or government presence here, and Mullah Mustafa has government contacts. \"\n\nNawroz was a man whose jealousy allegedly led him to kill the man married to his lover. It's a story that has played out countless times in countless places. But here, in Kand, there was no trial, no jury of peers. Nawroz's punishment was strictly an eye for an eye, meted out in frightful fashion. \n\nCNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta."}, "2011-dc-tour-operator-closing_866_en.txt": {"title": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Just moments after departing Washington's Union Station, as the tour bus drove past the U.S. Capitol, Mel Bruce made an announcement to a handful of tourists.", "prompt": "\"Most sadly for us, we close the doors after 42 years of service. Today is the final run for Tourmobile,\" said Bruce, a tour guide for Tourmobile Sightseeing. The company announced that Monday would be its last day of operation. \n\nThe company claimed unique status among tour operators in the nation's capital by having the exclusive contract for sightseeing bus tours of Arlington National Cemetery. \n\nFor many Tourmobile employees, the end of the line means more than the end of a job. \n\n\"It was just a shock, we were just stunned by it,\" Bruce, 63, said after dropping off a group of tourists at Arlington.", "text": "For Bruce, giving brief history lessons to out-of-towners came easy, since growing up in the area gave him the chance to witness history firsthand. \n\n\"I was at the Lincoln Memorial with my family to hear firsthand Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his 'I Have a Dream' speech,\" Bruce said over the loudspeaker as the bus drove past the newly dedicated memorial to the civil rights leader. \n\nBruce became a tour guide for the company in the summer of 1972 -- when Tourmobile was in its third year of business-- but he left after four years to try his luck on Broadway. After a 33-year absence, he returned in 2006. \n\nMuch remains the same, he said. \"Everyone in the world is still eager to see the sights that they have only seen up to now in paintings, books and magazines. \"\n\nAccording to the company's website, Tourmobile, which started operations in 1969. employs 300 seasonal workers and serves \"upwards of 2 million riders annually.\" The tour buses take visitors to many of the capital's most famous sites, including the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument and the National Mall. \n\nWhat's next for the company is unclear. \"We are currently unable to provide any information regarding future tour services,\" a message on the company's website said. \n\nBruce blamed the company's demise on the sagging economy and more competition in the area offering similar services. \n\nStarting Tuesday, wlth Tourmobile no longer running, there will be no bus tours for visitors at Arlington National Cemetery until a new contract is awarded through bidding that will be overseen by the National Park Service. \n\nThe cemetery covers 624 acres and has 4 million visitors a year, many of whom may find walking the sprawling hallowed grounds too difficult. \n\nThe park service hopes to have a new tour bus company in place before the end of the year. \n\n\"This is a bittersweet time for the (National Park Service) and Tourmobile, as they have faithfully served the needs of millions of visitors for over 42 years,\" said Steve Whitesell, regional director of the park service's National Capital Region. \"Times change, and we are ready to enter a new era for visitors to access our national parks in greater Washington. \"\n\nTourist Gretchen Neu, from Racine, Wisconsin, was visiting Washington for the first time and could not imagine touring the cemetery on foot. \n\n\"Absolutely not. I mean, you have to have some mode of transportation other than your own car,\" Neu said, sitting on the Tourmobile bus as it left the cemetery. Families with loved ones buried at Arlington National Cemetery and those with disabilities will still be able to drive their own cars on the property. \n\nAnother thing that set Tourmobile apart from other tour operators was the type of buses it used -- more like trams that are common at theme parks. \n\nThe red, white and blue Tourmobile trams that many Washingtonians have become used to seeing came from Universal Studios in California. \"They are truly relics of a whole other era,\" Bruce said just before making his final trip of the day. \"It seemed that that operation worked so well in California that they wanted to try it out here, and that's how it was born. \"\n\nWhat was born over 40 years ago is coming to an end, but Bruce said he's not ready for retirement and wants to keep showing off the place where he grew up. \n\n\"I greet the world every day, and it's a privilege for me to show the world my hometown,\" he said."}, "2011-holder-fast-and-furious_774_en.txt": {"title": "Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that the controversial tactic that allowed illegal guns to be smuggled to Mexico \"should never have happened, and it must never happen again.\"", "prompt": "In testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Holder hit hard at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives practice that has tainted his tenure at the Justice Department and led to some Republican calls for him to resign. \n\n\"I want to be clear: Any instance of so-called 'gun walking' is unacceptable,\" Holder said of weapons smuggling, later adding: \"This operation was flawed in its concept, and flawed in its execution. \"\n\nHolder acknowledged what critics have been saying about the long-term consequences of \"gun walking.", "text": "\"\n\n\"Unfortunately we will feel its effects for years to come, as guns that were lost during this operation continue to show up at crime scenes both here and in Mexico,\" Holder said. \"We are losing the battle to stop the flow of illegal guns to Mexico. \"\n\nHolder defended his own actions, reminding the panel he called for the inspector general to examine the so-called Operation Fast and Furious and issued a directive that \"gun-alking\" was illegal and should never be repeated. The resulting report may be concluded before the end of the year. \n\nHowever, Holder stopped short of laying blame for the flawed operation. \n\nLast week, his assistant attorney general, Lanny Breuer, expressed \"regret\" for his failure to alert Holder about a similar earlier operation called \"Wide Receiver\" which had employed similar ATF \"gun-walking\" tactics during the Bush administration. \n\nAt the hearing Tuesday, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said, \"It doesn't matter how many laws we pass if those responsible for enforcing them refuse to do their duty -- as was the case in Fast and Furious.\"\n\nGrassley pressed Holder at the hearing about who had leaked a sensitive document to the press regarding a whistle-blower who had come forward with allegations of gun-walking. Grassley asked who was being held accountable. \n\nHolder refused to answer, but several hours later Grassley said Justice had provided him a document in a classified setting. \n\nGrassley revealed that former U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke, who resigned from his post, had leaked the document to the press. \n\nStill, the senator said, he is not satisfied. \"The Justice Department should not be allowed to continue to scapegoating the one person who has resigned,\" Grassley said, promising to pursue the matter further. \n\nDespite the disagreements, Holder pressed for congressional cooperation. He made a plea to the committee for strengthening the authority of the ATF to detect and disrupt illegal gun trafficking, and urged full funding for the ATF to combat gun-running. \n\nHe added: \"I am determined to ensure that our shared concerns about Operation Fast and Furious lead to more than headline-grabbing Washington 'gotcha' games and cynical political point scoring,\" Holder concluded. \n\nHolder has the support of Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the committee, who opened the hearing by reciting successes by the Justice Department under Holder's leadership. \n\nOn Monday, Leahy tried to lower the heat on Holder by raising it on the Bush administration for Operation Wide Receiver. In a letter to the Justice Department inspector general, the senator asked whether the current investigation also will cover the Bush-era supervision of the ATF in 2006 when, he said, \"hundreds of weapons apparently moved beyond the custody and control of the ATF and possibly into Mexico and Arizona. \"\n\nLeahy said that then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey may have been briefed in the case in 2007. \n\nHolder faces what is likely to be a much more hostile environment next month when he testifies before a House panel, where Republican Darrell Issa, R-California, will wield the gavel and control the questioning. \n\nCNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report."}, "2011-mexico-gadhafi-son_910_en.txt": {"title": "Mexico City (CNN) -- Saadi Gadhafi, a son of the deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, secretly tried to travel to Mexico using false documents, Mexico's interior minister said Wednesday.", "prompt": "Four people have been implicated in the alleged plot -- a Canadian, a Dane and two Mexicans, said the minister, Alejandro Poire. \n\nThe arrests of the alleged plotters, which occurred last month, were announced Wednesday. Officials called their efforts \"Operation House Guest. \"\n\n\"With these actions, the federal government contributes actively to a safe North America,\" said Alejandra Sota, a government spokeswoman. \n\nThe plan was to provide false documents claiming Mexican nationality for Saadi Gadhafi and his family, and to purchase a number of properties in Mexico for use as safe houses, Poire said.", "text": "One of the houses was in Bahia de Banderas, a tourist town in western Mexico's Nayarit state, he said. \n\nMexican intelligence detected the alleged plot on September 6, he said. \n\nIntelligence agents followed the trail and discovered that Cynthia Ann Vanier, a Canadian who was in direct contact with the Gadhafi family, was the leader of the ring, Poire said. \n\nVanier was arrested on November 10. \n\nThe next day, authorities arrested Gabriela Davila Huerta o Cueto, a Mexican living in the United States who Poire said was in charge of getting the false documents. \n\nPierre Christian Flemsborg, a Dane, was in charge of logistics, Poire said, and was arrested on November 11. \n\nAlso arrested was Mexican Jose Luis Kennedy Prieto, who helped obtain the phony documents, Poire said. \n\nThe suspects face charges that include falsifying documents and opening bank accounts under false identities. \n\nAccording to Poire, the Gadhafis would have entered the country under the following aliases: Daniel Bejar Hanan, Amira Sayed Nader, Moah Bejar Sayed and Sofia Bejar Sayed. \n\nSaadi Gadhafi remains in Niger, a landlocked West African nation bordering Libya, to which he fled this year as his father's regime was collapsing. \n\nHe had offered to negotiate an end to the war with the rebels in Libya after his father's troops lost control of Tripoli, but appeared later to change his mind. \n\nSaadi Gadhafi's lawyer, Nick Kaufman, said he spoke with his client Wednesday. \n\n\"There is absolutely no truth whatsoever to the allegation that, since fleeing Libya where his life was in grave danger, Saadi Gaddafi has attempted to flout the restrictive measures placed on him by the international community,\" Kaufman said. \n\nThe alleged plot, however, would have been hatched while Saadi Gadhafi was still in Libya, before he fled to Niger. \n\nWednesday's announcement appeared to have been spurred by an investigation into the plot by the Canadian newspaper National Post. \n\nThe newspaper spoke with the CEO of a Canadian security company who said he was involved in the alleged plan to move Saadi and his family to Mexico. Gary Peters, CEO of Can/Aust Security and Investigations International, told the paper that the plan was to be carried out with the approval of the Mexican government, which was to have supplied the documentation. \n\nMexico contradicted that version with its own allegations Wednesday. \n\nThe National Post article mentioned Varnier, whom it identified as a Canadian consultant who traveled to Libya in July on fact-finding mission with Peters. \n\nTwo of the men who helped secure the private jet used for the trip were among those arrested with Varnier, the paper reported. \n\nThe Canadian government confirmed the arrest of a Canadian in connection with the case and said Canadian consular officials in Mexico City and in Ottawa were providing assistance as required. \n\nNiger President Mahamadou Issoufou had reaffirmed his country's decision to grant asylum to Saadi Gadhafi, saying he should be allowed to stay and be treated like other Libyan refugees. Libya's National Transitional Council has blasted that stance. \n\nA businessman, Saadi Gadhafi ran the Libyan Football Federation before the unrest began. He played soccer for Perugia in Italy for one season. Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables posted on WikiLeaks say he had \"scuffles\" with police in Europe. \n\nMoammar Gadhafi was killed in Libya on October 20. \n\nAnother of Moammar Gadhafi's sons, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, was captured after a gun battle in the Libyan desert. Senior Libyan military officials said they believe the potential Gadhafi successor was also trying to make his way to Niger. \n\nSaif al-Islam had been on the run since shortly after rebels overran his father's Bab al-Aziziya compound in the capital in August. \n\nThe International Criminal Court in Netherlands wants Saif al-Islam for alleged crimes against humanity, including murder allegedly committed during the uprising. \n\nCNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report."}, "2011-river-rafting-sunset_1567_en.txt": {"title": "(Sunset) -- Whether you're into lazy-day floating or rip-roaring rapids, there's a river out there for you.

Even with limited visibility, we've seen a great blue heron, a kingfisher, Canada geese, an osprey, a quick glimpse of an otter and a bald eagle. The river is calm, and we don't have to paddle if we don't want to. Yet, somehow, a stretch and a bite to eat are in order.

Therefore, I am not bothered by the time we are consuming to bring about some sort of national consensus behind this government.\"\n\nJibril said negotiations include discussion of the number of ministries the new government will have and where they will be located.", "text": "Earlier Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated Libya's transitional leadership on the apparent success of that country's revolution, ushering in a post-Gadhafi era for the North African nation as part of the international body. \n\n\"For Libya, this is a historic day,\" said Ban, who directed that the country's new flag be presented alongside the U.N. flag amid a standing ovation from those in attendance. \n\nThe United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to accept the credentials of the country's new leadership after rebels last month all but ousted Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi after more than four decades in power. \n\n\"I am sure you saw your new flag this morning, flying so proudly outside this building,\" the U.N. chief said. \n\nThe rebuilding of Libya and the Palestinian quest for statehood are expected to be the dominant topics this week as world leaders converge on the United Nations in New York for the 66th annual session of the General Assembly. \n\nOn Tuesday, Ban met with Mustafa Abdul Jalil -- head of Libya's ruling National Transitional Council -- to discuss the deployment of a support mission to be run by British diplomat and U.N. envoy Ian Martin. \n\nThe mission is thought to largely center on post-conflict planning, with particular focus on security-building and electoral assistance. \n\nBut American participation, the U.N. chief says, is instrumental in supporting the new government, noting challenges facing transitional leadership as it confronts pockets of resistance and the specter of Gadhafi, who remains at large. \n\nU.S. President Barack Obama vowed to continue to protect Libyan civilians for as long as they remained threatened by the former regime, pledging to reopen the American embassy in Tripoli later this week. \n\n\"Six months ago, as his tanks approached Benghazi, Gadhafi predicted that his opponents would be slaughtered like rats,\" said U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague. \"But he had not counted on the courage of the Libyan people, the principled stand of the Arab League and the resolve of the international community. \"\n\nHague said he sought to send to a clear message to the former dictator and his remaining supporters that \"their time is up,\" adding that the unfreezing of Libyan assets will help pay for the country's critical services. \n\nTuesday's Libya summit at the U.N. General Assembly was billed as an event designed to give world leaders a chance to figure out ways to help Libya rebuild from the battle against their former leader. \n\nThe meeting was in stark contrast to two years ago, when Gadhafi gave a rambling General Assembly address where he floated conspiracy theories, urged probes into U.S. military activities and took aim at the structure of the Security Council itself. \n\nMeanwhile, the international body also focused on what it described as an alarming increase in global desertification, and wrapped a two-day meeting on noncommunicable diseases, now the world's leading killer. \n\nIt is only the second time a health issue has been debated at a special meeting of the General Assembly, following the group's pledge to take on AIDS a decade ago. \n\nDelegates unanimously approved a \"political declaration\" on Monday, addressing illnesses including cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung diseases and diabetes in developing countries, which often struggle with limited budgets and overwhelmed health care systems. \n\nAlso on the plate of U.N. activities this week is an expected address from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who will take the podium Thursday to address recent changes in the Middle East. \n\nHis visit marks the seventh time the Iranian president has traveled to New York since he took office in 2005. \n\nAhmadinejad told Iranian state media on Monday that the U.N. must meet the international community's \"real demands,\" raising questions as to whether the Iranian leader will broach the issue of Palestinian statehood, a lightning-rod topic and the subject of much diplomatic wrangling. \n\nThe U.S. has pledged to block a Palestinian membership application should it reach the Security Council, but is likely eager to head-off a scenario that would involve an American veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular in the Middle East. \n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has, however, seemed largely undeterred. \n\nIn a speech Friday that appeared both an attempt to manage domestic expectations and push the statehood issue, the Palestinian leader told an audience in Ramallah, \"We are going to the United Nations to attain full membership. \"\n\nHe has said the Palestinian territories should be represented by their \"natural borders\" -- with Israel remaining within its 1967 boundaries, which would afford Palestinians the Gaza strip, East Jerusalem and the West Bank. \n\nHe called disputed territories inhabited by Israeli settlers \"illegal. \"\n\nOn Friday, the body will address the controversial bid. \n\nAbbas is scheduled to speak, and has said after he gives that speech, he will deliver a formal membership application to the U.N. secretary-general. \n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes the measure, is scheduled to speak later in the day and has called the move provocative and pushed for a return to the negotiating table. \n\nThe Palestinian territories currently have \"observer\" status, meaning delegates can speak in the General Assembly but not vote. \n\nA \"yes\" vote in the General Assembly -- where only a majority vote would be needed -- could afford Palestinians with the status of \"permanent observer,\" similar to the position the Vatican currently holds. \n\nA vote in their favor would be all but assured, meaning they could pursue legal actions against Israel, though analysts suggest that the elevated status could prematurely raise expectations for change in the region. \n\nHamas, the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza, has warned Abbas against making the request, saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with Israel, which would \"deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland. \"\n\nThe five permanent members of the Security Council are the United States, China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom. \n\nThe General Assembly, the U.N.'s

graveyard shift, port spokesman Isaac Kos-Read told CNN. \n\n\"What has this accomplished?\" he asked. \"This is disrupting the 99%.\" The Occupy movement has rallied against what it describes as corporate greed while asserting that the nation's wealthiest 1% hold inordinate sway over the remaining 99% of the population. \n\nOakland Mayor Jean Quan concurred with Kos-Read, saying the Occupy movement isn't thinking of the consequences of its actions and whom it is actually hurting. \n\n\"They are saying ... they have to get the attention of the ruling class. I think the ruling class is probably laughing and people in this city will be crying this Christmas,\" Quan said. \"It's really got to stop. \"\n\nOakland has been a flash point of the Occupy movement since October when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown. One demonstrator, a Marine veteran of the war in Iraq, suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile, according to a veteran's group; police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers. \n\nThe International Longshore and Warehouse Union -- which represents 15,000 dockworkers -- has distanced itself from the protest movement. The union \"shares the Occupy movement's concerns about the future of the middle class and corporate abuses,\" ILWU President Robert McEllrath wrote to locals last week -- but he urged the movement to stay out of its dispute with the port of Longview, Washington, and warned against \"outside groups attempting to co-opt our struggle in order to advance a broader agenda. \"\n\nIn Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, three people claiming ties with the Occupy movement blocked the main door of House Speaker John Boehner office. The men, who said they were in the 120th hour of a hunger strike, sat together with stickers that read \"Taxation without representation\" taped over their mouths. \n\nThey said they were demanding full voting rights for residents in the District of Columbia. \n\nElsewhere, police moved into the Occupy Baltimore encampment at around 3 a.m. Tuesday to remove protesters that had been in McKeldin Square for the last two months, according to CNN affiliate WMAR. Local reports said officers were out in full riot gear, and police cars surrounded the area, but there were no major incidents reported. \n\nReports showed the city of Baltimore recently denied a permit extension for the camp and cut off its power supply, and that several incidents -- including a stabbing -- had occurred at the encampment recently. \n\nIn a statement released Tuesday morning, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said people are free to assemble and demonstrate, but \"our public parks and green-spaces should not be treated as permanent campgrounds.\" Rawlings-Blake said her administration will provide \"outreach and assistance\" to the homeless. \n\nTuesday's actions followed Occupy protests -- and police reactions -- in several cities on Monday. \n\nIn Houston, police arrested 20 protesters after dozens of police on foot and on horseback confronted a somewhat larger group of Occupy protesters who blocked an interstate on-ramp, authorities said. \n\nIn Long Beach, California, protests caused isolated traffic delays but did not hinder port operations, according to Police Chief Jim McDonnrell, who added that two arrests were made. \n\nAbout 80 protesters demonstrated outside the gate of San Diego's port Monday but caused no disruption, port spokesman Ron Powell said. Four people who sat down in the road were arrested, he said. \n\nThe demonstrations that began Monday in port cities were part of a nationwide Occupy effort in the aftermath of efforts by cities across the country -- including New York, Boston and Oakland -- to clear demonstrators from encampments they had set up in public parks and other locations. \n\n\"We are occupying the ports as part of a day of action, boycott and march for full legalization and good jobs for all to draw attention to and protest the criminal system of concentrated wealth that depends on local and global exploitation of working people, and the denial of workers' rights to organize for decent pay, working conditions and benefits, in disregard for the environment and the health and safety of surrounding communities,\" Occupy organizers said on their website. \n\nCNN's Greg Morrison, Amanda Watts, Shawn Nottingham , Sara Weisfeldt and Melanie Whitley contributed to this report."}, "2012-autism_832_en.txt": {"title": "The number of children with autism in the United States continues to rise, according to a new report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

What's the sticking point? \n\nA. Among the major issues, the teachers are negotiating over the length of the school day, objecting to their evaluations being tied to performance and fretting about potential job losses. \n\nQ.

Why are teachers objecting to evaluations tied to performance? \n\nA. The union says student performance is directly linked to conditions in the home or neighborhood, making it unfair for teachers to be punished if students don't do well in the the classroom for those reasons. \n\nQ. How many jobs will be lost under the evaluation plan? \n\nA. As many as 6,000 teachers could lose their jobs under the evaluation system, according to CTU President Karen Lewis, who has called the system \"unacceptable.\"  The mayor's office, the city and school officials have questioned that job-loss figure. \n\nQ. How many school closings are being talked about? \n\nA. The teachers union says 200 schools will be closed, but Marielle Sainvilus, a spokeswoman for Chicago Public Schools, calls the claim \"false,\" asserting that union leaders said recently that 100 schools would close.  \"I'm sure it'll be another number tomorrow,\" she said. \n\nQ. What is the status of the strike? \n\nA. The Chicago Teachers Union will make no decision Monday.  They are taking the day off for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. \n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is vowing to go to court to force teachers back to work, calling Sunday's actions by the union \"a delay of choice that is wrong for our children.\"  He announced in a statement that he's asked city lawyers to file an injunction in circuit court to \"immediately end this strike. \"\n\nMy view: From the picket lines\n\nQ. What's next? \n\nA. The House of Delegates, a group of 800 union representatives, will reconvene Tuesday afternoon, at which point delegates could decide to end the strike. If they do, classes would resume no earlier than Wednesday.  The rank-and-file of the Chicago Teachers Union would still have the opportunity at some point to accept, or reject, the proposed contract. \n\nBut as of Sunday, Lewis said a \"clear majority\" of union delegates did not want to suspend the strike given the proposed contract, saying \"they are not happy with the agreement. \"\n\nQ. How many teachers are in the union and how much do Chicago teachers make? \n\nA. The Chicago Teachers Union represents 26,000 teachers.  Chicago has the nation's third-largest school system with some 35,000 students, and its teachers are among the highest paid in the country. The median base salary for teachers in the Chicago public schools in 2011 was $67,974, according to the system's annual financial report. \n\nQ. What sort of raise are they being offered? \n\nA. The pay structure would change with a 3% pay hike for the first year of the contract, 2% for the second year and 2% for the third year. If a trigger extends the contract to four years, teachers would get a 3% pay increase. Union members would no longer be compensated for unused personal days, health insurance contribution rates will be frozen and the \"enhanced pension program\" is being eliminated. \n\nQ. How is the public reacting to the strike? \n\nA. The reaction is predictably mixed in the pro-union town. Parents have had to juggle work schedules and lay out money for child care, but many remain supportive of the union's action. \n\nQ. What do the presidential candidates have to say? \n\nA.

A Washington Post/Pew Research Center survey released Tuesday put the margin at 53%-27% in citing Republicans or Obama. A CNN/ORC International poll released last week showed 45% would blame congressional Republicans compared to 34% who would hold Obama responsible. \n\nEconomists warn that the fiscal cliff's automatic tax hikes and spending cuts would invite recession. \n\nRepublican Sen.

Obama and Boehner spoke on the phone Wednesday afternoon, for the first time in a week, according to a source familiar with the call. But the source said the conversation didn't lead to any breakthrough. And moving forward, no formal negotiating sessions are known to be scheduled, and congressional aides say no back-channel discussions are taking place. \n\nThe House is scheduled to adjourn for the year on December 14, but Boehner's number two, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, said Wednesday the chamber would remain in session until a fiscal cliff deal gets reached. \n\nRead more: Americans make big choices over fiscal cliff\n\nAnd Boehner said, \"I'll be here and I'll be available at any moment to sit down with the president to get serious about solving this problem. \"\n\nObama demands that the House immediately pass a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year while allowing rates to return to higher Clinton-era levels for wealthier households. \n\nDemocrats, including the president, argue that both sides agree that the 98% of Americans making less than $250,000 a year should avoid a tax hike when the tax cuts from the Bush administration expire on December 31. They call for the House to guarantee that outcome by passing the Senate measure now. \n\nOnce that happens, Obama and Democratic leaders promise, they will work out compromises on other spending cuts sought by Republicans to reduce the deficit, such as reforms to the Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs. \n\nThe latest proposal from House Republicans could reduce the nation's chronic federal deficits by $2.2 trillion over 10 years. \n\nThe GOP proposal includes $800 billion from tax reform, $600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings and $600 billion in other spending cuts, House Republican leadership aides said. It also pledges $200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index, a measure of inflation. \n\nWhile the Republicans gave ground by calling for more revenue through tax reform, the plan only mentioned unspecified elimination of some deductions and loopholes. \n\nJason Furman, an assistant to Obama on economic policy, told reporters Wednesday that the president wants to ensure additional revenue from higher taxes on the wealthy now to help avoid the fiscal cliff. He described the Republican proposal for more revenue as lacking specifics. \n\n\"Tell us what it is. Show us a score,\" Furman said. \"Tell us how it locks in revenue because you're trying to actually pass a bill this year, not engage in some long process around tax reform, which we don't have time to do by the end of this year. \"\n\nOpinion: Millionaires' tax bracket would be a smart compromise\n\nWhile some Republican senators have blasted the House proposal, others have signaled a willingness to use it as a starting point. \n\nSen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, a senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said he would support Boehner's plan to raise revenue, but only if there is a \"willingness on the part of Democrats to accept spending cuts that are three-to-one or four-to-one.\" \n\nWhile the White House has made clear Obama will veto any measure that fails to increase tax rates on the wealthy, aides have signaled a possible willingness to negotiate the specific rate increase. \n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg TV, Obama said lower tax rates for the wealthy could be negotiated as part of broader tax reform in 2013, but only after those rates increase now. \n\nObama's deficit-reduction plan would increase taxes by almost $1 trillion over 10 years, a significant portion of a $4 trillion overall deficit-reduction goal. \n\nIt also would close loopholes, limit deductions, raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends. \n\nThe Obama plan includes $50 billion in stimulus spending for programs intended to create jobs, such as repairing roads and bridges. \n\nExperts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil. \n\nThe non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes without action. \n\nRead more: Same players, same disputes in fiscal cliff debate\n\nCNN's Ted Barrett, Kate Bolduan, Deirdre Walsh, Paul Steinhauser, Jessica Yellin, Mark Morgenstein and Greg Botelho contributed to this report."}, "2012-football_707_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- A group of soccer stars have called for Israel to be stripped of hosting rights for a top European age-grade tournament next year following last month's bomb attacks on Gaza.", "prompt": "52 players, including Eden Hazard, Papiss Cisse and Demba Ba signed a petition which was posted on the website of former English Premier League and Spanish La Liga striker Fredi Kanoute. \n\n\"We, as European football players, express our solidarity with the people of Gaza who are living under siege and denied basic human dignity and freedom,\" the statement said. \n\n\"The latest Israeli bombardment of Gaza, resulting in the death of over a hundred civilians, was yet another stain on the world's conscience. \"\n\nAmerican soccer star playing for Palestine\n\nIt cited reports of a bomb attack by Israeli forces on a football stadium in Gaza on November 10, which killed four teenage players, and said that two players from the club Al Amari had been detained in Israel \"without charge or trial\" since February.", "text": "\"It is unacceptable that children are killed while they play football.

They have traveled five days by foot to a Himalayan meadow at a 4,300 meter elevation deep inside Nepal's Dolpa district.

It's this tiny protuberance that the harvesters spend weeks each spring searching for. \n\nA hundred or so people crawl across the field in a mulled silence until a sole searcher lets out an excited cry.", "text": "Dozens rush over to witness, Jafra is the first to arrive. \n\nThe woman who has discovered the specimen uses an ice pick to prod the earth and dig a hole about six inches in diameter. She then lifts a clump of earth up and sifts out the specimen. The crowd gossips about its value -- \"it's small, only 300 rupees!\" (about $3). A middle man will offer her that amount, then walk it to a market in Tibet and sell it for three times the price. \n\nJafra explains: \"We pay attention when other people find them. This is our first time coming for the harvest. We've been here for nearly a week. We haven't found anything, because we don't know what they look like -- we don't know what we're looking for. \"\n\nSee also: Himalayan glaciers 'buck melting trend'\n\nLike many others, Ram and his brothers traveled for the harvest betting on hope alone. \"People in our village talked about the money to be earned, so we came,\" he says. \n\nThe rumors of riches are not baseless. According to experts, the market value of yartsa gunbu has increased by 900% between 1997 and 2008. \n\nOne study says 500 grams of top quality yartsa gunbu can sell for up to $13,000 in Lhasa, Tibet, or up to $26,000 in Shanghai. Average annual income in Nepal's rural mid-and-far-western hills, where many harvesters live, is just $283, according to the government. \n\nPolice in Dolpa expect 40,000 people to migrate to the district this year. The influx of migrant harvesters speaks volumes to the increasing global commodification of yartsa gunbu. Prized in traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicinal practices for its power as an elixir or an aphrodisiac, in recent years commercial dubbing of the product as \"Himalayan Viagra\" has driven up both demand and market value around the world. \n\nBut the unprecedented flood of harvesters has observers concerned about the environmental impacts of this informal economic boom. \n\n\"Look at the hills,\" says Gyalpo Thandin, a student in Dolpa, \"they're all torn up from people digging. By next year they'll be deserts. \"\n\nThandin, who was visiting home for the harvest, remembers when the yartsa gunbu season meant local bounty, not commercial competition. \"Just five years ago the numbers were lower,\" he says. \"Every year we see more people come and more grasslands get damaged. People who come hack at the land with tools and leave it to dry out. \"\n\nHe says his family's yaks have died in recent winters due to depleted grass caused by the harvest. \n\nSee also: Bringing Nepal's ghost town back to life\n\nEnvironmental protection measures offer some hope. Six years ago, a committee of community leaders in Dolpa instituted a taxation system on harvesters in an effort to control numbers and ensure the local community remained resilient amidst environmental changes. \n\nThe committee charges locals 1,000 rupees ($11) and outsiders 3,000 rupees ($33) to join the harvest. The system is intended to spend the money on environmental protection measures and to subsidize food for villages in the district. \n\nSimilar systems exist in harvest areas across the Himalayas. However, some worry the measure is ineffective. \n\nA former committee member who spoke on the condition of anonymity suggests that charging admission to the harvest has only made it seem even more valuable, and as a result, drawn more harvesters. \"The goal of the system was to charge people and therefore limit the number who would want to come for the harvest, but putting a price on the entry might actually be encouraging more people,\" he says. \n\nA leading expert on Himalayan caterpillar fungus, ecologist and geographer Daniel Winkler, believes the future of the harvests is contingent on many factors -- collection intensity, rainfall, and climate change among them. \n\n\"Centuries of collection indicate that caterpillar fungus is a relatively resilient resource,\" he says. \n\nBut his research suggests that over-harvesting is contributing to fewer fungal spores being around for the next season. Winkler believes education is the key element to promoting sustainable resource conservation. \n\n\"Knowledge of fungal reproduction ... and (establishing) an end-date to the collection season might allow for sufficient spore dispersal to guarantee sustainability,\" he adds. \n\nAs communities in Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries, cope with the economic need and the increasing desire for high-value commodities like yartsa gunbu, conservation efforts will require cooperation between leaders at village, district, and national levels. There is no question this Himalayan \"gold rush\" buoys rural economies.

Though that's not surprising when you consider Crais began his career writing for television series like \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"Cagney & Lacey\" and \"Miami Vice.\"\n\nCNN recently spoke to the author about his new book, his loyal fans and why he's refused to bring Elvis and Joe to the big screen.", "text": "The following is an edited transcript. \n\nCNN: How has writing about Elvis Cole and Joe Pike changed over the course of the series?\n\nCrais: I really strive to bring something new to each book. I don't want to write the same book over and over again. I've done Elvis books; I've done Joe books; I've done mixed books, but this time, I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50-50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles. When I discovered this particular story, it just seemed a perfect way to do that. Part of the book, they're working together. Then there's Elvis' track through the story, and there's Joe track, where he's trying to find Elvis and save him. So it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage. \n\nCNN: In \"Taken,\" the story jumps between several points of view and moves back and forth in time. How difficult was it to put together? \n\nCrais: It was like a crazy puzzle that kept changing. You should have seen my office. I have these huge black foam boards on the wall, and tacked to them, I have these white punch cards with my story ideas, scenes and notes. I kept juggling these cards and amending them, making little scrawls on them. Notions came to me, things changed, and I literally shuffled them around like a deck of cards, trying to bring them all into focus so the events were as exciting as I could make them. \n\nCNN: How do you start a novel? What comes first, an idea, an image, a scene? \n\nCrais: It could be any of the above, but it's usually an image, almost always driven by a character moment. In \"Taken,\" it was the notion of Krista Morales and her hunger to know more about her mother's experience that night in the desert. I just saw her. It was literally my first image in the book. I saw her staring out into the black desert sky with this open-eyed wonder, trying to see the path her mother took to get to this country. All I had was her face in the moonlight, staring out there, and I just knew whatever she's looking for, I want to find. That was the engine that really kicked off the rest of the book. \n\nCNN: \"Taken\" revolves around a kidnapping on the U.S.-Mexico border by bajadores. What prompted you to write about these bandits? \n\nCrais: I had heard about these atrocious mass graves uncovered in Mexico south of the border: 52 people in one grave, 87 people in another, 164 bodies at a ranch with multiple burial sites. If you watch the news at all, you know Mexico is pretty much defining itself now as a war between the government and the various drug cartels. South of the border is fairly well-patrolled by armed groups of thugs who work for the cartels, and those guys end up preying on civilians, policemen and government officials, but they also prey on each other. \n\nI found out most of the people who were found in those mass graves were immigrants who were headed North from as far away as Central America. They were trying to get to the U.S., and somewhere along the way, cartel bandits or \"bajadores\" would kidnap them, rob them, force them to call their families or employers or whoever and try to extort additional money out of them. When there was no more money to be had, they would just be murdered and buried in mass graves. The business was literally stealing people. The nature of this victim was very moving to me. \n\nWhen you consider that the victim is basically an innocent, penniless person who's just trying to find a way to make his or her life better was super appealing to me, and it seemed like the type of people that Elvis and Joe would sympathize with and risk their lives to try and save. \n\nCNN: While there's lots of action in your books, it seems like the friendship between Elvis and Joe is what keeps readers coming back. \n\nCrais: Sure. The books are about Elvis and Joe. The books are about their friendship and who they are as men and human beings. I think that's why the readership has grown the way it has and why readers keep coming back to them. There's a value to their friendship that I think people admire and envy and want in their own lives. I know I do, so I kind of attribute it to other people, too. I would love to have either Elvis or Joe, preferably both, as my friends. They're certainly interesting guys, and we can live vicariously through them for their adventures, but there's something beautiful about these two guys and about having someone so trustworthy and dependable in your life. It's very comforting, I think. \n\nCNN: Has the success of the series surpassed your expectations? \n\nCrais: I'm certainly thrilled by the reaction. Honestly, I never would have thought the characters would have become as popular as they have. In the beginning, my dream was simply to make a living at it. I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to earn a living, but it never occurred to me that the books would become bestsellers. I mean, I'm glad, but none of this was by design. I wrote these guys because they're guys I wanted to spend time with. \n\nWriting a book is a long and difficult process for me. I'm a slow writer, so I spend the year with Elvis Cole and Joe Pike in my head. I was thinking about this the other day. I wrote the first book in 1987. Literally every day since that time, Elvis and Joe have been in my head. They're always there. I started these guys because I like them. I still like spending time with them, and I think that's probably the reason the readers have embraced Elvis and Joe the way they have. Whenever there's a new book, they want to refresh that friendship. \n\nCNN: Despite many lucrative offers, you've never sold the screen rights to Elvis and Joe. Why is that? \n\nCrais: It's pretty simple. You know the old saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it? I'm concerned that if there's a film of Elvis and Joe, that somehow it will interfere with the collaboration I have with my readers. I'm the first to admit this is probably a knuckleheaded fear on my part, but I have it nevertheless. Books are a collaborative art. Elvis and Joe don't exist until someone picks up one of the books and reads it. In the act of reading, you and I collaborate, and Elvis and Joe come to life inside your head. \n\nWhat I've learned over time is that the Elvis and Joe you see and hear in your head, they are only yours. There might be however many hundreds of thousands of other people who've read \"Taken,\" and each and every one of them is going to have a unique Elvis and Joe. It's going to be a little bit different from everybody else's because we all bring our own stuff to this. I find that wonderful. \n\nTo me, that is the great thing about books, and I guess part of me is a little scared that if I let Hollywood get involved, and even if there's a really good movie made, that somehow once you've seen the film, when you come back to the new book next year, that collaboration that you and I have is going to be a little bit different. Because then, the movie is going to have inserted itself. So I'm really jealous and guarded about that. I want your Elvis and Joe to be a product of yours and mine and nothing else. \n\nRead an excerpt from \"Taken\" and find out more about Robert Crais on his website."}, "2012-meast_1414_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- As the death toll from Syria's almost year-long uprising continues to climb, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem vowed to defend his country's \"independence.\"", "prompt": "\"We are not happy to see brothers killing each other.

At least 144 people were reported killed Monday, including 64 who died in a \"horrifying massacre\" at a checkpoint in Homs province. \n\nThose killed at a checkpoint in the Abel area were attempting to flee shelling in the Baba Amr neighborhood in the city of Homs, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. \n\n\"Reports said security members and thugs kidnapped the women among them,\" the network said in a statement. Residents found 47 corpses in one area and 17 in a second one, it said. \n\nA total of 68 corpses were found in the area, in farmland in western Homs province, said the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, apparently referencing the same incident. The bodies were found after an injured survivor reported the attack, the group said. All the bodies had been either shot or stabbed. \n\nIn all, 104 people were killed Monday in Homs, an opposition stronghold, according to the LCC. They included four defected soldiers, three woman and three children. \n\nThe deaths came on a day when Syrian officials announced that the nation's new draft constitution received approval and the European Union imposed new sanctions on the country amid ongoing clashes. \n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said earlier explosions rocked Homs and shelling was occurring in Baba Amr. Twenty people were wounded when a large shell struck an anti-government gathering in Homs, the group said. \n\nMeanwhile, Interior Minister Mohammed al-Shaar announced that 89.4% of voters approved the draft constitution, and 57.4% of eligible voters cast ballots. President Bashar al-Assad's regime has touted the constitutional referendum as a move toward reform. \n\nSyria announced the referendum amid intense international cries to stop the bloodshed and open its regime to change. But analysts and protesters widely describe the effort as a farce, a superficial attempt to pacify al-Assad's critics. \n\n\"We dismiss it as absolutely cynical. ... Essentially, what he's done here is put a piece of paper that he controls to a vote that he controls so that he can try and maintain control,\" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said of the referendum and al-Assad. \n\nShe cited the ongoing violence in such cities as Homs and Hama and asked: \"How could you possibly have any kind of a democratic process in conditions like that? \"\n\nAid efforts were under way in the midst of the violence. \n\nThe Syrian Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross entered the province of Hama on Monday to provide aid to civilians, said Simon Schorno, spokesman for the Red Cross. A one-month supply of food, along with blankets and hygiene kits, were distributed to 12,000 people, he said. \n\nBeatrice Megevand-Roggo, the Red Cross' head of operations for the Middle East, said a handful of aid workers were also able to go into Baba Amr. \n\n\"There were four ambulances that entered Baba Amr, belonging to the Syrian Red Crescent. They were loaded with medical goods. They indeed were not able to evacuate the two foreign journalists. I don't have the reasons why. They could evacuate an elderly woman, a pregnant woman with her husband,\" she said. \n\nThe two journalists Megevand-Roggo was referencing were British photographer Paul Conroy and French reporter Edith Bouvier. Both were wounded in shelling. \n\nRed Cross spokesman Hicham Hassan said aid workers were also not able Monday to recover and evacuate the bodies of two journalists killed in Baba Amr last week. \n\nMarie Colvin, an American journalist who worked for London's Sunday Times, was killed in a shelling attack, along with French journalist Remi Ochlik. Colvin's mother, Rosemarie, said Sunday that aid workers have been trying for days to remove her daughter's body. \n\nCNN and other media outlets cannot independently verify opposition or government reports because Syria has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists. But the vast majority of reports from the ground indicate that government forces are massacring citizens in an attempt to wipe out civilians seeking al-Assad's ouster. \n\nNo attempts at getting al-Assad to stop his regime's crackdown on dissidents have stopped the onslaught. \n\nThe Council of the European Union agreed Monday on new sanctions regarding Syria after foreign ministers met in Brussels, Belgium, said spokeswoman Susanne Kiefer. \n\nSeven ministers of the al-Assad regime will have their EU assets frozen and will be denied entry into the EU, Kiefer said. In addition, assets of the Syrian Central Bank in the EU will be frozen. Legitimate trade will be allowed to continue, she said, but must be authorized first. \n\n\"Today's decisions will put further pressure on those who are responsible for the ruthless campaign of repression in Syria,\" Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, said in a statement. \"The measures target the regime and its ability to conduct the appalling violence against civilians. As long as the repression continues, the EU will keep imposing sanctions. \"\n\nElsewhere in Syria on Monday, two people were killed and eight wounded by government shelling on the village of Sarmeen in Idlib province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. \n\nThe shelling began Sunday night, and Syrian troops have entered Sarmeen, said Abu Mustafa al-Sayed, a Syrian opposition and community leader in the town of Binnish, also in Idlib province. The Syrian army has Sarmeen surrounded, and communications with the residents have been cut off, he said. \n\nAnd in Damascus, security forces fired on mourners at a funeral, according to the Local Coordination Committees. Clashes were also occurring in Deir Ezzor, the group said, and 14 students were arrested during a protest at Aleppo University. \n\nThe opposition network estimates that 9,000 people have been killed since the government launched its crackdown in March. The Syrian government says that more than 2,000 members of its security forces have been killed by \"terrorists\" during that same period. \n\nAsked Monday whether Syria would be referred to the International Criminal Court, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said, \"I hope the international community reflects on the conditions of referral. ... It's a difficult issue. Syria is not a participating state, so it's up to the Security Council to address this question. They must therefore continue to gather the elements that would permit an eventual referral. \"\n\nCNN's Jo Shelley, Per Nyberg, Salma Abdelaziz, Jack Maddox, Hamdi Alkshali and Kareem Khadder and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report."}, "2012-nebraska-hate-crime_1044_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- A Nebraska \"hate crime\" that targeted an openly gay woman and that triggered responses from candlelight vigils locally to Facebook postings of support nationwide was staged by the alleged victim, authorities said Tuesday as they charged the woman with lying to police.", "prompt": "Charlie Rogers -- a former basketball player for the University of Nebraska who identifies herself as lesbian -- told police that three masked men entered her home on July 22, stripped her, tied her down, and carved homophobic slurs into her body before attempting to set her and the house on fire. \n\nBut the Lincoln Police Department said Tuesday that \"the physical evidence conflicted with Charlie Rogers' version of events\" and that \"extensive investigation revealed numerous inconsistencies. \"\n\nPreviously on CNN.com: Woman speaks out after alleged hate crime\n\nRogers was arrested Tuesday, police said.", "text": "Her attorney, Brett McArthur, told CNN Tuesday night that Rogers had agreed as part of an arrangement to turn herself in, in exchange for a personal recognizance bond. \n\n\"She did not have to post any money\" to be released, McArthur said, adding that his client pleaded not guilty to the charge of lying to police. \n\n\"She maintains her innocence.

But more than three decades after Etan vanished, authorities say Hernandez confessed to the boy's killing after being brought in for questioning last week. \n\nHernandez has since been charged with second degree murder and is currently awaiting trial. But attorney Harvey Fishbein said his client -- who is currently on suicide watch at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan -- has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation. \n\nAccording to police, the former stock clerk claims he lured Etan to the store's basement with the promise of a soda before choking him to death. He then allegedly disposed of the body using a plastic bag, placing the boy inside a trash bin located a block and a half away from his work. \n\n\"The detectives thought (that confession) was a feeling of relief on his part,\" said Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who described Hernandez as remorseful. \n\nProsecutors are now confronted with the task of corroborating that confession and piecing together a murder mystery that for decades has been littered with false positives. \n\nThe image of Hernandez, meanwhile, has gradually come into focus as attention homes in on the reclusive suspect who, according to his attorney, apparently suffers from a \"long psychiatric history\" that includes schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hallucinations. \n\nThe Hernandez family -- a large clan consisting of 11 brothers and sisters -- moved from Puerto Rico to southern New Jersey in the early 1970s, a relative told CNN. \n\nPedro Hernandez attended high school in the Camden, New Jersey, area before moving to Manhattan at the age of 18, sharing an apartment in the city's SoHo neighborhood with his older sister. \n\nSometime after his 19th birthday, Hernandez took a job as a stock clerk at a corner convenience store. He worked in the Lower Manhattan bodega for roughly a month before returning to his mother's south Jersey home in the summer of 1979, according to family members and police. \n\nEtan disappeared roughly a month earlier on May 25. \n\nDescribing Hernandez as having been a quiet young man, relatives say his demeanor changed upon his return to New Jersey. He grew further withdrawn while also frequently becoming ill, they said. \n\nThough his whereabouts after 1979 remain murky, family members say at one point he returned to New York. It's unclear for how long. \n\nPolice Commissioner Kelly told reporters last week that Hernandez was injured during a construction job sometime in the 1990s and has since been receiving disability compensation. But a relative claims that the suspect was instead injured during his employment at a clothing factory in Maple Shade, New Jersey. \n\nTwice married, Hernandez fathered a daughter and settled down with a woman named Rosemary, his second wife, who relatives say had always had a crush on him. \n\nBut financial troubles followed, and the couple filed for bankruptcy in 1999, according to court documents. \n\nStill, those who claim to know Hernandez offer mixed impressions of his character. \n\nRoberto Monticello, a former SoHo resident who says he knew Hernandez in New York at the time of Etan's disappearance, described him as a \"very strange guy. \"\n\n\"He was always by himself,\" Monticello recalled to CNN affiliate NY1. \"(I) never saw him with people. \"\n\nHis pastor, George Bowen, called him a \"very quiet, unassuming, almost shy man,\" who attended church regularly with his wife and daughter, often sitting in the same pew. \n\n\"Every Sunday morning I had a conversation with him,\" said Bowen, who described the interaction as \"more or less a greeting. \"\n\nBut the suspect's sister, Norma Hernandez, said their family had for years grappled with the knowledge of her brother's alleged crime. \n\nShe says she once walked into a Camden police station in the early 1980s to report the murder, telling authorities that her brother confessed to killing a boy in New York and throwing the body near a dumpster. \n\nBut, she says, there's no indication that anything ever came out of that report. \n\n\"You feel like they didn't believe you,\" Norma Hernandez told CNN. \"I was expecting something else. \"\n\n\"Police asked whether I was mad\" at her brother or had an ulterior motive, she said. \n\nPedro Hernandez allegedly confided in a church prayer group that included members of his family and his then-spiritual adviser, his sister said, telling them of the alleged killing. \n\nCamden police and Tomas Rivera, a leader of the prayer group, declined to comment. \n\nBut Lisa Cohen, whose 2009 book, \"After Etan,\" is widely considered the definitive account of the case, said she remains skeptical about the man's confession, widely considered the signature element of his prosecution. \n\n\"I had never heard of Pedro Hernandez before this week,\" she told CNN. \n\nA separate law enforcement source said Hernandez's claims were being treated with \"a healthy dose of skepticism. \"\n\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance ultimately gave the green light to file murder charges against Hernandez, despite the absence of forensic evidence, witness testimony and lingering questions over his mental state. \n\nCNN's Ross Levitt and Chris Boyette contributed to this report."}, "2012-olympics-london-2012-psychology_768_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- Mind over matter?

To improve you have to be very specific about what you are aiming to do and target it. \"\n\nIt is a view supported by Syed, who suggests that the willingness of top athletes to push themselves further and further in practice pays dividends when it comes to high-pressure competition. \n\n\"It's interesting, for example, that world-class ice dancers fall over more often in practice than intermediate ice dancers, which sounds paradoxical,\" he said. \n\n\"The reason is they are always pushing themselves, they are attempting jumps that are at the outer limits of their capabilities. It's a branch of science called 'epigenetics' -- the brain is re-wired as we practice. \"\n\nOnce athletes have meticulously honed their skills, they should, in theory, have all the tools at their disposal to achieve success. But in high-pressure situations, even the greatest can crumble. \n\nWhat causes a footballer to crack under the nail-biting strain of a penalty shootout? Or a tennis star to fall apart at match point? \n\n\"The problem when you're under pressure is you're so nervous you start thinking consciously about the shot you are playing,\" Syed says. \n\n\"You are intruding upon your subconscious competence, and that is what triggers the choking response. \"\n\nSo how can Olympians preparing for London 2012 ensure they are mentally ready to challenge for gold? Barton suggested that imagining the crowning moment is almost as important as physically training for it. \n\n\"The thing about when we mentally rehearse something vividly, it actually fires up the same neurology in the brain as if we were really experiencing it. So on a certain level the mind cannot differentiate between a vividly-imagined experience and reality. \n\n\"What we need to do is to create our own realities in our heads so you can imagine yourself in that Olympic final, for instance, performing how you want to perform. \n\n\"The more you actually do that, the more your body and mind get used to it, so when you come to the real thing, you're more prepared. \"\n\nSo the next time you find yourself daydreaming of sprinting to 100 meters gold, don't dismiss it -- it might just be vital preparation for your future Olympic success."}, "2012-online-class-warfare_946_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- While the Republican nominees beat their drums and stomp their feet and whoop \"class warfare,\" we're reminded of another kind of war on class: That is people's seeming inability to be decent and sophisticated online.", "prompt": "This isn't a new problem.

Both officers have pleaded not guilty. \n\nThis week, at the preliminary hearing to determine whether enough evidence supports proceeding with a trial, prosecutors aired a graphic video of the savage beating. The footage shows about a half dozen officers punching and kicking and putting pressure on Thomas' chest, firing electric shocks from a Taser stun gun, all to supposedly subdue a suspect well beyond the point where he is resisting or capable of resisting arrest. \n\nEarly on, Ramos appears to tell the young man who is sitting on the ground: \"You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up!\" Another police officer is heard saying: \"We ran out of options so I got to the end of my Taser and I ... smashed his face to hell. \"\n\nBy the end of the video, Thomas is lying in a pool of blood.

Virtually every socioeconomic study looking at the intersection of income and education shows a direct correlation between the two. For Santorum to vilify higher education for political gain -- while obviously benefiting from attending universities -- is embarrassing. Then saying that John F. Kennedy's famous 1960 speech standing up for the separation of church and state made him want to throw up? \u00a0\n\nWell, that makes me nauseous. \n\nSometimes it seems as if Santorum and the others are content with pushing each other closer and closer to the edge of idiocy because that's easier than pushing ideas to convince voters they're the best person for the job. \n\nIt's a tactic that might be fine for early cheers in February but will run out of steam the longer this process goes. Usually, a tough primary makes a candidate stronger for the general election, but between the exposure of character flaws and this dumbing-down of rhetoric, it\u00a0seems to be having the reverse effect on the GOP. \u00a0\n\n In November, a Pew poll showed then-front-runner Romney was leading Obama 53%-41% among independents. Now, Obama's up 51%-42%, and the president hasn't even started campaigning aggressively.

He fled to Chile and was arrested a few days later. \n\nIt was an apparent attempt to win a more lenient sentence, using a plea called an \"anticipated conclusion of the process\" under Peruvian law. Five days earlier, the three judges delayed the start of van der Sloot's trial after he declined to give a plea after expressing reservations about the \"aggravating factors\" tied to admitting his guilt. \n\nVan der Sloot's attorney, Jose Luis Jimenez, pressed earlier this week for a shorter sentence. \n\nJimenez claimed that his client was under special stress the day the 2010 murder occurred, which marked five years after Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway went missing in Aruba. \n\nVan der Sloot -- who, with two others, was among the last people seen with Holloway - was detained twice, but never charged, in the high-profile international case. \n\n\"He was pointed at and persecuted.

Candidates were given tacit endorsements at the Golden Globes and again at Sunday evening's Screen Actors Guild Awards.", "text": "After \"The Help\" took home a surprise win at the SAG Awards, the race for Best Picture has narrowed to that film and \"The Descendants\" and \"The Artist,\" both big winners at the Globes. \n\nFor the next few weeks, until the close of Academy voting on the Sunday before the Oscars, the studios and distributors behind those three pictures -- Disney, 20th Century Fox and The Weinstein Company, respectively -- will be aggressively wooing the Academy's 6,000 members into their camps. \n\nAs in a political campaign, you simply cannot win an Oscar without spending money. It doesn't matter who spends the most, but it does matter who spends it best. \n\nOne of the better campaigns of the past five years was the 2010 win for the little war flick that could: \"The Hurt Locker.\" Despite its critical acclaim and high-quality cinematography and script, it was the lowest-grossing best picture winner of all time, competing against the highest-grossing movie in recent history, \"Avatar.\" \n\nBesides quality, of course, what did it have going for it? One hell of an Oscar campaign. Its studio, Summit Entertainment, was flush with vampire money from the \"Twilight\" series. Oscar watchers, including studio executives, film journalists and fellow Oscar campaigners,\u00a0told me that Summit spent between $3 million and $5 million for the campaign, which consisted mainly of hiring consultants to spin \"Hurt Locker\" and \"Avatar\" in a battle of good versus evil within the press. \n\n\"Hurt Locker\" actually lost out to \"Avatar\" in the Globes race, and that might have been a well-timed boon for the small flick. It positioned it perfectly as the underdog going into the home stretch of the campaign. \n\nBesides the cachet of an Oscar win, the successful campaign typically pays for itself in dividends. In the nine months after \"The Hurt Locker's\" Oscar win, the film sold more than $31 million worth of DVDs in the United States, 214% of its U.S. box office gross of $14.7 million. \n\nThat's what makes Oscar campaigning more than a $100 million-a-year cottage industry within the movie industry. \n\nPersuading members of the Academy to first nominate your film and then vote for it is tremendously similar to how political operatives get candidates elected. \n\nThere is no single strategy for a successful Oscar campaign, but momentum is key. Peak too early and excitement peters out; peak too late and you've spent millions of dollars without enough time to get voters invested. \n\nBuilding momentum involves racking up accolades and awards from individual guilds and film festivals before the nomination voting in January. This year Weinstein is making sure \"The Artist\" gathers momentum at just the right time. It took home a Golden Globe and its lead actor, Jean Dujardin, brought home a Best Actor SAG. But it has yet to peak. \n\nHow is momentum built? And why does it cost millions? After all, word of mouth is free. But an intricate web of gypsy publicists, rogue party planners, and entire full-service consultancies to generate that all-important buzz that drives a campaign can run more than $2 million. \n\nSure, a DVD can be mailed for less than $2. But with elaborate packaging, express mailing and hand delivery, the cost can increase to $200 each. With 6,000 Academy members, that translates to more than $1 million to get the films in front of voters. \n\nOne of the stealthier tactics of good campaigners is the third-party Oscar party, where someone who is not in the Academy hosts an event celebrating a film starring one of their good friends. The expenses for these can easily run to $2 million, which is often somehow subsidized by the studio. \n\nLike a good show-pony politician, the cast of a film needs to be tirelessly glad-handing voters and going to every event to fluff their film. If a movie's main players aren't willing to commit to living and breathing and fighting for their film for the two months leading up to the Oscars, they can forget about taking home a statue. \n\nBills can run into the millions to fly the talent back and forth across the country and keep them upright and happy during the final stretch. Then there are screening costs and advertising costs. Full-page ads in trade magazines like Variety and The Hollywood Reporter can cost $25,000 each, with ad budgets ranging from $15,000 to $1 million. \n\nPolitical campaign tricks are obvious. Not so for Oscar campaigns. Selecting the leader of the free world may hold far greater stakes than what to put on your Netflix queue, but they both deserve a high level of transparency.

The agency had imposed hefty fines on broadcasters. \n\nIn many televised instances, \"one cannot tell what is indecent and what isn't\" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.", "text": "\"It's the appearance of arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in concrete situations,\" she added. \n\nBut with so many programming choices on broadcast, cable and satellite TV, \"All the government is asking for is a few (broadcast) channels where you can say -- they are not going to hear the s-word, the f-word. They are not going to see nudity,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said. \n\nThe court's ruling, which will come in a few months, could establish important First Amendment guidelines over explicit content on the airwaves. \n\nThe Justice Department had filed an appeal, and helpfully provided the justices with a DVD of a 2003 episode of the now-canceled \"NYPD Blue\" on ABC in which a naked woman was shown. The content of that program is central to the ongoing legal dispute. Lawyer Seth Waxman representing ABC said the FCC's tough action against the network was \"a shot out of the blue. \"\n\nA federal appeals court last year for a second time struck down the government policies, concluding they were vague and inconsistently applied. Pending fines against the broadcasters were dismissed. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are all parties in the case. \n\nControversial words and images have been aired in scripted and unscripted instances on all the major over-the-air networks in the past eight years, dating back to when the FCC began considering a stronger, no-tolerance policy. \n\nThe policy became known as the Golden Globes Rule, for singer Bono's 2003 acceptance speech at the live awards show on NBC, where he uttered the phrase \"really, really, f---ing brilliant. \"\n\nThe commission specifically cited celebrities Cher and Nicole Richie for potty-mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards, which aired live on Fox. Richie, in an apparent scripted moment said, \"Have you ever tried to get cow s--t out of a Prada purse? It's not so f---ing simple. \"\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer dryly noted the language from the two women \"seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary.\" That drew laughter in the courtroom. \n\nThe CBS complaint involved dirty language on \"The Early Show,\" a news and interview program. \n\nThe high court two years ago ruled in favor of the FCC on the issue of \"fleeting expletives,\" concluding federal regulators have the authority to clamp down on broadcast TV networks airing isolated cases of profanity. \n\nThe court, however, refused at the time to decide whether the commission's policy violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech, ruling only on the agency's enforcement power. The justices ordered the free-speech aspect to be reviewed again by a New York-based federal appeals court, which subsequently ruled in favor of the broadcasters. \n\nThe Justice Department, in its new appeal, lumped both the expletives and nudity cases together, saying the court should decide the free speech questions as one. \n\nExplicit language is heard with greater, albeit varying, frequency on cable television, the Internet, and satellite radio, which do not use public airwaves. But the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints of \"indecent\" language and images on broadcast television and radio, which is subject to greater regulation. \n\nThat is especially relevant during daytime and early evening hours, when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching. \n\nThe commission formally reversed its policy in March 2004 to declare even a single use of an expletive could be illegal. In addition, a voluntary rating system is used by all television networks to warn viewers when material that might be offensive will be aired. \n\nMuch of the oral argument Tuesday centered around the ABC television stations fined $27,500 each for airing the \"NYPD Blue\" episode featuring a woman with her breasts and buttocks exposed. \n\n\"The episode is called 'Nude Awakening.' It's about the sexual awakening of a child,\" Breyer said. \"The whole thing was titillating,\" suggesting the FCC in this case could step in and declare it indecent. \n\nBut Justice Elena Kagan echoed the sentiments of the networks. \"There is some amount of uncertainty, and ABC finds itself in that area of uncertainty,\" she said. \"Because it turns out that nudity -- sometimes it's allowed as to some body parts and sometimes it's not allowed -- and the commission hadn't really said anything about it for 50 years,\" until the clampdown a decade ago. \n\nThe networks complain the FCC allowed profanity in such movies as \"Saving Private Ryan,\" and full-frontal nudity in \"Schindler's List\" when they aired on broadcast TV, but fined stations for other allegedly \"indecent\" material. \n\n\"Context matters,\" said Chief Justice Roberts, skeptical about what he was hearing from the networks. \"People understand that, including children. When they hear a bad word when someone hits their thumb with a hammer, they understand that's different than having an adult stand in normal conversations and use the words. And it seems to me that your position is saying that the government cannot regulate with an understanding of what takes place in the real world. \"\n\nAnother source of contention is whether broadcast radio and the TV networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, and the CW -- should receive treatment differing from their satellite and cable cousins, in a content way. Most broadcast stations are part of the basic cable packages people buy, and just 10% of the population receives its TV only through the airwaves. But the government countered that 69 million television sets are not connected to cable or satellite, and that broadcasting is the medium of choice for children. \n\n\"What do you call it, you surf through all the (cable) channels. And it's not apparent to many people which are broadcast and which are not,\" Justice Anthony Kennedy said to Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who argued for the FCC. \"But you're saying that there's still a value, an importance, in having a higher standard or different standard for broadcast media on the television. Why is that, when there are so many other options? \"\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia: \"Sign me up as supporting Justice Kennedy's notion that this has a symbolic value, just as we require a certain modicum of dress for the people that attend this court. ... If these are public airwaves, the government is entitled to insist upon a certain modicum of decency. \"\n\nBut Ginsburg interjected: \"The expletives are in common parlance today.

It is not going to be long before it goes the way of vinyl records and eight-track tapes,\" he told the network lawyers. \"I'm sure your clients will continue to make billions of dollars on their programs which are transmitted by cable and by satellite and by Internet.

Everyone enjoyed that moment of levity. \n\nThe Supreme Court first ventured into the broadcast speech debate in 1978, when it ruled as indecent a monologue by comedian George Carlin on society's taboo surrounding \"seven dirty words.\" The bit had received some radio airplay. The justices said \"context\" should be applied when deciding whether words or images are \"indecent.\" \n\nThe major broadcast television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity, racy images or expletives, even after 10 p.m., when some potentially vulgar words are permitted. \n\nTime Warner -- the parent company of CNN -- filed a supporting amicus brief in the high court dispute two years ago.

It was then that the baby moved on as well, to the Charleston, South Carolina, home of Matt and Melanie Capobianco. \n\nIt was an open adoption, family friend Jessica Munday said. That meant the girl's birth mother could and did maintain a relationship with the girl. \n\nBut Brown, the biological father, wasn't on board. Four months after Veronica's birth, he began legal proceedings seeking custody of her. \n\n\"My client has been fighting for custody of his daughter since shortly after her birth,\" Shannon Jones, Brown's Charleston-based lawyer, said by e-mail. \"He loves this child with all his heart. \"\n\nBrown appeared to win that battle late last year. On New Year's Eve, he arrived in South Carolina, picked up Veronica from her adoptive parents, and headed west to his home in Oklahoma. \n\n\"It's awful,\" Matt Capobianco said days later to CNN affiliate WCIV. \"Everyone keeps saying how bad they feel for us. But, I mean, she's a 2-year-old girl that got shoved in a truck and driven to Oklahoma -- with strangers. \"\n\nKey to Brown's case is a 1978 federal law called the Indian Child Welfare Act. \n\nIts aim is to \"promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and Indian families by the establishment of minimum federal standards to prevent the arbitrary removal of Indian children from their families and tribes and to ensure that measures which prevent the breakup of Indian families are followed in child custody proceedings. \"\n\nBrown is enrolled in the Cherokee Nation, a \"federally-recognized government\" of Indians that has \"inherent sovereign status,\" based near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. That means young Veronica has Indian blood, as well. \n\nChrissi Ross Nimmo, assistant attorney general for the Cherokee Nation, says that the protections inherent in the Child Welfare Act are clear and important. Applied as she sees it, Brown -- as an Indian and the biological father of Veronica -- is entitled to custody of the girl. \n\n\"There's a placement preference. If children are removed by the state or if they're placed in private adoption, the first preference is for a family member,\" Nimmo told CNN affiliate KOTV. \n\nOthers disagree. CNN legal analyst Avery Freedman, for one, said the law was misused in this case. \n\n\"It's a wonderful law which seeks to protect the integrity of ... Native American families,\" she said. \"But it cannot be used as a bludgeon to destroy existing families. \"\n\nJones insists that Brown \"would still be entitled to custody of his daughter under South Carolina law. \"\n\n\"It is important to understand that the Indian Child Welfare Act was not used as a loophole in this action,\" the lawyer said. \n\nWhatever the legal arguments, the emotions are still raw. The Capobiancos have spoken to Veronica once since she left, on New Year's Day. \n\n\"She said, 'Hi Mommy! Hi Daddy! She sounded really excited to hear us. And she said, 'I love you!' numerous times,\" Melanie Capobianco told WCIV. \n\nShe added that her husband felt like he'd failed as a father, sending her off with people she didn't know and not knowing what the little girl must think of them and the whole situation. \n\nMelanie Capobianco said she is worried about what's next, and how Veronica is getting through each day and night. \n\n\"We just wish we could be there, if she was afraid,\" she said."}, "2012-tv_910_en.txt": {"title": "Singing competition shows like \"American Idol\" and \"The Voice\" don't only make stars, they rehabilitate them.", "prompt": "Just ask Jennifer Lopez, whose seat at the \"American Idol\" judges' table paved the way for the success of her 2011 album and her recently announced summer tour.

And as stars like Lady Gaga and Beyonce have figured out, there's more to being a singing sensation in 2012 than meets the ear. \n\nFans want to relate to their favorite artists on a personal level, said Andy Greene, an associate editor at Rolling Stone. Becoming a mainstay on a show like \"The X Factor,\" and showing off her personality each week, could reignite the level of fame Spears experienced in the early 2000s, Greene added. \n\nReferencing the way Lady Gaga uses Twitter to stay connected to her fans, which she often calls her \"little monsters,\" Greene said, \"(Gaga) is part of their daily life, while Britney is not.

People can't relate to that,\" he said. \"This could prove to be a whole new phase of her career. Britney 4.0. \"\n\nAnd lucky for Spears because, with a reported $15 million contract to appear on \"X Factor,\" this move is likely less about the money than it is about rebuilding her image. \n\n\"Britney off the cuff doesn't exist,\" said Phil Gallo, Billboard's senior correspondent for film and TV. \"It's really been a while since we've heard her give any kind of expansive commentary. \"\n\nTo that end, there's a risk involved, because \"the No. 1 dangerous thing that could happen,\" Gallo said, \"is if the artist doesn't appear genuine. You have to feel like that's Britney saying what Britney wants to say. It can't feel scripted, like she has someone in her ear telling her what to say. \"\n\nWhile \"The X Factor\" played hardball in the ratings game last fall, fluctuating from 8.5 to 12.5 million viewers each week, the singing competition underwhelmed critics thanks to Simon Cowell's prediction that anything less than 20 million in viewers would be unacceptable. \n\nHowever, with Spears at the judges' table, ratings probably won't be a concern, Gallo said. If the show starts pulling \"Idol\"-like numbers, he added, \"it will be driven by, 'What did Britney say?' ' What is Britney going to say?' Out of the gate, that's what it is. \"\n\nGreene agrees people will tune in, if only to hear her talk. \n\n\"If you were a young person between '98 and '07, you find Britney fascinating,\" he said. \"There's just no way around it ... between her craziness and absence. \"\n\nOf course, Greene added, Britney's team probably wouldn't let her on live TV if she couldn't handle it. \n\n\"There's a vote of confidence on Fox's part and Simon Cowell's part and Britney's team's part to say she's ready, and if it goes right, the potential is huge,\" he said. \"The real Britney I used to see is bubbly and funny.

We've already covered one of the most consumer-facing updates, the new Start Screen, but other changes include hardware-related features like multi-core processor and memory card support, a revamped Internet Explorer 10, shared native code between Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8, NFC support, a new Wallet hub, Nokia Maps, and Windows Phone 8 for business. \n\nMany of these updates shouldn't come as a surprise, considering all the leaks and reports that came out in February.", "text": "Nor was today's announcement a full-fledged reveal like Apple's iOS 6 presentation at WWDC. Microsoft says it will unveil more end-user features in the summer. But in the meantime, these platform updates are significant, and Microsoft had a lot to say about them. \n\nHere's a deeper dive into what we can expect from Windows Phone 8. \n\nHardware updates\n\nAs suspected, Windows Phone 8 will support multi-core chips. It's a move that will make Windows Phone more competitive with the iPhone and Android handsets, which have been able to check off multi-core support on their spec sheets for quite a while. When they launch, Windows Phone 8 devices will run on dual-core processors, specifically those from Qualcomm. \n\n\"The experience that people have had on a single-core will get much, much better as we move to dual-core,\" Joe Belfiore, manager of the Windows Phone Program, said at the event. \n\nWindows Phone 8 will also support three screen resolutions. (Windows Phone 7.5 supports just one.) The new screen resolutions include WVGA at 800\u00d7480 pixels and a 15:9 aspect ratio; WXGA at 1280\u00d7769 and 15:9; and 720p at 1280\u00d7720 at 16:9. \n\nRounding out the hardware story, Windows Phone 8 will support microSD card expansion. Hardware manufacturers can include a microSD slot for users to easily transfer information from device to device. \"What this enables is that an end user can add a MicroSD card months after they've bought a phone and transfer information from PC to phone, and phone to phone,\" Belfiore said. \"We didn't want to deliver this feature until we could do it where it's easy to use. \"\n\nRevamped Internet Explorer 10\n\nMicrosoft showed off a new Internet Explorer browser for Windows Phone 8. The new IE 10 features Smart Screen, an anti-phishing filter that uses data from Windows PCs to block malicious websites in real time. Belfiore showed off how IE 10 can protect users who might fall victim to scam links sent via email. \n\nIE 10 also receives a JavaScript update \u2014 JavaScript is now four times faster than the browser in Windows PHone 7.5, according to the company. There's also twice as much HTML5 support. \n\nHow does mobile IE 10 compare to other mobile browsers? According to recent SunSpider scores that measures a browser's JavaScript execution performance, IE 10 performed the best. \n\nShared Native Code\n\nWindows Phone 8 will share native C and C++ code with Windows 8, making it easier for developers to create apps for both platforms. It's not something that consumers will immediately notice when they use the OS, but Microsoft hopes shared native code will lead to better, faster app development \u2014 and thus more quality apps in Windows Phone Marketplace. \n\n\"The biggest effect this will have is we're going to see some freaking killer games this year,\" Belfiore said. \n\nAt its developer summit, Microsoft continually hammered on how easy it will be for developers to port games from Windows 8 to Windows Phone 8, and vice versa. \"Suddenly, with Windows Phone 8 with that shared core, taking an app from the PC to phone is very straightforward,\" Belfiore said. \n\nIn essence, native code will enable developers to write high-performance code \u2014 which is why games are such a big deal \u2014 and drive hardware acceleration. \"You're going to see some beefy, powerful phones running some amazing games this year,\" Belfiore said. \n\nNFC Sharing\n\nAs suspected, Windows Phone 8 devices will support NFC sharing. NFC isn't a totally new technology, but it's far from ubiquitous, so it's interesting to see Microsoft pushing it forward. Belfiore demoed how NFC would work in a Lexus advertisement with an embedded tag \u2014 he used the April issue of Wired magazine, actually: With a simple tap of his phone on top of the advertisement, he transferred product information directly to his Windows Phone. \n\nAlso, sharing isn't limited to just phones. The new Microsoft platform supports NFC between phones, laptops, slates, and PCs. And NFC also has an important role in the next platform update....\n\nWallet Experience\n\nWindows Phone 8 will feature a new Wallet hub where users can store their credit and debit card information, third-party loyalty and membership cards, and coupons and deals. It's not unlike Apple's iOS 6 Passbook app. But Windows Phone Wallet experience will also support NFC tap-to-pay. \n\nYes, it's like Google Wallet, but with one fundamental difference. All of your credit and debit card information will be stored in a secure SIM card, not in an on-device system. Google Wallet is built directly into a device, making it impossible to move your Wallet info from one device to the next, but Windows Phone has opted for a more transition-friendly option. \n\nMicrosoft's approach is also an experience that carriers prefer. But don't get too excited just yet, as the NFC tap-to-pay capabilities won't be coming to the United States until next year. At launch, the capability will be limited to the France-based Orange carrier. US Windows 8 consumers, however, will still be able to access the Wallet hub as their central location for cards, third-party services, and deals. \n\nGoodbye Bing Maps, Hello Nokia Maps\n\nSay goodbye to Bing Maps. Windows Phone 8 maps will run on Nokia's mapping technology, built directly into the onboard Maps app. There's not too much news on this front, but this development isn't surprising considering Microsoft and Nokia's close ties. Some key features include: Global NAVTEQ map data, offline map support, turn-by-turn directions, and map control for developers. 3-D navigation didn't make it. \n\nWindows Phone 8 for Business\n\nMicrosoft has always had a strong hold on the enterprise market with Windows, and now it's taking all of that work and pulling it together with a business-friendly Windows Phone platform. Windows Phone 8 will come with a complete security platform with Secure Boot and encryption (which is a derivative of Windows Bitlocker). It'll make app distribution and deployment flexible for business, offering up a mechanism for private distribution and full-on onsite management. \n\nBusinesses will also be able to manage Windows Phone 8 devices through a software management system. And finally, Windows Phone 8 will run the Microsoft Office suite \u2014 though we have yet to see how it will look in that mobile form. \n\nNew Start Screen\n\nAh, the new Start Screen. \"It's the sexiest thing in Windows Phone 8,\" Belfiore said. And this should definitely the case for more visually motivated users. As we wrote in our story about the Start Screen and current Windows Phone devices, the new Start Screen is the most visible end-user feature of Windows Phone 8 (at least that's been announced so far). \n\nMicrosoft has taken its Live Tiles and made them more customizable, bringing a new small size to the experience. \n\n\"These live tiles are the heart and soul of the Windows Phone,\" Belfiore said. \"We know that our users really love their phones, and we think the biggest reason is because Live Tiles make the phones so special and so personal. \"\n\nUsers will be able to choose between a small, medium and large size for their Live Tiles. And now the entire screen is available for Live Tile pinning \u2014 the arrow and empty space on the right-hand side have dissapeared. To that end, users can pin more on their Start Screen. \n\nAnd of course, Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 are coming even closer together. As Microsoft said, they're \"better together. \"\n\n\"The intent in our changing the Live Tiles support is not just to make Live Tiles more personal, but to give a more consistent experience between Windows 8 Live Tiles and Windows Phone 8 live tiles,\" Belfiore said. \n\nSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

Meetings between Zuckerberg, 27, and Instagram head Kevin Systrom, 28, that took place at Zuckerberg's multi-million-dollar Palo Alto, California, home. \n\nIt's a move that shows Zuckerberg displaying the hacker spirit that helped him launch a social-media juggernaut in his college dorm room.", "text": "And that's a spirit that doesn't always jibe with the image of  CEO of a corporation expected to be valued at up to $100 billion when it makes its first public stock offering in the next few weeks. \n\n\"On balance, I'm not sure it's the best way to do business,\" said Ali Velshi, CNN's chief business correspondent. \"But Mark Zuckerberg has defied all rules. \"\n\nThe moxie suggested in the report comes at an interesting time for Facebook and Zuckerberg, who also reportedly whittled down Systrom's initial asking price of $2 billion. \n\nOn the brink of offering up Facebook, with its hundreds of millions of users, to stockholders, even Zuckerberg's controlling interest in the company (a 57% share of voting rights, according to reports) could soon need to be checked by the types of lawyers, bean-counters and other business types whose jobs involve looking out for a company's bottom line. \n\n\"This paints a complex picture of its CEO as at once confident and bold, and also nervous and panicky -- details that will be scrutinized come Facebook's imminent IPO,\" Kit Eaton wrote on Fast Company's website. \n\nVelshi, who over the course of his career covered the \"tech bubble\" of the late 1990s, said the whirlwind purchase may, in fact, be a last hurrah of sorts for Zuckerberg. \n\n\"It actually happens more than we think. And it's not a bad thing, particularly in non-public companies, Velshi said. \"But, in public companies, boards are important -- they are supposed to protect shareholder interests, and they are supposed to bring perspective and experience that a kid CEO may not have.\"\n\nThe Facebook board did vote to approve the deal, according to the Journal. But at that point, it was largely an endorsement more than a decision. The board, one source said, \"was told, not consulted. \"\n\nIn the fast-moving world of Web tech, being nimble is almost a prerequisite for survival. Fail to adapt and someone else will pass you by. \n\nInstagram, a mobile app which lets users enhance their photos with a raft of pre-created filters, was reportedly on the verge of nailing down a new round of private investments worth $50 million. Could that have made Zuckerberg overpay for a company with 13 employees and no revenue to date? \n\nMaybe, says Velshi. \n\n\"Creativity, innovation and deal-making are different strengths; rarely does one person possess all of them,\" he said. \"That Zuckerberg felt strongly that he wanted Instragram may not have made him the best person to do the deal -- that's why we have real estate agents, or talent agents. \"\n\nFor what it's worth, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg was aware of the negotiations all along, although she didn't personally take part. And, for Facebook, making a profit directly from Instagram may have been less important than locking up its user data and taking a rapidly growing competitor, now with more than 40 million users, off of the playing field. \n\nRegardless of where the future takes Facebook -- whether life as a publicly traded commodity is more about stuffy board meetings than spur-of-the moment handshake deals -- Wednesday's report provided at least one more glimpse at the hoodie-wearing, authority-flouting CEO whose origin story has literally become the stuff of Hollywood storytelling. \n\n\"What's cooler than a billion dollars?\" Matthew Braga of Ars Technica wrote, invoking the oft-paraphrased line from Facebook biopic \"The Social Network. \"\n\n\"A billion dollars without board approval. \""}, "2013-07-web_969_en.txt": {"title": "Las Vegas (CNN) -- The National Security Agency's controversial intelligence-gathering programs have prevented 54 terrorist attacks around the world, including 13 in the United States, according to Gen. Keith Alexander, NSA director.", "prompt": "Speaking before a capacity crowd of hackers and security experts Wednesday at the Black Hat computer-security conference, Alexander defended the NSA's embattled programs, which collect phone metadata and online communications in an effort to root out potential terrorists. The secret programs have come under fire since their existence was revealed in June by former CIA contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked details about them to several newspapers. \n\n\"I promise you the truth -- what we know, what we're doing, and what I cannot tell you because we don't want to jeopardize our future defense,\" Alexander told the audience, which included a few hecklers who shouted profanities and accused him of lying.", "text": "He then gave a partial recap, using PowerPoint slides, of how the two intelligence programs work. Alexander said the NSA can collect metadata on phone calls in the United States, including the date and time of the call, the numbers involved and the length of the conversations. He made a special point of saying the NSA does not have access to the content of citizens' calls or text messages. \n\nTop senator questions need to collect phone records\n\nAlexander said the NSA's PRISM surveillance program, which probes digital activity such as e-mail, instant messaging and Web searches, focuses on foreign actors and does not apply to people in the United States. He said the phone and Internet data is necessary to \"connect the dots\" and identify potential terrorists before they act. \n\nAlexander attempted to reassure the audience that NSA officials are not abusing access to the databases to intrude on Americans' privacy. \n\n\"The assumption is that people are out there just wheeling and dealing (users' information), and nothing could be further from the truth,\" he said. \"We have tremendous oversight and compliance in these programs. \"\n\nCongress and courts make sure the programs operate within the bounds of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and internal auditing systems are in place to prevent any abuse by employees, Alexander said. He added that only 35 analysts are authorized to run queries on the phone metadata. \n\nAlexander made no mention of a report in Wednesday's Guardian newspaper about the existence of another secret NSA program, called XKeyscore. According to documents provided to the Guardian by Snowden, XKeyscore allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing e-mails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of people. \n\nCNNMoney: NSA chief to hackers: If you don't like what we do, change it\n\nAlexander denied accusations that the NSA programs allow the government to collect all online data on everyone. \n\n\"We can't afford to and don't want to collect everything,\" he said. \n\n\"I have four daughters. Can I go and intercept their e-mails? The answer is no,\" said the security chief before looking out at the auditorium thick with hackers and joking, \"You may be able to. \"\n\nAside from a couple jokes, Alexander's words were serious and measured, and he seemed unfazed by a smattering of heckling from the audience during his hourlong talk. \n\nEx-NSA chief: Safeguards exist to protect Americans' privacy\n\n\"You lied to Congress. Why would we believe you're not lying to us right now?\" yelled one person. \n\nAlexander replied that people were basing opinions on what was \"written in the press\" without looking at facts and urged the heckler read his congressional testimony. \n\nDuring a Q&A session consisting of prescreened questions, Alexander said that one reason terrorists target the United States is a desire by people in the Middle East to run governments under Islamic law. But another attendee disagreed, shouting, \"They want to attack us because we're bombing them. \"\n\nAnother yell of \"bulls---!\" inspired the general to cap his explanation of the programs by saying \"And that's no bulls---, those are facts. \"\n\nOverall, the reception to Alexander's talk seemed mostly positive. Black Hat attendees are primarily corporate-security types, interested in protecting their networks and warding off cyber attacks. The looser, hacker-centric Def Con conference, which starts here Thursday, could likely give him a more hostile reception. \n\nAlexander solicited advice on how to better balance security with civil liberties and put up an e-mail address so the room of tech experts could share their ideas with the NSA. \n\nHe also hinted at possible damage resulting from the Snowden leaks, and wondered aloud whether the government will have the same success preventing terrorist attacks in the next 10 years as it has in the past decade. \n\n\"If we tell everyone exactly what we're doing, then the adversaries will know exactly how to get through our defenses,\" he said. \n\nOpinion: NSA secrets kill our trust"}, "2013-americas_1300_en.txt": {"title": "Less than an hour after he fired off an angry letter to Catholic Church leaders about their handling of Argentina's same-sex marriage debate, Marcelo Marquez says his phone rang.", "prompt": "He was surprised to hear the voice on the other end of the line. It was Jorge Mario Bergoglio, then the archbishop of Buenos Aires, and now the pope. \n\nWhat Bergoglio said to him at a meeting soon afterward that year, 2010, was even more surprising, Marquez said. \n\nFor months, church officials had made sharp, public criticisms of the push to legalize same-sex marriage in the South American country. But privately, Bergoglio seemed to be more open to discussion, according to Marquez.", "text": "5 things to know about Pope Francis\n\n\"He told me. ... 'I'm in favor of gay rights and in any case, I also favor civil unions for homosexuals, but I believe that Argentina is not yet ready for a gay marriage law,'\" said Marquez, a gay rights activist, a self-described devout Catholic and a former theology professor at a Catholic seminary. \n\nThe pope's reported willingness behind-the-scenes to accept civil unions as a compromise may offer new insight into how he will lead the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. \n\nA public battle\n\n As archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio was one of the leaders of the Catholic Church's public charge against legalizing same-sex marriage in Argentina. He engaged in a notorious war of words with the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who supported the measure. \n\nBergoglio put himself in the middle of the fight, calling the proposed legislation \"a destructive attack on God's plan. \"\n\nWith a front-page counterpunch, the president said the church possessed \"attitudes reminiscent of medieval times and the Inquisition. \"\n\nSome point to the public battle as evidence of Bergoglio's traditionalist views. \n\nBut behind closed doors, Marquez said, the man who would become pope appeared to be more open to discussion of the issue. \n\nIn another meeting, Bergoglio told him he had always treated gay people with respect and dignity. \n\nWorld reacts to new pope\n\n\"I have accompanied many homosexual people during my career to tend to their spiritual needs,\" Bergoglio said at the time, according to Marquez. \n\nPope was 'very open, very frank'\n\nBergoglio, who chose the name Pope Francis after he was elected pontiff last week, may have voiced his support for civil unions in other circles. \n\nAndres Albertsen, a former pastor of the Danish Church in Buenos Aires, said Bergoglio made similar comments about civil unions to him in a private meeting. \n\n\"In this conversation that we had, he showed himself to be very open, very frank with me,\" Albertsen told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol on Wednesday. \"He told me that he would have accepted a civil union. \"\n\nAccording to a story published by The New York Times on Wednesday, Bergoglio also told bishops at a 2010 meeting that the church should support civil unions for gay couples. \n\nCNN could not independently confirm the details of the Argentine bishops' meeting, which was also described in a July 2010 article published by Argentina's Clarin newspaper. \n\n\"Bergoglio -- faithful to his moderate position -- proposed continuing measured actions. ... He would suggest, also, that the church discreetly accept the intermediate alternative of the civil union -- authorizing a series of rights (inheritance, social work) -- that would not equate to marriage nor permit adoption,\" wrote journalist Sergio Rubin -- now Bergoglio's biographer. \n\nBut that proposal was rejected by bishops, who voted instead to begin a high-profile, public battle against same-sex marriage, Rubin wrote. \n\nPushing for dialogue\n\nA senior Vatican official said he could neither confirm nor deny The New York Times report at this point, adding that while Pope Francis might have expressed such a view while he was a cardinal, he should be given time to develop his policy position as pontiff. \n\nAlejandro Russo, the rector of the Metropolitan Cathedral in Buenos Aires, said it was unlikely the pope had ever expressed such a view, even in private. \n\nIn 2007, Bergoglio publicly criticized Buenos Aires' government for allowing civil unions, Russo said. His relationship with the mayor of Buenos Aires soured over the matter. \n\nGay rights advocates in Argentina later argued that civil unions, allowed in a several states, were a positive step that conferred some benefits to same-sex couples, but didn't go far enough. The same-sex marriage measure, they said, would treat homosexual and heterosexual relationships equally before the law. It would permit gay couples to adopt, and also allow the inheritance of property. \n\nArgentina approved a law legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide in July 2010. \n\nEven though Bergoglio was one of the law's most well known opponents, Marquez said on Wednesday that he hopes the pontiff will remain open to discussion, just as he appeared to be several years ago in Buenos Aires. \n\n\"We are going to try to have a dialogue with the pope,\" said Marquez, who works for Argentina's National Institute Against Discrimination. \"It's frightening, but I think it must be done. \"\n\n'He's really moderate on this issue'\n\nWord of the pope's reported support for civil unions in Argentina sparked debate, with some praising his stance and saying it was a hopeful sign of possible reforms. \n\n\"He wanted to respect human rights. That's the real surprise here, that people say, well he's anti-gay. You can be anti-gay marriage and not be anti-gay, and I think there's a distinction here,\" said the Rev. Edward Beck, a CNN contributor and host of \"The Sunday Mass\" on ABC Family. \"He's really moderate on this issue, it seems. \"\n\nOthers, though, were more skeptical. \n\nOne Argentine journalist said Wednesday that he wasn't quite ready to celebrate. \n\nIn an article titled, \"Francis, the pope that declares war on us and later calls us on the phone,\" journalist Bruno Bimbi said it wasn't clear how the pope will handle the issue of same-sex unions. \n\n\"Maybe the lion has become a lamb. Maybe, as a priest told me the day his election was announced, maybe he is worried about his biography and wants to go down in history. I do not know,\" Bimbi wrote. \"Whatever he does, this time he won't be able to blame others for the pressures.

Audio of that week's arguments are now posted Fridays on the Supreme Court's website. It may be the easiest to sample the flavor of public session: only about 330 courtroom seats are available to the public and only on a first-come, first-seated basis. \n\nA little-known fact about the high court is that it has been taping its arguments since 1955, initially in secret. Until three years ago, the audio from one term was not available until the beginning of the subsequent term, a wait of up to a year.

More important than exposing everyone around the world to it is making sure it's healthy and not an experiment. \n\n\"I know a lot of people talked about Rio and New York. It's obviously great to be wanted. At the same time you need to be sure it makes sense -- and right now London makes a lot of sense. \"\n\nFederer, who lost to Novak Djokovic in last year's final, shared Silva's view. \n\n\"I must agree with Andre in many ways because I think it's important that this event is played in a place that knows tennis,\" Federer told CNN. \n\n\"I think it's good sometimes to play Shanghai, or maybe Lisbon or Sydney for a year, but I think it's not long enough in one place to put its roots down. \"\n\nLisbon welcomed the world's top players in 2000 and Sydney did the same in 2001 in another one-year stint. \n\n\"It's like a circus,\" said Federer, who will this week tie Ivan Lendl's record of 12 successive appearances at the season-ending event. \n\n\"You come, the tent is there but it's temporary and you move it away again. So here the roots are down, it's successful and that's why if the business makes sense, if the numbers make sense, if the excitement of everybody involved makes sense, I think we should keep it here. \n\n\"Other options would have to be considered but it would have to be a great other option. \"\n\nRichard Davies, the CEO of ATP Properties before leaving his post at the end of 2010, said London was \"twice as successful\" in monetary value for the ruling body than other host cities. \n\nUnlike when the season finale was showcased in Shanghai as the Masters Cup, the World Tour Finals are operated as a joint venture between the ATP and London's O2 venue owner AEG. All operating costs and revenues feed into the joint venture. \n\nThe Shanghai promoters paid the ATP for the right to run the tournament, and the purchasing fee -- believed to work out to about $10 million per year -- was all the latter received from the event. \n\n\"If there's no tennis fatigue at the O2 and it's still selling out, I think you have to ask yourself, 'What's the upside to move it elsewhere?' \" said Davies. \"At the ATP Tour, it's not their responsibility to be evangelistic about tennis. \n\n\"London is a great city and that helps corporately. You'd have to take a long, hard look to say, 'We're going to move it.' It's very profitable and to get a tennis-loving nation behind it in any other country at that time of the year will be a gamble. \"\n\nThe success of the tournament has had a knock-on effect on sponsorship, according to both Davies and Silva. \n\nSome companies get involved with the World Tour Finals and then decide to increase their affiliation with the tour throughout the year. \n\nMore than one million fans have walked through the turnstiles in the four editions, helped by a capacity of 17,800 that makes the O2 arena the second-largest regularly used tennis venue behind New York's Arthur Ashe Stadium. \n\nOperating two sessions -- day and evening -- pads the coffers. Tickets to watch a single round-robin match range from \u00c2\u00a310-62 ($16-98), while seats for the final are \u00c2\u00a330-105 ($48-167). \n\n\"People want to be part of the event,\" said Silva. \"They see how successful it is. They see the tour operates in a very successful way throughout the year and end up becoming global partners. \"\n\nCome the conclusion of 2015, London's term will hit seven consecutive seasons, a run only bettered by New York, which had an unbroken spell from 1977-1989. \n\nWith tennis a younger sport in China, crowds for opening matches disappointed, the time zone presented problems for broadcasters and viewers in Europe -- tennis' biggest market -- while players faced the long trip to Asia following the European indoor swing. \n\nLondon lacks those issues, though players have complained about Britain's tax laws -- which restrict the number of days they can be in the country before being rated on their overall income. \n\nThe O2 is \"one of the best venues ever\" according to veteran doubles specialist Leander Paes, this week teaming up with Radek Stepanek. \n\n\"Playing in there, the acoustics are phenomenal,\" Paes, who turned pro in 1991, told CNN. \"The crispness of it makes the quality of tennis so high.\" \n\nPondering the achievement of the event in London, Davies spared a thought for former ATP head Etienne de Villiers. \n\nDe Villiers was criticized for implementing a round-robin format at smaller tournaments, and the ATP was taken to court during his 2005-08 tenure for attempting to strip a German event of Masters status. \n\nBut De Villiers spearheaded the shift to London from Shanghai in 2009. \n\n\"People have short memories,\" said Davies. \"It was a very bold move. The O2 wasn't an established venue and it had a slight miasma about it. \n\n\"To back ourselves and say we know we can build an event here, find sponsors and fill it with an audience really that has just had Wimbledon, outdoors ... we're going to take that tennis-loving public and tell them to watch tennis indoors -- it was a big decision. \""}, "2013-begala-government-shutdown_982_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- As Washington hurtles toward a government shutdown, the go-to move for the uninformed is to blame both sides equally.

But not now.", "text": "Credit the strong leadership of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid with keeping a remarkably diverse Democratic Congress together. When you can keep a strong conservative like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia on the same page with the powerfully progressive Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, you are definitely winning. \n\nMeanwhile, the GOP, whose members range from conservative to ultraconservative, is at war with itself and its leaders. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas led the fight on the Senate floor to block consideration of the funding bill. But after a pointless 21-hour talkathon, the majority of his GOP colleagues rejected Cruz's strategy. Senate Republicans split badly and bitterly; 25 voted against Cruz while just 19 voted with him. \n\nIn the House, it is chaos. The Neanderthals are fighting the Cro-Magnons and the Homo erectus tough guys are fighting the australopithecines. \n\nWhich side is more mainstream? \n\nA majority of voters don't like the Affordable Care Act -- although that's a bit misleading, because a percentage of them dislike it because they think it doesn't go far enough. \n\nI like it -- in fact, I love it -- but that's not the point of this column. Obamacare clocks in at just 29% support in a recent CNBC poll. So you'd think that the Republicans' position of repealing the ACA would be more mainstream. But you'd be wrong. \n\nThat same CNBC poll shows that Americans oppose defunding Obamacare, with only a little more than one-third of voters saying they want it defunded. They want to mend it, not end it. \n\nWhat's worse for the Republicans, when the question shifts to whether you support shutting down the government and/or defaulting on U.S. debt in order to kill Obamacare, the GOP position loses by a crushing 59 to 19 percentage points. When you're down to just 19% of your countrymen and -women supporting your crusade, it's time (as we say in Texas) to pee on the fire and call the dogs: The hunt's over. \n\nThat is, no doubt, why the House Republicans have retreated to their new position: delaying Obamacare for a year rather than outright defunding it. But health care delayed is health care denied, and it's a bit of a reach to demand a one-year delay in the president's top domestic priority in exchange for funding the government for 10 weeks. \n\nWhich side is more reasonable? \n\nIt is hard to seem reasonable when you are pursuing a strategy that even conservative Republicans like Sen. Richard Burr called \"the dumbest idea I've ever heard of.\" Keep in mind this is from a man who represents North Carolina, where the Republicans proposed a law barring federal courts from interpreting the Constitution, and allowing the North Carolina Legislature to declare a state religion. (Which might have passed had they chosen the right religion for the Tarheel State: college basketball.) \n\nAnd yet there is hope for the GOP here. Every time the president says \"I will not negotiate on the debt ceiling\" -- a phrase he utters even more often than \"Just pass me the ball, Joe, I'm open!\" -- he risks looking unreasonable. \n\nAs a matter of substance, I strongly agree with his position. But as a matter of rhetoric and positioning, he would be better served to state his position this way: \"I will gladly listen to any idea to improve the Affordable Care Act, or reduce the deficit, or any other ideas my Republican friends might have. But first we have to avoid default. That means paying the bills that Congress has already incurred. Once we've done that we can negotiate on anything. \"\n\nSame substantive position: Negotiations on policy come only after the nation avoids default. But this formulation emphasizes the president's willingness to be flexible on improving the ACA and other Obama priorities. \n\nOf course, nothing is certain in life. But if I were a betting man, I'd bet on President Obama and the Democrats in this fight. As long as Republicans appear more divided, more extreme and more unreasonable, they are going to lose. And then they will look weak as well. \n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala."}, "2013-comet-ison-dead-or-alive_823_en.txt": {"title": "In case you missed it, a comet grazed the sun on Thanksgiving Day.

The lawyer cites the FBI as saying he arrived in late November. \n\nHashi's British citizenship was stripped from him just a short time before he was put on a plane to the United States, Batchelder said. \n\nThat move is being challenged before a special board of immigration appeal, he said. \"But as of now, the British government has offered no assistance to this matter whatsoever. \"\n\n'New and improved rendition'\n\nHashi's father doesn't understand how his son has ended up in a Brooklyn criminal court. \n\n\"He has never been to the United States even for a holiday. He has never threatened the United States. We don't know why he was taken all the way there,\" he said. \n\nFrom his parents' point of view, he was kidnapped and taken to the United States. \n\nBatchelder said Hashi's case is an example of a disturbing new trend he has heard called \"new and improved rendition. \"\n\n\"I mean that the agonies that were inflicted in earlier renditions, the government has reacted to that, but they still take people from foreign countries, bring them into the United States, and they're going to try him here,\" the attorney said. \n\n\"In my mind, that has long-term ramifications that, if carried out to their logical end, would mean the 20,000 people in Somalia are now eligible to be brought to the United States and tried in a U.S. court. That's a little bit disturbing, and that's an understatement. \"\n\nBecause he is no longer considered a British citizen, Hashi has received no help from the British government. His mother told CNN it has changed the way she thinks of her adopted homeland. \n\n\"When we came this country, it was (as) you know, asylum seeker,\" she said. \"They said you are welcome. And now (they say) you are welcome to be hunted. For our kids, our brothers and sisters. The whole community, not only my son. \"\n\nMahdi Hashi is now fighting to regain his British citizenship while in a New York detention center.

Teams earn ranking points for a win or a draw but nothing for a defeat. \n\nThe points vary with each game depending on who is playing and whether it is a friendly or qualifying match. \n\nUneven numbers\n\nWhen there are eight unseeded European teams -- as in 2010 -- the draw works easily and smoothly, meaning FIFA can organize the nations into four pots of eight teams. \n\nBut because there are nine unseeded European teams in the 2014 World Cup, things become a little more complicated. \n\nFIFA has decided to put these nine teams into one pot, and prior to the draw they will pull out one nation to go into pot two with five African nations and the two unseeded South American sides. \n\nThat country will be selected at random, despite France -- which qualified through the playoffs -- being the lowest ranked nation from the European qualifying phase. \n\nThis random element has not gone down well with some of the other countries in that part of the draw. \n\nPot X\n\nAs a starting point, Brazil will automatically be drawn into Group A due to its role as host. \n\nThen the other seeded teams will be allocated their groups, which runs as far as Group H.\n\nAnd then it gets rather complicated. \n\nWith one of the unseeded European teams now residing in pot two, there are now nations from three geographical zones in the same pot. \n\nThat increases the chances of three European teams ending up in the same group, a violation of FIFA's \"geographical separation\" principle. \n\nAs such, the governing body decided to create \"Pot X\" into which four of the seeded South American teams will be placed. \n\nOne is drawn out and then paired together in a group with the unseeded European team from pot two. \n\nAfter that, the rest of the teams will be allocated to their groups -- with the only other issue residing with Chile and Ecuador, who can skip a group in order to avoid being drawn with seeded South American teams. \n\nGroup of Death\n\nAs ever with any high-profile soccer draw there is the potential for the much-touted \"Group of Death. \"\n\nWhichever unseeded European team is plucked out of pot four and put into pot two might be forgiven for watching the rest of the draw from behind their sofa. \n\nThat nation will be guaranteed to face one of the South American seeds from Pot X -- Brazil, Argentina, Colombia or Uruguay. \n\nThen they could face the United States from pot three and either Italy or Netherlands from pot four, making qualification for the last 16 much harder."}, "2013-football_870_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- A man suspected of being part of a major soccer match-fixing organization has given himself up to Italian police after being a fugitive since December 2011.", "prompt": "Admir Suljic, a former football player, was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport Thursday following his arrival from Singapore, having told authorities he would do so via his defense lawyer. \n\nThe 31-year-old Slovenian has been accused of direct involvement in a transnational criminal group said to be composed of individuals from Singapore and the Balkans which had been targeted by the \"Last Bet\" investigation. \n\nAuthorities said the group's activities included influencing the results of Italian league matches during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 seasons.", "text": "Investigations into this have targeted top clubs such as Napoli, and involved a raid on the Italy team headquarters ahead of Euro 2012. \n\n\"This is exactly the type of result which can be achieved when police share information in real time and use Interpol's global network to locate, identify and arrest suspects,\" said the head of the worldwide policing agency, Ronald Noble. \n\n\"The arrest of this suspected match-fixer could not have been achieved without Italy and Singapore's close cooperation with Interpol, nor without a great deal of behind-the-scenes work by prosecutors and magistrates. \n\n\"Those who doubted Singapore's ability or commitment to fight match-fixing and bring those wanted for arrest to justice need to understand that Singapore acts when the evidence exists and is shared and when their laws permit.

And both times, America's National Security Agency conducted widespread surveillance that was \"closely coordinated with the Canadian partner,\" according to CBC's account of a briefing note from the U.S. spy agency. \n\nThe multi-day spying operation focused at making sure meeting sites were safe, protecting against terrorist threats and \"providing support to policymakers,\" a NSA briefing document states, according to the Canadian news outlet. \n\nThe National Security Agency and the office of Director of National Intelligence, President Barack Obama's top intelligence adviser, did not respond Thursday to CNN requests for comment on the CBC report.", "text": "Ottawa's Communications Security Establishment Canada, or CSEC, did not comment to the CBC, according to that news outlet. \n\nWhen similar reports have surfaced in the past.

If that Canadian agency had been complicit in snooping on anyone -- be they Canadians or foreign nationals -- without a warrant, it could violate that North American nation's laws, the CBC reports. \n\nG8 summits are meetings of world leaders from the Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, the European Union and the United States. G20 summits incorporate a larger group, traditionally taking place once or twice each year. \n\nDuring these meetings, leaders traditionally discuss a wide range of important and sometimes hot-button issues. At the end of 2010's G8 summit in Toronto, for example, the group issued a final statement focusing on recovery from a global economic crisis while also criticizing Iran and North Korea. \n\nThe fact that Snowden is linked to the CBC's report isn't a big surprise. \n\nThe now 30-year-old worked as an information technology contractor for the U.S. government.

It kicks it squarely through the goalposts with a mind-blowing story set in an alternate reality that may be only a short trip from our real-world track. \n\n\"BioShock Infinite\" takes place in a version of 1912 America in the floating city of Columbia, a technological marvel on which a prophet has chosen to lead his people away from the \"Sodom below.\" Booker DeWitt, a former military man and Pinkerton agent, is charged with going to the city in the sky and rescuing a young girl, Elizabeth, who has the power to manipulate time and space.", "text": "Indeed, the game plays with the concept of time from its very beginning. An Edwardian barbershop quartet sings \"God Only Knows\" by the Beach Boys. A mechanical horse is advertised as \"Horse of the Future Today.\" The city itself feels like a floating World's Fair, with new inventions, a carnival-like atmosphere and everyone speaking about how much better things will be tomorrow -- all based on the prophet's guidance. \n\nThe environments are colorful and vibrant, reflective of the game's disparate moods of optimism and turmoil. The city feels like it has gravitas while remaining lofty in the clouds. There is even a beach and \"ocean,\" so I guess we get to see where rain really comes from. \n\nSteampunkish \"voxophones\" and \"kinetoscopes\" scattered throughout the city help provide aural and visual backstories for current events. They fill in the history blanks and give the player a better understanding of actions that take place. \n\nOf course, Elizabeth is key to the Prophet's plan to bring judgment on the sinners below, so Booker's time in Columbia is not going to be an easy one. Combat in \"Infinite\" is based very much on the principles from other \"BioShock\" games, with some slight tweaks. \n\nInstead of plasmids (the power source in the first two games), so-called vigors are the source of Booker's environmental powers. From throwing fireballs to directing flocks of ravens or firing lightning bolts, the vigors are permanent once acquired and powered by salts found throughout the city. Think of salts as ammunition for your vigor weapons. \n\n'Bioshock' creator talks history, writing and 'nerdity'\n\nThere are more traditional weapons as well. Pistols, shotguns, machine guns -- they're all here. Both the guns and the vigors are upgradable through purchased additions at vending machines, so keep an eye out for coins wherever you find them. \n\nThe nice addition for combat is making vigors and weapons dual-wieldable. You can mow down an opponent with bullets or rockets while tossing them in the air with a Bucking Bronco vigor. In previous games, this was an either/or venture, so it is nice to be able to mix and match your attacks to whatever you choose. \n\nHowever, the heart of the game is Elizabeth. \n\nShe is your constant companion throughout the game, offering help in combat or pointing out items you might miss as you travel throughout Columbia. Her ability to create windows into other worlds can help bring in supplies or allies during battle as well. She is also a master thief who can pick locks quickly. \n\nElizabeth is never in danger during combat and never takes damage. In that way, she is not one big escort mission but a true companion during your adventures. \n\nGetting Elizabeth just right was a massive undertaking for Irrational Games and Levine, who said the game's release date was pushed back a year solely to perfect her. \n\nTheir success lies in the empathy the player develops toward her as the game progresses. You feel and see her frustrations, her joys and her pain. Her tiny movements, such as bending over to closely examine a new item for the first time (even one that has no bearing on the game), give her a human feeling without treading into Uncanny Valley (where animation comes so close to actual human behavior that it causes discomfort). \n\nWithout going into spoiler territory, there were two separate instances where I really thought the development teams nailed it. The first was during a tense situation early in the game where Elizabeth is trying to understand what's going on and why people were fighting over her. \n\nBooker tries to explain that different sides want different things from her. Her response: \"Well, I want a puppy, but that doesn't mean I'm going to get one. \"\n\nIt felt like the way a teenager would react to a stressful situation. \n\nThe second came during a scene in which Booker is talking with people who suddenly disappear. As a gamer, I shrugged it off and accepted it. However, when I turned around, I caught sight of Elizabeth, who was standing there with the best \"WTH?\" look I've ever seen in a video game. \n\nLittle moments like that combine to reveal a character who isn't just a companion but who helps move the story along in a meaningful way. \n\nAt first, you want to help yourself. Later, you want to help Elizabeth. By the end, you want both. \n\nThe experiences will linger. And your emotions will be real. In this way, Levine and his team have succeeded in creating not only an excitingly wonderful game but one that will make the player think for days after the game is done. \n\n\"BioShock Infinite\" earns its title by the end of the game. The possibilities, like time and space, are endless. \n\nThe overarching narrative portrays struggles on so many different levels, but it is your story of struggle that is ultimately important and the one you guide to its conclusion. \n\n\"BioShock Infinite\" is available worldwide on Tuesday for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows PC. It is rated M for mature due to blood and gore, intense violence, language, mild sexual themes and use of alcohol and tobacco.

No one has summoned the person with the satchel; he or she is expected to show up each day without being asked. \n\nIt's the postal carrier.  And because the presence of the postal carrier has for so long been such a familiar sight, perhaps only that visitor from outer space or from the future would be startled by what he was observing:\n\nThe sight of other people also outdoors, all over town, communicating instantly with each other at the touch of a button, smiling and looking down at the little screens in their palms -- grinning at the through-the-air responses they're receiving from friends, tapping at the screens to reply anew.", "text": "Words flying from person to person, nonstop, on the go. \n\nAs, meanwhile, on those same sidewalks, the men and women with the satchels weave their way through the people with the screens, on their appointed rounds to deliver words by hand. \n\nThe visitor from space, or from a future century, might think this scene -- mailbag luggers walking amid screen tappers -- is like witnessing ox carts amid hovercraft. \n\nAs might an efficiency expert, or a business consultant. \n\nWhich summarizes the continuing headache faced by officials in charge of the United States Postal Service.  The price of a first-class stamp is going up again in the new year: On January 26, it will increase by three cents, to 49 cents per letter.  Federal regulators last week approved the rise on an allegedly temporary basis -- the higher rate is supposed to last for no more than two years -- but no one really expects it to go back down. \n\nThe Postal Service reports that it lost $5 billion in the last fiscal year -- and this is being presented as good news.  The year before, it lost almost $16 billion.  But there are fewer and fewer envelopes in those satchels, so each stamp will come with a higher price tag; the billions of dollars the Postal Service is required to pay each year to pre-fund health care for future retirees is a burden heavier than anything that would fit into a mail sack. \n\nYet there are reasons to hope that the Postal Service finds a way to stay around for a very long time. \n\nThe Postal Service, like UPS, FedEx and other private delivery companies, is a stand-alone  business.  It is expected to sustain itself; it does not depend on tax money. \n\nBut, unlike UPS and FedEx, the Postal Service must go to Congress to get explicit approval for the rates it charges, and for many of the rules under which it operates.  This is why it costs the same amount to send a letter across the country as it does to send a letter to the next town.  This is why mail service is universal -- why those carriers are required to show up each day at virtually every address in the United States. \n\nForty-nine cents may seem like a lot to mail a first-class letter.  But if the Postal Service were to collapse under financial pressures and competition from digital means of communication  -- if the Postal Service had to throw in the towel -- do you really think that UPS or FedEx or some other courier service would take your envelope across the country for 49 cents? \n\nOver the Christmas holiday, the failures by UPS and FedEx to get packages to some customers on time were  prominent in the news.  As efficient as UPS and FedEx usually are, the existence and ubiquity of the Postal Service has a lot to do with what keeps them on their toes.  Their business model is: We cost more than the Postal Service, but because of that you can count on us to be reliable and accountable to you.  If the Postal Service were to go away -- if that check on the other carriers, that extra impetus for them to excel, were to be removed -- what would the impact be on customers and businesses?  Could or would the other carriers pick up the slack, at a price that didn't dismay people? \n\nOne hopeful sign for the Postal Service has come from an unlikely source: Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.  Amazon has announced that it will be delivering its packages on Sundays -- and that to deliver those packages it has arranged to use employees of the Postal Service.  The Postal Service has said that it is glad to have the business.  It without question can use the revenue. \n\nCan daily delivery of mail continue forever in a digital world?  It's difficult to imagine how.  In Canada, the postal service has informed citizens that, over the next five years, it will stop all door-to-door delivery of letters and concentrate on delivering packages.  Most Canadians are already asked to pick up letters at community mailbox clusters in neighborhoods or apartment buildings; soon, everyone will.  It's the future. \n\nUniversal, inexpensive mail delivery in the United States has been one of the miracles of the nation's long story; if someone were assigned to build a system like it from scratch today -- carriers reporting to every U.S. address, six days a week, to drop off mail and see if there is any mail to go out, all for pocket change -- that person would have to concede: It can't be done. \n\nBut it was done, and, for now, it's still here.  For those who, in the digital era,  casually say that they'd be just as happy if the Postal Service were to simply disappear:\n\nBe careful what you wish for."}, "2013-innovation_811_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- A Texas group run by a self-described anarchist has posted what appears to be the first video of the live firing of a handgun created with a 3-D printer.", "prompt": "The 53-second video shows a single shot being fired from The Liberator, a plastic handgun that, with the exception of its metal firing pin, was assembled from parts made with a 3-D printer, according to Defense Distributed.

Sadly, however, the elimination of this tyrant was perhaps the only positive result of the war. \n\nThe war aimed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction, but there weren't any. \n\nThe war aimed to eliminate al Qaeda in Iraq, but the terrorist group didn't exist in the country until after the invasion. \n\nThe war aimed to make Iraq a model democracy based on law, but it replaced tyranny with anarchy and led America to practices that violated the laws of war. \n\nThe war aimed to transform Iraq to a friendly base for U.S. troops capable to act, if needed, against Iran -- but instead it gave Iran a new ally in Baghdad. \n\nWATCH NOW: Iraq's phantom WMD\n\nThe Bush administration certainly wanted to go to war, and it advanced eradication of weapons of mass destruction as the main reason. As Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz has since explained, it was the only rationale that was acceptable to all parts of the U.S. administration. \n\nThe WMDs argument also carried weight with the public and with the U.S. Congress. Indeed, in the autumn of 2002 the threat seemed credible. While I never believed Saddam could have concealed a continued nuclear program, I too thought there could still be some biological and chemical weapons left from Iraq's war with Iran. If not, why had Iraq stopped U.N. inspections at many places around the country throughout the 1990s? \n\nHowever, suspicions are one thing and reality is quite another. U.N. inspectors were asked to search for, report and destroy real weapons. As we found no weapons and no evidence supporting the suspicions, we reported this. But U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfield dismissed our reports with one of his wittier retorts: \"The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\" \n\nRumsfeld's logic was correct, I believe, but it was no excuse for the American and British governments to mislead themselves and the world, as they did, by giving credit to fake evidence or assuming that if weapons items were \"unaccounted for\" that they must exist. They did not exist. \n\nWe inspected many hundred of sites, including dozens that had been suggested to us by various governments' national intelligence organizations. In a few cases we found conventional weapons -- but no weapons of mass destruction. The governments that launched the war claimed to be 100% convinced that there were such weapons, but they had 0% knowledge of where these weapons were. \n\nI am not suggesting that governments should ignore information coming from their billion dollar intelligence programs. Such information is indispensable and collected with many means that are not available to U.N. inspectors. \n\nHowever, I think one lesson from the Iraq war is that we should pay equal attention to the results of multimillion dollar international reports that are based on extensive professional inspections on the ground. In 2003, the alliance of willing states did not do that. \n\nAfter the war it was reported that I and several others in New York had had our offices bugged during this period. If I was bugged, as I find very likely, I regret that those listening in did not pay more attention to what I had to say. \n\nFAREED ZAKARIA: 5 lessons of the Iraq War\n\nFortunately, enough states did listen, and the U.N. Security Council was saved from green-lighting a war that was justified by false evidence. \n\nThe political leaders who have been criticized as responsible for launching the war on false premises have asserted that they acted in good faith, and that interrogation of leading Iraqis showed that the regime planned to revive its weapons program as soon as sanctions disappeared. \n\nI am not questioning the good faith of the political leaders, but rather their poor judgment in bringing war and death to a country on flimsy grounds. \n\nOn February 11 -- less than five weeks before the invasion -- I told U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice I wasn't terribly impressed by the intelligence we had received from the U.S., and that there had been no weapons of mass destruction at any of the sites we had been recommended by American forces. Her response was that it was Iraq, and not the intelligence, that was on trial. \n\nARWA DAMON: Iraq suffocates in cloak of sorrow\n\nAnd during a telephone chat with Tony Blair on February 20, I told the British prime minister that it would be paradoxical and absurd if a quarter of a million troops were to invade Iraq and find very little in the way of weapons. He responded by telling me intelligence was clear that Saddam had reconstituted his weapons of mass destruction program. \n\nAt any rate, whatever view one took of the evidence of weapons, no one could believe in 2003 that prostrate Iraq was a threat to any other state. \n\nI cannot judge whether Iraqi prisoners were sincere when they talked about Saddam Hussein's intentions to revive weapons programs after the end of sanctions. They might have said what they thought their Western interrogators wanted to hear. Either way, the risk of a revived weapons program was remote and hypothetical -- and the U.N. foresaw a system of reinforced monitoring to continue in Iraq and to provide an alarm bell even after a lifting of sanctions. \n\nThe most important lesson of the Iraq War, I think, has been that an overconfidence in military power has been replaced by an understanding that there are severe limitations on what can be achieved by military means. \n\nOPINION: Media's failure on Iraq still stings\n\n Intervening swiftly with arms and crippling strikes might be easy for a great power, but achieving desired political aims is another matter and exiting may be hard -- the phrase \"If you break it, you own it\" comes to mind. Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq have been long and costly engagements with very mixed results. Since then prudence has held the U.S. back in the case of Libya and so far in Syria. \n\nAnother important lesson is that today armed  international interventions are likely to be condemned by much of the world unless they are clearly  in self-defense or have been authorized by the Security Council. \n\nIraq was neither. Unless we remember this going forward, I fear there is nothing stopping this kind of tragedy from being repeated."}, "2013-japan-hashimoto-comfort-women_724_en.txt": {"title": "Japanese officials have distanced themselves from comments made by a prominent nationalist politician that suggested women forced to become prostitutes to entertain Japanese troops during World War II were \"necessary.\"", "prompt": "Toru Hashimoto, who serves as the Mayor of Osaka, told reporters at his weekly press conference Monday that \"anyone would understand\" the role of \"comfort women\" when soldiers were risking their lives and you wanted to give them \"a rest. \"\n\nThough he acknowledged the issue was a \"tragic result of war,\" Hashimoto, who is co-leader of the nationalist Japan Restoration Party, insisted the use of prostitutes by soldiers was not unique to Japan. \n\nBizarrely, Hashimoto also revealed that he told a U.S. military commander during a trip to a base on the island of Okinawa that the adult entertainment business in Japan should be \"utilized more\" by U.S. personnel.", "text": "\"I told him there are places that operate within the boundaries of the law which can be used for releasing sexual frustration, so they [the U.S. military] should fully utilize it or the marines won't be able to control their aggressive sexual desires. \"\n\nHe said the officer refused to discuss the suggestion. \n\nReaction at home\n\nHashimoto's comments also found little support among political colleagues at home. \n\n\"A series of remarks by Japanese politicians related to our interpretation of [wartime] history have been misunderstood,\" Education Minister Hakubun Shimomura told reporters at his weekly press conference Tuesday. \"In that sense Mr. Hashimoto's remarks came at a bad time. [But] I wonder if there is any positive meaning to intentionally make such remarks at this particular moment? As for the remarks about adult entertainment, I could not believe that it came from a man representing a political party. \"\n\nFellow minister Tomomi Inada asked: \"I wonder is this something the representative of a political party should say? I myself think the comfort women [issue] infringed the human rights of the women. \"\n\nChief Cabinet Spokesman Yoshihide Suga did not respond directly to Hashimoto's comments but instead told reporters \"the stance of the Japanese government on the comfort women issue is, as it has been stated repeatedly in the past, that they suffered unspeakably painful experiences and we keenly feel the pain when we think about them. \"\n\nSex slaves\n\nMany of the 200,000 women whom historians estimate were forced to become sex slaves for Japan's former Imperial Army were from the Philippines, China and the Korean peninsula -- all occupied territories at the time. While many have now died, a group of Korean survivors has spent years protesting outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul. They demand greater recognition of their suffering, as well as individual compensation. \n\nTokyo maintains its legal liability for wrongdoing was cleared by a bilateral treaty signed in 1965 with South Korea. For its part, the Seoul government expressed \"deep disappointment\" over Hashimoto's comments. \n\n\"There is worldwide recognition... that the issue of comfort women amounts to a wartime rape committed by Japan during its past imperial period in a serious breach of human rights,\" a foreign ministry spokesman told Agence France-Presse Tuesday. \n\n\"Our government again urges Japan's prominent officials to show regret for atrocities committed during Japan's imperial period and to correct their anachronistic way of thinking and comments. \"\n\nIn 1993, the Japanese government released a statement acknowledging the \"immeasurable pain and suffering\" endured by thousands of women forced to have sex during World War II. It even vowed to include the comfort women issue in new junior high school textbooks for the first time. \n\nBut Japan's wartime past continues to loom over its relations with key Asian neighbors such as South Korea and China, which are currently strained by territorial disputes in the region."}, "2013-justice_1208_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- A day after a jury deadlocked on whether Jodi Arias should be sentenced to death for the murder of her ex-boyfriend, the jury foreman described the decision process as tense and emotional.", "prompt": "\"It was a gut-wrenching thing we had to go through, and everybody had to make their own decision,\" William Zervakos told ABC's \"Good Morning America. \"\n\nThe foreman said some of the most difficult testimony to hear came from the dead man's relatives. \"Until you're face to face with people that have gone through something like that, it's something that you really can't put into words,\" he said. \"I'm 6 feet away from somebody talking about a horrendous loss, and if you can't feel that, then you have no emotion, no soul.", "text": "And yet we couldn't allow ourselves to be emotional on the stand. \n\n\"We couldn't allow ourselves to show emotion, although I'm sure some came through, and I'm very, very proud of my peers and my jurors that were with us because they did a fantastic job of holding it together. \"\n\nThat stoicism in the face of emotional testimony disappeared in the jury room, he said. \n\nZervakos said the 32-year-old defendant simply did not fit his image of a murderer. \"When you look at a young woman and you think of the crime, and then you see the brutality of the crime, it just doesn't wash,\" he said. \"It's very difficult to divest yourself from the personal, from the emotional part of it. \"\n\nThough the jury did not believe Arias' story that she killed Travis Alexander in self-defense, Zervakos said he believed Alexander abused her. \"I'm very sure, in my own mind, that she was mentally and verbally abused,\" he said. \"Now, is that an excuse? Of course not. Does it factor into decisions we make? It has to. \"\n\nZervakos said Arias' 18 days on the stand hurt her case. \"She was not a good witness,\" he said. \"There were so many contradicting stories. \"\n\nBut he expressed sympathy for her ability to endure her time on the stand. \"I think the way the prosecutor was with her -- he's known for an aggressive style -- I think it was very hard, I think it would be difficult for anybody. \"\n\nA retrial for the penalty phase will begin on July 18, Judge Sherry Stephens said. \n\nJurors had deliberated since Tuesday on whether Arias should get a death sentence for the 2008 murder. \n\nA source with knowledge of the jury's vote said there was an 8-4 split in favor of sentencing Arias to death. \n\nJurors refused to talk to reporters and immediately left the courtroom. \n\nThe hung jury brought to a close a chapter in the high-profile case, which has lasted for months. \n\nBut the trial isn't over. In many states, the death penalty would be off the table if the jury couldn't agree. \n\nNot Arizona. \n\nIn a written statement, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said prosecutors \"will proceed with the intent to retry the penalty phase. \"\n\n\"We appreciate the jury's work in the guilt and aggravation phases of the trial, and now we will assess, based upon available information, what the next steps will be,\" he said. \n\nEmotions ran high in the courtroom as the jury's deadlock was announced. Arias appeared to be on the verge of tears. One of Alexander's sisters sobbed. \n\nEven the voice of the normally stoic judge cracked as she dismissed jurors. \n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the participants in this trial, I wish to thank you for your extraordinary service to this community,\" she told them. \"This was not your typical trial. You were asked to perform very difficult responsibilities. \"\n\nAs the jury filed out of the courtroom, one juror said, \"I'm sorry\" to Alexander's family. \n\nJurors had deliberated for more than 13 hours in the penalty phase of the trial when they told the court they wouldn't be able to agree on a verdict. \n\nOn May 8, the same jurors decided in 15 hours that Arias was \"exceptionally cruel\" when she stabbed Alexander 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face. They pronounced her guilty of first-degree murder. \n\nFor Arias to be sentenced to death, a jury's decision must be unanimous. \n\nIf Arias is sentenced to death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in Arizona. On Tuesday, she pleaded with jurors to spare her. \n\nShe called Alexander's murder \"the worst mistake\" she had ever made, \"the worst thing I've ever done.\" She couldn't have imagined herself capable of such a grisly crime, Arias told the jury. \n\n\"But I know that I was,\" she said. \"And for that I'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life -- probably longer.\" \n\nArias was living in Yreka, California, when she met Alexander at a business convention in Las Vegas in September 2006. That November, he baptized Arias into the Mormon faith, a ceremony Arias said was followed by anal sex. \n\nArias became his girlfriend two months later, she testified. They broke up in the summer of 2007, and Alexander began dating other women. \n\nIn June 2008, Alexander missed two appointments, prompting friends to go to his house. They found his naked body crammed in a stand-up shower. \n\nHe had been stabbed 29 times in the back and torso and shot in the head. His throat was slit. \n\nAfter her arrest, Arias told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into Alexander's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped. \n\nRelatives who spoke with police described her as mentally unstable. \n\nThe trial, which started in January, has been rife with talk of sex, lies and digital images -- among them graphic autopsy photos. \n\nCNN's Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report."}, "2013-justice_1652_en.txt": {"title": "Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The military judge overseeing the trial of admitted Fort Hood gunman Maj.

Tara Osborn, rejecting a motion by the standby counsel who are tasked with assisting Hasan as he represents himself. \n\nThe attorneys argued Wednesday that Hasan is trying to help the prosecution achieve a death sentence. \n\nOsborn's decision sparked a bitter fight in a trial focused on charges that Hasan shot and killed 13 people and wounded 32 in the November 2009 rampage at the Army installation near Killeen, Texas.", "text": "\"We believe your order is causing us to violate our professional ethics. It's morally repugnant to us as defense counsel,\" said Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, head of Hasan's legal team. \n\nHe asked for a stay on her order, which would prevent it from going into effect. The judge then asked for a written document from the state bar establishing that continuing to work with Hasan would be an ethical violation. \n\n\"I will make it easy for you. I've given you an order ... and that relieves you of every ethical liability,\" Osborn said. \n\nPoppe would have nothing of it, his voice raised in obvious frustration. \n\n\"The order does not relieve us of the responsibility. ... We believe we are doing something that is morally repugnant. This is not about saving my license ... this is about what you are requiring me to do today: assist this man in achieving the goal, which we believe is achieving a death sentence. \"\n\nThe lead prosecutor chimed in, questioning the defense team's claims, saying that Hasan is mounting a legitimate defense. \n\n\"The government sees only two defenses: either 'I didn't do it,' or 'I did it, with an excuse.' He was caught with a gun in his hand,\" said Col. Michael Mulligan. \n\n\"I don't understand how that's repugnant to defense counsel -- I'm truly perplexed. \"\n\nIn a military capital trial, a guilty plea is not an option. Hasan's official plea is that he is not guilty of the charges. But on Tuesday, Hasan used his opening statement to declare \"I am the shooter. \"\n\nAfter the standby counsel argued Wednesday that Hasan was seeking the death penalty, Hasan objected, calling it \"a twist of the facts.\" But he refused to submit his objection in writing, a move that Osborn requested to avoid revealing privileged information in open court. \n\nThe defense attorneys Thursday immediately appealed Osborn's ruling. But she gave no stay in the meantime. \"We're going to move forward,\" the judge said, allowing the trial to continue unless a higher military court weighs in. \n\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling to the stand soldiers who were witnesses of Hasan's shooting spree. \n\nThe attorneys' request Wednesday halted what would have been the second day of testimony. \n\nAlthough Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, was granted his request to represent himself, Osborn ruled before the court-martial began that defense lawyers would act as standby counsel during the proceedings. \n\nExpert: Judge can't let attorneys stop\n\nGeoffrey Corn, a military justice expert at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, said the defense lawyers are in \"a terrible predicament. \"\n\n\"They have to stand by and watch the person they are ostensibly charged with assisting to represent himself essentially put a noose around his own neck, and they view this as fundamentally inconsistent with their ethical obligation as lawyers,\" he said. \n\nBut Corn said Hasan not only has the right to defend himself, \"he has the right to do it poorly\" -- even to the point of asking for death. \n\n\"The defense lawyers would love to get off this case, because it becomes unbearable,\" Corn said. \"If you imagine having to sit there, being an ardent opponent of capital punishment, watching this guy seal his own fate with every move he makes, it must be torture. But the judge can't let them off the case. \"\n\nMilitary death row: More than 50 years and no executions\n\nWitnesses describe horror of shooting\n\nHasan, an Army psychiatrist, was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage. He listened impassively as one of the first witnesses recounted the horror unleashed that November day at a processing center for soldiers heading to Afghanistan and Iraq. \n\nStaff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford stared hard at Hasan, appearing to brace for a cross-examination from the man who had admitted to shooting him seven times. But Hasan just stared back. \n\nThe courtroom turned silent as Lunsford was called as a witness. He was the first of several survivors scheduled to testify against Hasan. \n\nLunsford recounted how the gunman rose from a chair in the processing center, shouted \"Allahu Akbar,\" pulled out a pistol and began shooting. \n\n\"It was a state of panic,\" Lunsford said. \n\nLunsford, a health care specialist, described how his friend and colleague, physician's assistant Michael Cahill, tried to hit Hasan with a chair to stop the shooting; Hasan shot him dead. Soldiers tried to flee or take cover inside the processing center as Hasan fired dozens of shots. \n\nAs Lunsford was checking behind him, \"Major Hasan is turning the weapon on me,\" he said. \"He has a laser on his weapon and it goes across my line of sight and I blink. In that time, he discharges his weapon. The first round, I'm hit in the head. \"\n\nA second shot caught Lunsford in the back. He decided to play dead for a while before changing his mind and deciding to run for the door. He made it out of the building but was shot five more times outside, he testified. \n\nHasan continued shooting at Lunsford even as he was receiving first aid outside the processing center, before police arrived. Officers shot and wounded Hasan, ending the rampage and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. \n\nAfter the prosecution finished questioning Lunsford, the judge asked Hasan whether he had any questions for the witness. \n\n\"I have no questions,\" Hasan said. \n\nHasan also declined to question Michelle Harper, who worked at the deployment center and was inside when the shooting began. Prosecutors played a recording of her 911 call, where she pleaded for help. \n\nScheduled to go to Afghanistan\n\nHasan had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings. Prosecutors hope to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a \"progressive radicalization,\" giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime. \n\nHasan did not want to deploy to fight against other Muslims and believed \"that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,\" said Col. Michael Mulligan, the lead prosecutor in the case. \n\nInvestigators found 146 spent shell casings in the room where the attack began, Mulligan said. Hasan carried two laser-sighted pistols and 420 rounds of ammunition, his pockets lined with paper towels to muffle the sounds of the magazines banging together, he said. \n\nInternet searches on Hasan's computer used keywords like \"terrorist killing,\" \"innocent,\" \"Quran,\" \"fatwas\" and \"suicide bombings,\" Mulligan said. \n\nHasan told the panel in his opening statement, \"We mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion.\" But, he added, \"I apologize for the mistakes I made in this endeavor. \"\n\nThe mujahedeen consider themselves warriors who defend the Islamic faith. \n\nWitness: 'His punishment will come'\n\nHasan told his family he had been taunted after the al Qaeda attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American radical cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011. \n\nThe case was first set to begin in March 2012, but was delayed repeatedly, notably over a previous judge's unsuccessful demand that the beard Hasan has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved. \n\nJosh Rubin reported from Fort Hood.

According to the bureau, according to the file, he is an informant,\" Fitzpatrick, who spent more than 20 years with the FBI, said before a federal jury in Boston on Monday. He ultimately recommended that Bulger's file be closed. \n\nOn cross-examination, prosecution attorney Brian Kelly asked Fitzpatrick rhetorically, \"You wouldn't go to close a window if it wasn't open right?\"\n\nMuch of Bulger's trial has been focused on whether he was an open informant for the FBI in Boston for two decades during the time prosecutors say he reigned over crime in South Boston, participating in 19 murders, racketeering, extortion and money laundering -- all of which he has been charged with. \n\nThe prosecution previously introduced a 700-page document that suggests Bulger was an informant. That assertion has been the crux of the prosecution's case, which wrapped up Friday. \n\nThe defense argues that Bulger had FBI agents on his payroll to protect him from wiretaps and indictments, but he never fed any information to the FBI. \n\nDefense attorney Hank Brennan's line of questioning indicated that Bulger's counsel is attempting to shift the pendulum, and put the FBI on trial for corruption. \n\nThe defense called Fitzpatrick, 73, to testify about being called in 1981 to \"stop the leaking in Boston. \"\n\n\"Inside and outside FBI,\" there was a \"leaking of information, causing lots of investigations to go south,\" Fitzpatrick said. He was assistant special agent in charge, head of the drug task force and white collar crime section of the FBI in Boston. Describing himself as a whistle-blower, he detailed instances when he tried to report leaks and corruption within the FBI in Boston. \n\nIn one instance, Fitzpatrick testified, the FBI and government strike force attorneys were resisting his efforts to get an FBI informant into the witness protection program. \n\n\"I was getting the impression that people were stonewalling our trying to get Halloran out of harm's way,\" Fitzpatrick said Monday. Brian Halloran, one of Bulger's former associates, agreed to cooperate with the FBI and implicate Bulger in the murder of a wealthy Oklahoma businessman. Two days after Fitzpatrick complained to his superiors that not enough was being done to put the man in witness protection, Halloran was shot to death, along with a friend, Michael Donahue, who was driving him home. \n\nBulger's \"surrogate son\" and former associate, Kevin Weeks, testified earlier in the trial that \"Jim Bulger just kept shooting,\" describing Halloran's writhing, bullet-ridden body as \"bouncing off the ground.\" Bulger was tipped off by his rogue FBI informant handler that Halloran was cooperating with the FBI, according to testimony from disgraced FBI agents. \n\nFitzpatrick contends he was ultimately forced to resign from his post in Boston because he was being retaliated against after reporting to headquarters that his boss was leaking information about grand jury testimony. \n\n\"The reason I left the FBI is because it was corrupt at that level,\" he said. \n\nOn cross-examination, sparks flew as prosecuting attorney Brian Kelly asked Fitzpatrick immediately, \"It's fair to say you are a man who likes to make up stories? \"\n\nKelly argued that in Fitzpatrick's memoir \"Betrayal,\" the former agent falsely proclaims that he made the arrest of a mafia crime boss. Kelly produced the FBI report in court that made no mention of Fitzpatrick's name in the arrest report. \n\nFitzpatrick also contends in his book that he recovered the rifle used to shoot Martin Luther King Jr. Prosecutor Kelly brandished the 200-page report on the FBI's website documenting the MLK assassination, which does not make one mention of Fitzpatrick. \n\n\"Where's you?\" Kelly asked Fitzpatrick. \n\n\"I was on the scene when shot was taken,\" he said. \n\nTension between attorneys is mounting as the trial gets into its final weeks. Kelly used words as ammunition as he read passages from Fitzpatrick's memoir amid a fiery line of questions. Bulger's attorney, J.W. Carney, had to reinforce his partner Hank Brennan's objections at one point, adding, \"Apparently it takes two voices to get Mr. Kelly to stop talking. \"\n\nKelly got Fitzpatrick to admit that he was not working in the FBI during the time the government began to make its case against Bulger, and said aloud to a very attentive jury, \"you have nothing to do with the charges that bring us here today. \"\n\nFitzpatrick is still in legal battles for his pension, which he lost as a result of being forced to resign five years early. \n\nOn why he titled his book \"Betrayal,\" he said, \"I felt betrayed. \n\n\"I think the government felt betrayed. \n\n\"The FBI was betrayed. \n\n\"The Justice Department was betrayed. \n\n\"There was a lot of betrayal going on. \"\n\nThe defense plans to call at least 11 more witnesses, but the attorneys indicated that is subject to change. \n\nAlso Monday, Judge Denise Casper heard arguments on a defense motion to sequester the jury. Kelly said that it was \"not necessary\" to suggest this to the jury \"at the 11th hour. \"\n\nCarney replied that there has \"never been a more widely publicized or sensational case in this district,\" harkening to saturated media coverage and \"statements that are so hyperbolic and prejudicial towards the defendant ... unlike anything anyone has seen. \"\n\nCasper has not yet ruled on the motion\n\nFitzpatrick said he met with Bulger only one time to evaluate him as an informant, and Bulger did not give him any valuable information. He added that the only information he ever gleaned from Bulger came from his FBI file, which was written by Bulger's rogue FBI informant handlers, John Morris and John Connolly. \n\nConnolly is serving time for leaking sensitive information that cost two cooperating witnesses their lives at Bulger's hands. Morris was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony in 1998 in which he confirmed FBI misconduct. \n\nMorris, who reviewed all informant matters at the time, drove Fitzpatrick to a meeting with Bulger in January of 1981. Fitzpatrick said Morris was \"pumping him (Bulger) up\" to Fitzpatrick, saying that Bulger was a \"great guy.\"\n\nMorris previously testified he accepted more than $7,000 in cash and gifts from Bulger. \n\nFitzpatrick said that when he met Bulger in a dark corridor in Quincy, Massachusetts, Bulger was wearing a baseball cap -- \"Boston of course\" -- and sunglasses. Bulger would not shake Fitzpatrick's hand, he said. \"That's not a really nice way to start a conversation. \"\n\n\"Most informants are really trying to help,\" he said. \"They are trying to do the job. I didn't get that from him at first.\" \n\nSo Fitzpatrick asked him, \"What are you doing for me? \"\n\nDuring a 30-minute conversation, Fitzpatrick said, Bulger never once gave him any valuable information. \"Basically, he was not giving me info I was trying to get. ... He was not responsive to what I was out there to get. \"\n\nBulger \"said he was leader of the gang, top guy. That resonated with me because, you know in the FBI, you can't have the head of the gang as an informant, because then you are validating the gang, you are a part of the management, if you will,\" he said. \n\nFitzpatrick said Bulger told him he would never testify, which is rare for an informant. \n\n\"At one point, he (Bulger) even said, 'I am not an informant.' At that point I made a mental reservation ... 'what am I doing here, what's going on here?'\"\n\nThen Fitzpatrick, who thought this was a private meeting, was \"shocked\" to see Connolly, Bulger's rogue FBI informant handler, who \"popped up\" out of nowhere at the meeting, which Fitzpatrick said he was not entitled to attend. \n\nConnolly served time on federal racketeering charges and is now in state prison serving 40 years on related murder charges stemming from his relationship with Bulger. He tipped off Bulger and his crew that an associate, Halloran, was cooperating with the FBI and implicating Bulger in the Oklahoma businessman's murder. \n\nUltimately, Fitzpatrick recommended Bulger be closed as an informant.

US and allied vehicles being destroyed in Iraq and Afghanistan by IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices); video cameras slaved to the sights of Dragunov sniper rifles blasting the heads off GIs and then murdering those who came to their assistance; suicide bombers driving explosive-laden trucks through fences and into buildings or crowds immediately followed by massive explosions. Sometimes such scenes would carry sub-titles giving the date and location of the horror. In other instances, there would be clips of the happy, excited suicide bomber explaining his joy at the prospect of martyring himself for such a noble purpose. \n\nPower struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants\n\nThere would also be clips of their \"Great Emir\", Bin Laden, uttering in his quiet and reasonable sounding voice his latest threats to tear the heart out of the degenerate West. Then some stocky, heavily bearded, white robed and turbaned American, who we were told was Adam Gadahn, a Jewish Californian convert to Islam and Al Qaeda, made his first of many appearances. Gadahn was ridiculing -- in English, with Arabic sub-titles -- the American President and issuing dire warnings aimed at US audiences of the disasters that would befall America if the USA and her allies did not quit \"Muslim lands\". \n\nRead more: Algeria crisis is a wakeup call for America\n\nWhile Bin Laden was lionized by the young men around us, the star of each show was the brash, in-our-face (and happily defunct) Abou Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian who was the former leader of the Iraqi franchise of Al Qaeda. Zarqawi had walked their talk regarding cleansing \"Muslim lands\" of the presence of infidels with passion, utter ruthlessness and without compromise. He was their man of action. He did, in their view, what others merely talked and fantasized about. The scene the young ones loved best on what we came to call \"TV Night\", was Zarqawi standing, legs planted wide, with a fierce and vicious open-mouthed grin on his face, firing the entire 100 round magazine of a SAW (a Belgian light machinegun), just past the camera with the sound jacked way up. We could almost hear his scream of whatever the Arabic equivalent is of \"GET SOME!\"\n\nRead more: Algeria hostage crisis may be future of terrorism\n\nEach time an episode of mayhem and destruction would occur on the screen, the crowd pressing around Louis and me would shout, \"Allahu Akbar\" and immediately swivel their eyes to watch how we were enjoying the show. Without my glasses, I could read none of the signs or sub-titles, so Louis would read them out loud until I quietly asked him to stop. The video did not need a great deal of interpretation. \n\nObviously, these propaganda videos were intended to pump up the boys, to remind them that they were part of a large global cause in which sacrifice was a major element. And it was having the desired impact; particularly for the younger mujahideen whose eyes glistened with excitement as they watched the Western infidels being butchered and humiliated over and over again. The senior members of the Group were less caught up in the show and the laptop operator was choosing the clips to be displayed with some care. I could only imagine what he was skipping and I did not for a moment presume that they were being avoided out of generosity but rather cold, hard pragmatism. They did not want to break their hostages, at least, not yet. \n\nIn many ways, both for the assembled Belmokhtar Group of AQIM, and for me, the scenes that elicited the strongest emotion were the all-too-familiar images of black-hooded, orange-clad figures, chained hand and foot, shuffling around those tiny cages in Guantanamo. These were indignities perpetrated by my side -- the 'good guys'. Those scenes of German Shepherds, fangs bared, straining to get at broken men cowering in corners and those piles of horrified naked bodies forced into obscene intimacy and, always, the iconic black-hooded figure, mutely perched barefoot on a box in a short black poncho with wires dangling from his outstretched fingers in the disgraceful Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, made me, in the midst of my own mental anguish, feel deep shame. \n\nThe leaden and menacing stares of our Al Qaeda captors eloquently made a mockery of our aggressive Western claims to harbour higher or superior values. The look on their faces declared that we had abandoned any alleged moral high-ground, which they, at least for the moment, sought to occupy with regard to their treatment of Louis and me, if only to demonstrate to themselves their own moral superiority. \n\nIt is therefore at least paradoxical that those wretched videotapes and photos of Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib may have resulted in Louis' and my captivity being less violent than it otherwise might have been, for it seemed to me that we were spared worse treatment because our abductors were anxious to demonstrate that they didn't stoop to such stuff, which, of course, we know is not generally the case. That particular myth, however, with that particular Group of AQIM hostage-takers, probably served us well. \n\nThus, I found that the most appalling of those TV Night videos images were not the mass murders and individual assassinations perpetrated by Al Qaeda and their allies against our soldiers and civilians, which were never easy to behold, but less difficult to understand. That was simply Al Qaeda being Al Qaeda. That was what they were. Rather, it was the intimate and almost palpable proof of our side's methodically applied, officially sanctioned, and so casually administered barbarity, that had been parsed into the bureaucratic banalities and legal niceties of officially sanctioned abuse and torture which was so hard to absorb. Viewing such scenes, I could not help but believe that if we were capable of such outrages and so carelessly willing to resort to torture-as-entertainment, then we had indeed strayed into truly dangerous ethical territory. \n\nThe ease with which faux-legal language was coined in Washington and unopposed throughout the West in a cursory attempt to legitimize the illegitimate; the arbitrary manner in which long-standing international conventions were set aside; and the glibness with which word-games and were employed to condone such practices, should have stunned us all. The methodical development of \"black sites\" and concepts like \"extraordinary rendition\" (sub-contracting torture) and \"enhanced interrogation\"; the invention of ersatz juridical explanations of why was not torture, and other such despicable behaviour, indeed made a mockery of our Western pretensions to be champions of human rights and international justice. Further, without a shred of doubt, they have massively increased recruitment to the Islamist cause and markedly amplified the threat against Western interests and the security of individual Americans and their friends and allies. \n\nIf the dreadful events of 11 September 2001 could so easily dismantle the bulwarks of free, just and open societies which had taken us centuries to build, then, yes, our claims to a higher moral standard were in fact a sham, and surely there were no effective limits to what we were prepared to visit upon our enemies, or merely anybody who got in our way. \n\nNo, these were not made-in-Canada practices, justifications and facilities, but how easily we in our country and our friends throughout Europe abandoned our much-vaunted principles and meekly, often enthusiastically, went along. The bulk of our usually vocal human rights advocates and politicians were muted or stunned into silence when the need to avenge the insult and atrocity of 9/11 was allowed to pervert the law and sully the reputation of our friends and neighbours; perversions which have done and continue to do the West incalculable harm throughout the world. We are clearly guilty by such association. And Louis and I were reaping the consequences. \n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert R.

It will cost them their benefits.

In addition, the president wants Congress to take steps to better screen people with mental illnesses, so they cannot obtain weapons. \n\nLegislation proposed so far also would crack down on so-called straw purchases, in which a legal buyer purchases weapons for distribution to non-legal buyers. \n\nThe NRA and other opponents argue the Democratic proposals are veiled attempts to limit gun ownership and eventually take away weapons, and therefore violate the constitutional right to bear arms. \n\nIn particular, opponents contend the proposed ban on semi-automatic rifles focuses on a weapon used in a tiny percentage of killings and other gun violence. \n\nOpinion: Chicago's violence took my dad, friends\n\nHarold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, confirmed on Friday that so-called assault weapons targeted by the proposed ban account for a small fraction of murders in the United States. \n\nHowever, Pollack said the ban proposed by Obama can help reduce gun violence, especially what he called the psychologically impactful mass shootings such as the Newtown attack in which a lone gunman used a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle. \n\nThe combination of such weapons with high-capacity magazines \"facilitates mass homicides,\" Pollack told CNN, noting that professional criminals generally don't use such rifles that look like military weapons. \n\n\"The people who do use these weapons are often the most dangerous or most sociopathic,\" Pollack said. The Newtown shooter, a 20-year-old man living with his mother, took her legally owned guns and killed her before going to the school to open fire on students and teachers. \n\nNew player in gun control ad wars\n\nTo Pollack, such a mass killing -- while relatively rare -- \"traumatizes communities and the entire society in a way that demands attention. \"\n\nStudies show that street crime such as shooting deaths cost communities more than lives, Pollack said, citing emergency medical services and criminal investigation as tangible costs along with intangibles such as residents moving away to escape the threat. \n\nObama also made that point in his remarks on Friday, saying \"it's very hard to develop economically if people don't feel safe. \"\n\nIn the aftermath of the Newtown shootings, the NRA called for putting armed guards at every school, rather than seeking to limit the ability of people to obtain weapons. It also wants tougher enforcement of existing gun laws, which Pollack agreed was necessary. \n\n\"A lot of the underground gun market could be stopped if we treated guns with the same amount of determination and tools as the drug market,\" he said. \n\nFor example, Pollack noted how committing a crime with a gun brought additional charges, and he called for similar treatment for illegally possessing a firearm. \n\nHow we talk about guns in my Chicago classroom\n\nIn a Google Hangout online chat on Thursday, a participant asked Obama how renewing the assault weapons ban would help reduce gun violence caused primarily by handguns. \n\nHe responded that his proposed package would affect handgun violence through the expanded background checks and cracking down on straw purchases. Renewing the weapons ban focused on what Obama called \"weapons of war. \"\n\n\"It's not going to solve every problem,\" the president continued, noting that some restrictions are already in place. \n\n\"We can't purchase a grenade launcher from a store, although there may be some folks who want to buy those,\" he said. \"And the reason is we think on balance, the Second Amendment does not automatically assume that any weapon that's available you can automatically purchase.\" \n\nNRA: Obama's State of the Union shows true colors on gun violence\n\nCNN's Ashley Killough, Paul Steinhauser and Halimah Abdullah contributed to this report."}, "2013-romney-russia-detroit_974_en.txt": {"title": "If Mitt Romney were to write a bumper sticker slogan for the past month, it would probably be, \"Detroit DID go bankrupt.

Carol Anne Bond was given a long prison sentence in the federal system after being convicted of violating an international agreement on the use of chemical weapons. She would have gotten a much shorter sentence under state law. \n\nThe case of toxic love has soap-opera elements, but Bond's lawyers argued she was being treated like a foreign terrorist instead of someone caught up in a domestic dispute. \n\nBeyond this fact-specific dispute, the case touches on larger concerns about the strength and purpose of the Constitution's 10th Amendment, designed to preserve state power.", "text": "It is also a question roiling the current political debate, especially among tea party conservatives in this post-9/11, security-conscious environment. \n\nThe justices are using this case to explore the limits of congressional and presidential authority, with timely, far-reaching implications. \n\n\"It would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much energy criticizing Syria,\" for its government's alleged use of chemical weapons in an ongoing civil war, said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, \"when if this court were now to declare that our joining or creating legislation to implement the treaty was unconstitutional.

As a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case: \"Bond was excited when her closest friend, Myrlinda Haynes, announced she was pregnant. Bond's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband, Clifford Bond, was the child's father. She vowed revenge. \"\n\nThe woman, known to her family as Betty, struck back by stealing dangerous a chemical -- arsenic-based 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine -- from her company. She also obtained potassium dichromate over the Internet. Both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic, even lethal harm with very little physical contact. \n\nThe 42-year-old then tried to poison Haynes some two dozen times over several months, secretly sprinkling small amounts of the chemicals on an apartment doorknob, car door handles, and a mailbox. \n\nWhile suffering no more than a chemical burn on her thumb, Haynes grew suspicious -- one of the chemicals was a bright orange powder. After getting little help from local police, in 2007 she called postal inspectors, who set up surveillance cameras. Bond was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and a car muffler, court records show. She was soon arrested. \n\nBond admitted her guilt early on and claimed she never meant to kill Haynes, but only wanted to cause her \"an uncomfortable rash.\" The defendant also said her friend's betrayal caused an \"emotional breakdown\" that made her respond in such a shocking fashion. \n\nInstead of being charged with simple assault, which may have gotten her six months to a year or two in state prison, Bond was indicted in federal court on two counts of mail fraud and -- the bombshell -- two counts of violating a federal law and international treaty on the possession and use of \"chemical weapons. \"\n\nWhen a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court, Bond pleaded guilty and immediately appealed. She received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $12,000 in fines and restitution. She was released in August 2012. \n\nDid Utah doctor kill his wife? \n\nDuring Tuesday's lively hour of arguments, Bond's lawyer, Paul Clement, called the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act an \"odd statute\" that clearly exceeds congressional authority. He said the treaty was designed to deal with \"warlike\" behavior, not \"ordinary\" poisoning cases. \n\n\"I don't think that nation-states poison romantic rivals, attempt to commit suicide, or try to get rodents out of their houses\" using chemicals that might have everyday non-criminal uses, he said, like vinegar. \n\nJustice Elena Kagan was unconvinced. \"You are imagining a world in which judges day-to-day try to get inside the head of treaty makers,\" where judges might say: \"We understand that there's a national interest in regulating sarin gas, but we don't think that there's a sufficient interest in regulating some other chemical down the line. It seems to me a completely indeterminate test\" for judges to delineate \"what is in the national and international interest. \"\n\nSolicitor General Donald Verrilli agreed, defending the treaty and law by saying, \"There can't be a 'too local' exception to the treaty power. \"\n\nThe Justice Department says federal law broadly prohibits a person from knowingly using a chemical weapon in a way that can \"cause death, temporary incapacitation, or permanent harm\" to another person, which prosecutors said Bond admittedly did. \n\nVerrilli dismissed a \"parade of horribles\"-- hypothetical suggestions that a sweeping treaty could be authorized giving the federal government complete police power over the states. \n\n\"It seems unimaginable that a convention of that kind would be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate, which it would have to be,\" he said. \n\n\"It also seems unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution,\" against Bond, said Justice Anthony Kennedy. \"But let's leave it at that.\" The remark brought laughter in the courtroom, but Kennedy clearly was not joking. \n\nTest your knowledge of the U.S. Supreme Court\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia used the issue to delve into another controversial issue. \n\n\"Let's assume that an international treaty is approved by two-thirds of the Senate and the President, which requires states to approve same-sex marriage. All right?\" he said. \"Now, if that were a self-executing treaty, same sex marriage would have to be approved by every state. If it is not self-executing, however, it will be up to Congress to produce that result, and Congress would do it by having a federal marriage law. \"\n\nThe conservative Scalia said to do so would be \"dragging the Congress into areas where it has never been before. \"\n\n\"If you told ordinary people that you were going to prosecute Ms. Bond for using a chemical weapon, they would be flabbergasted,\" said Justice Samuel Alito. \"This statute has an enormous breadth -- anything that can cause death or injury to a person or an animal. Would it shock you if I told you that a few days ago my wife and I distributed toxic chemicals to a great number of children? On Halloween we gave them chocolate bars. Chocolate is poison to dogs, so it's a toxic chemical under the chemical weapons convention.\" Again there was audience laughter, but no smiles from the bench. \n\nJustice Stephen Breyer also worried about the scope of federal power. \n\n\"In principle your position constitutionally would allow the President and the Senate, not the House, to do anything through a treaty that is not specifically within the prohibitions of the rights protections of the Constitution,\" he told Verrilli, citing a 1920 high court precedent giving Congress the power to enact treaties, even if it steps outside its traditional constitutional authority by usurping state laws. \"And I doubt that in that document the Framers (of the Constitution) intended to allow the President and the Senate to do anything.\" \n\n\"I am worried about that and I think others are, too,\" the left-leaning Breyer added. \n\nAmong those attending the arguments was former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. \n\nJustices prepare for hot-button cases - and hot internal rhetoric\n\nThere are about a thousand treaties signed by the United States currently on the books. \n\nMany academics and lawmakers hope the majority right-leaning bench will use this opportunity to delve further into the scope of the 10th Amendment, which states, \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. \"\n\nIn the broader political context, a bipartisan sphere of Americans worry the federal government and Congress have been overly aggressive in staking claims to disputes they believe are best left to states, especially in the criminal arena. \n\nAnd it is not just felonies. Areas like gun ownership, zoning laws, environmental regulations, taxation, health care, and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of this high court decision. \n\nSome of Bond's supporters argue that some federal prosecutions are novel and the penalties are often more harsh, creating conflict and confusion with local efforts to ensure public safety. They see Bond as an unexpected hero in the fight to return \"the power back to the people. \"\n\n\"The proposition that the Treaty Clause is a trump card that defeats all of the remaining structural limitations on the federal government is not a proposition that is logically defensible.\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said last week. \n\nBond had won an earlier Supreme Court appeal, with a unanimous ruling she had \"standing,\" or legal authority, to pursue her claims in the courts. That allowed her to continue trying to have her federal conviction tossed out, which is the current issue before the justices. \n\nHer lawyers say she had been trying in recent years to repair her shaken marriage, and has come to terms with her husband's betrayal. \n\nThe case is Bond v.

Harris, that nearly all the students at Harvard are indeed above average -- so much so that the median grade given is an A- and the most frequent grade awarded is an A!", "prompt": "What are we to make of the news? Well, first of all, this is not exactly news. Harvard and many elite colleges across the country have witnessed the creeping ivy of grade inflation for quite some time -- a situation that has just about eliminated failure as a possibility. \n\nIt makes one wonder why the school bothers giving grades at all. \n\nIn the mid-1970s, when I was a dean at Boston University, there were rumors that a certain professor was indiscriminately awarding a final grade of A to all his students.", "text": "That was unusual back then when most professors graded on the bell curve and only a handful of the best students received an A. Some actually failed and most received grades of B or C.\n\nBut in the case of this particular professor everybody got an A. As a test, I surreptitiously enrolled a fictitious student into the roster of his next class. This \"nobody\" never came to class, never wrote a term paper and never took an exam. At the end of the semester the mysterious student received an A.\n\nThat led to a discussion with the professor. In a tone of righteous indignation he claimed I had overstepped my bounds to play such a trick on him. With righteous indignation I claimed that he had underperformed as a professor by acting in a reckless manner, grading his students with careless abandonment. Steam came out of both our ears. I believed his actions were a mark of failure in academic responsibility. \n\nGrades serve several purposes. They are a tool that measures a student's progress in relation to others in a class; they allow financial aid and scholarship committees to assess merit; and they culminate in a 4-year overall performance record in the form of a college transcript. Academic strengths and weaknesses are discovered over a period of time. \n\nTo some extent Harvard's faculty have abandoned their responsibilities to their students as well as to those who wish to judge their students: Admission officers at law and medical school; faculty selecting graduates to mentor them for advanced degree programs; employers deciding between applicants for jobs. \n\nDecades ago, professors were often characterized by their students on the severity of their grading. Professor Smith is a tough grader -- no one gets an A. Or, Professor Jones is an easy grader -- no one fails. What can be said today? All the professors are easy marks as well as easy markers. \n\nWhy give everyone an A? When the admissions office puts together a freshman class full of high school valedictorians who have perfect grades and SAT scores, there is no doubt they are bringing capable students to the campus. But the power has shifted from the faculty to the students and a new form of entitlement on the part of students has developed. \n\nIf students are paying $55,000 a year, they may feel they have paid for the As in dollars as well as sense. Is there an unspoken academic transaction that is filtering into the university landscape now that tuition prices are in the stratosphere? Has higher education morphed into a consumer business in which the customer is always right? It seems like it. \n\nFirst, universities have to compete for students in the marketplace. Then faculties do the same after students enroll. Professors want to be popular. They want good ratings from students at the end of semester reviews just as the students want good grades from them. Gut courses, once the exception, have become more common. \n\nFaculty tenure, promotions and raises may turn on such matters right along with publications and other measures. University life, long a contact sport, has been upgraded to a blood sport. It's become a \"dog-eat-dog\" business in which departments try to fill quotas for majors. \n\nAnd then there are the parents who are quick to speak out if they think their sons or daughters are under appreciated. \n\nIs there a solution that can stop grade inflation? Yes, of course. \n\nIn 2004, Princeton readjusted their grading system instructing the faculty not give more than 35% of their undergraduate students A or A- grades, and apparently Yale is currently discussing a similar adjustment. Harvard faculty should construct a ladder that has a rung at the bottom, middle and top. \n\nLast week, I had the privilege to chair the Rhodes Scholarship selection committee for the D.C., Maryland, North Carolina district. We interviewed 13 semi-finalists and selected 2 award winners. All 13 were exceptional; the final decision came down to the splitting of hairs. Out of the 32 Rhodes Scholars named across the United States, Harvard students came away with 6, an impressive outcome however one slices the pie. Perhaps they are all A students. But now we know many Harvard students receive As. \n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Joel Trachtenberg."}, "2013-tsw-star-wars-comic_1070_en.txt": {"title": "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ...", "prompt": "An Empire has spread across the galaxy, and the few remaining Jedi defend themselves against the Sith.

But it's a fascinating part of movie history, no doubt. \n\nCNN spoke separately to J.W. Rinzler, who adapted Lucas' script for comics, and artist Mike Mayhew. \n\nCNN: What captured your interest when adapting this script? \n\nRinzler: It's so similar and yet so different at the same time. All the puzzle pieces are there but arranged to form a different picture. You've got Sith and Jedi, you've got a desert planet. You've got a planet with twin suns, an imperial city and a cloud city. When I read the rough draft, it had all those things which made me want to make it into a comic book. It's such a great story, George is a great storyteller. \n\nCNN: Was it difficult to illustrate this story from a script written nearly 40 years ago? \n\nMayhew: Not at all. I've been in comics 20 years, and when I read the rough draft, I thought, I can make a comic of this tomorrow. It was just a very well-written screenplay, and that's what a comic book script is. This is genuinely George's first complete screenplay story of this tale, and it's wildly different. \n\nYou can see why some of it was changed because there's no way they could have done it. It was just too ambitious. \n\nWhen you look at movies now like \"Avatar\" and \"The Avengers,\" it seems prophetic. Audiences expect all that action and set pieces, and one thing after another. I'm sure back then they looked at this and thought, \"What's this guy thinking?\"\n\nThe other interesting thing is you see the origins of the characters we know and love. Darth Vader is kind of a general, he's one of the main heavies but he's not a lord of the Sith. Here, Vader is really three characters: General Vader, this Lord of the Sith named Valorum, and this mechanical man. You think you know these characters and then you discover their truer origins. \n\nCNN: What do you think fans will take away from this book? \n\nRinzler: Based on early fan feedback from the first issue, they're really enjoying this alternate universe, and they're getting to read a story that's being told by George. Even through my adaptation, you feel his voice. You see many of the things you love in \"Star Wars\" but in a slightly different way. \n\nYou have the Tusken raider moment surging in front of the binoculars, except it's not a Tusken raider, it's a different character. Fans are saying they're reading it two or three times to take it all in. \n\nMayhew: This to me is the greatest \"what if\" story in comics. What if this made it to the screen? The mind reels at the possibilities. \n\nCNN: Is there one particular thing that is farthest away from the \"Star Wars\" we know and love? \n\nRinzler: Everyone seems to latch onto the fact that Han is a big green alien. That's pretty far! He doesn't have his own ship. His character is probably the most different, although he can already talk to Wookies. It's fascinating to see all this stuff starting out, in a way. \n\nWhat's really fun is that R2-D2 talks in this one. There's a couple of points where I felt like \"R2-D2 should say something here,\" and I added a line and that was really fun. \n\nMayhew: The characters in this story are much different than the characters in \"Star Wars.\" The relationships are a lot different and to me, more intense. Leia's story is a little more complicated, and she's more a part of the action. Annikin is more of a trained Jedi than Luke was. The older General Skywalker to me is so much cooler than Obi-Wan. This character is like Captain America, a bigger than life hero. \n\nCNN: Is there a possibility that this alternate version of \"Star Wars\" could live on beyond these eight issues, at least in the fans' minds? \n\nRinzler: Fans have been asking already about this, because so many things are hinted at particularly in the first issue, about the past, or characters in the periphery, or just spoken of and not seen. They'd love to see those mysteries explained, but we have a little movie called \"Episode VII\" coming up and that will take precedence. \n\n'Star Wars' cinematographer Gilbert Taylor dies at 99\n\nJ.J.

The Constitution therefore protects the choice of one's partner for all citizens, regardless of their sexual identity. \"\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by one gay and two lesbian couples in Utah who wish to marry but have been unable to do so because the Utah Constitution prohibits same-sex marriage. \n\nThe decision was greeted with joy from a spokesman for GLAAD, formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. \"At last, loving and committed couples in Utah will have the opportunity to celebrate marriage equality this holiday season,\" said Wilson Cruz in a posting on its website. \n\n\"We are seeing state leaders and more and more citizens recognize that loving and committed couples should not be legally kept apart,\" said Cruz. \"We look forward to seeing that momentum to continue in 2014. \"\n\nGov. Gary R. Herbert expressed disappointment at the ruling by Shelby, whom he called \"an activist federal judge.\" Herbert said he was working with his legal counsel and the acting attorney general \"to determine the best course to defend traditional marriage within the borders of Utah. \"\n\nA spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in a statement that it supports \"traditional marriage,\" while teaching that everyone should be treated with respect. \"This ruling by a district court will work its way through the judicial process,\" Eric Hawkins said. \n\n\"We continue to believe that voters in Utah did the right thing by providing clear direction in the state Constitution that marriage should be between a man and a woman and we are hopeful that this view will be validated by a higher court. \"\n\nThe president of the National Organization for Marriage, Brian Brown, called the ruling \"a travesty of justice. \"\n\nIn a statement, he added, \"This trend of vetoing the voters from the bench must be stopped. \"\n\nThat view was not shared by Clifford Rosky, chairman of the board of Equality Utah. \"We think it is a thoughtful and careful ruling that is based on the Supreme Court decision last summer and we expect that it will be upheld ultimately by the United States Supreme Court,\" he said. \n\nBy early Friday evening, Rosky told CNN he had signed as a witness to multiple marriages among same-sex couples. \n\nThough the state has already filed a notice of appeal, the state's lawyers did not file a motion for a stay  in district court, which allowed the marriages to begin at once. \"Why they didn't ask the district court for a stay is a mystery, to say the least,\" Rosky said. \n\n\"There are hundreds of people here -- it's past 5 o'clock and the clerk is not closing the door. \"\n\nSame-sex marriage is banned by constitutional amendment or state law in: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. \n\nBut it is legal in 17 other U.S states and the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. \n\nWorldwide, 16 other countries (and parts of Mexico) have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships. Most of these are in Europe and South America. \n\nCivil unions, which are legal in Colorado, grant couples most of the rights of state civil marriages, but provide none of the federal benefits of marriage, such as Social Security benefits. \n\nThese rights include spousal support, medical decision-making privileges, access to a partner's insurance, and hospital visitation rights. \n\nThough the U.S. Supreme Court has signaled that it is reluctant to issue a national opinion on the matter, lower courts and states have not been so reluctant, said Carl Tobias, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Richmond. \n\n\"I'm just struck by how quickly this is all moving,\" he said. \"It just seems like it's picking up steam in terms of challenges. \"\n\nHe attributed the change to a greater acceptance of gays and lesbians, especially among young people. \"They just don't see this as a great moral issue that needs to be something codified as a prohibition in the law,\" he said. \"Everybody knows gay people -- either in their families or friends or workplaces -- so what's the big deal? \"\n\nPresident Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage and defining marriage as \"a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife\" in 1996. \n\nLast June, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected parts of DOMA, in a 5-4 decision that dismissed an appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds and ruled same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits. \n\nOn Thursday, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled unanimously to allow same-sex marriage statewide and ordered county clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to qualified same-sex couples."}, "2014-bergen-sterman-terror-threat-report_954_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- On Sunday, ISIS released a new audio recording calling for Muslims to kill Americans and Europeans.

Each one of those deaths is a tragedy, but none of these attacks were national catastrophes as 9/11 was. \n\nWhile al Qaeda and its affiliates have failed to conduct any successful attacks in the United States since 9/11, they have sought to encourage action from militant American citizens, who might be more capable of carrying out terrorist operations in the States than foreign operatives given the stringent security measures now in place. \n\nUnfortunately, this strategy of promoting homegrown extremism has demonstrated some successes, such as Maj. Nidal Hasan's killing of 13 people at the Fort Hood, Texas, military base in 2009 and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, which authorities have said were carried out by Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. \n\nAll of these were inspired by the propaganda of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American cleric killed in a 2011 U.S. drone strike in Yemen after he took up an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. \n\nAccording to the New America Foundation's research, an astonishing quarter of the 247 jihadist extremists charged since 9/11 either possessed copies of al-Awlaki's propaganda materials, cited him as an influence or were in communication with him. \n\nThe influence of al-Awlaki and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's English-language magazine Inspire has persisted even after al-Awlaki's death. \n\nWorrisomely, around 100 Americans have traveled to fight in Syria with opposition groups, including with ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front. \n\nSo far, nine Americans have been charged with attempting to support or supporting ISIS or Nusra, according to a count by New America. \n\nIn addition, at least two Americans have died fighting with these groups: Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, who committed a suicide bombing in Syria for Nusra Front, and Douglas McCain, who died fighting with ISIS. \n\nThe difficulty al Qaeda and similar groups have had in inspiring Americans to conduct attacks at home is due to the strength of systemic security checks, such as the willingness of Muslim communities to report potential terrorist activity. A third of the extremists charged since 2001 were implicated by tips from family or local community members, according to an analysis by New America. \n\nOf the 51 plots to conduct an attack inside the United States since 9/11, nearly half were initiated while the suspects were under surveillance by informants, according to a count by New America. \n\nThe role that the Muslim community has played as well as aggressive law enforcement efforts using informants have both helped to make the United States a hard target for militants. \n\nAdd to these factors other measures taken since 9/11; the day that al Qaeda's hijackers attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, there were only 16 people on the U.S. no-fly list. Today, there are more than 40,000. \n\nIn 2001, there were 32 Joint Terrorism Task Force \"fusion centers,\" where multiple law enforcement agencies work together to chase down leads and build terrorism cases. Now there are 103. \n\nBefore 9/11, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Counterterrorism Center, Transportation Security Administration, Northern Command and Cyber Command didn't exist. In 2014, all of these new institutions make it much harder for terrorists to operate in the United States. \n\nThe U.S. intelligence budget also grew dramatically after 9/11, with Congress giving the government substantial resources with which to improve its counterterrorism capabilities. In 2013, the United States allocated $72 billion to intelligence collection and other covert activities. Before 9/11, the budget was around a third of that figure: $26 billion. \n\nIn addition, greater public awareness of the danger posed by terrorism has also made the United States a much harder target.

Such massive usage, billions of doses, has been going on year after year.", "prompt": "We have few clues about the consequences of our cumulative exposures. We do know that widespread antibiotic treatments make us more susceptible to invaders by selecting for resistant bacteria. \n\nThese risks are now well-known, but I want to lay out a new concern: that antibiotic use over the years has been depleting the pool of our friendly bacteria -- in each of us -- and this is lowering our resistance to infections. In today's hyperconnected globe, that means that we are at high risk of future plagues that could spread without natural boundaries from person to person and that we could not stop.", "text": "I call this \"antibiotic winter. \"\n\nTo explain: In the early 1950's, scientists conducted experiments to determine whether our resident microbes -- the huge number of bacteria that live in and on our bodies, now called our \"microbiome\" -- help in fending off invading bacteria. They fed mice a species of a typical invader, disease-causing salmonella. It took about 100,000 organisms to infect half of the normal mice. But when they first gave mice an antibiotic, which kills both good and bad bacteria, and then several days later gave them salmonella, it took only three organisms to infect them. This isn't a 10 or 20% difference; it's  a 30,000-fold difference. \n\nThat was in mice, but what about humans? In 1985, Chicago faced a massive outbreak of salmonella. At least 160,000 people became ill and several died from drinking contaminated milk. The health department asked victims of the outbreak and unaffected persons, \"Have you received antibiotics in the month prior to becoming ill?\" People who said yes were five times more likely to become ill than those who drank the milk but hadn't recently received antibiotics. \n\nPeople carry a small number of highly abundant bacterial species and a large number of much less common ones. For example, you may carry trillions of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in your colon and only a thousand cells, or fewer, belonging to many other species. We are not sure how many rare species any of us has. If you had only 50 cells of a particular type, it would be difficult to detect them against the background of trillions of others. \n\nWhen you take a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which is the kind most commonly prescribed, it may be that rare microbes occasionally get wiped out entirely. And once the population hits zero, there is no bouncing back. For your body, that species is now extinct. My worry is that some of these critical residential organisms -- what I consider \"contingency\" species -- may disappear altogether. \n\nWhy might it matter? Those puny species may not be so inconsequential. Microbes multiply. Any small population of, say, 50 cells can explode into a billion or more in one week. The trigger for their massive bloom could be a food you've eaten for the first time, which only they have the enzymes to digest. In the presence of this food, the rare microbe goes into overdrive, doubling every 12 or 20 minutes, multiplying by a million percent or more. \n\nThis could be good for you because some of the energy captured by these digesting microbes might end up in your bloodstream. When food is in short supply, as has been the case for most of human existence, and people need to eat unfamiliar plants or animals, it is useful to have a repertoire of enzymes that help us process a wide variety of nutrients. The genes of our flexible partners, our resident microbes, provide those enzymes. \n\nNow consider the consequences if one of your rare microbes -- an ancient one that has been dwelling in Homo sapiens for 200,000 years -- went extinct. One possibility is that it doesn't matter. Perhaps that microbe was a marginal player -- good riddance. Another possibility: It's a \"contingency\" organism,  useful -- crucial -- when we need it for protection. \n\nWhen a new influenza epidemic arose in Mexico in 2009, people in California and Texas soon fell ill, and then flu appeared in New York a few days later. After a few weeks, this flu spread throughout the world. Considering the numbers of people infected, we were lucky that it was not a highly lethal strain.  Yet thousands of people all over the world did die. Even when a strain is not that virulent, when hundreds of millions of people are infected, deaths add up. And when the strain is worse, the deaths climb into the millions. \n\nOur world has gotten smaller. We have much greater global access to one another -- at the very moment in our history when our ancient microbial defenses are degrading. This makes us vulnerable to microbial invaders and provides fuel for disease conflagrations, with consequences scarcely imaginable. \n\nPlagues are inevitable wherever people congregate. With a global population of 7 billion, rising by 80 million annually, the question is not whether another big plague will come, but when it will happen, what will cause it, and who will be affected. In 1918-19, influenza killed tens of millions, in an era without airplanes and with much less mass transit to spread it. With a huge world population that is essentially contiguous, and with so many people with weakened defenses, we are vulnerable as never before. \n\nI see many parallels between our changing climate and our changing microbiome. The modern epidemics -- asthma and allergic disorders, obesity, and metabolic disorders -- are not only diseases, they are external signs of change within.  But they also indicate a deeper imbalance, the loss of our reserves. \n\nOur diverse microbes, with their millions of genes helping us resist disease, are the guerrilla warriors defending the home domain -- as long as we protect them. But recent studies suggest that otherwise normal people already have lost 15% to 40% of their microbial diversity and the genes that accompany it. \n\nThis is the greatest danger before us -- invaders causing an epidemic against which we are helpless.  Unless we change our ways, we do indeed face an \"antibiotic winter. \"\n\nWe must end the assault on our microbes, by cutting antibiotic use and also such elective practices as unnecessary cesarean sections that bypass the natural order of mothers passing on their bacteria to their babies. There are times when both of these are needed urgently, but we already know that we are overusing them. \n\nTechnology already provides important tools to improve doctors' judgments about when antibiotics are needed, but we must get them into the clinic. We also must develop new tools, like \"narrow-spectrum\" antibiotics that target only the invader and minimize collateral effects. \n\nWe must understand that every antibiotic course has a biological cost, and more precisely align possible benefit with the full costs. I predict that in the future we will routinely be giving children back their lost microbes, in early life to restore their patrimony and after the antibiotic courses that are truly necessary. \n\nJust as we have abused marvelous inventions like freon and the internal combustion engine, so too we have abused our \"wonder drugs.\" But the possible costs of these practices are our worst nightmare; we need to prepare, starting now."}, "2014-branding-nigeria-mastercard-backed-i-d-_1010_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- What does it mean to be Nigerian?

Given Nigeria has recently recently re-calculated it's 2013 GDP to a figure of $488 billion, making it Africa's biggest economy, that's certainly an amount the government is keen to keep a hold of. \n\nCard controversy\n\n But not everyone is happy with this pocket-sized one-stop-shop. Human Rights Activist Shehu Sani attacked the scheme on Facebook:\n\nWhile Eze Onyekpere, lead director at the non-governmental organisation Centre for Social Justice, said the collaboration was not appropriate. \"There should be difference between everyday credit or payment cards and an identity card issued by a sovereign authority,\" he says. \"Even if Mastercard was needed to ensure a good payment system, there is nothing that says it must be heavily embossed on the card. It could guarantee the card without necessarily getting this free advert from 170 million Nigerians. \"\n\nOnyekpere has also criticised the way the Nigerian government partnered with the international payments provider. \"The choice of Mastercard did not undergo a competitive selection process,\" he claims. \"It was clearly an abuse of Nigeria's public procurement process and the selection should have been open to all companies that can provide the service. \n\nA MasterCard spokesperson denied the payments company was turning the I.D. card project into a branding exercise. In an emailed statement the company said \"the brand mark is not MasterCard's corporate logo, nor is it an advertisement for the company. The MasterCard brand displayed on the card is what makes the electronic payment component of the eID card accepted as a means of payment.\"\n\nNIMC spokesperson Umar Abdulhamid rejected any allegation of foul play in partnering with MasterCard. \"It's a level playing field,\" he said In a phone interview. \"Other payment providers have been invited to get involved, but were apprehensive. \"\n\nAnd Daniel Monehin, president of MasterCard's Sub Saharan Africa division, joined Abdulhamid in dismissing this claim. In a phone interview he said that \"the collaboration went through all the highest levels of government.\"\n\nPrevious attempts\n\nThis is not the first time Nigerian authorities have tried to implement such a card. \n\nThe idea of a national identity card scheme for Nigeria was first initiated in 1978, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. But successive governments and coups meant the idea did not become a reality. \n\nMore recently, progress on the provision of identity cards for Nigerians took shape in early 2003, when some 60,000 centers were set up to register citizens. While the approach to take photographs and fingerprints sought to avoid fraud, an article on the U.N. refugee agency's website reports that irregularities in the roll-out of the I.D. cards meant that by 2008 the government was planning a new card. \n\nA month into this latest identity project there remains no fixed timetable for when the roll out of the initial 13 million cards will be completed. \n\nRead more: Africa's oil and gas: Boom or hype? \n\nRead more: In the driving seat of S.

He also has been subpoenaed, refused to answer questions from legislative investigators, and he's got a lawyer. \n\nFor his part, Christie has fired a top aide linked to what has metastasized into a political scandal coming on the heels of a successful re-election and prior to a possible White House bid. Others have left their jobs as the scandal unfolded, including Wildstein. \n\nFormer deputy chief of staff Bridget Ann Kelly, whose e-mail to Wildstein -- \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\" -- weeks before the gridlock occurred led to her firing by Christie in January, refused on Monday on constitutional grounds to comply with a state legislative subpoena to turn over documents, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN's Chris Frates. \n\nState lawmakers leading that investigation said they are reviewing the matter and \"considering our legal options with respect to enforcing the subpoena. \"\n\nChristie, in the radio interview, repeated what he said at a January news conference -- challenged by Wildstein in a letter written by his lawyer to the Port Authority on Friday -- about the timeline around when he became aware of the traffic mess. He also denied having any knowledge of a suggested political motive. \n\nWho's who in the bridge scandal\n\nChristie blasts Wildstein\n\n\"The first time that this really came into my consciousness, as an issue\" was when an e-mail from Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye \"was leaked to the media and reported on. \"\n\nFoye was the person, according to e-mails, who started asking questions about the lane closures and ordered them reopened. \n\nThat's when Christie said he asked his chief of staff and his chief counsel to \"look into this and see what's going on here. \"\n\nHe said any reference to the bridge situation prior to this wouldn't have meant anything to him because he wasn't clued into the fact that there was a problem. \n\nAfterward, Christie said again that he was told the \"Port Authority was engaged in a traffic study,\" which has now been called into serious question. \n\nHe also stressed that \"nobody has said I knew anything about this before it happened, and I think that's the most important question. \"\n\nA question of evidence\n\nChristie's appearance follows steps by his office over the weekend to strike in an unusually personal way against Wildstein, a one-time high school classmate of the governor in Livingston, N.J.\n\n\"Bottom line - David Wildstein will do and say anything to save David Wildstein,\" a letter released by the governor's office said in a statement. \n\nOn Monday, Christie's office also planned to send to friends and allies a list of tweets and stories aiming to put the focus on The New York Times' handling of the disclosure by Wildstein, according to CNN's Jake Tapper. \n\nThe Times broke the story, saying Wildstein \"had the evidence to prove\" Christie knew about the lane closures. The newspaper quickly revised its lead to simply reflect what the letter written by Wildstein's attorney actually said: that \"evidence exists,\" not that Wildstein was in possession of it. \n\nThe letter never disclosed the evidence. \n\nChris Christie scandal: A primer\n\nFirst on CNN: Mayor behind Christie allegations full of contradictions\n\nThe letter also didn't suggest that Christie had knowledge of what his people might have been up to -- political or otherwise. \n\nRead Wildstein's letter\n\nThe scandal and another allegation of strong-arm political tactics by Christie administration officials over Superstorm Sandy aid have generated a wave of negative political fallout for a governor overwhelmingly re-elected in November and considered a top-tier Republican presidential hopeful in 2016. \n\nChristie's swagger and straight-shooting style had him riding high in the polls as late as December. \n\nHe topped other potential GOP 2016 White House hopefuls in various surveys. But those numbers have faded as the scandal has intensified, according to a new CNN/ORC International survey. \n\nChristie trails Hillary Clinton by 16 percentage points in a hypothetical presidential match-up, a turnaround from December when he was up by 2 points. \n\nOpinion: Are clouds gathering for Christie? \n\nChristie to appear at CPAC\n\nCNN's Cassie Spodak, Paul Steinhauser, and Chris Frates contributed to this report."}, "2014-clippers-who-is-steve-ballmer_782_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- After weeks in limbo, the Los Angeles Clippers could shift hands from an embattled billionaire octogenarian to a former Microsoft CEO.", "prompt": "But unlike owner Donald Sterling, whose racist remarks hurled him into a vortex of public criticism, Steve Ballmer flew under the radar in recent months before he laid down a record $2 billion offer for the team. \n\nHere are nine things to know about the man who could become the Clippers' next owner:\n\nHe's wealthier than Sterling. \n\nA lot wealthier.

Ballmer earned a degree in mathematics and economics. \n\nGates, of course, didn't graduate.

But the company went on to lose more than half of its market value over the course of a decade. \n\nInvestors have been critical of Ballmer for failing to anticipate the mobile computing revolution. \n\n... but there were also great times. \n\nDuring Ballmer's tenure,Windows 7 was the fastest-selling operating system of all time, and Microsoft's cloud and enterprise businesses have stayed strong over the past decade. \n\nAccording to Microsoft, the company tripled its revenue and doubled profits under Ballmer's leadership. \n\nHe retired in February and has been spotted at Clippers games since. \n\nHe's really animated. \n\nJust watch how he takes the stage for a corporate presentation. \n\n\"Come on! Get up!\" Ballmer screamed at one gathering as he danced and leaped across the floor. \"Whoooooo! Come on! Give it up for me! \"\n\nBy the time he took the podium, he barely had enough breath to say, \"I love this company!\" \n\nSo much so that he's ripped his vocal cords. \n\nPerhaps it's not surprising, then, that Ballmer has damaged his voice during his public displays of affection (for Microsoft). \n\nAccording to The New York Times, Ballmer once shouted ''Windows! Windows!'' so furiously at a sales meeting in Japan that he ripped his vocal cords, requiring surgery. \n\nHe's from Motown but has a soft spot for LA. \n\nBallmer's dad, Fred Ballmer, was a manager at Ford Motor Co. in Detroit. The son excelled academically there and became valedictorian of his high school class. \n\nBut he has reason to cheer for the Clippers. \n\n\"I love basketball. And I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that the Clippers continue to win -- and win big -- in Los Angeles,\" Ballmer said in a statement after making his offer. \n\n\"LA is one of the world's great cities -- a city that embraces inclusiveness, in exactly the same way that the NBA and I embrace inclusiveness. \"\n\nBallmer wasn't the only bigwig eyeing the Clippers. \n\nA group that included media moguls David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey also made a bid of $1.6 billion for the Clippers, a source told CNN. \n\nThis isn't his first time trying to buy an NBA team. \n\nBallmer's purchase of the Clippers would still have to be approved by 75% of the NBA's 30 owners. \n\nLast year, the owners denied the sale of the Sacramento Kings to a group that included Ballmer.

In less than three months, doctors were able to wean her off Depakote, a powerful medication that had been damaging her liver. \n\nHaleigh had never been able to walk or talk. But freed from seizures in Colorado, \"She said 'Mama' for the first time,\" Cox said.  \"She's playing with puzzles; she's walking. She's almost being a normal child. \"\n\nDespite all the good news, Cox is living in limbo. Her husband, a paramedic, couldn't afford to leave his job and pension; he still lives and works in Forsyth, Georgia. The family is relying on charity to keep their Colorado apartment for the next few months; beyond that, the future is uncertain. \n\nA bill being introduced Monday in the U.S. House of Representatives could be Cox's ticket home. The three-page bill would amend the Controlled Substances Act -- the federal law that criminalizes marijuana -- to exempt plants with an extremely low percentage of THC, the chemical that makes users high. \n\nGupta: Why I changed my mind on weed\n\nIf passed, it would be the first time that federal law allows any medical marijuana use. \n\n\"No one should face a choice of having their child suffer or moving to Colorado and splitting up their family,\" said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pennsylvania, the bill's sponsor. \"We live in America, and if there's something that would make my child better, and they can't get it because of the government, that's not right. \"\n\nThe bill will land in a Congress that may be open to change. Across the country, highly sympathetic patients and a nonintoxicating product have proved a popular mix. This year alone, 11 states have passed legislation loosening regulation of cannabis strains with high cannabidiol and/or minimal THC content. \n\nIn this atmosphere, Perry says that once members and their staffs are brought up to speed, he expects the bill to attract \"overwhelming\" support. \n\n\"It wouldn't be surprising if we see broad support for this proposal,\" agreed Mason Tvert, communications director at the Marijuana Policy Project, which advocates for marijuana and medical marijuana legalization. \"If this bill gets support, it will demonstrate that there is recognition of marijuana's medical benefits. \"\n\nDubbed the Charlotte's Web Medical Hemp Act of 2014, the bill is named after Charlotte Figi, a young Colorado girl whose parents have campaigned nationwide for easier access to medical marijuana after successfully controlling their daughter's seizures with cannabis oil. Since her story became known, a growing number of parents have flocked to Colorado, hoping for similar success. \n\nThe Charlotte's Web cannabis strain, developed by the Realm of Caring nonprofit organization in Colorado Springs, is in high demand, in part because of the attention it's received in the media. Many families wait months for a batch to be grown and processed into cannabis oil. Perry's bill, however, would apply to any cannabis strain with a THC content of less than 0.3%. \n\nCharlotte's Web and similar strains not only have minimal THC, they have high levels of cannabidiol, another chemical. A growing body of anecdotal evidence suggests that cannabidiol can effectively control seizures, though there are no published studies to support its use. \n\nIt's easy to find critics who say parents should follow a more traditional route. \n\n\"There is no evidence for marijuana as a treatment for seizures,\" Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, a physician, claimed during a congressional hearing last month. \"We hear anecdotal stories, and that's how myths come about. \"\n\nFleming and others point out that a pharmaceutical version of cannabidiol oil, called Epidiolex, is being tested in clinical trials. But many children aren't able to get into the trials. Haleigh Cox is disqualified because she has type-1 diabetes. Others aren't willing to wait several months to be enrolled. \n\n\"With Epidiolex, there just aren't enough seats at the table,\" said Mark Knecht, a father from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, whose story helped inspire Perry's bill. \n\nHis daughter Anna, 11, has epilepsy and suffers anywhere from a handful of seizures a day to more than 100, despite her four anti-convulsant medications. Knecht, the chief financial officer of a large Christian medical nonprofit, says Anna has been evaluated at several top hospitals but couldn't land a spot in the Epidiolex trial. \n\nTwenty-three states and the District of Columbia have laws on the books allowing medical marijuana for a variety of conditions. But even as states rewrite their regulations, federal law remains the same: Marijuana is illegal to grow, sell or use for any purpose. Under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is listed on Schedule 1, meaning it has \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" To backers of reform, the Catch-22 is familiar: Marijuana is restricted in large part because there is little research to support medical uses; research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions. \n\nA series of memos from the Justice Department has said that arresting individual medical marijuana users is not a priority, and a 2013 memo added that federal prosecutors should not target large commercial operations except on a case-by-case basis. But most observers say that shipping or transporting the drug across state lines ups the ante. \n\n\"For families like us, the biggest issue is the federal issue. You can't take it across state lines,\" Knecht explained. \n\nHis family still lives in Mechanicsburg. But after seeing CNN's medical marijuana documentary last year, Anna and her mother, Deb, established residency in Colorado, where they obtained a medical marijuana card that let them place an order for a batch cannabis oil, in hopes it will control Anna's seizures. If Perry's bill becomes law, Knecht says, \"Realm of Caring could just put it in a FedEx package. \"\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is conducting a review of scientific evidence to determine whether marijuana warrants looser treatment, but a spokeswoman says there's no set date to complete the analysis. A review in 2011 ended with the Drug Enforcement Administration leaving marijuana's status unaltered. \n\nBut certain actions in Congress give Perry and his supporters hope. \n\nThis month, the House passed a bill allowing banks to handle cash proceeds from dispensaries and other legal marijuana businesses. \n\nThe most recent Farm Bill allows industrial hemp -- a strain of cannabis without THC -- to be grown for academic or research purposes. That didn't stop the Drug Enforcement Administration from seizing a shipment of hemp seeds bound for the University of Kentucky this spring. In response, the Senate Appropriations Committee, with support from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,  passed an amendment blocking DEA funds for anti-hemp enforcement. \n\nIn May, the House passed a measure blocking money for DEA raids on marijuana dispensaries that are legal under state law. \n\nAnd just last week, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky took it a step further, introducing an amendment to the Jobs Bill that would forbid federal prosecution of doctors and patients whose actions are legal under state medical marijuana laws. \n\n\"If states allow doctors to prescribe medical marijuana, and people are in good faith prescribing medical marijuana, we want to make sure it's OK and that the federal government doesn't come in and prosecute somebody ,\" said Brian Darling, Paul's communications director. \n\nThe amendment seems likely to die amidst wrangling over the Jobs Bill, but Darling says his boss plans to move forward on a standalone measure. \n\nToo many people have been sentenced to long prison terms for possession of marijuana, Darling says. \"The War on Drugs has gone overboard. \"\n\nKnecht doesn't want to uproot his family to move to Colorado. But he says his hand may be forced. \"We're taking this situation one day at a time. \"\n\nThat's where Janea Cox was a few months ago. She hadn't heard about Perry's bill until she got a call from a reporter but says she understands where the Pennsylvania families are coming from. She's angry at home-state lawmakers who failed to push through Georgia's cannabidiol oil bill this spring. \n\n\"I lived in Georgia for 17 years,\" she said, \"but here in Colorado, I met my child for the first time, at the age of 5. \" \n\nMedical marijuana research stalls after Arizona professor is let go"}, "2014-georgia-alabama-stranded-buses-schoolchildren_1645_en.txt": {"title": "Atlanta is shut down -- businesses, roads, government in general -- and while that's generated furor among residents, the angst is exacerbated by the overnight uncertainty involving many of the city's cubs.", "prompt": "Across the state, and even extending into Alabama, there were reports of children spending the night in schools, their parents or school buses unable to navigate treacherous conditions that Georgia Department of Public Safety Commissioner Col.

But the company is still collecting payment in the form of massive amounts of personal information about the people who use it. \n\nWith an estimated 500-plus million users, Gmail has grown to dominate the Web-mail world. It has also repeatedly found itself in hot water over privacy. Gmail is facing multiple privacy lawsuits in the United States and Europe, some accusing the company of illegal wiretapping for scanning the content of e-mails.", "text": "Google reported $16.86 billion in revenues for the last quarter of 2013 alone. One way it makes money from Gmail is by automatically scanning and indexing messages and using the data it mines to show relevant ads to its users. \n\n\"The basic premise of Gmail is, we'll give you a robust e-mail service and in exchange we want to display ads alongside our e-mail and we're scanning your e-mail to decide what ads are most relevant,\" said Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law. \n\nScanning and ads\n\nGmail looks for keywords that identify topics of discussion based on things such as frequency and context, then matches the e-mail up with related ads. A conversation thread about meeting up at a spinning class, for example, might trigger an ad for a weight-loss product. \n\nData gathered through e-mail scanning can also be used to create user profiles for future ad targeting. \n\nWhat many consumers don't consider is that companies such as Google can create a comprehensive profile of each user based on information from different products such as search, maps, e-mail and Google+, its social network. \n\n\"Nothing in life is free, and as a result it is important for people to understand what value they bring to a free service of any kind,\" said Behnam Dayanim, a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings LLP in Washington. \n\nWhen people send and receive messages using a free e-mail service, they are sharing details about their interests, who their connections are and what their finances look like. That information might seem mundane on the surface, but when extracted and organized, it's incredibly valuable to marketers and advertisers. \n\nAll the major e-mail providers, including Microsoft Outlook and Yahoo, benefit one way or another from offering a free service. The provider might serve up general or targeted ads, generate a user base for marketing other services, or just use the e-mail service to build brand recognition. \n\nAnd while Gmail may have popularized it, targeted ads based on user data has become the primary business model for many tech companies. It's how social media companies such as Facebook and search engines such as Bing make money as well as a huge number of apps that scrape contact and location information from users. It's also led to a number of similar privacy lawsuits against other companies, including LinkedIn, Yahoo and Facebook. \n\nAny company that collects personal information has to advise its customers what it is doing with their information and comply with any relevant privacy laws, Dayanim said. These are usually laid out in the lengthy terms and conditions and privacy policies that customers barely skim before hitting \"agree. \"\n\nHowever, many of the details about how exactly Google's program works have been kept confidential. And critics say the service doesn't adequately disclose what it is doing with customers' information. \n\nLegal action\n\nWhen Gmail made its debut in 2004, it was upfront about the fact that it would show contextual ads targeted to match the topic of e-mail threads. People still lined up to be accepted as early beta users of the service because it was slickly designed, included ample amounts of storage, and was excellent at filtering out spam. And it didn't cost anything to sign up. \n\nOne problem is that not all the people affected have agreed to Google's privacy policy. One group of plaintiffs in a recent class-action lawsuit were non-Gmail users who sent messages to Gmail accounts. Google responded that non-Gmail customers had no expectations of privacy when sending e-mails to people who did use the service. \n\nGoogle has defended its e-mail scanning program by pointing out that it's automated and handled by computers picking out keywords. Google's employees aren't personally reading through e-mails for the latest lovers' spat. \n\nGoogle also says the scans are necessary to cut down on malicious e-mails and spam, and for features such as Priority Inbox and the tabbed view that filters e-mails into different categories. \n\nA federal judge dealt a blow to the case this month, ruling it couldn't proceed as a class-action lawsuit because the different groups weren't cohesive enough. A class-action lawsuit could have cost Google trillions of dollars in damages. \n\nA changing landscape\n\nWhen Gmail debuted in 2004, the rules for collecting user information were looser. But the privacy landscape has changed drastically over the past 10 years. \n\nSeveral U.S. states have passed laws that restrict the use of personal information, the Federal Trade Commission has been more active pursuing privacy violations, and the industry has adopted best practices about what's acceptable. \n\nOne thing that hasn't changed is the federal law with the biggest impact on how and when companies can share data with third parties. The Electronics Communication Privacy Act is a dusty piece of legislation passed in 1986, long before the era of cloud-based e-mail. Many legislators and technology companies (including Google) have lobbied to have the law updated to reflect the times. \n\nMeanwhile, consumers must increasingly weigh the value of using a free e-mail service such as Gmail against their personal privacy."}, "2014-grammys-winners-list_2135_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- The 56th annual Grammy Awards were held in Los Angeles on Sunday night with performances from Lorde, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Jay Z, Beyonce and more.", "prompt": "Take a look at some of the top winners below:\n\nRecord of the year\n\"Get Lucky\" -- Daft Punk featuring Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers -- WINNER\n\"Radioactive\" -- Imagine Dragons\n\"Royals\" -- Lorde \n\"Locked out of Heaven\" -- Bruno Mars\n\"Blurred Lines\" -- Robin Thicke featuring T.I. and Pharrell\n\nAlbum of the year\n\"The Blessed Unrest\" -- Sara Bareilles\n\"Random Access Memories\" -- Daft Punk -- WINNER\n\"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City\" -- Kendrick Lamar \n\"The Heist\" -- Macklemore & Ryan Lewis \n\"Red\" -- Taylor Swift\n\n5 things we loved about the 2014 Grammys\n\nSong of the year\n\"Just Give Me a Reason\" --", "text": "P!nk featuring Nate Ruess\n\"Locked Out of Heaven\" -- Bruno Mars\n\"Roar\" -- Katy Perry\n\"Royals\" -- Lorde -- WINNER\n\"Same Love\" -- Macklemore & Ryan Lewis\n\nBest new artist\nJames Blake\nKendrick Lamar\nMacklemore & Ryan Lewis -- WINNER\nKacey Musgraves\nEd Sheeran\n\nBest pop solo performance\nSara Bareilles -- \"Brave\"\nLorde -- \"Royals\" -- WINNER\nBruno Mars -- \"When I Was Your Man\"\nKaty Perry -- \"Roar\"\nJustin Timberlake -- \"Mirrors\"\n\nBest pop duo/group performance\nDaft Punk featuring Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers -- \"Get Lucky\" -- WINNER\nP!nk featuring Nate Ruess -- \"Just Give Me a Reason\"\nRihanna featuring Mikky Ekko -- \"Stay\"\nRobin Thicke featuring T.I. and Pharrell -- \"Blurred Lines\"\nJustin Timberlake and Jay Z -- \"Suit & Tie\"\n\nBest pop instrumental album\nHerb Alpert -- \"Steppin' Out\" -- WINNER\nBoney James -- \"The Beat\"\nEarl Klugh -- \"Handpicked\"\nDave Koz, Gerald Albright, Mindi Abair and Richard Elliot -- \"Summer Horns\"\nJeff Lorber Fusion -- \"Hacienda\"\n\nBest pop vocal album\nLana Del Rey -- \"Paradise\"\nLorde -- \"Pure Heroine\"\nBruno Mars -- \"Unorthodox Jukebox\" -- WINNER\nRobin Thicke -- \"Blurred Lines\"\nJustin Timberlake -- \"The 20/20 Experience -- The Complete Experience\"\n\nBest dance recording\n\"Need U (100%)\" -- Duke Dumont featuring A*M*E & MNEK\n\"Sweet Nothing\" -- Calvin Harris featuring Florence Welch\n\"Atmosphere\" -- Kaskade\n\"The is What it Feels Like\" -- Armin Van Buuren featuring Trevor Guthrie\n\"Clarity\" -- Zedd featuring Foxes -- WINNER\n\nBest dance/electronica album\n\"Random Access Memories\" -- Daft Punk -- WINNER\n\"Settle\" -- Disclosure\n\"18 Months\" -- Calvin Harris\n\"Atmosphere\" -- Kaskade\n\"A Color Map of the Sun\" -- Pretty Lights\n\nBest traditional pop vocal album\n\"Viva Duets\" -- Tony Bennett and various artists\n\"To Be Loved\" -- Michael Bubl\u00e9 -- WINNER\n\"The Standards\" -- Gloria Estefan\n\"Cee Lo's Magic Moment\" -- Cee Lo Green\n\"Now\" -- Dionne Warwick\n\nBest rock performance\nAlabama Shakes -- \"Always Alright\"\nDavid Bowie -- \"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\"\nImagine Dragons -- \"Radioactive\" -- WINNER\nLed Zeppelin -- \"Kashmir\"\nQueens of the Stone Age -- \"My God is the Sun\"\nJack White -- \"I'm Shakin' \"\n\nBest metal performances\nAnthrax -- \"T.N.T.\"\nBlack Sabbath -- \"God is Dead?\" -- WINNER\nDream Theater -- \"The Enemy Inside\"\nKillswitch Engage -- \"In Due Time\"\nVolbeat featuring King Diamond -- \"Room 24\"\n\nBest rock song\n\"Ain't Messin' 'Round\" -- Gary Clark Jr.\n\"Cut Me Some Slack\" -- Paul McCartney, Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic, Pat Smear -- WINNER\n\"Doom and Gloom\" -- The Rolling Stones\n\"God Is Dead?\" -- Black Sabbath\n\"Panic Station\" -- Muse\n\nBest rock album\nBlack Sabbath -- \"13\"\nDavid Bowie -- \"The Next Day\"\nKings of Leon -- \"Mechanical Bull\"\nLed Zeppelin -- \"Celebration Day\" -- WINNER\nQueens of the Stone Age -- \"...

But passersby were quick to nickname the mannequin \"Umbrella Man. \"\n\nBuilt of wooden squares, the 10-foot tall statue of a man holding aloft a yellow umbrella has now taken its place alongside the posters, cartoons, banners and calligraphy that now decorate the streets and sidewalks of Hong Kong's Admiralty district. \n\nSince they occupied this area a week and a half ago, pro-democracy protesters have transformed a stretch of concrete highway running through the center of the city into an improvised outdoor gallery of politically-inspired art.", "text": "\"It's an outpouring of creative talent,\" exclaimed Douglas Young, a Hong Kong-based designer and entrepreneur, during a recent visit to the protest encampment. \n\n\"Why haven't we seen this before?\" asked Young, who also took care to point out that he was not an active supporter of the protest movement. \n\nUmbrella inspiration\n\nThe sit-in has acted as a magnet attracting artists eager to make their voices heard. \n\nThe artist known as Milk told CNN his statue was inspired by the image of a protester holding an umbrella to shield a police officer from the rain. \n\nMost of the other images displayed here also riff on the umbrella and the yellow ribbon, two symbols of the protest movement. \n\nLast month, protesters used umbrellas -- an accessory Hong Kongers carry to protect themselves from torrential downpours as well as tropical sun -- to shield themselves from pepper spray fired by police. \n\nLess than 48 hours into the occupation, demonstrators erected a globe-shaped monument out of umbrellas above the traffic circle next to the Legislative Council building. Since then, the streets and sidewalks have been plastered with cartoon-like characters holdings umbrellas, accompanied by slogans calling for democracy, freedom and justice. \n\nOne of the posters shows a helmeted police officer with riot shield yelling \"You're such a thug!\" while pointing his finger at an umbrella-toting cartoon that resembles the children's book character Paddington Bear. \n\nThe artist who drew the cartoon is a 30-year-old graphic designer Carol Hung. \n\n\"My initial idea was to make people laugh in this heavy atmosphere,\" Hung told CNN. \n\nHung, who described herself as a political neophyte, said she was inspired to produce a series of protest-inspired drawings after seeing reports of police clashing with protesters on September 28th. \n\n\"At the moment I saw the tear gas, it made me want to support the students,\" Hung said. \n\nArt as 'silent protest'\n\nOn a recent afternoon, art teacher Josephine Lau sat in the middle of the highway now occupied by students, painting yellow ribbons onto Chinese paper.  She hoped her posters would prove more durable than previous slogans she had made, which were washed away by rainstorms last week. \n\n\"We can use different media to express ourselves... to tell people what we feel about Hong Kong,\" Lau said. \"I like the peaceful and silent protest and I'm supporting the students behind the scenes. \"\n\nNot far away, 17-year-old Timothy Sun was designing his own posters on the asphalt with the slogan \"GOV YU NO LISTEN TO US?\"\n\n\"I want to use my way to show my voice to the public,\" the teenager said. \n\nPost-it politics\n\nLike many others here, Sun said his favorite piece of art at the protest site was actually a colorful piece of work created by thousands of contributors named the \"Lennon Wall. \"\n\nThousands of pastel post-it notes bearing messages and drawings written by passersby in many languages coat the curved staircase that runs along the outside wall of one of the government office buildings in Admiralty. \n\nMany of the messages profess love for Hong Kong. The wall serves as proof that, despite young Hong Kongers' freedom to digitally post anything they like on social media, there is still a powerful attraction to expressing oneself using old-fashioned paper and ink. \n\n\"This feels very much to me like Twitter, but paper Twitter,\" observed Young, the businessman and art aficionado. \"Old school Twitter, if there's such a thing. \"\n\nYoung, who runs a chain of high-end design stores called Goods of Desire, was quickly inspired to add his own post-it message to the wall.  It was an appeal to Hong Kong's beleaguered top official to preserve the post-it monument: \"Mr. Chief Executive, Please don't tear this wall down. \"\n\n\"I see a lot of tenderness, a lot of passion... a lot of imagination, which is fantastic,\" Young said, while gazing out on the largely empty encampment and its fluttering banners and posters. \n\n\"I wonder where that's from?\" he asked. \"I wonder where these people will be after this, when it all ends. \"\n\nNathan Mauger and Scott Clotworthy contributed to this report."}, "2014-malayisa-airlines-flight-370-search_1106_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- Australian researchers released an audio recording Wednesday of an underwater sound that they say could possibly be related to the final moments of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.", "prompt": "It's a long shot, but researchers at Curtin University near Perth, Australia, have been studying records from underwater listening devices, including those meant to monitor for signs of underwater nuclear explosions, in an effort to help find the missing plane. \n\n\"One signal has been detected on several receivers that could be related to the crash,\" said Alec Duncan with the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST). \n\nResearchers have been analyzing the very low frequency sound for weeks to see if it was \"the impact of the aircraft on the water or the implosion of parts of the aircraft as it sank,\" Duncan said.", "text": "\"But (the source of the noise) is just as likely to be a natural event. \"\n\nLow frequency signals can travel thousands of miles through water under favorable circumstances, at about 1 mile per second, Duncan said. But \"at the moment (the sound) appears to be inconsistent with other data about the aircraft position,\" he said. \n\nThat's because researchers at Curtin University believe the sound came from an area thousands of miles to the northwest of the current search area in the southern Indian Ocean. And even then, they haven't been able to pinpoint the source. \n\nDuncan says his team has calculated an \"uncertainty box\" for the signal's origin. It's area that stretches some 2,485 miles in length from southeast to northwest across the Indian Ocean, and spans some 124 to 186 miles in width at its widest point. \n\nThe center of the long, narrow box is south of the tip of India, as shown in a map released Wednesday. \n\nThe university on Wednesday released an audio clip captured by one of the listening devices, off of Perth. Duncan says his team has sped up the recording 10 times to make it audible to the human ear. \n\nIt also shared charts of acoustic signal plots showing what various devices detected. \n\nSearching in the right place? \n\nThe search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight continues to focus along an arc hundreds of kilometers long, the area where investigators believe the Boeing 777 ran out of fuel, about 1,000 miles off the coast of Western Australia. \n\nMartin Dolan, the chief commissioner with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the organization leading the search into MH370 at the request of Malaysia, says an international team of experts continues to review the analysis of Inmarsat satellite data and aircraft performance. \n\nIn a television exclusive, Dolan told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" he remains confident the final resting place of MH370 is somewhere along that arc, the so-called \"partial handshake\" with the satellite:\n\n\"We've seen all the data. We've seen all the calculations. We are reviewing the calculations and are also developing our own model to cross check and verify that information,\" Dolan told Burnett. \n\nWhen asked last week about the underwater sound being analyzed by the team at Curtin University, along with Geoscience Australia, a government agency, Dolan was skeptical. \n\n\"We think that those detections may have been interesting from the point of view of the direction they came, but other characteristics make it unlikely that they are associated with MH370,\" he said. The ATSB first referenced these signals in a document posted on its website on May 26. \n\nListening below the surface\n\nAs was the case with the Inmarsat satellite -- a communications satellite whose data was analyzed by Malaysia Airlines MH370 investigators as a navigational aide -- the analysis of the underwater signals involves the use of technology for a different purpose than its original intent. \n\nOne of the devices, operated by Curtin University and located some 12 miles off Perth, is designed to listen to whales and other marine life. The other is for signs of underwater nuclear explosions, one of 11 operated worldwide by the U.N.-chartered Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) as part of the International Monitoring System. \n\nEarly in the search for Malaysia Flight 370, the United Nations reported it had not detected any explosions or plane crashes on land or water from its sensors around the globe. But the recent efforts involve pairing CTBTO data with other sources to see what can be gleaned, officials said. \n\n\"One can always be hopeful,\" said Mark Prior, a seismic acoustic analyst with the CTBTO. \n\nThe CTBTO's hydro-acoustic stations detect low frequency sound in the 0-100 Hz range, and can't detect black box \"pings\" in the 30-40 kHz range, officials said. \"It's possible (to detect a plane crash), but the circumstances that would allow it would have to be very particular,\" said Prior. \n\nPrior said some of those circumstances might include a sloping sea bed. Another possible scenario: the origin of the sound would need to be near the listening device. \n\nThe CTBTO's system near Cape Leeuwin, the southwestern-most point of Australia, regularly captures signals of ice breaking noise from Antarctica and seismic activity from Indonesia, he said. \"There are other scenarios that would allow (the hydrophones to detect a crash). But it's not certain if there was an impact we would detect it,\" Prior said. \n\nAttempts were made following the 2009 crash of Air France 447 in the southern Atlantic Ocean to see if underwater listening devices had detected the plane's impact. No data could be found. \n\nYears later, after the plane was located, CTBTO again checked its data, and still was not able to identify signals related to the crash."}, "2014-malaysia-airlines-stolen-passports_1343_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- How difficult is it to board a plane with a stolen passport?", "prompt": "Not as hard as you might think. \n\nIn any major international airport, it's not uncommon to have your passport checked four times or more between check-in and boarding the aircraft. But if passenger documents aren't checked against Interpol's database of stolen and lost travel documents, travelers using those documents can slip through layers of security. \n\nReports that two passengers on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 were traveling on stolen Austrian and Italian passports have highlighted security concerns that have troubled Interpol for years, the international law enforcement agency said Sunday.", "text": "The flight, carrying more than 200 passengers, disappeared from radar Saturday and hasn't been seen or heard from since. \n\nInterpol identified the men using the stolen passports as Pouri Nourmohammadi, 18, and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, both Iranians. Malaysian police believe Nourmohammadi was trying to emigrate to Germany using the stolen Austrian passport. The men entered Malaysia on February 28 using valid Iranian passports, Interpol said. \n\n\"Interpol is asking why only a handful of countries worldwide are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights,\" Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said in a statement. \n\nBefore the departure of Flight 370, no country had checked the stolen passports against Interpol's list since they were added to the lost-documents database in 2012 and 2013, Interpol said. \n\nCountries, but not airlines, have access to Interpol's data, and many governments don't routinely check passports against the database. \n\nIn 2013, passengers were able to board planes more than 1 billion times without having their travel documents checked against Interpol's data, the agency said. Airlines carried more than 3.1 billion passengers globally in 2013, according to estimates from the International Air Transport Association. \n\nAre stolen passports related to plane's disappearance? \n\nInterpol head Noble said Tuesday that the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 does not appear to be related to terrorism. \n\n\"The more information we get, the more we're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident,\" Noble said at a news conference in Lyon, France. \n\nThere's no evidence to suggest either of the men traveling on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight was connected to any terrorist organizations, according to Malaysian investigators. \n\nOn any given day, many people travel using stolen or fake passports for reasons that have nothing to do with terrorism, aviation security expert Richard Bloom told CNN. \n\nThey might be trying to immigrate illegally to another country, or they might be smuggling stolen goods, people, drugs or weapons or trying to import otherwise legal goods without paying taxes, said Bloom, director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \n\n\"For all of those reasons, the very notion that passports might be important in this particular situation may be a red herring,\" Bloom said. \n\nNoble said Sunday that the fact that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in Interpol's databases is a big concern. \n\n\"This is a situation we had hoped never to see,\" he said. \"For years Interpol has asked why should countries wait for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates?\"\n\nFew countries look up stolen passports\n\nInterpol does not charge countries for access to its databases, but some of the 190 Interpol member countries may not have the technical capacity or resources to access the network, according to Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director. \n\n\"It's just up to the will of the country to set it up and do it,\" Fuentes said. \n\nInterpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database was created in 2002, following the September 11, 2001, attacks, to help countries secure their borders. Since then, it has expanded from a few thousand passports and searches to more than 40 million entries and more than 800 million searches per year. \n\nAbout 60,000 of those 800 million searches yield hits against stolen or lost documents, according to Interpol. \n\nThe United States searches the database more than 250 million times annually, the United Kingdom more than 120 million times annually and the United Arab Emirates more than 50 million times annually, Interpol said. (Some 300,000 passports are lost or stolen each year in the United States, according to the U.S. State Department, which collects reports of stolen passports and sends them to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Interpol.) \n\nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection vets all travelers booked on flights to, from and heading through the United States through the Advanced Passenger Information System. \n\nIt conducts a thorough review of all relevant domestic and international criminal databases, including Interpol's, for any issues of concern. This review includes reports of stolen documents. \n\n\"If Malaysia Airlines and all airlines worldwide were able to check the passport details of prospective passengers against Interpol's database, then we would not have to speculate whether stolen passports were used by terrorists to board MH 370,\" Interpol's Noble said. \n\nThe Thailand connection\n\nThe Austrian and Italian passports were stolen in Thailand in 2012 and 2013, respectively, according to Interpol. \n\nThailand is a booming market for stolen passports. Paul Quaglia, who has been working in the region as a security and risk analyst for 14 years, said the situation in Thailand is better than it was five to 10 years ago \"but still not up to international standards. \"\n\n\"Unfortunately, Thailand remains a robust venue for the sale of high-quality false passports (which includes altered stolen passports) and other supporting documentation,\" he said. \n\nNot all \"lost\" passports are necessarily \"stolen\" passports, Quaglia said. \"Some passports 'lost' are actually sold by the passport holder. Some young men and others traveling to Thailand, short on cash after extended partying and high living, can be approached to sell a passport, which can be easily replaced at embassies upon presentation of a routine 'lost passport' police report,\" he said. \n\nSearching for true identities\n\nAn investigation was launched into the Flight 370 matter, with Malaysian and aviation authorities reviewing video and other documentation to try to identify not only who the passengers were that used the stolen passports but how the illegal passports cleared security. \n\nIn an interview with CNN on Monday, Thailand Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said the country is cooperating with Interpol in the investigation. \n\nInterpol's Noble urged countries and airlines to adopt routine checks against its lost and stolen document database. \n\n\"I sincerely hope that governments and airlines worldwide will learn from the tragedy of missing flight MH 370 and begin to screen all passengers' passports prior to allowing them to board flights,\" Noble said. \n\n\"Doing so will indeed take us a step closer to ensuring safer travel. \""}, "2014-mideast-tensions-qa_1626_en.txt": {"title": "Part of Jerusalem is seeing its worst flare-up in years.

But last month's abduction of three Israeli teens who were on their way home from school in the West Bank brought the tensions to a fever pitch. Israelis waited with bated breath, hoping for word that they were alive. \n\nWhen the bodies of Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel -- a dual Israeli-American citizen -- were found on June 30, the country was grief-stricken.", "text": "The Israeli government blamed Hamas, which denied responsibility but praised the abductions. Israel carried out arrests and demolished homes of the suspects in the West Bank, and launched airstrikes against targets in Gaza that are used to lob rockets into Israel. Palestinians stepped up rocket attacks and clashed with Israeli troops. \n\nHas the Middle East crisis reached a tipping point? \n\nWhen was the Palestinian teen killed? \n\nOn Wednesday, according to his family, Mohammad Abu Khedair was headed to a mosque in his middle-class neighborhood of Shuafat, part of eastern Jerusalem, which is populated by Arabs. Three people in a car forced him inside, according to authorities and family members. He was reported missing and, about an hour later, his body was found in a forest in Jerusalem. Israel vowed a swift investigation and condemned the killing. Still, clashes erupted in the usually quiet Shuafat neighborhood. Residents threw rocks at security forces, and Israeli authorities responded with occasional volleys of stun grenades or tear gas. Some protesters also attacked two fellow Palestinians whom they mistook for undercover Israeli police. \n\nIsrael announced over the weekend that several Jewish suspects had been arrested and that there was \"strong indication\" the killing may have been in revenge for the three Israeli teens' deaths. The clashes are the worst the city has seen in a decade. \n\nIsrael has condemned the killings of five teens. Who's the fifth? \n\nIsrael announced over the weekend that a taxi driver had confessed to killing an Israeli Jewish teen in May. Shelly Dadon, 19, was kidnapped, stabbed to death and left in an abandoned parking lot. The suspect's motivation was believed to be Palestinian nationalism, Israeli police said. In the Knesset, Israel's parliament, lawmakers unanimously condemned the deaths of all five young people, The Jerusalem Post reported. \n\nWho's the beaten teen? \n\nTariq Abu Khdeir is from Florida. He was visiting his relatives in Jerusalem when his cousin, Mohammad Abu Khedair, was killed. Two videos posted online Thursday show Tariq Abu Khdeir beaten by men wearing the uniform of Israeli security forces. The videos do not show what led to the beating. \n\nThere's a dispute over what transpired. Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said Khdeir was among six masked people who threw petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails, and three of whom had knives. Still, that would not excuse \"any excessive use of force,\" he told \"Fox News Sunday.\" Khdeir says he was watching protesters and was \"attacked.\" A court has ordered him to house arrest for nine days at a relative's home in a different neighborhood. His mother says the family plans to sue Israeli authorities. Physically, he's \"doing a lot better,\" a family lawyer in Florida told CNN on Monday. \n\nWill this spark a 'third Intifada'? \n\nThat's a question being raised by some in the region as well as global media. The term refers to two previous armed uprisings by Palestinians against Israel. The first began in 1987 and ended in 1993 with the signing of the Oslo accords. The second lasted from 2000 to 2005. \n\n\"A third intifada is likely if Palestinians fail to distance themselves from the militants following the cold-blooded murder of three Israeli teenagers,\" the Telegraph's Con Coughlin wrote last week after their bodies were found. \n\n\"Put simply, there are solid reasons to fear that a third intifada could be far more bloody than the uprisings that have gone before. Which means the task facing leaders on all sides could not be clearer: they have to calm this situation, not inflame it,\" The Guardian's Jonathan Freedland wrote Friday. \n\nBut Haaretz reported that \"many East Jerusalem officials expect the turmoil to die down.\" It noted that West Bank cities have not joined the violent protest. \n\nTo some Palestinians, the intifada is the ongoing effort against Israel. \"The blood of our martyrs is precious ... and is fuel for the intifada and the resistance,\" Mushir Al-Masri, a Hamas leadership figure and member of the Palestinian parliament, wrote Monday on Facebook. \n\nWhat are Palestinian leaders saying? \n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas surprised many when he condemned the kidnappings of the three Israeli teens. He faced heated criticism from fellow Palestinians for doing so. \"Hamas, which is now part of the Palestinian Authority government in a unity deal with Fatah, made no effort to conceal its glee,\" columnist Frida Ghitis noted on CNN.com. Khaled Meshaal, Hamas political chief, told Al Jazeera after the Israeli teens' disappearance, \"I congratulate the abductors because our prisoners must be freed from the prisons of the occupation. \"\n\nPalestinian leaders have called for an end to \"collective punishment\" by Israel, including the demolishing of homes and other military actions. And some have called on Israel to demolish the homes of those behind the killing of Abu Khedair. Palestinian leaders have also condemned the killings of people in Israeli military actions. Israel says it is focused on terrorist networks. More than 150 rockets from Gaza have hit Israel in less than a month, and \"terrorists from Gaza opened fire at an (Israel Defense Forces) vehicle patrolling the security fence,\" the IDF tweeted Monday. \n\nIs anyone calling for peace? \n\nYes. In recent days, Israelis have held anti-racism rallies to counteract hatred on both sides, including groups of Israeli Jews who were seen yelling \"Death to Arabs\" after the Israeli teens' killings. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on Palestinian and Arab leaders to join his public calls for an end to the killings. \"We don't differ between terror and terror, and against both we will act harshly. And I don't differ between incitement and incitement in the state of Israel,\" he said Sunday, adding, \"We will not let extremists -- it doesn't matter from which side -- bring bloodshed to the area. \"\n\nLast week, the family of Frankel, the slain Israeli-American teen, also condemned Khedair's killing. Frankel's uncle Yishai Frankel, who works to bring Palestinians into Israel's high-tech sector, said he feels as good as ever about \"the good people\" he works with. \"It's no secret that every society has bad people,\" he said. \n\nAnd the family attorney for beaten teen Tariq Abu Khdeir told CNN's \"New Day\" on Monday, \"We need, really, all sides right now to just stop this disgusting cycle of violence where innocent children, both on the Israeli and Palestinian side, are being killed and injured almost daily nowadays. \"\n\nWhat does all this mean for peace efforts? \n\nIt's unclear whether there's been any real progress toward substantive peace talks in recent years, with each side blaming the other for preventing them. In April, The Economist called it \"a peace process that is going nowhere. \"\n\nIsraelis and Palestinians may have grown further apart in what they're hoping for. Most Israelis support a two-state solution, according to a new poll by the Dialog Institute, Haaretz reported Monday. But a June poll of Palestinians, taken during the search for the three missing Israeli teens, found that fewer than 30% of Palestinians support a two-state solution. Sixty percent say the five-year goal \"should be to work toward reclaiming all of historic Palestine, from the river to the sea,\" the Washington Institute for Near East Policy found. But the majority support nonviolent methods of \"popular resistance. \"\n\nFor now, the focus for all those opposing the violence is calming anger in the short term -- and stopping the killing."}, "2014-new-york-medical-marijuana_730_en.txt": {"title": "New York (CNN) -- New York is set to become the latest state to open the door for medical marijuana, with Gov.

Twenty states and the District of Columbia now allow it in some form -- among them Colorado, where as of January 1 it's legal to sell marijuana to those 21 or older -- according to info compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. (In addition, Maryland has a limited program for research.) The momentum has picked up of late, with most of these efforts taking effect over the past decade. \n\nThe states where there is medical marijuana include Connecticut, Vermont and New Jersey, each of which border New York. And yet the Empire State has not joined them. Versions of the Compassionate Care Act pushed by Gottfried have passed the state Assembly, only to stall in the Senate. \n\nCuomo is acting without the legislature's OK, though what he's doing is legal, according to Gottfried, whose district includes much of Midtown Manhattan. He explained that the governor is acting on powers granted through a law passed in 1980 in setting the stage for a highly regulated system that's less liberal than many other medical marijuana setups nationwide. \n\nHere's how it would work, according to Gottfried: Under Cuomo's directive, the state health department would take charge by setting up the guidelines and picking hospitals that would take part. These hospitals would then have panels of people who decide, on a person-by-person basis, which patients qualify for medical marijuana. \n\nIt has yet to be determined where the medical marijuana -- or the elements of it that might be dispensed -- will come from, including who might produce it. \n\nGottfried estimated that tens of thousands of people could get medical marijuana by virtue of this policy change, though he insisted it is no substitute for a more complete, far-reaching program. \n\n\"(Cuomo) can take (this step) without the need for further legislation,\" the Manhattan legislator said. \"But to have a truly comprehensive and well-working system will take legislation. \"\n\nGabriel Sayegh -- the New York state director for the Drug Policy Alliance, which describes itself as a \"national advocacy leader of drug law reform\" -- agrees, saying that it too will push for broader medical marijuana laws in the state. \n\nHe learned about this latest measure in a call Saturday from the governor's office, saying the proposal originated there and describing it the same basic way as Gottfried. \n\nEven as he pushes for something bigger, Sayegh praised the governor for taking what he called an \"exciting\" initial step. \n\n\"It's tremendous,\" Sayegh said. \"We applaud him coming out on this.

Everyone, that is, except senior Uber executives themselves. \n\nLast Friday night, at a dinner party set up by Uber as an off-the-record briefing, at Manhattan's exclusive Waverly Inn bistro, Emil Michael, the company's vice president of business, proposed a dastardly scheme to compromise one of Uber's leading media critics.", "text": "Michael suggested that Uber use its vast collection of consumer data to \"dig up dirt\" on Sarah Lacey, the founder of the Silicon Valley news site Pando. \n\nOver a dinner attended by leading technology pundits, Michael suggested that Uber could spend \"a million dollars\" to hire a crack team of researchers and journalists. This investigative team might, he said, snoop into the personal and family life of a critic like Lacey who has relentlessly exposed many of Uber's creepiest features -- particularly what she calls  the \"asshole\" misogyny of its CEO, Travis Kalanick. \n\nEarlier this week, Michael's outrageous and perhaps even criminal idea was leaked by the Buzzfeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith, who attended the dinner. This, of course, has generated a massive storm of outrage amongst the technorati. \n\nPeter Thiel told CNN that Uber was the most \"ethically challenged\" company in Silicon Valley. While The Guardian's Dominic Rushe rhetorically asked whether Uber is Silicon Valley's \"worst company. \"\n\nAll over social media, people said the same thing: Emil Michael was the ultimate creep! The crowd had spoken. Michael's reviews were universally abysmal. He should be yanked, dismissed, fired. \n\nBut that's exactly what hasn't happened. In spite of the popular outrage over Michael's behavior, Travis Kalanick wrote an unapologetic 12 part Twitter \"apology\" which rejected the idea of firing his most senior business executive. Uber investors have mostly remained conveniently silent with a few -- like the normally outspoken Jason Calacanis -- explicitly defending Kalanick and, by implication, Michael. \n\nIn The Circle, his brilliant satire of technology companies like Uber, Dave Eggers coined the Orwellian phrase \"Sharing is caring\" to describe the hypocrisy enveloping Silicon Valley. But, of course, in the sharing economy of multi-billion dollar start-ups like Uber, sharing is only caring when it comes to dismissing lowly drivers or customers. Trust is only the convenient new currency of this economy when it suits Uber. \n\nOtherwise the \"new\" economy appears to be ominously old, with a rejection of transparency, democratization, openness, accountability and all the other buzzwords of the Internet revolution. \n\nWe the people, however, may have the last laugh. The New York Times' Farhad Manjoo wrote that Uber's \"toughest challenge\" now is improving its dubious ethical behavior. While Dov Seidman, the CEO of LRN and a deep thinker about business ethics, notes that the principle challenge now of a successful startup like Uber is to scale its morality. \n\n\"In the past, technology entrepreneurs created and sold devices,\" Seidman says. \"Today, they create and sell platforms for human behavior, which in turn raises real questions about the social and moral implications of the behavior -- and their underlying values -- on their platforms and about the responsibility that they have for these behaviors. Tech entrepreneurs are obsessed about scaling their business models and products. But they should be just as, if not more, deliberate about scaling their values on their platforms and in their companies. \"\n\nTravis Kalanick should listen to critics like Seidman. If Uber is to succeed, it needs to scale its morality in sync with its fast-growing business. Firing Emil Michael would be a beginning. \n\nIt would say that Uber really is a trustworthy company.

The incident occurred a day after Pyongyang had warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device, and just a week after it tested two medium-range ballistic missiles. \n\nBut should the West greet such saber-rattling with a shrug of the shoulders? After all, Western capitals have been engaging in this \"dance\" for two decades, since the late Kim Jong Il took over as the country's supreme leader.", "text": "Is this latest round of provocations under his son and successor, Kim Jong Un, simply more of what we've seen before? \n\nNot necessarily, argue some of those closely familiar with North Korea. They warn that under Kim Jong Un's rule, Pyongyang has shown an even greater willingness to raise the stakes, whether it be the multiple missile launches over the past several weeks, the way it stoked a crisis last spring when it announced it had ended the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement and moved intermediate missiles to its east coast, or its warning that foreign companies and tourists in South Korea should evacuate. \n\nSouth Korea investigates two suspected North Korea drones\n\nMore recently, in the U.S. intelligence community's annual worldwide threat assessment, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned that North Korea had \"expand(ed) the size of its Yongbyon enrichment facility and restart(ed) the reactor that was previously used for plutonium production\" but was shut down in 2007. \n\n\"The regime still acts in a very belligerent manner, but it seems less predictable, and more random,\" said Christian Whiton, deputy envoy to North Korea during the George W. Bush administration. \n\nTimeline: North Korea nuclear program\n\nThe younger Kim (and young is the right word -- he is still only 31) took office in December 2011, amid questions over how much control he really has over the levers of power, including the country's military of more than 1 million people. \n\nSince then, North Korea has faced additional international sanctions after the launch of a long-range rocket in December 2012, a move that it followed up with the country's third nuclear test, in February 2013. \n\n\"The timing and the intensity of North Korea's provocations (since Kim Jong Un took office) clearly demonstrates a high tolerance for risk,\" said Ellen Kim, assistant director of the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \n\n\"Since (Kim) took power he has purged almost all of his elder guardians ... and filled his surroundings with new faces. We are in a situation where we are learning about him a little bit every day through his unpredictable behavior and actions, which is why the current situation with North Korea is a lot more dangerous than before,\" she said. \n\nBut James Person, coordinator of the North Korea International Documentation Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center, suggested this week's exchange of live fire is not, on its own, too troubling. \n\n\"North Korea actually warned South Korea in advance that they were going to carry out live-fire drills in seven locations. They advised the South to remove ships from the area. All of the shells fell in the water. No land or military installations were targeted,\" Person said. \"This is comparatively a very mild provocation. \"\n\nPerson said the latest incidents might reflect North Korean frustration on a number of issues, not least the recent joint military drills between South Korea and the United States, which Person described as the largest such exercises in two decades. But most important, Person said, is concern in North Korea over the pace of improved relations with South Korea and the United States. \n\nAll just guesswork? \n\nOf course, the most oft-stated problem with speculating on North Korean intentions has been the claim that the information coming out of the country is just too limited to make any concrete assumptions. \n\n\"There are no countries as closed as North Korea. Its citizens aren't allowed to travel, and the few North Korean officials who do go abroad are closely watched. You basically have to go back to Stalin's Soviet Union to find something similar,\" Whiton said. \"This makes it difficult to collect even the most basic background information about what is going on, and recruiting espionage sources is very difficult. The regime is very good at preventing knowledge of its inner workings. \"\n\nSouth Korea captures a North Korean fishing boat\n\nA troubling glimpse of what is going on inside North Korea came with a U.N. report released in February. In a 372-page report, the Commission of Inquiry on Democratic People's Republic of Korea outlined claims of \"extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape ... and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation. \"\n\n\"The gravity, scale, duration and nature of the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country reveal a totalitarian state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,\" the report stated. \n\nYet understanding the inner workings of the regime has proven a tougher nut to crack. This was evident in the speculation that swirled around the younger Kim when it became clear he was the most likely candidate to succeed his father; media reports were full of chatter about whether Kim Jong Un's time at a Swiss boarding school, and his apparent love of basketball, were an indication that he might be more friendly toward the West. \n\nChina, North Korea slam U.N. human rights report\n\nIndeed, according to a leaked cable published by WikiLeaks, Japan's intelligence community was said to have relied in part on the book of a former sushi chef for insights into the elder Kim's behavior. \n\nEven China, the closest thing North Korea has to a reliable ally, doesn't fully understand the power struggle going on at the top of the North Korean regime, suggested Minxin Pei, a leading China watcher and director of the Keck Center for International and Strategic Studies at Claremont McKenna College. The gruesome execution in December of the younger Kim's influential uncle, Jang Song Thaek, for example, \"caught Beijing by surprise,\" Pei said. \n\nBut Person suggested the supposed impenetrability of North Korea might sometimes be overplayed. \n\n\"While North Korea has long defied close scrutiny, there is no void of knowledge about the country. We have much more information to call upon than most care to admit,\" Person said, adding that the Wilson Center for one has spent years \"assembling and translating the diplomatic record of North Korea's former communist allies ... (including) thousands of conversations between North Korean officials, including the supreme leaders, and foreign heads of state and diplomats. \"\n\nThe question confronting policymakers is whether the still inexperienced Kim Jong Un has yet mastered the implications -- and relatively safe limits -- of the brinkmanship that was practiced for so long by his father. \n\n\"North Korea is signaling that they are not shutting the door.

And we are told that in that case, the focus would be exclusively on \"ISIS strongholds\" in order to \"minimize civilian casualties. \"\n\nRemoved from the rhetoric of politicos, though, Western intervention would bolster the propaganda efforts of ISIS, for any attack would inevitably kill or injure Muslim civilians, regardless of how well it had been planned or how good the intelligence behind it was. This would be good news for ISIS. \n\nIndeed, the group actually relies on its ability to attribute civilian casualties to its enemies. By doing so, it bolsters the skewed jihadist narrative of international politics and presents an opportunity to exaggerate the non-existent \"Crusader threat\" and defend the group's false legitimacy. \n\nIn short, the more civilians that die, the more events in Iraq can be internationalized, and the wider the appeal of ISIS can become. This effect would be grossly amplified if there were deaths at the hands of the U.S. or the UK. \n\nAfter all, one of the central tenets of the jihadist narrative is the so-called \"War on Islam.\" Through this much abused paradigm, any international involvement in a conflict involving Muslims is used by jihadists to fortify their ever-tenuous relevance in the modern world. \n\nAnd even were we to set aside all of the above, we still could not in any way justify intervening against ISIS in Iraq but not against Assad in Syria. \n\nRightly or wrongly, this would be read by the region's most vulnerable as incontrovertible evidence that the West will only intervene when its own economic prosperity is at stake. Why else would it defend the rights of civilians here and not against Assad after his apparent use of chemical weapons? \n\nThe West must ignore Baghdad's plea for military assistance. We must not play into the jihadists' hands. \n\nInstead, we must focus on humanitarian assistance for refugees and diplomatic pressure on al-Maliki to force him into profound and far-reaching reforms. \n\nIn the long term, the only solution there can be is a political one: Iraq's economically and politically marginalized Sunnis need to be brought back into Iraq's decision-making process. \n\nBut even if it is not our place to carry out military action, this is not to say that military intervention is categorically inappropriate. Indeed, if the Iraqi national army cannot pull itself together, I would argue it is absolutely necessary. \n\nHowever, it must be at the hands of a Sunni Muslim-majority country, in order to diffuse the narrative of Western armed forces once again attacking Muslims. If a country like Turkey or Jordan acts against it, ISIS's \"War on Islam\" rhetoric would not have anywhere near the same impact. \n\nLeaving its operational and strategic capacity to regional players, the West's focus needs to be on ISIS's ideological heart. \n\nWe need to undermine its greatest rhetorical asset: that Muslims, worldwide, are under attack by the \"Crusading\" West.

I boarded my flight at 11 a.m. and was on the island inside the hour to be met by the helicopter crew. \n\nI knew I was in good hands when I met my pilot, retired military man Col. Andy Largo. His flying career included flying four former Philippine presidents around the country, as well as the late Pope John Paul II. \n\nHe had already flown two sorties that morning to Tacloban but my anxieties grew as he described the flights. He was forced to touch down early on both journeys because of the conditions -- and they were growing worse by the hour. \n\nThe biggest worry, he said, were strong wings that could literally break the rotor blades. If we encountered excessive winds he would reduce the flying speed and edge ahead, waiting for a break in the weather. \n\nI was his only passenger but he took along an engineer to help \"just in case.\" I buckled into the front seat next to Col. Largo and off we went into a murky cloud-filled sky. \n\nIt was surprisingly smooth. We flew at between 1,000 and 2,000 feet over a white-capped sea, towards increasingly thick clouds.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren objected to a GOP provision -- attached to a broad spending bill -- that rolled back a key portion of the Wall Street reform law. Her opposition prompted dozens of Democrats to defect and triggered a last-minute scramble for support; President Barack Obama himself made calls to win lawmakers back and stave off a potential government shutdown. \n\nThe spending bill eventually passed the Senate on Saturday night and on Sunday, Democratic leaders downplayed a possible rift within the party. \n\nBut the nearly 2,000 progressive activists and operatives who descended on Washington over the weekend for the annual Rootscamp gathering felt otherwise. \n\nPanels addressed things like #HillaryProblems and the lack of understanding between the grassroots and establishment wings of the Democratic Party.

More than 300 former Obama campaign staffers signed a letter urging Warren to run for President this week. \n\nClinton, meanwhile, continues to face skepticism from progressives who believe she's too cozy with Wall Street. \n\nAnd while Warren has repeatedly said she's not interested in a run, her supporters believe even having her in the mix, and focusing the conversation on Wall Street reform, could help shape Clinton's potential candidacy. \n\nIndeed, the activity surrounding Warren, and the emerging rift within the party, had even Democratic Party officials on Friday predicting a spirited primary battle for the presidential nomination. \n\n\"Regardless of who decides to run, we're gonna have a really competitive and interesting primary process,\" said Matt Compton, the Democratic National Committee's digital director."}, "2014-republicans-2016_1394_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- The Republican 2016 presidential field is starting to come into focus with potential contenders making notable moves this week.", "prompt": "Here's a breakdown of the latest headlines starting to shape the early race for the Republican nomination. \n\nPortman is out\n\nPollsters can cross one name off their long list: Rob Portman.

Carson came in second place behind Mitt Romney in the survey, which measure support for potential 2016 contenders. \n\nCarson rose to political fame after publicly chiding the direction the country was going during his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 2013. President Barack Obama was sitting just a few feet away. \n\nSince then, he's been likened to a rockstar among conservatives, and he's become the only African-American Republican expressing interest in a 2016 presidential run. His abhorrence for political correctness has also made him a favorite among radio talk shows. \n\n\"I try to talk about what I actually see that's going on and this is what we need in America,\" he told CNN's Mark Preston for a profile piece. \"We need people who are not afraid to express themselves and who are not afraid to debate issues. \"\n\nIn the interview, Carson said that if the right candidate emerges before May 1, he won't run for the White House. \n\nRand Paul is definitely running in 2016 ... for the Senate\n\nWhile Sen. Rand Paul has been saying for more than a year that he plans on running for a second term in the Senate, the Kentucky Republican made it official Tuesday. \n\nBut he has a bumpy road ahead. Kentucky election law allows candidates to appear on a ballot only once at a time, making it difficult for Paul if he also runs for president \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a decision he told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he's about \"four to six months\" away from making. \n\nHis allies in the state Senate tried to help him by passing a bill that tweaks the law, but the measure stalled in the Democratic-controlled state House. \n\nStill, Paul has other options, including a possible court challenge or convincing the state GOP to change its nominating system in 2016 from a primary to a caucus. That way, his name wouldn't appear on a ballot. Or, he could just not appear on the ballot at all and forego Kentucky's delegates. \n\nIt's unclear which direction he'll take, but expect Democrats to seize on Paul's attempt to run for two offices. \n\n\"Where I come from, people think if you can't make up your mind on which office you want to run for, then you ain't fit to serve in either one,\" Kentucky House Speaker Greg Stumbo told CNN. \n\nChris Christie wins high praise from Iowa's top Republican\n\nIn a bizarre 2016 storyline, Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a popular bill that would have banned gestation crates that severely limit the mobility of pigs in New Jersey. \n\nWhile his decision drew strong pushback from animal rights activists and other supporters, the veto kept Christie in high standing with Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa. The Hawkeye State is the nation's top pork producer. \n\nBranstad, who holds significant influence in Iowa's first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest, said Monday that Christie's veto was a \"good decision,\" adding that he personally lobbied Christie to reject the bill. \n\nChristie said he vetoed the bill because it was a \"solution in search of a problem\" and a \"political movement masquerading as substantive policy. \"\n\nBut his opponents say the decision was simply a political ploy with 2016 ambitions on his mind.

His regime's war on its own people resulted in the militarization of the conflict, which in turn took on a sectarian dimension. \n\nIn Iraq, meanwhile, the West ignored the message of Iraqi elections and threw its full support behind Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, despite championing democracy. Yet in office, al-Maliki pursued exclusionary policies that left a large segment of Iraqi society feeling sidelined.", "text": "It was this marginalization that provided ISIS, which now calls itself the Islamic State, an opportunity to exploit the Sunni desire for fairer representation. \n\nBut as much as ISIS claims to be championing Sunnis, it does not in any way represent Islam. The Quran clearly and categorically condemns forced conversion to Islam. It also accepts other religions and prophets as messengers of God, especially those of the other monotheistic religions: Judaism and Christianity. \n\nWhat ISIS is doing -- including its targeting of Christians and Yazidis -- therefore has nothing to do with practices through the ages, from the Levant to Andalusia. Indeed, Arab Christians have been an integral part of Arab history -- the presence of Christians in this part of the world is not an aberration, and Christianity is as part of the history of this region as Islam. \n\nSadly, ISIS has tried to hijack Islam and is often wrongly labeled a Sunni organization. \n\nThis is unfortunate as the vast majority of Sunnis are moderates who should not be tarred with the same brush as the extremist group. In fact, Sunnis have largely been the main victims of ISIS atrocities. \n\nIn Syria, for example, ISIS has often trained its fire on the moderate Free Syrian Army rather than the forces of the al-Assad regime. In Iraq, meanwhile, ISIS has alienated those Sunni tribes that have rejected its extremist practices, while also fighting (predominantly Sunni) Kurdish forces. \n\nSo how should the West and the countries of the Middle East respond to the growing threat that ISIS poses? \n\nThe reality is that force alone will not be enough to uproot ISIS and banish the threat it poses to this region and to the rest of the world. Instead, militias such as ISIS -- typically based on rigid and outdated ideological beliefs -- require a multipronged approach. \n\nYes, military confrontation is an important tool, as is boosting economic and social development in areas affected. But the war on ISIS can't be won unless a key reason for its emergence is not tackled: tyranny and a lack of justice. \n\nTyranny is another face of extremism, and it therefore makes no sense to treat it as if it is a viable alternative to radical agendas. With that in mind, it is high time that world leaders not just claim to cherish democracy, freedom, justice and respect of human rights while merely condemning the acts of dictators. Empty words will do nothing to change their behavior. Instead, the West must offer genuine support for moderate, civil opposition in Syria and Iraq. \n\nThe United States' increased engagement in the region, as signaled by President Barack Obama's speech last Wednesday, is welcome. And the proposed military element -- including airstrikes -- may be successful in containing the threat ISIS poses. \n\nBut to truly eliminate the risk of its resurgence (or its replacement by some other extremist group), the West has to be more engaged in finding lasting solutions to fundamental problems in the region. \n\nWhat are these problems? \n\nIsrael's occupation of Arab lands is one. Another is the vindictive government policies that have left large segments of the Iraqi population frustrated, a problem that could in part be resolved by guaranteeing a true power sharing arrangement. Finally, the Geneva process needs to be restarted with a view to forming a transitional government with a mandate for moving toward democratic rule in Syria. \n\nUnfortunately, some in the West have suggested that keeping al-Assad might even be desirable, believing he is the lesser of two evils. \n\nThis is not only preposterous, but also immoral and completely ignores the Syrian conflict's role in ISIS's emergence in the first place. Indeed, my country has firsthand experience of having to confront extremism stoked by al-Assad's regime -- back in 2007, when I was Prime Minister, we discovered an extremist group called Fatah al Islam appeared to have links to Syrian intelligence. \n\nExperience has shown us that dictatorships are not a sustainable guarantor of peace for minorities. Instead, only the emergence of a democratic and modern civil state, where all individuals are treated equally, regardless of regardless of religion or ethnic grouping, can bring lasting peace and stability. \n\nAnd the West should see in this struggle not only a moral duty to act but also its own long-term interests. Ending the Israeli occupation through the principles of a two-state solution while backing the forces of moderation in the Arab world would undermine the appeal of extremists and pave the way for democratic states that foster stability. \n\nDiversity and pluralism in nations such as Iraq and Syria can be seen as either a challenge or as presenting an opportunity. But one thing should by now be clear to all religious and sectarian actors in the Levant: one group cannot force its lifestyle, opinions or policies onto the other groups. Democracy should not be used as an excuse to marginalize a minority. \n\nFor years, Lebanon was successful in following a principle espoused by President Obama -- \"the principle of no victor and no vanquished.\" He is absolutely right, and governments and others in this region should listen. \n\nBut if the United States wants to see real change, then it will have to empower those moderate forces that are trying to put these fine words into action."}, "2014-sudan-apostasy-appeal_862_en.txt": {"title": "Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- A Sudanese appeals court has started deliberating the case of a woman sentenced to death for refusing to renounce her Christian faith, her husband said.", "prompt": "Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, was condemned to die by hanging last month after she declined to profess she is a Muslim, the religion of her father. \n\nSharia law considers her a Muslim and does not recognize her marriage to a Christian.

Qatar and Saudi Arabia provide most of the outside support for Syria's rebel forces. \n\nThe experts advancing the report are David Crane, the first chief prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone; Sir Desmond de Silva, the former chief prosecutor of the same special court; and Professor Sir Geoffrey Nice, former lead prosecutor against former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. \n\nThey shared their findings in a joint exclusive this week with CNN's \"Amanpour\" and The Guardian newspaper. \n\nThe experts contend their analysis -- based on thousands of photographs of the dead bodies of alleged detainees killed in Syrian government custody -- would stand up in an international criminal tribunal. \n\nIn the photos, lifeless bodies show signs of starvation, brutal beatings, strangulation and other forms of torture and killing, according to the report. \n\n4 things to know about Syria\n\nIn one group of images of 150 individuals examined in detail by the experts, 62% of the bodies showed emaciation -- severely low body weight with a hollow appearance indicating starvation. The majority of all of the victims were men most likely between ages 20 and 40. \n\nStomachs, faces and even legs are concave -- sunken, rather than convex. On some torsos, bruising and bleeding is so severe that the victims' skin is a mosaic of black, red, purple and pink. \n\nOblong and parallel wounds, a mix of bruises and torn skin, line one man's chest and torso, covering every inch of the victim's body from neck to pelvis. \n\nThe forensics team identified the neck bruising as consistent with strangulation with a rope, piece of rubber, or other such object, as opposed to the marks that would be left by a hanging. \n\nDe Silva likened the images to those of Holocaust survivors. \n\nThe emaciated bodies were the product of starvation as a method of torture, \"reminiscent of the pictures of those (who) were found still alive in the Nazi death camps after World War II,\" de Silva said in a CNN interview. \n\nThe report asserts the killing was orchestrated by Syria's highest levels of government. \n\nHaunting images of Syria's abandoned homes\n\nA complex numbering system was used to catalog the corpses, with only the relevant Syrian intelligence service knowing the identities of the corpses. It was an effort, the report says, to keep track of which security service was responsible for the death, and then later to provide false documentation that the person had died in a hospital. \n\nCNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the photographs, documents and testimony referenced in the report and is relying on the conclusions of the team behind it, which includes international criminal prosecutors, a forensic pathologist, an anthropologist and an expert in digital imaging. \n\nThe report draws its evidence from the testimony of a defector dubbed \"Caesar\" and almost 27,000 photographs he provided; in all 55,000 such images were taken out of the country. \n\nCaesar worked as photographer in the military police, and once the war broke out, his work consisted entirely of documenting \"killed detainees,\" the report said. \n\nHe claimed to have photographed as many as 50 bodies a day. \n\nAt one point he took the unusual step of photographing a group of bodies to show that it \"looked like a slaughterhouse,\" according to the report. \n\nRefugees starving to death in Syrian camp\n\nThe fact that all the bodies were photographed, the report's authors say, strongly suggests that \"the killings were systematic, ordered, and directed from above. \"\n\nIt is also possible that far from being a systematic plan to document human rights abuses, photographing the bodies was the unexamined continuation of a long-time practice. \n\nSyria is not a member of the International Criminal Court. The only way the court could prosecute someone from Syria would be through a referral from the United Nations Security Council. \n\nBut because of Russia's support for the al-Assad regime, and because it has veto power on the council, such a referral seems unlikely, at least for now. \n\nMore than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since the revolt against al-Assad began in March 2011, the United Nations says. A communique by last year's Geneva I conference calls for a transitional government and eventual free elections as part of a political settlement to end the war. \n\nAl-Assad has called for this week's conference to include a focus on \"fighting terrorism\" in Syria. Throughout the civil war, Syria has blamed violence on \"terrorists. \"\n\nIn a meeting with Syria's delegates to the talks, al-Assad directed them to preserve their nation's sovereignty by \"preventing and rejecting any foreign interference no matter its form and context,\" Syria's state news agency, SANA, reported Monday. \n\nAl-Assad also said no political solution could be reached without the agreement of the Syrian people and \"first and foremost the complete cessation of terrorism\" and its support by other countries, the news agency said. \n\nSyria peace talks: Russia criticizes rescinding of Iran's invitation"}, "2014-turkey-mevlevi-dervishes_851_en.txt": {"title": "Some call them a secret brotherhood, others refer to them as a spiritual mystery.", "prompt": "The Mevlevis -- or \"Whirling Dervishes\" -- themselves acknowledge that their devotion blurs the line between physical and metaphysical worlds. \n\n\"To die before actually dying, that is what's important in the world, to kill your ego.

The sema ritual exists in spite of controversial laws banning Sufism altogether. \n\nThe Mevlevis' religious association was used as justification to ban the order after the founding of the secular Turkish Republic. In 1925, the founder of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, prohibited all Sufi orders, under Law 677 of the constitution on maintaining order. \n\nIn the 1950s, the government eased the ban, allowing the sema to be performed in public. But it is commonly assumed this move was to boost the tourism industry rather than a sign of religious tolerance and private worship by the order remains officially banned. \n\nThe tourism industry is the main source of income for the Dervishes, with members of the public giving donations to watch them worship. \n\nEach December, there is a huge festival in Konya, where Celaladin Rumi founded the order in the 13th century. At the \"Seb-i-Arus,\" curious observers can watch Mevlevi associations performing the religious ceremony together. Tickets went on sale this month for the ceremony, which runs from December 7-17 every year. \n\nAt the beginning of each sema ceremony, the disciples stand with their arms closed to their chest and feet pointed inward. Young and old Mevlevis do this out of respect and to signify humility, fighting their ego through a spiritual journey inside and outside of the Dervish lodge. \n\nIlyas Noyan Ozatik, the head of the reed flute players accompanying the Ankara semazens in Istanbul, says the Mevlevis \"are on an inner journey of oneself to where God is. \"\n\nMusic is a unifying force he says, bringing \"our frequencies together leading to a completion of souls. \"\n\nThis passionate inner battle reflects their relationship with the outside world. When asked about the turmoil in the Middle East,  Lora points to an old British saying: \"if you want a clean street, every shop owner must clean the front of their own shop. \"\n\nMevlevis strive for universal peace, but believe that peace must begin in the hearts of individuals. \n\nAs the Dervishes turn, mesmerized and apparently staring into blank space, their spirit takes control and leads them across the age-old prayer space. \n\nThey glide effortlessly in circles, their white robes rising and falling, thinking all the while of their act as a bridge from God to earth."}, "2014-ukraine-crisis_965_en.txt": {"title": "Billionaire Petro Poroshenko declared victory Sunday in Ukraine's presidential election, following preliminary exit polls that suggested he got 56% of the vote.", "prompt": "His closest challenger, former Ukrainian prime minister and leader of the Batkivshchyna party Yulia Tymoshenko, conceded the election after exit polls showed her with 13% of the vote. \n\nPoroshenko, a candy tycoon known as the \"Chocolate King,\" is also a seasoned politician. \n\nThe election took place Sunday despite a recent wave of deadly violence in the east and threats by pro-Russia separatists to prevent citizens from casting their ballots. \n\nVoters were picking a successor to ousted pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych in a country torn apart by Russia's takeover of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and bloody conflict with pro-Russia factions.", "text": "The unrest has centered in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where separatists have claimed independence following a disputed referendum earlier this month -- and many there did not get to cast ballots Sunday. \n\nAs of 3 p.m. (8 a.m. ET), some 528 polling sites out of 2,430 were open in the Donetsk region, the regional administration said.

The reason? They happen to be born in the U.S. territory of American Samoa instead of somewhere else in the United States.", "prompt": "Cevallos gets the basic unfairness of it all right: \"The United States laid claim to these eastern islands of a South Pacific archipelago in 1900, and since that time, American Samoans have served in the U.S. military, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\" But his conclusion that \"citizenship for them is not a constitutional right\" because \"only Congress can choose to grant citizenship to territorial inhabitants\" rests on an assumption that has no basis in the Constitution or any decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. \n\nIt is easy to see where this assumption comes from.", "text": "After the United States acquired Puerto Rico and other territories in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, the Supreme Court decided a series of deeply divided and controversial cases known as the Insular Cases. \n\nWhile none of these cases addressed constitutional issues relating to citizenship, Justice Henry Billings Brown wrote an opinion in Downes v. Bidwell that suggested, in passing, that citizenship was not a fundamental right in these newly acquired areas, which were populated by what he called \"alien races.\"\n\nAlthough his opinion was not joined by a single other justice, it was good enough for those in Congress who thought birthright citizenship was not such a great idea for the inhabitants of these areas, who did not look like or speak like them. \n\nThe assumption that Congress controls citizenship in overseas territories has survived since, but not without disagreement in the lower courts. \n\nLeneuoti Tuaua, the Samoan Federation of America, and several others born in American Samoa are challenging this faulty assumption in a federal lawsuit  pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. They argue that so long as American Samoa is under the U.S. flag, with American Samoa's sons and daughters fighting and dying to defend that flag, the U.S. Constitution guarantees them birthright citizenship, regardless of what Congress has said. \n\nWhat does the Constitution itself say? The Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment -- part of the Constitution since 1868 -- states that \"All persons born ... in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. \"\n\nThe great Chief Justice John Marshall explained decades earlier that the Constitution used the phrase \"the United States\" as \"the name given to our great republic, which is composed of states and territories. \"\n\nIt is no surprise then that those who drafted the Citizenship Clause understood its guarantees to extend to U.S. territories, explaining that \"the first section (of the 14th Amendment) refers to persons everywhere, whether in the states or in the territories or in the District of Columbia.\" Just four years after the Citizenship Clause was ratified, the Supreme Court stated that the clause \"put to rest\" the notion that \"those ... who had been born and resided always in the District of Columbia or in the territories, though within the United States, were not citizens. \"\n\nThis original understanding makes sense. The 14th Amendment was intended to overturn the Supreme Court's infamous Dred Scott decision and put the question of citizenship by birth on all U.S. soil beyond Congress' power to deny. In 1868, nearly half of all land in the United States was in a U.S. territory. An amendment that failed to guarantee citizenship in U.S. territories would not have been much of an amendment at all. \n\nBirthright citizenship remains a hotly debated topic. But there is a remarkable cross-ideological consensus among legal scholars about what exactly the Constitution guarantees when it comes to birthright citizenship. \n\nFormer U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson, who represented President Bush in Bush v. Gore, and Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe, a renowned liberal scholar, argued in a 2008 joint memo that Sen. John McCain was eligible to run for president based solely on his place of birth: the Panama Canal Zone, a former U.S. territory. \n\nOlson and Tribe explained that \"birth on soil that is under the sovereignty of the United States, but not within a state\" satisfies the requirement for being a \" 'natural born' citizen,\" in light of \"the well-established principle that 'natural born' citizenship includes birth within the territory and allegiance of the United States.\" \n\nPresident Clinton's Solicitor General Walter Dellinger and former Texas Solicitor General James Ho have echoed similar views on the geographic scope of birthright citizenship. \n\nWhat the Insular Cases mean for U.S. territories today also remains hotly debated. On Wednesday the Harvard Law School is holding a conference titled \"Reconsidering the Insular Cases,\" with federal Circuit Judge Juan Torruella delivering the keynote address \"The Insular Cases: A Declaration of Their Bankruptcy.\" Torruella has long compared the Insular Cases to Plessy v. Ferguson, criticizing the Insular Cases as establishing a race-based doctrine of \"separate and unequal\" status for residents of overseas U.S. territories. \n\nIn 2008, the Supreme Court also expressed skepticism of the idea that Congress has the power to deny constitutional rights in current U.S. territories, stating that \"it may well be that over time the ties between the United States and any of its unincorporated territories strengthen in ways that are of constitutional significance.\" The court went on to explain that \"the Constitution grants Congress and the president the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply. \"\n\nAlthough the Constitution grants Congress broad powers in U.S. territories, one that it clearly withholds is the power to rewrite the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship. Denying citizenship in American Samoa is not just unfair, it's unconstitutional. \n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Neil Weare."}, "2014-west-virginia-school-controversy_1357_en.txt": {"title": "(CNN) -- The legacy of the Hatfields vs. the McCoys looms large in Mingo County, West Virginia.", "prompt": "Now, in the same mountainous county along the Kentucky state line where blood was spilled and lives were lost in the famed feud nearly a century ago, two new sides are squaring off over serious allegations of repeated sexual assault on two schoolgirls by two male classmates. And there are claims of sham investigations and \"punishment\" that in one case allegedly amounted to denying the accused an ice-cream break. \n\nThe case moved behind closed doors Friday at the Mingo County courthouse, where two school district officials and four faculty members made their first appearance in a courtroom for a hearing a week after the state's top lawyer accused them in a civil complaint of concealing alleged sexual abuse at a Mingo County middle school.", "text": "West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a request for a civil injunction last week in which he alleges that two female students were victims of sexual assaults over the course of the year at the hands of two seventh-grade boys. According to the filing, abuse of the two 13-year-old Burch Middle School students, also in the seventh grade, took place on multiple occasions between November 2012 and May 2013. \n\nThe attorney general says in the filing that two boys would work in concert: one would restrain their victim while the other groped her \"breasts, genitalia (and) buttocks. \"\n\nMost of the alleged attacks Morrisey outlines in the filing took place at the school, except for a class trip to the state capital of Charleston, where one of the girls said she was raped. \n\nNames of neither the boys nor the girls have been released, but the attorney general's court filing identifies the suspects as Juvenile 1 and Juvenile 2, and states they are both relatives of employees of the Mingo County school system. \n\nMingo County Prosecuting Attorney Teresa Maynard told CNN that she first learned of the investigation last week after Morrisey filed the request for an injunction. She said she met with the attorney general on Friday and explained to him that her office must be part of the investigation from now on -- and it didn't take her very long to show that she meant it: Maynard filed juvenile charges against both of the boys on Friday. She would not divulge what those charges were. \n\nMaynard has not brought charges against any other parties, but the attorney general did name a handful of teachers and administrators as defendants in the court filing requesting a civil injunction -- which is not to be confused with the filing of criminal charges. \n\nAttorney General Morrisey declined to be interviewed for this article, but West Virginia State Police Public Information Officer Lt. Mike Baylous explained that a civil injunction -- like the one requested by Morrisey in this case -- is an \"extreme\" court order that is made for the purpose of restraining the defendant -- or in this case, the defendants - from pursuing any conduct that amounts to harassment. \n\nThe attorney general made the case in his complaint that he has ample reason to believe that a state investigation would be stymied. As abhorrent as the allegations are themselves, Morrissey says they are not why he is taking this action; he's doing that because, he said \"the overall handling of the allegations was inherently flawed and tainted with conflicts of interest. \"\n\nThat may seem like an understatement in a 32-page complaint that details allegations of disappearing evidence, connected suspects, sham investigations, deceitful and vengeful administrators, and refusals to cooperate with law enforcement. \n\nMingo County, going back to the Hatfield-McCoy days, has earned an unsavory reputation, thanks to nepotism, cronyism and a spectacular history of vendettas and public corruption. \n\nIn the last few years Mingo's sheriff was assassinated, its only circuit judge and prosecutor both went to prison on conspiracy charges in an unrelated case, and a county commissioner pleaded guilty to extortion. Just this week, the mayor of the county's largest city pleaded guilty to lying to federal authorities in a workers' compensation case. \n\nNot even the Mingo school system seems to be immune from controversy. Court filings cite repeated examples of school officials allegedly protecting the accused in the seventh-grade sexual assault allegations, and claim that \"a relative of (one of the boys) was directly involved in the handling and investigation into the allegations against (him), and involved in decisions relating to the discipline/punishment of the male juvenile offenders. \"\n\nThat investigation, according to Morrisey's injunction request, was \"ineffective, non-existent, (and) designed (to) illicit contradictory and/or less incriminating statements from the female victims. \"\n\nWhen punishment was doled out, the attorney general characterized it as a mockery. In one instance, for example, a school official \"'disciplined' (the boys) for the alleged abuse of a female student by denying them a break for ice cream during statewide testing,\" the attorney general's court filing said. \n\nThe attorney general says the problems go beyond alleged efforts to sweep the accusations under the carpet. Morrisey's complaint said Burch Middle School teachers and administrators \"threatened (the girls) with discipline\" to dissuade them from coming forward, and the alleged victims were retaliated against when they did. \n\nThe day after one of the alleged victims alerted state police in April 2014, she was written up for bullying. Morrisey wrote that the \"bullying\" was actually the victim blocking her Facebook account from the niece of a teacher at the school. The next day she was written up again, this time for \"insubordination,\" according to the filing. \n\nThe attorney general alleges that the other victim says she was targeted as well: the injunction request states that a high-ranking Burch official \"retaliated against (her) by removing her from her classes and placing her in other classes that were below her academic level. \"\n\nWhen West Virginia State Police showed up at Burch on April 24, the principal refused to allow a trooper to take a statement from a possible third victim, according to the court filing. The principal \"went an additional step further and informed the State Trooper investigating the alleged sexual abuse at the school that he could no longer take statements from students at Burch Middle School because it 'disrupted the learning environment.' \"\n\nCNN tried repeatedly to reach the teachers and administrators at Burch Middle School named in the filing for comment on the allegations, but multiple e-mails and phone messages were never returned. \n\nJason Long, the attorney representing the Mingo County Board of Education and the Mingo County school superintendent, released a statement that said \"the Mingo County Board of Education is committed to working with the attorney general's office to resolve this investigation in a timely manner. The hearing today gathered everyone involved and opened a dialogue. We take these allegations very seriously. Be assured our goal is to create a safe learning environment for all students of Mingo County. \"\n\nCNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report."}, "2015-australia-tony-abbott-confidence-vote_823_en.txt": {"title": "Sydney, Australia (CNN)It was an unbecoming way for the Australian prime minister to begin the week.

The principle of cabinet solidarity meant the prime minister went in to the meeting with nearly 40 votes secured. \n\nDespite a significant block of lawmakers opposing their leader, the Liberal Party's whip, Phillip Ruddock, a former immigration minister, said there was no debate and that \"the result is clear. \"\n\nThe meeting originally scheduled for Tuesday was brought forward a day, to prevent the prime minister's detractors caucusing in Canberra ahead of the first week of parliament this year. The move was a \"captain's call\" quipped his nemesis, the immensely popular Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull who was being urged to show his hand and pledge to stand for the top job in the event the motion to vacate the position was successful. \n\nIn the end, Turnbull skated close to declaring his candidacy but stopped short. He would now have been obliged to resign from the Cabinet had he done so. \n\nHe may well have won the vote, but the fact 39 out of 102 members of the party have declared a lack of confidence in their prime minister leaves Abbott very exposed.  In recent Australian political history, no leader who has faced such a challenge, itself a vote of no confidence, has gone on to survive the wrath of colleagues. \n\nAll have eventually been overthrown. But for now Abbott has at least spared himself the indignity of becoming the shortest serving first term prime minister ousted by his own party. \n\nWhile lawmakers remain angry by his failure to sell the government's first budget, which has stalled in the country's upper house, Abbott has been accused of not consulting his colleagues on big decisions, among them a botched paid maternity leave scheme, widely seen as favoring the wealthy, and the bizarre knighting of Prince Philip. \n\nHe seemed to consolidate this view of him as a non-collegiate player by calling Monday's vote a day earlier than anticipated and without apparent consultation, even with his deputy whose job would also have been vacated had the no-confidence vote succeeded. \n\nAustralians have looked on at the shenanigans in their capital with a mixture of delight and dismay. Those who dislike the government were divided by a desire to see the end of Abbott's government and the fear that replacing him with Turnbull would spell disaster for the Australian Labor Party's chances at the next election. Others raised concerns about tossing out leaders when unpopular decisions are taken. \n\nNews Corp political commentator Paul Kelly noted that the apparently new political culture of tossing out leaders who make unpopular decisions was damaging the ability of government to govern. \n\n\"The politicians will try to deny it -- but our system is moving inexorably into a 'death of reform' straitjacket,\" he wrote. \n\nThe 2016 election is likely to be dominated by political advice to Liberal and Labor not to provoke the voters. This will put Australia on a long-run trajectory of decline and growing unhappiness. \n\nThere is broad agreement that frequent leadership changes are not good for Australia.
