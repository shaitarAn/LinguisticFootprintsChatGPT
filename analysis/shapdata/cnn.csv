"The news article is about a Ghanaian football player named Ayew, who earned the nickname ""Pele"" due to his impressive skills on the pitch. Like his namesake, Ayew displayed remarkable athleticism and technique, leaving defenders in awe with his blistering pace.  Ayew started his professional career in 1978 when he signed a contract with Real Tamale United in Ghana. However, it didn't take long for him to catch the attention of foreign scouts, paving the way for African footballers at a time when few players from the continent had major international careers. He spent time playing for teams in Qatar and Benin before making his move to France's second division.  In 1987, Ayew joined Marseille, one of France's top clubs. Unfortunately, his initial spell with Marseille was short-lived as he faced racial abuse from teammates who didn't accept him. Frustrated by their actions and derogatory remarks like ""go back to where you come from"" and ""go back to the bush,"" Ayew decided to leave Marseille after just one year.  He went on to play for rivals Lille, impressing everyone with his exceptional performances. This made Marseille's club president realize what they had lost and sparked their interest in signing Ayew once again. Although initially hesitant due to past experiences, Ayew's wife convinced him to return and prove himself as the best.  Ayew rejoined Marseille in 1990 and enjoyed three successful years at the club culminating in a historic victory over Italian giants AC Milan in the 1993 Champions League final. Winning this prestigious tournament fulfilled every footballer's dream for Ayew and made him proud of being one of the first African players to achieve such an accomplishment.  Not only did Ayew excel at club level but he also captained Ghana's national team for six years starting from 1990. He played an instrumental role during this period and scored 33 goals in 67 appearances for the Black Stars. Ayew also participated in a record five Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.  After retiring from professional football in 2000, Ayew didn't lose his passion for the sport. He now dedicates his time and resources to coaching and mentoring young players in Ghana. Apart from teaching them the fundamentals of football, Ayew also focuses on preparing them to face challenges similar to the ones he overcame.  Ayew acknowledges that not every aspiring player will achieve a successful professional career but emphasizes the importance of respecting and disciplining oneself both on and off the field. He believes that preparing young athletes to navigate society is equally significant and strives to instill these values through his coaching efforts.  In summary, Ayew's story highlights his journey as a talented Ghanaian footballer who faced racial abuse but persevered through resilience and skill, ultimately becoming an African pioneer in international football. Today, he uses his experience and knowledge to guide future generations of players towards not just sporting success but also personal growth within society. In addition to coaching and mentoring young players, Ayew continues to be involved in football. He has passed on his love for the sport to his three sons, who are following in his footsteps by pursuing professional careers as well. This family legacy further solidifies Ayew's passion for the game and its ability to bring people together across generations.  Ayew's impact extends beyond Ghana. His success and dedication have made him a respected figure in African football, serving as an inspiration for aspiring players across the continent. He has paved the way for future African talent, showing that they have the potential to compete at the highest levels of international football.  Throughout his illustrious career, Ayew not only showcased exceptional skills but also exhibited leadership qualities as captain of Ghana's national team. His role extended beyond scoring goals and making plays on the field; he became a symbol of pride for Ghanaians worldwide. By leading his country in multiple Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, Ayew embodied perseverance and determination—qualities essential for success both individually and collectively.  Retirement from professional playing did not diminish Ayew's commitment to football or desire to contribute positively to society. Through coaching and mentoring, he seeks not only to cultivate talented players but also instill valuable life lessons such as respect and discipline—essential qualities that transcend the boundaries of sport.  Ayew understands that while some young athletes may not achieve glittering careers on football pitches, teaching them values important outside of sports will help them thrive within society. By emphasizing respect and discipline alongside sporting abilities, he aims to mold well-rounded individuals who can contribute positively wherever their paths may lead.  Ayew's story is a testament not only to his personal achievements but also serves as a reminder of what can be accomplished through hard work, resilience, and self-belief—a message applicable beyond sports arenas. His journey from facing adversity due to racial abuse within Marseille's ranks to becoming one of Africa's most renowned footballers illustrates the power of determination and perseverance in overcoming challenges.  In conclusion, Ayew's legacy goes beyond his achievements on the pitch. He is a role model for aspiring African players, a symbol of pride for Ghana, and a driven individual dedicated to shaping young athletes' lives both within and outside of sports. Through coaching and mentoring, Ayew aims to inspire the next generation while promoting essential values such as respect and discipline that will guide them on their journeys, be it as professional footballers or productive members of society.",explain
"This news article discusses the ongoing unrest and voting situation in Ukraine. The main focus of the unrest is in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where separatists have claimed independence following a disputed referendum earlier this month. Many people were unable to cast their ballots on election day, as only a fraction of polling sites were open in these regions. In the Donetsk region, for example, only 528 out of 2,430 polling sites were operational.  Although voting was progressing normally in other parts of Ukraine, excluding Donetsk and Luhansk regions, voter turnout was relatively low at nearly 38% by 3 p.m. local time. In the city of Donetsk itself, where pro-Russia militias are concentrated, there were no open polling stations at all.  The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) deployed 900 observers for the election – its largest mission ever. Despite some instances of intimidation and violence reported in eastern Ukraine leading up to the elections, with armed separatist groups seeking to disrupt voting processes, Ukrainian acting President Oleksandr Turchynov described the polls as open and transparent.  U.S. President Barack Obama congratulated Ukrainians for participating in the elections despite attempts by Russian-backed separatists to block them. He criticized these separatist groups for their actions but commended the efforts made by Ukrainians and their government to carry out these elections under such circumstances.  Intimidation appears widespread across eastern Ukraine due to increasing violence related to pro-Russia militants who Kiev authorities accuse Russia of backing indirectly. There have been reports of large separatist rallies held in central Donetsk city square with militants on trucks firing guns into the air while chanting pro-Russia slogans.  Residents also claim they saw new billboards urging them not to vote appear overnight before election day in southeastern city Mariupol while social media discussions mention requests from local Russia supporters to boycott elections taking place there.  In rebel stronghold Slovyansk, the self-declared mayor has announced that anyone who attempts to vote will be arrested. Furthermore, an Italian journalist and a Russian citizen were killed near this area during clashes. There are reports of mortar fire in Slovyansk as well.  Overall, the article highlights the challenges faced during the Ukrainian elections due to ongoing unrest, violence, intimidation tactics by separatist groups supported by Russia. It also captures some positive aspects such as Ukrainians still trying to exercise their right to vote despite these obstacles and international support for ensuring transparency in the elections. The article highlights the contrast between the voting situation in eastern Ukraine, specifically in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and the rest of the country. While polling stations were open and functioning smoothly in many parts of Ukraine, including cities outside the unrest-affected areas, this was not the case in Donetsk.  The lack of open polling stations in Donetsk suggests that pro-Russia militias have a strong presence and control over the region. The fact that a CNN team driving through Donetsk could not find a single operational polling station further demonstrates this control. However, there were reports of some voters attempting to reach polling stations located west and south of Donetsk.  The role of international observers from organizations like OSCE is crucial during these elections to ensure transparency and legitimacy. With 900 observers deployed - their largest mission ever - they are tracking any irregularities or instances of intimidation across Ukraine. This monitoring is essential for maintaining trust in the electoral process.  President Obama's statement applauding Ukrainians for participating in spite of attempts to disrupt voting reflects international support for Ukraine's democratic aspirations. He condemns Russian-backed separatist groups for trying to disenfranchise entire regions but praises Ukrainian citizens' resolve to cast their ballots despite these challenges.  Within eastern Ukraine, particularly towns like Slovyansk and Mariupol mentioned in the article, there are clear instances where local authorities or armed groups associated with separatism have attempted to influence or suppress voter turnout through intimidation tactics and threats of arrest.  The mention of an Italian journalist being killed near Slovyansk underscores just how volatile the situation is on the ground. This incident raises concerns about media freedom as journalists covering conflicts often face significant risks while performing their duties.  Overall, this news article portrays a complex electoral landscape in Ukraine characterized by regional disparities due to ongoing conflict between separatist forces supported by Russia and Ukrainian government forces seeking stability and territorial integrity throughout their country. The elections serve as a test both within Ukraine itself as well as in terms of international relations, with observers closely monitoring the situation and the world watching to see if Ukraine can successfully hold fair and free elections despite the challenging circumstances.",explain
"This news article discusses various topics related to the 2012 presidential election and how they influenced the campaigns of both Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama.   Firstly, it highlights the differences between Romney and Obama's views on the war on terror and Russia. Romney referred to Russia as ""our number one geopolitical foe,"" which drew criticism for being stuck in a Cold War mentality. However, tensions between Russia and the United States have escalated due to issues such as Edward Snowden's asylum, disagreements on Syria and Iran, leading some politicians like Senator John McCain to call for a reevaluation of U.S.-Russia relations.  The article then touches upon another significant issue in the election: Romney's stance on the auto bailout in Detroit. While Obama supported providing assistance to save the struggling industry, Romney argued for a managed bankruptcy without taxpayer dollars. The article mentions how this disagreement resonated with voters, especially in light of later news about Detroit going bankrupt.  Furthermore, the article briefly discusses Romney's controversial statement about 47% of Americans who would not vote for him no matter what. This comment was seen as dismissive toward a large portion of American voters and created negative perceptions around his campaign.  Overall, these different storylines surrounding Russia, Detroit's bankruptcy, and remarks made by Romney ultimately impacted his campaign negatively. The national dialogue has now shifted to future political developments focusing on potential 2016 GOP contenders rather than revisiting these past events from the 2012 election cycle. In the remaining part of the news article, it is mentioned that while these issues had an impact on Romney's candidacy, they have become part of the past as the national dialogue has moved on. Romney has retired from national politics, and discussions have shifted towards potential 2016 GOP contenders.  The article implies that the controversies surrounding Romney's views on Russia and his position on the auto bailout in Detroit played a role in shaping public opinion during the 2012 election. However, given that eight months have passed since then, these topics are now considered historical events rather than ongoing debates.  It notes that during this period, Romney became a grandfather to four new grandchildren but also mentions how his statement regarding the 47% of Americans who wouldn't vote for him still lingered as a significant issue. In this regard, an excerpt from Washington Post writer Dan Balz provides more insight into Romney's perspective and attempts to clarify his comments.  Despite these past controversies, particularly relating to Russia and Detroit, political focus has shifted towards potential candidates for future elections. The mention of three potential Republican contenders heading to South Carolina suggests that speculation about presidential campaigns continues even after the 2012 election cycle has concluded.  In conclusion, while certain issues like Romney's stance on Russia and Detroit's bankruptcy influenced opinions during the last election cycle, they are now seen as historical events rather than current topics. The article highlights how political discussions evolve over time and redirect attention towards future possibilities in American politics.",explain
"This news article is about a woman named Meriam Ibrahim, who is seeking asylum in the United States after being convicted of apostasy and sentenced to death in Sudan. Meriam's husband, Daniel Wani, who is an American citizen, is asking U.S. officials to expedite the asylum process for his wife because he fears for their lives if they have to remain in Sudan.  The court convicted Meriam of apostasy on May 15th when she was eight months pregnant. She gave birth to a baby girl while in prison and has been detained with her 20-month-old son since then. Despite being imprisoned with two infants, her husband says that she remains committed to her Christian beliefs.  Meriam's case has gained international attention, and her husband is appealing New Hampshire's U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte for assistance. He hopes that they can help expedite the asylum process and ensure the safety of their family.  In Sudan, there are pressures from Muslim religious leaders for Meriam to renounce her Christian faith and return to Islam. However, she maintains that she was never a Muslim as her father deserted the family when she was young, and she was raised as a Christian by her Ethiopian Orthodox mother.  There are concerns that Meriam could face execution once it is determined that she is no longer nursing or pregnant because under Sharia law practiced in Sudan, pregnant women cannot be sentenced until two years after they give birth.  Meriam's arrest came after Muslim relatives accused her of renouncing Islam when they discovered that she had married a Christian man named Daniel Wani. Her brother has even stated that if Meriam refuses to repent from Christianity, then she should be executed.  Initially, Meriam was charged with adultery due to marrying outside of Islam but later accused of apostasy when she maintained her Christian identity despite pressure from authorities.  CNN reached out to the Sudanese government for comment but was denied, with the justice minister stating that they do not comment on matters going through the courts. Attempts to contact Sudan's foreign affairs minister were also unsuccessful.  The article concludes by noting that Meriam's case highlights the issue of religious freedom and human rights in Sudan. Daniel Wani hopes that his wife's new daughter does not hasten her death sentence, and he remains hopeful for a positive outcome in their efforts to seek asylum in the United States.  In summary, this news article discusses Meriam Ibrahim's fight for asylum in the United States after being sentenced to death for apostasy in Sudan. It highlights her commitment to her Christian faith, pressures she faces from Muslim relatives and religious leaders, and efforts by her American husband to expedite the asylum process for their family's safety. Continuing from the previous explanation, the news article sheds light on the differing accounts of Meriam Ibrahim's situation. Her husband, Daniel Wani, claims that she has been a committed Christian and was raised in that faith by her Ethiopian Orthodox mother.  However, one of Meriam's brothers, Al-Samani al-Hadi, tells a different story. He accuses Wani of feeding his sister ""potions"" to convert her to Christianity and insists that she should repent for leaving Islam. If she refuses to do so, he believes she should be executed.  The case initially started with charges of adultery against Meriam for marrying a Christian man outside of Islam. Then, when she maintained her Christian identity during court proceedings and denied ever being a Muslim herself, the apostasy accusation was added. As a result of these charges and convictions, Meriam has been detained since January 17th.  This case has sparked international outrage because it raises concerns about religious freedom and human rights in Sudan. Many individuals and organizations have condemned Sudanese authorities for their treatment of Meriam Ibrahim.  Daniel Wani is appealing to U.S. officials to expedite the asylum process for his wife because he fears for their lives if they are forced to remain in Sudan even after her potential release from prison. He particularly worries about potential harm coming not only to himself but also his wife and their two children.  Seeking assistance from New Hampshire's U.S Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte shows the desperate measures Daniel is taking to protect his family from what he perceives as grave danger in Sudan due to religious differences.  The article concludes by noting that CNN reached out multiple times to seek comments on this matter from both the Sudanese government and its justice ministry but did not receive any official response or interviews regarding this specific case going through the courts. Meriam Ibrahim's plight continues as international attention focuses on her fight for justice and freedom while she remains imprisoned with her young children.",explain
"This news article discusses a recent ruling by a U.S. District Court Judge in Utah that struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage. In his ruling, Judge Robert J. Shelby stated that the state's current laws denying gay and lesbian citizens their right to marry were unconstitutional and demeaning to same-sex couples. The judge also argued that the Constitution protects the rights of same-sex couples to marry and have their marriages recognized by the government.  The lawsuit against Utah's ban on same-sex marriage was brought by one gay couple and two lesbian couples who wanted to get married but were unable to do so due to the state's constitutional prohibition. The decision was met with joy from advocates for marriage equality, such as GLAAD, who celebrated this step towards equal rights for loving and committed couples.  However, Governor Gary R. Herbert expressed disappointment in the ruling, calling Judge Shelby an ""activist federal judge."" He stated that he would work with his legal counsel and attorney general in defending traditional marriage within Utah.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also expressed its support for traditional marriage while emphasizing respect for all individuals. The church believed that voters made the right decision when they determined through a constitutional amendment that marriage should be between a man and a woman.  On the other hand, proponents of marriage equality praised Judge Shelby's ruling as thoughtful and based on previous Supreme Court decisions regarding same-sex marriage. They believed it would ultimately be upheld by higher courts.  The article notes that although Utah has filed an appeal against the decision, they did not request an immediate halt to marriages being performed between same-sex couples during this process. As a result, many people proceeded with getting married without restrictions from Friday evening onwards.  The article also highlights how different states across America vary in their stance on same-sex marriage laws - some have banned it through constitutional amendments or state law while others have legalized it. Furthermore, 16 other countries (and parts of Mexico) have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships.  The overall sentiment expressed in the article is that the issue of same-sex marriage is gaining momentum, with more courts and states leaning towards recognizing marriage equality. The changing attitudes towards acceptance of gay and lesbian individuals, particularly among younger generations, are seen as significant factors contributing to this shift.  In conclusion, this news article covers a recent ruling by a U.S. District Court Judge striking down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage. It presents various perspectives from both supporters and opponents of marriage equality while highlighting the ongoing debate surrounding this issue across different states and countries. The article also sheds light on the historical context of same-sex marriage in the United States. It mentions that President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in 1996, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman and banned federal recognition of same-sex marriages. However, in June 2013, parts of DOMA were rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in a landmark decision.  The article notes that while the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet issued a national opinion on same-sex marriage, lower courts and states have been active in addressing this issue independently. This indicates a growing momentum towards recognizing equal rights for LGBTQ+ individuals.  Carl Tobias, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Richmond, weighs in on this trend and suggests that greater acceptance of gays and lesbians, particularly among young people, has contributed to the changing tide. He argues that as more people come into contact with LGBTQ+ individuals through their families, friends, or workplaces, they see no reason to deny them equal rights.  The article concludes by highlighting how quickly progress is being made towards achieving marriage equality nationwide. It recognizes that challenges remain with many states still banning same-sex marriage through constitutional amendments or state laws. Nevertheless, it remains optimistic about future developments within both legal circles and public opinion regarding this issue.  Overall, this news article provides an overview of an important ruling regarding same-sex marriage in Utah and contextualizes it within the broader landscape of LGBTQ+ rights across America. It offers differing viewpoints from various stakeholders involved while emphasizing societal shifts towards greater acceptance and recognition for loving relationships regardless of sexual identity or orientation.

"This news article discusses the author's perspective on the Iraq War and reflects on the reasons behind its occurrence, as well as the lessons that can be learned from it. The author, who headed the U.N. inspections in Iraq at the time of the war, highlights some key points regarding the war's objectives and outcomes.  The article begins by stating that after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there was a desire within George W. Bush's administration to take action against more ""evil actors"" beyond Afghanistan's Taliban regime. Iraq and its dictator, Saddam Hussein, became targets for this desire to punish and eliminate perceived threats.  However, according to the author, while Saddam Hussein being overthrown may have been a positive outcome of the war, most of its other objectives were not achieved. The war aimed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), but no such weapons were found in Iraq. Additionally, it aimed to eliminate al Qaeda in Iraq but they didn't exist there until after the invasion. Furthermore, instead of transforming Iraq into a model democracy based on law, it led to anarchy and violations of laws during wartime. Lastly, rather than creating a friendly base against Iran with U.S. troops stationed in Baghdad if needed for action against Iran; instead Iran gained a new ally within Baghdad.  The author reveals that although various reasons were presented by different parts of Bush's administration for going to war with Iraq focusing mainly on eradicating WMDs because it was an acceptable rationale for all parties involved including public opinion as well as Congress support.  While acknowledging that suspicions existed about remaining biological and chemical weapons from previous wars between Iraq and Iran based on Iraqi obstruction during U.N inspections throughout 1990s; no evidence supporting these suspicions was found during their inspection process conducted by U.N inspectors reporting their findings accordingly - US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld dismissed these reports claiming ""absence of evidence is not evidence absence."" The author agrees with Rumsfeld's logic but believes that it was not an excuse for the American and British governments to mislead the world by crediting fake evidence or assume existence based on ""unaccounted for"" items.  The author emphasizes the importance of paying equal attention to reports based on professional inspections conducted on the ground. During this period, international reports were ignored by some members of the alliance of willing states which could have dissuaded them from launching a war justified by false evidence.  The article also mentions that the author's offices may have been bugged during this time, indicating potential surveillance on their activities and views. They express regret that if they were bugged, those listening did not pay more attention to their insights.  Finally, in regards to arguments made by political leaders who emphasized acting in good faith and intelligence suggesting Iraq's intentions to revive weapons programs after sanctions; ultimately these grounds for war were perceived as flimsy. The author questions their judgment in bringing war and death upon a country without strong evidence or proof of Iraq being a threat at that time.  In conclusion, the article highlights lessons learned from the Iraq War - primarily cautioning against overconfidence in military might and stressing the importance of thoroughly evaluating intelligence information before making significant decisions regarding warfare. The author encourages equal consideration for multimillion-dollar international reports compiled through professional inspections.",explain
"The news article discusses the concept of an ""antibiotic winter,"" which refers to the potential consequences of overusing antibiotics. The article highlights how our resident microbes, also known as our microbiome, play a crucial role in protecting us from invading bacteria. Studies conducted on mice showed that when they were given antibiotics before being exposed to salmonella, it took a significantly smaller number of organisms to infect them compared to mice who hadn't received antibiotics.  This phenomenon was further supported by a massive outbreak of salmonella in Chicago in 1985. Those who had received antibiotics in the month prior to becoming ill were five times more likely to become sick than those who hadn't taken antibiotics but had consumed contaminated milk.  The article explains that humans carry both highly abundant bacterial species and many less common ones. When a broad-spectrum antibiotic is taken, rare microbes could potentially be wiped out entirely due to their small population size and difficulty detecting them against trillions of other cells. Once a rare species population hits zero, it becomes extinct within the body.  Although these rare microbes may seem inconsequential initially, they possess the ability to multiply rapidly under certain circumstances. For example, they might have unique enzymes for digesting specific foods that can trigger their exponential growth when consumed for the first time. This could be beneficial for individuals as some energy captured by these digesting microbes might end up in their bloodstream.  However, if one of these rare ancient microbes goes extinct within an individual's microbiome – an organism that has coexisted with Homo sapiens for thousands of years – there may be consequences. These organisms are considered ""contingency"" species because they are crucial when protection against new epidemics is needed.  The increasing global accessibility between people combined with degrading ancient microbial defenses makes humanity vulnerable to microbial invaders and diseases on a larger scale than ever before seen in history.  A parallel is drawn between changing climate conditions and changing microbiomes as both contribute to the emergence of modern epidemics such as asthma, allergic disorders, obesity, and metabolic disorders. The loss of microbial diversity and accompanying genes within our microbiomes is seen as a great danger that leaves us helpless against infectious epidemics.  To avoid an ""antibiotic winter,"" the article suggests reducing antibiotic use and avoiding unnecessary practices like elective cesarean sections that disrupt the natural transfer of bacteria from mother to baby. Technological advancements can aid doctors in making better judgments about when antibiotics are truly necessary, while also developing new tools like ""narrow-spectrum"" antibiotics to specifically target invading organisms with minimal collateral effects.  In conclusion, understanding the importance of our microbiome and taking steps to preserve its diversity is vital in protecting ourselves against potentially devastating diseases brought on by microbial invasions. The article emphasizes the urgent need for change in our approach to antibiotics and the preservation of our microbiome. It points out that technology already exists to improve doctors' decisions on antibiotic prescriptions, but it must be implemented more widely. Additionally, there is a call for the development of new tools like ""narrow-spectrum"" antibiotics that specifically target the invading bacteria without harming beneficial microbes.  The author stresses that an ""antibiotic winter"" can only be avoided if we halt the assault on our microbes. This means reducing antibiotic use by using them judiciously and avoiding unnecessary medical procedures like elective cesarean sections unless they are truly necessary.  Furthermore, it is important to recognize that preserving and protecting our diverse microbiomes is essential in maintaining our body's defenses against infectious diseases. The loss of microbial diversity and genes within our microbiome poses a significant threat because it renders us vulnerable to epidemic outbreaks for which we may have no defense. These epidemics can spread rapidly due to increased global connectivity and weakened immune systems.  The article warns that plagues are inevitable when people gather together, given our current global population of 7 billion, which continues to rise each year by 80 million individuals. As such, considering these factors along with the decreasing effectiveness of antibiotics against newer strains of bacteria shows why we should prioritize taking preventive measures now rather than waiting for a potential catastrophic outbreak in the future.  In summary, this news article highlights the importance of understanding how antibiotics impact our microbiome and its vital role in protecting us from infectious diseases. It urges individuals and healthcare professionals alike to take action by reducing unnecessary antibiotic use, adopting technological advancements in prescribing practices, and developing targeted therapies preserving both human health and microbial diversity. By doing so, we can minimize the risk posed by emerging epidemics or even prevent them altogether through proactive measures.",explain
"This news article provides a summary of Senator Marco Rubio's response to President Obama's State of the Union address.   Rubio started his speech by referring emotionally to his personal story and that of his family, who are Cuban immigrants. However, his policy criticisms and proposals align with mainstream and conservative Republican thinking.  One notable omission from Rubio's speech was any mention of his previous support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the US. Instead, he advocated for a responsible solution to the issue of illegal immigration while emphasizing securing borders and enforcing laws.  Rubio also addressed gun control measures mentioned in Obama's State of the Union speech, stating that dealing with violence effectively is important but undermining Second Amendment rights is unconstitutional.  The article mentions that Rubio sharply criticized Obama on various fronts, accusing him of unfairly portraying Republicans as not caring about the environment or seniors while only supporting wealthy individuals. Rubio argued that it was actually Obama’s plans that would hurt middle-class families by preventing economic growth through tax increases and deficit spending.  The divide on budgetary matters between Democrats and Republicans was evident in their approaches - Democrats focused on pairing increased government revenues with spending cuts, whereas Republicans sought reduced government size and opposed increasing tax revenue.  Rubio claimed that relying on more taxes and government spending has failed in the past. He supported lowering corporate tax rates but did not mention closing tax loopholes benefiting the rich as proposed by President Obama.  On energy policy, Rubio criticized wasteful spending on clean energy ventures like Solyndra under Obama's administration. He favored reforming energy regulations and allowing greater exploration of federal lands for oil and gas purposes – both common Republican themes.  Regarding Medicare, Rubio acknowledged changes were needed for its sustainability. While President Obama suggested modest reforms to Medicare, Rubio argued they were insufficient without hurting seniors like his mother. He warned against leaving Medicare unchanged as it may lead to bankruptcy.  Towards the end of his speech, Rubio expressed hope for bipartisan cooperation to solve the nation's problems. He emphasized the consequences of failing to revive the economy, stating that future generations would either be the most prosperous or responsible for America's decline.  In summary, this article provides an overview of Senator Marco Rubio's response to President Obama's State of the Union address, highlighting his conservative stance on immigration, gun control, tax policy, energy reforms, and Medicare. It also mentions Rubio's desire for bipartisan unity in addressing these issues. In addition to Senator Rubio's policy positions and criticisms of President Obama, the article also mentions CNN's fact-checking of Rubio's claims. One specific claim addressed by CNN is Rubio's statement that Obamacare needs a checkup. While Rubio criticized Obama on many fronts, it is important to note that this fact-checking provides a more objective analysis of the accuracy of his statements.  The article further delves into the contrasting views between Democrats and Republicans on budgetary matters. Democrats believe in increasing government revenues along with spending cuts to address the deficit, while Republicans generally oppose any increase in tax revenue and push for reducing the size of government through aggressive spending cuts and entitlement program overhauls.  Throughout his speech, Rubio consistently criticized Obama for advocating more taxes and higher government spending as solutions to economic challenges. He argued that such approaches have failed in the past and emphasized that more government intervention only hinders progress rather than facilitating advancement.  Rubio did express agreement with Obama on lowering corporate tax rates but omitted mention of tax loopholes benefiting wealthy individuals — an aspect supported by President Obama. This omission could be seen as reflecting a conservative stance favoring lower corporate taxes without addressing issues related to income inequality or wealth redistribution.  The article also highlights Rubio's stance on energy policy, where he attacked wasteful spending on so-called clean energy ventures like Solyndra under the Obama administration. He advocated for reforming energy regulations while opening up federal lands for safe oil and gas exploration – positions that align with traditional Republican views.  Concerning Medicare, a government-run health insurance program for seniors, both President Obama and Marco Rubio acknowledged its need for reform but differed in their proposed solutions. While President Obama suggested modest changes to Medicare, Rubio contended that deeper reforms were necessary to avoid bankrupting the program without negatively impacting seniors' benefits.  Finally, towards the conclusion of his speech, Senator Rubio expressed hope for bipartisan collaboration in solving America's problems but warned about the consequences of failure. He believed that a healthy economy would lead to unprecedented prosperity for future generations, while inaction and continued decline would mark his generation as responsible for America's downfall.  In conclusion, this news article provides an analysis of Senator Rubio's response to President Obama's State of the Union address. It highlights his alignment with conservative Republican positions on various issues such as immigration, gun control, taxes, energy policy, and Medicare. The article also includes CNN's fact-checking of Rubio's claims and provides a balanced view by presenting different perspectives on budgetary matters and other policy areas discussed in the speech.",explain
"This news article discusses the features and updates that Microsoft will be introducing in its new operating system, Windows Phone 8. The article mentions that this announcement is not a full reveal like Apple's iOS 6 presentation at WWDC, but Microsoft plans to showcase more end-user features in the summer.   One major update mentioned in the article is that Windows Phone 8 will now support multi-core chips, making it more competitive with iPhone and Android handsets. Previously, Windows Phone only supported single-core processors. Additionally, there will be support for three screen resolutions compared to just one in the previous version.  Another hardware update is the inclusion of microSD card expansion, allowing users to easily transfer information from device to device by adding a microSD card.

Continuing with the article, it mentions that Microsoft has always had a strong presence in the enterprise market with their Windows operating system. With Windows Phone 8, they are now extending their focus on business-friendly features. The new operating system will come with a complete security platform that includes Secure Boot and encryption, similar to Windows Bitlocker. This feature ensures that the device and its data are protected from unauthorized access.  In terms of app distribution and deployment, Windows Phone 8 offers flexibility for businesses. It provides a mechanism for private distribution of apps within organizations and allows for onsite management. This means businesses can easily control and manage the apps installed on company devices, providing heightened security and streamlined administration.  The article also hints at future possibilities regarding game development on Windows Phone 8. By sharing native C and C++ code with Windows 8, developers can create high-performance games that can be easily ported between both platforms. This is expected to result in better quality games available in the Windows Phone Marketplace.  Another significant update mentioned is support for NFC tap-to-pay capabilities in Windows Phone Wallet experience. While Google Wallet already exists as a tap-to-pay solution built directly into devices, Microsoft takes a different approach by storing credit/debit card information securely on a SIM card instead of within the device itself. This allows users to move their wallet information from one device to another seamlessly.  However, it's important to note that initially this NFC tap-to-pay feature will be limited to France-based Orange carrier at launch but will become available in other regions later on.  Lastly, there is mention of Microsoft's close partnership with Nokia as evidenced by Nokia's mapping technology being integrated into the onboard Maps app in Windows Phone 8. The NAVTEQ map data combined with offline map support provides users with reliable navigation options even without an internet connection.  In conclusion, these updates announced by Microsoft for its upcoming operating system show efforts to position itself competitively against iOS and Android. With hardware updates, improved browser performance, shared native code with Windows 8, NFC capabilities, a business-friendly platform, and integrated mapping technology from Nokia, it is clear that Microsoft aims to enhance the user experience while appealing to both consumers and businesses with its Windows Phone 8 offering.",explain
"This news article discusses Pope Francis' stance on gay rights and civil unions for homosexuals. The article mentions that although the Pope publicly opposed same-sex marriage in Argentina, he expressed his support for civil unions in private conversations. These comments shed light on Pope Francis' approach to leading the Catholic Church, which has about 1.2 billion followers worldwide.  The article begins by mentioning a conversation between the Pope and a gay rights activist, Marquez. According to Marquez, the Pope expressed his favor for gay rights and civil unions, but believed that Argentina was not yet ready for legalizing gay marriage. This reported willingness of the Pope to accept civil unions as a compromise suggests that his views may differ from his public opposition to same-sex marriage.  During his time as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio (who would later become Pope Francis) was known for leading the Catholic Church's charge against legalizing same-sex marriage in Argentina. He engaged in a heated debate with President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who supported the measure. While some perceived this public battle as evidence of Bergoglio's traditionalist views on homosexuality, Marquez claims that behind closed doors, he appeared to be more open-minded and respectful towards gays.  Further evidence supporting Bergoglio's support for civil unions is presented through conversations with another source – Andres Albertsen – a former pastor of the Danish Church in Buenos Aires. Albertsen stated that during a private meeting with him, Bergoglio admitted that he would have accepted a civil union.  Although there are various sources confirming these statements by Bergoglio regarding civil unions for gays, their authenticity could not be independently verified by CNN at the time of writing this article.  The report also mentions an incident from 2010 when priests attended a meeting where they discussed whether or not the church should support civil unions for homosexual couples; however this proposal was ultimately rejected by bishops who voted instead to publicly battle against same-sex marriage.  The article includes reactions to the Pope's reported support for civil unions. Some praised his stance, considering it as a hopeful sign of possible reforms within the Catholic Church. They emphasized the distinction between being against gay marriage and being against gays as individuals. Others remained skeptical and questioned whether the Pope's reported support for civil unions was genuine or merely a political move.  In conclusion, this news article highlights Pope Francis' alleged support for civil unions for homosexuals, based on conversations he had with various individuals before becoming pope. While his public stance against same-sex marriage may suggest traditionalist views, these private comments indicate a more open-minded approach towards gay rights. The reactions to this revelation have been mixed, with some hopeful for reform within the Catholic Church while others remain cautious about whether these statements reflect actual policy changes. The article goes on to discuss the reaction from the Vatican and other individuals in response to The New York Times report. A senior Vatican official is quoted as saying that they cannot confirm or deny the details of the report at this point. They suggest that while Pope Francis may have expressed these views as a cardinal, he should be given time to develop his policy position as pontiff.  Alejandro Russo, the rector of the Metropolitan Cathedral in Buenos Aires, disagrees with the claim that Pope Francis supported civil unions for homosexuals. He believes it is unlikely that the pope ever expressed such a view, even in private. He points out that Bergoglio publicly criticized Buenos Aires' government for allowing civil unions in 2007 and had a strained relationship with their mayor over this issue.  The article also highlights how same-sex marriage became legal in Argentina in 2010 despite opposition from then-Cardinal Bergoglio. Gay rights advocates argue that while civil unions were seen by some as a positive step, they still fell short of equal treatment before the law. The passage of same-sex marriage legislation allowed homosexual couples to adopt and inherit property, leading to increased acceptance and recognition by society.  The reported support for civil unions by Pope Francis sparked debates among commentators. Reverend Edward Beck asserts that there is a distinction between being against gay marriage but not being anti-gay altogether. He interprets Pope Francis' moderate stance on this issue as hopeful progress towards respect for human rights within Catholic teachings.  However, journalist Bruno Bimbi remains cautious about celebrating these revelations regarding Pope Francis' views on homosexuality and civil unions. He questions whether these statements are genuinely reflective of significant change or if they are merely motivated by personal historical concerns or desires for positive recognition during his papacy.  Overall, this news article portrays differing opinions about Pope Francis' stance on gay rights and civil unions within Argentina's context. It presents evidence suggesting both public opposition to same-sex marriage and private discussions that hint at support for civil unions. The reactions and interpretations of these statements reflect a spectrum of perspectives, ranging from optimism to skepticism regarding potential changes within the Catholic Church's teachings and policies.",explain
"The news article discusses the introduction of a new identity card in Nigeria that serves as a certification of identity, personal database repository, and payment card. The director general and CEO of the Nigerian Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Chris Onyemenam, also mentions the potential for using the card for voting and international travel purposes.  The article highlights that only about 30% of Nigeria's population has a bank account despite being the largest oil-producing nation in Africa. Mastercard sees this as an opportunity for growth and claims that cash dependency in Nigeria can cost up to 1.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). With Nigeria recently becoming Africa's biggest economy with a GDP of $488 billion, the government aims to reduce cash dependency and promote economic growth by introducing this multifunctional ID card.  To obtain the ID card, Nigerians must register at one of NIMC's enrollment centers across the country. They need to provide 10 fingerprints, a picture of their face and iris, along with information about their age and place of birth. Once registered, they are issued an ID number along with the card.  However, not everyone is happy with this new initiative. Human rights activist Shehu Sani criticizes the scheme on Facebook while Eze Onyekpere from Centre for Social Justice argues against collaborating with Mastercard. Onyekpere believes there should be a distinction between everyday credit or payment cards and an identity card issued by a sovereign authority. He also questions why Mastercard was selected without going through a competitive selection process.  A Mastercard spokesperson denies that they are turning this project into a branding exercise but clarifies that their brand mark on the card is necessary for it to be accepted as an electronic means of payment. NIMC spokesperson Umar Abdulhamid defends partnering with Mastercard by claiming it was done through fair competition and other payment providers were apprehensive to get involved. Daniel Monehin, president of Mastercard's Sub Saharan Africa division, supports Abdulhamid's statement.  The article also highlights the history of previous attempts to implement a national identity card scheme in Nigeria since 1978. However, due to political reasons and irregularities in the roll-out of previous ID cards, a new card was planned in 2008. The current initiative does not have a fixed timetable for completing the roll out of the initial 13 million cards.  In conclusion, this news article details the introduction of a new multifunctional identity card in Nigeria that serves as a certification of identity, personal database repository, payment card and potentially for voting and international travel purposes. While some see it as an opportunity for economic growth and reducing cash dependency, others criticize the partnership with Mastercard and question the selection process. Additionally, the article mentions the significance of this new ID card in addressing Nigeria's low level of financial inclusion. With only 30% of the population having bank accounts, the introduction of a multifunctional card that can also serve as a payment method aims to increase accessibility to financial services for more Nigerians. This aligns with global efforts to promote financial inclusion and reduce reliance on cash transactions.  The article highlights Mastercard's interest in seizing this growth opportunity. Nigeria's large population of 170 million people, coupled with its status as Africa's biggest economy, makes it an attractive market for electronic payments and digital solutions. Mastercard conducted research that indicates high cash dependency can cost up to 1.5% of GDP in countries like Nigeria. By providing a secure and convenient card-based payment system, Mastercard aims to tap into this potential market and help drive economic growth.  However, concerns are raised by human rights activists and critics about the collaboration between the Nigerian government and Mastercard. Shehu Sani voices his opposition on Facebook while Eze Onyekpere from Centre for Social Justice states that there should be a clear distinction between an identity card issued by a sovereign authority and everyday credit or payment cards. He critiques the heavy branding presence of Mastercard on the ID cards.  Onyekpere further argues that there was no competitive selection process for choosing Mastercard as the partner in this initiative. He believes it was an abuse of Nigeria's public procurement process and suggests that other companies should have been given the opportunity to provide their services.  In response, both Mastercard and NIMC defend their partnership by stating that it went through all necessary levels of government approval and was open to other payment providers who were hesitant to participate. The spokespersons from both organizations assert that there was fair competition involved in selecting Mastercard as part of this project.  The article concludes by highlighting previous attempts at implementing a national identity card scheme in Nigeria that were unsuccessful due to political factors and issues with previous card roll-outs. The current initiative faces an open-ended timeline for completing the distribution of the initial 13 million cards.  In summary, the news article provides an overview of Nigeria's introduction of a multifunctional identity card that also serves as a personal database repository and payment card. It explores both the potential benefits for economic growth and financial inclusion, as well as concerns raised by critics regarding the partnership with Mastercard and the selection process. It also touches upon Nigeria's previous attempts at implementing an identity card scheme and the ongoing challenges faced in its roll-out.",explain
"The news article discusses President Obama's stance on immigration and the criticism he has received for his deportation policies. The author expresses the opinion that President Obama claims to be seeking justice for illegal immigrants and their families but has actually deported a large number of them, leading to the division of families.  The article highlights the fact that despite winning a significant percentage of Latino votes during his election, President Obama does not have any Latinos serving in his Cabinet after the departures of important Latino figures such as Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis. The author sarcastically mentions that it is ""nice"" to see white males occupying top Cabinet positions, adding sarcasm by saying they never get anything.  Furthermore, the author points out that many illegal immigrants refer to themselves as undocumented Americans, considering themselves Americans in every way except legal status. The heavy-handed enforcement policies and record number of deportations under President Obama's administration have marginalized this group and deprived them of liberty and pursuit of happiness, contradicting principles of tolerance, opportunity, human dignity, and justice that he claims to uphold.  In conclusion, the article criticizes President Obama for not adequately supporting illegal immigrants or furthering ideals such as tolerance and opportunity through his immigration policies. It suggests that his self-proclaimed lofty ideals do not align with his actions during his first term as president. The author of the article asserts that President Obama, in his speech, talked about the rights and privileges of Americans but failed to acknowledge the perspective of illegal immigrants who refer to themselves as undocumented Americans. These individuals consider themselves fully integrated into American society except for their legal status. The author argues that President Obama's deportation policies have marginalized this group and contradicted the principles of tolerance, opportunity, human dignity, and justice that he claims to champion.  The article implies that President Obama has not prioritized or adequately addressed the concerns of illegal immigrants or the U.S.-born Latino community who are purportedly supportive of them. The author suggests that in non-election years, there seems to be a lack of attention given to this issue.  The criticism extends further by questioning who is responsible for expelling these ""striving, hopeful"" immigrants from the country. The answer provided is President Obama himself. This emphasis on deportation numbers highlights what the author perceives as a misalignment between President Obama's rhetoric on tolerance and opportunity and his actual policies.  In conclusion, this commentary presents an opinionated view on President Obama's immigration record. It criticizes him for being self-unaware and living in a world of loft ideals without effectively addressing issues such as illegal immigration during his first term. The assessment suggests a contradiction between his words and actions when it comes to advocating for tolerance, opportunity, human dignity, justice - raising concerns about his commitment towards these principles. The author of the article, Ruben Navarrette, goes on to argue that President Obama has not treated the issue of immigration appropriately and has failed to fulfill his promises. Navarrette accuses Obama of ruining the lives of undocumented immigrants and depriving them of their liberty and pursuit of happiness through his deportation policies.  Navarrette criticizes the fact that despite winning a significant majority of Latino votes in his election, President Obama's Cabinet no longer includes any Latinos after the departures of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis. This lack of representation leads Navarrette to suggest sarcastically that it is ""nice"" to see white males occupying top positions because they supposedly never get anything.  The author further highlights the discrepancy between President Obama's rhetoric on tolerance, opportunity, human dignity, and justice and his actual actions regarding immigration. According to Navarrette, many undocumented immigrants consider themselves as ""undocumented Americans"" since they identify fully with American society despite lacking legal status. However, he asserts that President Obama's heavy enforcement policies and high number of deportations have marginalized these individuals rather than providing them with the promised opportunities.  Navarrette concludes by accusing President Obama of not doing right by undocumented immigrants or their U.S.-born Latino supporters outside election years. He suggests that through his immigration policies, President Obama has failed to advance principles such as tolerance, opportunity, human dignity, and justice while claiming otherwise in his speeches.  In summary, this news article essentially presents a scathing critique from Ruben Navarrette towards President Obama regarding immigration issues during his first term. It accuses him of not following through on campaign promises o",explain
"This news article revolves around controversial comments made by a Japanese politician, Toru Hashimoto, regarding the use of ""comfort women"" during World War II. Hashimoto suggested that the United States military should have utilized legal adult entertainment establishments to address their soldiers' sexual needs, implying it could have helped control their aggressive behavior.  However, these remarks faced immediate criticism both domestically and internationally. In Japan, several political figures expressed disapproval and questioned if such comments were appropriate. Education Minister Hakubun Shimomura acknowledged that controversial remarks by Japanese politicians regarding wartime history had been misunderstood in the past but emphasized that Hashimoto's comments came at an unfavorable time. He also criticized the suggestion of using adult entertainment to address sexual frustration.  Another minister named Tomomi Inada echoed these sentiments and highlighted that she believed the comfort women issue infringed upon women's human rights. While Chief Cabinet Spokesman Yoshihide Suga did not respond directly to Hashimoto's comments, he reiterated Japan's stance on acknowledging the pain suffered by comfort women during World War II.  The article further discusses the historical context of comfort women—approximately 200,000 women who were forced into sexual slavery by Japan's former Imperial Army during World War II. The majority of these women were from occupied territories such as China, Korea, and the Philippines. The surviving victims have been advocating for greater recognition of their suffering and individual compensation for years.  The South Korean government expressed ""deep disappointment"" over Hashimoto's remarks and emphasized worldwide recognition of comfort women as victims of wartime rape and a breach of human rights committed by Japan during its imperial period. They called upon Japanese officials to show regret for past atrocities committed during this time.  The article also mentions previous attempts by the Japanese government to acknowledge the pain inflicted upon thousands of comfort women through an official statement released in 1993. It vowed to include this issue in school textbooks for better education about this dark chapter in history. However, tensions surrounding Japan's wartime past still strain its relationships with neighboring countries such as South Korea and China, especially due to ongoing territorial disputes.  In summary, this news article primarily focuses on the controversial comments made by Toru Hashimoto suggesting that the United States military should have utilized legal adult entertainment establishments during World War II instead of having comfort women. The article highlights domestic and international reactions to these remarks and provides background information about comfort women and their ongoing struggle for recognition and compensation. It also underscores the impact of Japan's wartime past on its current regional relationships. Additionally, the article points out that Hashimoto's comments concerning the use of adult entertainment to address sexual frustration within the military were met with widespread condemnation because they trivialized the experiences of comfort women. By suggesting that sexual services provided by legal establishments could have controlled soldiers' aggressive tendencies, Hashimoto seemed to overlook the fact that comfort women were victims who were subjected to systematic and horrific forms of sexual exploitation against their will.  The controversy surrounding Hashimoto's remarks highlights a larger issue regarding Japan's acknowledgement and responsibility for its wartime past. While some steps have been taken towards recognizing the suffering of comfort women, there is still a long way to go in terms of providing adequate reparations and acknowledging historical truths.  The strained relationships between Japan and countries like South Korea and China are deeply intertwined with unresolved historical issues such as comfort women. These tensions are exacerbated by ongoing territorial disputes, further complicating efforts to foster diplomatic relations in East Asia.  Furthermore, this news article sheds light on how political figures within Japan reacted to Hashimoto's comments. Education Minister Hakubun Shimomura expressed concern about misunderstandings related to politicians' remarks regarding wartime history in general but criticized Hashimoto specifically for making such comments at an inappropriate time. This demonstrates a disapproval of offensive or insensitive rhetoric on sensitive topics that can damage international relationships.  It is worth noting that these controversies often arise around events related to World War II due to its devastating impact on various nations involved, particularly those subjecting others through aggression or occupation. The legacy of this dark period continues to influence global perceptions and ongoing geopolitical dynamics in East Asia.  Overall, this news article highlights the repercussions faced by Toru Hashimoto following his controversial statements about using adult entertainment establishments during World War II as a means for addressing soldiers' sexual frustrations. It explores reactions from both domestic political colleagues and foreign governments affected by Japan's wartime past while emphasizing the broader issue of unresolved historical grievances impacting regional relationships among East Asian countries.",explain
"This news article discusses President Obama's recent campaign-style appearances where he emphasized proposals from his State of the Union address. The president focused on raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour and providing quality pre-schooling for all children in order to help improve people's lives. Additionally, he called on Congress to vote on a package of gun control proposals aimed at reducing shootings that occur daily in communities and mass killings that have taken place in schools, movie theaters, and places of worship.  The article highlights statistics from the Centers for Disease Control, which show that there were 11,078 homicides by firearm in the United States in 2010, with 65% of victims aged 15-34. It is noted that African Americans make up 13% of the total U.S. population but accounted for 56% of firearm homicide victims. The president emphasizes that this issue goes beyond just guns and also involves building better communities.  President Obama emphasizes the importance of strong families and supportive parents as key factors in reducing violence. He calls for promoting marriage and encouraging fatherhood as a means to create stable homes for children. He also acknowledges that creating safer communities will not be easy but believes it can be achieved.  During one appearance at Chicago's Hyde Park Academy High School, Obama mentions Hadiya Pendleton, a teenager who was killed by gunfire after participating in inaugural activities in Washington D.C.. This tragedy further emphasizes the need for gun control measures to save young lives.  The National Rifle Association (NRA) is described as opposing any significant gun legislation proposed by President Obama and Democrats. They argue that these proposals are attempts to limit gun ownership and infringe upon Second Amendment rights.  President Obama seeks an updated version of the assault weapons ban from 1994 which expired ten years later. His proposal includes preventing manufacture and sale of certain semi-automatic rifles modeled after fully automatic assault weapons, limiting ammunition magazines to ten rounds, expanding background checks to all gun transactions, and better screening for individuals with mental illnesses. The article mentions opposition arguments that the proposed ban focuses on a tiny percentage of actual killings and gun violence.  Harold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, supports Obama's proposed ban on assault weapons despite acknowledging that they account for a small fraction of murders in the U.S. He believes that banning these weapons can help reduce mass shootings which have a significant psychological impact on communities and society.  The article concludes by emphasizing that street crime, including shooting deaths, costs communities socially and economically. It states that it is difficult for communities to develop economically if people do not feel safe.  Overall, this news article highlights President Obama's recent campaign-style appearances where he emphasizes his proposals from his State of the Union address regarding raising the minimum wage, improving pre-schooling, and implementing gun control measures aimed at reducing shootings in various settings. Following his campaign-style appearances, President Obama also made a visit to his hometown of Chicago, where he awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal, the nation's second-highest civilian honor, to 18 individuals. Among those honored were six educators who tragically lost their lives in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December 2012.  During this visit, Obama mentioned Hadiya Pendleton, a teenager who was shot and killed in Chicago after participating in inaugural activities in Washington D.C. Pendleton's parents were present at the event and had also attended the State of Union address as guests of First Lady Michelle Obama.  In addressing the issue of gun violence and implementing gun control measures, President Obama acknowledges that fierce opposition from organizations like the National Rifle Association makes it uncertain whether significant gun legislation will be passed. The NRA has criticized Obama's proposed measures as part of an agenda to limit gun ownership rather than addressing safety concerns.  The president's proposed gun control measures include an updated version of the expired 1994 assault weapons ban that would prevent certain semi-automatic rifles modeled after fully automatic assault weapons from being manufactured and sold. He also aims to restrict ammunition magazines to ten rounds and expand background checks for all firearm transactions, including those at gun shows. Additionally, he calls for better screening procedures to prevent individuals with mental illnesses from obtaining firearms and cracking down on ""straw purchases"" where legal buyers acquire guns on behalf of non-legal buyers.  While opponents argue that these proposals infringe upon Second Amendment rights and focus on a small percentage of killings involving specific types of firearms, supporters like Harold Pollack argue for their efficacy in reducing mass shootings that have a significant psychological impact on society.  Pollack acknowledges that assault weapons targeted by the proposed ban are responsible for only a fraction of murders in America; however, he believes that banning them can help curb mass homicides facilitated by their combination with high-capacity magazines. Furthermore, he points out studies showing that street crime, including shooting deaths, imposes significant costs on communities, both tangible (such as emergency medical services and criminal investigations) and intangible (such as residents feeling compelled to move away to escape the threat).  President Obama echoes this sentiment, noting that economic development becomes challenging if people do not feel safe. He emphasizes the importance of addressing the issue from multiple angles, including building stronger families and supporting parents in providing a stable home environment for children.  In conclusion, this news article provides an overview of President Obama's recent campaign-style appearances where he focused on his proposals concerning raising the minimum wage, improving pre-schooling opportunities for children, and implementing gun control measures. It touches upon opposition from organizations like the NRA and includes arguments from supporters who believe these measures can help curb violence and promote safer communities.",explain
"This news article focuses on the impact of jihadist terrorism in the United States since the 9/11 attacks. It begins by stating that, while terrorist attacks after 9/11 have not reached the scale of a national catastrophe, there have been instances where militants affiliated with al Qaeda or inspired by their propaganda have carried out successful attacks in the country.  The article highlights two examples of such attacks: Maj. Nidal Hasan's killing of 13 people at Fort Hood military base in Texas in 2009, and the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, carried out by Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Both incidents were influenced by Anwar al-Awlaki, an American cleric who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen after he became involved with al Qaeda.  According to research from the New America Foundation mentioned in the article, a significant number of individuals charged as jihadist extremists after 9/11 had possession of al-Awlaki's propaganda materials or were influenced by him through communication or citation. Even after his death, his influence persisted through al Qaeda's English-language magazine Inspire.  The article also discusses how around 100 Americans traveled to Syria to fight alongside opposition groups like ISIS and Nusra Front. Some individuals were later charged with attempting to support these groups or engaging in activities for them. The phenomenon raises concerns about radicalization within American communities and potential threats posed upon their return.  However, it is noted that jihadist groups like al Qaeda have struggled to inspire large-scale domestic attacks due to enhanced security measures implemented since 9/11. These measures include increased surveillance efforts that utilize informants from within Muslim communities reporting potential terrorist activity.  According to New America analysis cited in the article, approximately one-third of extremists charged since 2001 were implicated due to tips received from family members or local community members. Furthermore, almost half of all plots initiated inside the United States post-9/11 were discovered and monitored while suspects were under surveillance, primarily through the work of informants.  These efforts by the Muslim community and aggressive law enforcement have made it more challenging for militants to successfully carry out attacks within the United States. Additionally, several measures such as increased intelligence budgets, the establishment of various counterterrorism agencies, and heightened public awareness regarding terrorism have made the country a more difficult target over time.  The article concludes by emphasizing that since 9/11, significant progress has been made in enhancing security measures within the United States. The presence of a vast no-fly list, fusion centers where multiple law enforcement agencies collaborate on counterterrorism efforts, and institutions like the Department of Homeland Security demonstrate this progress. Moreover, there has been a substantial increase in intelligence funding since 2001.  Overall, this article highlights both the challenges posed by jihadist terrorism in the United States post-9/11 and the efforts taken to mitigate these threats through enhanced security measures and community engagement. The news article further delves into the specific measures that have been implemented in the United States to combat terrorism since the 9/11 attacks. It emphasizes how the government has significantly expanded its intelligence capabilities and resources in response to the growing threat of terrorism.  The budget allocated for intelligence collection and covert activities increased dramatically over the years, with $72 billion allocated in 2013 compared to $26 billion before 9/11. This substantial funding has enabled agencies involved in counterterrorism efforts to enhance their capabilities and stay ahead of potential threats.  Additionally, several new institutions were established after 9/11 aimed at bolstering national security. These include the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Counterterrorism Center, Transportation Security Administration, Northern Command, and Cyber Command. The creation of these agencies demonstrates a deliberate effort by the government to strengthen its ability to prevent terrorist attacks on multiple fronts.  Furthermore, there has been a significant expansion in fusion centers across the country since before 9/11 there were only 32 such centers compared to 103 today. These fusion centers serve as hubs where different law enforcement agencies collaborate and share information regarding terrorist activities or plots.  The article also discusses how public awareness regarding terrorism has played a crucial role in making it harder for terrorists to operate within the United States. The example of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's failed attempt at detonating a bomb on Northwest Flight 253 is cited as evidence that increased vigilance among fellow passengers can prevent catastrophic incidents from occurring.  An important aspect highlighted is that while measures like enhanced security checks and intelligence gathering have made it difficult for terrorists operating from abroad or foreign operatives affiliated with jihadist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIS to successfully carry out large-scale attacks within America's borders, homegrown extremism remains a concern.  The article points out that radicalization within American communities still poses risks since some individuals have traveled overseas to join extremist groups or carry out acts of violence. It acknowledges that the strength of security systems lies in the willingness of Muslim communities to report suspicious activities, ensuring that potential threats from within are proactively addressed.  Overall, the article emphasizes the progress made in enhancing national security over the years. However, it also recognizes that remaining vigilant and addressing domestic radicalization remain ongoing challenges for law enforcement agencies and society as a whole. The comprehensive set of measures implemented since 9/11 aims to continuously adapt and stay ahead of evolving terrorist tactics while ensuring individual rights and community engagement are upheld.",explain
"This news article discusses the upcoming peace talks, known as Geneva II, between the Syrian government and opposition delegations. The talks are scheduled to begin in Montreux, Switzerland on Wednesday with a preliminary session and then move to Geneva on Friday for formal international discussions.  However, controversy erupted over the United Nations' decision to rescind an invitation to Iran to join the talks. Russia considered this a mistake but not catastrophic. Iran, accused of supporting the al-Assad regime, announced its refusal to attend the conference due to objections regarding preconditions for a transitional government.  The Syrian Coalition expressed their relief at Iran's absence as they believed it would have been a deal-breaker. They stated that continued support from Russia and Iran for the Assad regime is hindering finding a solution to the violence in Syria.  In addition to these political developments, attention is drawn towards photographs that purport to show ""systematic torture and killing"" of detainees by the al-Assad regime. These photos are being considered potential game-changers by internationally recognized war crimes prosecutors and forensic experts who analyzed them. The team includes David Crane, Sir Desmond de Silva, and Professor Sir Geoffrey Nice.  The report claims that their analysis of thousands of photographs provided by a Syrian defector codenamed ""Caesar"" demonstrates evidence of severe abuse inflicted upon detainees in governmental custody. Lifeless bodies depicted in these images show signs of starvation, beatings, strangulation, and other forms of torture.  More specifically detailed in the report is an examination of 150 individuals within this collection where 62% displayed emaciation indicating starvation. Most victims were men between ages 20-40 with sunken appearances due to severe weight loss. Bruising is evident throughout their bodies with some showing wounds consistent with strangulation rather than hanging.  The photos reveal a complex numbering system used by Syrian intelligence services alongside false documentation suggesting deaths occurring within hospitals - all designed reportedly for accountability purposes regarding which security service was accountable for the deaths.  Although CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of these images, documents, and testimonies mentioned in the report, it relies on the conclusions drawn by the team of experts behind it.  The article mentions that Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court. Therefore, unless there is a referral from the United Nations Security Council, which seems unlikely given Russia's support for al-Assad and its veto power within the council, it would be challenging to prosecute anyone from Syria.  Lastly, it highlights that over 100,000 people have been killed since the start of anti-government protests in March 2011. The Geneva I conference held last year called for a transitional government and eventual free elections as part of a political settlement to end the war. However, Al-Assad insists on addressing terrorism during this week's conference.  In summary, this news article covers various aspects related to peace talks between Syrian government officials and opposition representatives. It discusses controversy surrounding Iran's attendance at these talks and sheds light on photographs allegedly depicting torture and killing by Syrian authorities.",explain
"This news article explores the practice of ""sema,"" a prayer-induced trance ritual performed by the Dervishes. The Dervishes consider themselves as a bridge between God and humankind, aiming to receive divine blessings and then share them with humanity.  Every Sunday, different Mevlevi orders visit Istanbul to worship at the Galata Mevlevihanesi, a Dervish lodge. During CNN's visit, it is observed that two teenage Dervishes are conducting their debut sema ritual in public. The young semazens wear white felt hats instead of the traditional brown ones, symbolizing their entry into spiritual modesty and meditative dance.  Learning how to whirl (spin) in the sema ceremony takes around six months and requires three essential elements: music, rhythm, and belief. In 2005, UNESCO recognized sema as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. However, in Turkey, where these rituals take place, Sufism (the mystical branch of Islam practiced by Mevlevis) faces restrictions due to controversial laws that banned Sufism altogether after the founding of the secular Turkish Republic.  Although performing sema was allowed in public again by the 1950s as part of an effort to boost tourism industry revenue, private worship by Mevlevis remains officially prohibited under Turkish law. Despite these challenges from authority figures throughout history, they persist with their ancient traditions.  The main source of income for the Dervishes is through donations given by members of the public who come to watch them perform during religious ceremonies like sema. A significant annual event called ""Seb-i-Arus"" takes place in Konya each December - where Celaladin Rumi founded this order back in the 13th century - allowing curious observers to witness various Mevlevi associations coming together for these rituals.  At each beginning of a sema ceremony, the disciples stand with their arms crossed to their chest and feet turned inward, signifying respect and humility. This gesture represents an inner journey of spiritual growth in which they battle their ego and seek a closer connection with God. Music plays a vital role in unifying the participants' frequencies, leading to a completion of souls.  The article mentions that Mevlevis strive for universal peace, believing it begins within individuals' hearts before it can spread to the world. The analogy is made that if everyone cleans the front of their own shop as per an old British saying, then streets will be clean. The Dervishes turn in mesmerizing circles during sema ceremonies, seemingly entranced and focused on their role as conduits between God and earth.  In conclusion, this article provides insights into the practice of sema by Dervishes within the context of Turkish history and modern-day challenges. It highlights the important role music plays in uniting participants' spirits during these rituals while emphasizing Mevlevi's ultimate goal: fostering peace within themselves as a means to achieve peace in society at large. The article further explores the struggles faced by the Mevlevis and the restrictions imposed on them in Turkey. The ban on Sufism in the early years of the Turkish Republic was justified by using the Mevlevis' religious association as a basis. This restriction was put in place by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, under Law 677 of the constitution on maintaining order.  However, despite these limitations, sema rituals continued to persist and gain recognition for their cultural significance. The easing of the ban in the 1950s allowed sema to be performed in public once again, but it is widely believed that this decision was primarily driven by a desire to boost tourism rather than an acknowledgment of religious tolerance or freedom.  Today, members of the public contribute donations to watch and participate in these spiritual ceremonies. This engagement helps sustain Mevlevi communities as they heavily rely on income generated through tourism.  The annual festival known as ""Seb-i-Arus,"" held every December in Konya - where Celaladin Rumi established this order centuries ago - serves as a significant congregation point for various Mevlevi associations. It offers an opportunity for people from all walks of life to witness these religious ceremonies together and experience their profound spiritual impact.  Throughout their performances, Dervishes engage in continuous whirling motions while donning white robes that rise and fall with each turn. The spinning act is captivating visually but also carries deep symbolism within it: they view themselves as conduits between God and humanity, channeling divine blessings down to Earth.  While discussing world affairs such as the turmoil present in Middle Eastern countries, one Dervish points out that individual responsibility is crucial for achieving peace. They hold firm beliefs that transformation begins within oneself before it can radiate outward into society at large—a philosophy which echoes deeply-rooted spiritual teachings.  In summary, this news article provides insight into the sema rituals practiced by the Dervishes, their historical challenges, and the ongoing restrictions they face within Turkey. Despite these obstacles, the Mevlevis persevere in preserving their cultural heritage and striving for inner peace while acting as bridges between the divine and human realms. The article sheds light on their quest for spiritual enlightenment, not only through dance but also through music, community gatherings, and maintaining a humble connection with God.",explain
"This article discusses the results of a recent women's slalom race in the World Cup skiing circuit. Tina Maze, a Slovenian skier, was poised to win the slalom title after already winning the overall, giant slalom, and super-G Crystal Globes. However, her hopes were dashed due to fog canceling racing on American skier Mikaela Shiffrin's birthday.  Despite this setback, Maze performed well in the opening run and led the standings by seven points. However, Shiffrin made an impressive comeback in the second run and closed a 1.17-second deficit to claim her fourth World Cup race victory of the season and become the fourth youngest woman to win a slalom title.  Shiffrin's win is also significant because she is only the third non-European woman to win the slalom globe in World Cup history. The other two were Tamara McKinney from America in 1984 and Betsy Clifford from Canada in 1971.  In an interview after her victory, Shiffrin expressed gratitude towards Maze for being an inspiration throughout her career. She also mentioned strong support from her parents and coaching staff played a crucial role in helping her achieve this success.  Maze had to settle for third place behind Austria's Bernadette Schild despite having a successful season with 23 podium finishes. She acknowledged that she took more risks during her first run but couldn't replicate that performance during her second run. Ultimately, Maze did not believe she lost due to this particular race but rather somewhere else along with other factors during the season.  The article also briefly mentions Ted Ligety from America who won his sixth out of eight giant slalom races this season and sealed his dominance of that discipline by winning last weekend's race as well as three gold medals at world championships earlier. Ligety expressed surprise at his success while acknowledging that it may be difficult for him to replicate his achievements in the future.  Lastly, it is mentioned that Marcel Hirscher has already won the overall World Cup title and also secured the slalom title. Hirscher shared his overwhelming thoughts about the season, stating that he hasn't had time to fully process everything that has happened.  Overall, this article highlights Mikaela Shiffrin's impressive victory in the women's slalom race where she overcame a deficit to secure her fourth World Cup win of the season. It also mentions Tina Maze's strong performance throughout the season and a brief update on Ted Ligety and Marcel Hirscher's successes. The article continues to emphasize the significance of Mikaela Shiffrin's win in the women's slalom race. It notes that she has been dominating the slalom discipline throughout the season, making her victory well-deserved. Shiffrin has proven herself as a formidable force on the slopes and solidified her position as one of the top skiers in the world.  The article also sheds light on some of Shiffrin's thoughts and emotions after her victory. She admits to feeling overwhelmed with emotion and excitement, describing herself as ""freaking out."" This shows that even top athletes experience intense emotions during crucial moments in their careers.  Shiffrin expresses gratitude towards Tina Maze for serving as an inspiration and helping her reach where she is today. This displays a sense of camaraderie and mutual respect between these two talented skiers, despite competing against each other.  Additionally, Shiffrin credits her parents and coaching staff for their unwavering support. They encouraged her to let go of any fears or doubts and urged her to give it her all without holding back. Their advice clearly resonated with Shiffrin since it influenced how she approached the race.  On the flip side, Tina Maze reflects on her performance during this particular race. While disappointed with finishing third, Maze recognizes that not winning here did not determine losing overall, attributing external factors to losing out on winning more races this season.  The article briefly mentions Ted Ligety's extraordinary season in men's giant slalom racing as well. Winning six out of eight races is an exceptional achievement for Ligety, underlining his dominance in this discipline during this World Cup season. He expresses surprise at his own success but also acknowledges that duplicating such results may be difficult moving forward.  Finally, Marcel Hirscher is mentioned as having already secured both overall World Cup champion status along with clinching yet another slalom title ahead of the final race. Hirscher admits to struggling to fully comprehend and come to terms with all that has happened this season, indicating the tremendous impact and intensity he experienced during his successful campaign.  In conclusion, this news article provides an overview of the recent women's slalom race in the World Cup circuit. It highlights Mikaela Shiffrin's remarkable comeback and victory, as well as Tina Maze's strong performance throughout the season. The article also briefly touches upon Ted Ligety's outstanding achievements in men's giant slalom racing and Marcel Hirscher's success in securing multiple titles. Overall, it offers insights into the triumphs, challenges, and emotions experienced by these world-class skiers throughout the season.",explain
"This news article discusses a speech made by the former National Security Agency (NSA) chief, General Keith Alexander, at the Black Hat conference. The general spoke about two intelligence programs – the collection of metadata on phone calls in the United States and the PRISM surveillance program.  According to General Alexander, NSA is able to gather metadata on phone calls made in the United States. This includes information such as the date and time of the call, numbers involved, and duration of conversations. However, he emphasized that they do not have access to the content of citizens' phone calls or text messages.  The PRISM surveillance program focuses on digital activities like email, instant messaging, and web searches. General Alexander stated that this program is primarily targeted towards foreign actors and does not apply to people within the United States. He argued that collecting phone and internet data is necessary for connecting potential terrorist threats before they occur.  To address concerns about privacy infringement, General Alexander reassured attendees that there are strict oversight measures in place. Congress and courts ensure that these programs operate within legal boundaries set by Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Additionally, internal auditing systems are used to prevent any misuse or abuse by employees. Only a limited number of authorized analysts are permitted to run queries on phone metadata.  The general did not mention another secret NSA program called XKeyscore during his speech but denied accusations that these programs allow unlimited collection of online data from everyone. He stated they cannot afford or have any interest in collecting everything and cited his personal example mentioning he couldn't intercept his own daughters' emails.  During a Q&A session with prescreened questions from attendees; one person yelled accusations at him for allegedly lying to Congress before asking why they should believe him now. In response, General Alexander urged them to base their opinions on facts rather than what has been written in press reports and suggested reading his congressional testimony.  Overall, reception towards General Alexander's talk appeared mostly positive, given the audience at the Black Hat conference consists mainly of corporate-security individuals interested in protecting their networks from cyber attacks. It was mentioned that he might face a more hostile reception at the hacker-centric Def Con conference starting the next day.  The general sought advice on striking a balance between security and civil liberties, requesting attendees to share their ideas through an email address he provided. He further raised concerns about potential damage resulting from the leaks by Edward Snowden and questioned whether future terrorist attacks could be prevented with such transparency.  In conclusion, this article summarizes General Keith Alexander's speech at the Black Hat conference where he explained NSA intelligence programs. He emphasized that phone metadata collection is separate from content surveillance and highlighted strict oversight measures in place to prevent abuses. However, he did not address all concerns raised by attendees, inviting criticism and skepticism about transparency and privacy issues surrounding these programs. In addition to addressing concerns about privacy and oversight, General Alexander also touched on the motives behind terrorist attacks on the United States. One attendee shouted that terrorists target the U.S. because of its military actions in the Middle East, to which another attendee disagreed and suggested that they attack because of a desire to implement Islamic law.  The general acknowledged both viewpoints but mentioned that one reason terrorists target the U.S. is due to a desire by people in the Middle East to establish governments under Islamic law. This statement prompted some debate among attendees, highlighting the complexity of understanding and addressing terrorism motivations.  Throughout his speech, General Alexander attempted to portray himself as transparent and open for discussions with tech experts about how security measures could better align with civil liberties. He provided an email address where attendees could share their ideas with NSA.  However, he also expressed concerns about sharing too much information publicly, emphasizing that complete transparency may expose vulnerabilities that adversaries can exploit. He stated that if all details of NSA operations were made public knowledge, then it would be easier for threats to overcome defense systems.  The article concludes by mentioning that there is growing skepticism and lack of trust in government surveillance programs due to leaks from Edward Snowden. It highlights how these disclosures have impacted public opinion and created a sense of mistrust towards agencies like the NSA.  Ultimately, this news article provides an overview of General Keith Alexander's talk at the Black Hat conference regarding NSA intelligence programs. It covers topics such as phone metadata collection, PRISM surveillance program targeting foreign actors, oversight mechanisms in place for preventing abuses, discussions around motivation behind terrorist attacks on the U.S., desire for balancing security with civil liberties, and growing skepticism towards government surveillance programs post-Snowden leaks.",explain
"This news article discusses the recent acquisition of Instagram by Facebook and its implications for Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook. The article highlights that this acquisition showcases Zuckerberg's confidence and boldness, but it also raises concerns about his ability to make sound business decisions.  The article mentions that CNN's chief business correspondent, Ali Velshi, believes that although Zuckerberg has defied conventional rules in the past, acquiring Instagram may not be the best decision for Facebook. Velshi suggests that while it may be acceptable for non-public companies to make such risky moves, public companies require more oversight from experienced professionals who can protect shareholder interests.  The report indicates that Facebook's board was informed about and endorsed the deal rather than being actively involved in making the decision. This raises questions about whether there should have been more consultation and consideration before making such a significant purchase.  The article suggests that Zuckerberg's motivation behind acquiring Instagram may have been driven by his desire to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of web tech. It mentions that Instagram was on the verge of securing private investments worth $50 million and speculates whether this influenced Zuckerberg into overpaying for a company with no revenue yet.  Velshi explains that creativity, innovation, and deal-making are different strengths. He implies that while Zuckerberg may have wanted Instagram strongly, he might not have been the best person to negotiate and make an optimal deal.  It is noted in the article that Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's Chief Operating Officer, was aware of these negotiations but did not take part directly. The significance of this acquisition might lie in locking up user data from a rapidly growing competitor rather than focusing on immediate profitability from Instagram itself.  The article concludes by mentioning how this event adds another layer to Mark Zuckerberg's reputation as a hoodie-wearing CEO who disregards authority when needed. It refers to ""The Social Network,"" a movie based on Facebook's origin story which popularized phrases like ""What's cooler than a billion dollars? A billion dollars without board approval.""  In essence, this news article highlights the acquisition of Instagram by Facebook and raises questions about Mark Zuckerberg's decision-making abilities as a CEO. It suggests that while his actions may be seen as bold and confident, they might not align with typical corporate practices expected from a company preparing for an IPO. The acquisition also brings attention to the need for checks and balances within public companies to safeguard shareholder interests. In addition to discussing the concerns surrounding Mark Zuckerberg's decision-making, the article also explores the potential implications of the Instagram acquisition for Facebook as a whole. It suggests that Facebook may have been motivated not just by profit from Instagram but also by the desire to eliminate a growing competitor in the social media space.  By acquiring Instagram, Facebook secures access to valuable user data and prevents other competitors from gaining an advantage. With more than 40 million users at that time, Instagram posed a significant threat to Facebook's dominance in photo-sharing and social networking.  The article acknowledges that success in the fast-paced world of web technology requires adaptability and nimbleness. Companies that fail to embrace innovation risk being left behind as new players emerge. Zuckerberg's decision to acquire Instagram could be seen as an attempt to stay ahead of these rapidly changing market dynamics.  However, there are still questions about whether this move was driven more by strategic foresight or Zuckerberg's personal preference for owning popular platforms like Instagram. The article suggests that perhaps it would have been better if professionals with experience in deal-making had been involved in negotiating and evaluating this acquisition.  The role of Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's COO, is also highlighted. While she was aware of the negotiations surrounding the acquisition, her limited involvement raises questions about leadership dynamics within Facebook and who ultimately has authority over major business decisions.  Ultimately, this news article aims to shed light on both sides of Mark Zuckerberg's leadership style – his unconventional approach which defies traditional corporate norms but also raises concerns about governance and shareholder interests. It underscores how this acquisition serves as a testament to his entrepreneurial spirit while simultaneously exposing potential risks associated with such bold moves.  As Facebook prepares for its imminent IPO expected at a valuation up to $100 billion at that time, stakeholders will closely scrutinize each move made by its CEO – including this multi-billion-dollar purchase – further shaping perceptions of Mark Zuckerberg as he navigates through public company obligations and expectations.",explain
"This news article discusses various tacky tactics that people often employ on the internet and offers classy fixes for better online behavior.   The first tacky tactic addressed is publicly airing grievances about others in a passive-aggressive manner on platforms like blogs, Facebook, and Twitter. The article emphasizes that this approach makes individuals appear childish and foolish, rather than righteous. Research also shows that gossipmongers are generally disliked and seen as weak. Instead, the suggested classy fix is to address issues directly with the person involved via private messages or emails or even better - through a calm and respectful in-person conversation.  The second tacky tactic mentioned is oversharing sensitive or intimate photos on social media when making big announcements such as the birth of a baby or the passing of a loved one. The article suggests that such big announcements can be made with simple updates without necessarily needing accompanying photos. It's also advised to consider what friends really want - celebrations of achievements and support during difficult times rather than constant updates every moment of the day.  Lastly, the article addresses the issue of assuming every online contact is willing to financially support personal ventures. It advises against tagging people daily in donation requests or sending spamming messages demanding financial contributions for projects like mission trips, starting nonprofits, etc. Instead, it recommends using positive incentives like setting up Kickstarter campaigns with reasonable funding targets and offering rewards based on different contribution levels. Additionally, personalized appeals can be made to potential donors without pressuring them into immediate financial contributions.  In summary, this news article highlights some common faux pas committed by people online while suggesting classier alternatives for more respectful internet behavior related to public grievances, oversharing personal photos during sensitive moments, and seeking financial support from online contacts for personal projects without feeling entitled or demanding contributions from them repeatedly. The article emphasizes the importance of maintaining a sense of class and etiquette in online interactions. It reminds readers that being classy not only reflects well on them but also helps to create a more pleasant internet environment for everyone.  One key point the article makes is about addressing conflicts and disagreements directly with the involved parties. Instead of resorting to passive-aggressive behavior or publicly shaming someone, it suggests having open and respectful discussions either through private messages or in-person conversations. By expressing concerns directly, individuals are more likely to be taken seriously and maintain their dignity.  Another aspect highlighted is oversharing on social media. The article argues that not every significant life event needs to be accompanied by graphic or intimate photos. It recommends sharing important news with concise updates or links without excessive details that could potentially make others uncomfortable or invade their privacy. Recognizing that not everyone finds every aspect of one's life as fascinating as they may think helps cultivate a more considerate online presence.  Furthermore, the article addresses the issue of using social platforms as constant fundraising tools. While there is nothing wrong with seeking support for personal projects or ventures, it stresses the importance of using persuasion rather than coercion. Rather than bombarding friends and acquaintances with countless donation requests, it suggests setting up crowdfunding campaigns with reasonable targets and offering incentives based on different contribution levels. Additionally, making personalized appeals showing genuine interest in potential donors' expertise demonstrates respect for their time and contributions.  In conclusion, this news article aims to encourage individuals to exercise tactfulness and class when engaging online. By addressing conflicts directly, avoiding oversharing personal details unnecessarily, and seeking financial support graciously rather than forcefully, people can contribute positively to a more pleasant digital atmosphere while maintaining healthy relationships within their networks.",explain
"This news article discusses the case of Pedro Hernandez, a former stock boy who is now a 51-year-old murder suspect. It is not clear whether Hernandez was interviewed in the initial case of Etan, a boy who went missing more than three decades ago. However, recently Hernandez confessed to killing Etan after being brought in for questioning. He has been charged with second-degree murder and is awaiting trial.  Hernandez's attorney, Harvey Fishbein, stated that his client has not entered a plea due to pending psychiatric evaluation. Hernandez is currently on suicide watch at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan and reportedly suffers from conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and hallucinations.  According to the police, Hernandez claimed that he lured Etan into the basement of the store where he worked with the promise of a soda before choking him to death. He then allegedly disposed of the body by placing it inside a plastic bag and leaving it in a trash bin near his workplace.  Police Commissioner Ray Kelly described Hernandez as remorseful during his confession. However, prosecutors now face the challenge of corroborating this confession since there have been false positives throughout this long-standing murder mystery.  The article also provides some background information on Hernandez's life before and after the crime took place. His family moved from Puerto Rico to New Jersey when he was young, and he attended high school there before moving to Manhattan at 18 years old. He worked as a stock clerk for about one month before returning home shortly after Etan's disappearance.  Relatives describe Hernandez as becoming withdrawn and frequently ill upon his return to New Jersey. His whereabouts after 1979 remain uncertain but at some point he apparently returned to New York City.  In more recent times, Hernandez got married twice and had financial troubles leading him to file for bankruptcy in 1999 with his second wife named Rosemary.  Various individuals who claim they knew him provide mixed impressions of his character - some describe him as strange and always alone, while others say he was quiet and attended church regularly with his family.  Hernandez's sister, Norma Hernandez, claims that she reported her brother's alleged confession to the police in the early 1980s but received no response. She also mentions that Pedro allegedly confided in a prayer group about killing a boy.  Although there is no forensic evidence or witness testimony supporting Hernandez's confession, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance decided to move forward with murder charges against him. The article mentions that Lisa Cohen, the author of a book called ""After Etan,"" remains skeptical about Hernandez's confession. She states that she had never heard of Hernandez before this week and questions the authenticity of his confession.  A law enforcement source mentioned in the article also expresses skepticism towards Hernandez's claims, stating that they are being treated with a healthy dose of skepticism. This suggests that there may be doubts regarding the veracity of his confession.  Despite the absence of forensic evidence and witness testimony supporting Hernandez's claim, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance approved filing murder charges against him. This decision raises questions about whether there is additional evidence or information that led to this course of action.  The article provides some background information on Hernandez's personal life as well. He was reported to have been injured during a construction job in the 1990s and has been receiving disability compensation ever since. However, a relative contradicts this information and claims that he was actually injured while working at a clothing factory in New Jersey.  Hernandez has been described as having a long history of psychiatric issues, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and hallucinations. His attorney has emphasized his client's mental health struggles as part of his defense strategy.  Overall, this news article highlights both the details surrounding Pedro Hernandez's alleged confession to Etan Patz's murder as well as providing insights into his personal background and mental health history. It outlines some conflicting accounts from different individuals who knew him and raises important questions about the reliability of his confession given its lack of forensic evidence or witness corroboration. The decision by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance to proceed with murder charges without these elements further adds complexity to an already perplexing case.",explain
"The article discusses Britney Spears' recent decision to join the singing competition show ""The X Factor"" as a judge. It highlights the contrast between her and other reality show judges, stating that she is still riding on the success of her recent album and tour.  The article mentions that although Britney Spears' personal life has been under conservatorship since 2008, she has not been accessible to her fans. It argues that in order to maintain fame in today's music industry, artists need to connect with their fans on a personal level. The author suggests that appearing on ""The X Factor"" and showing off her personality each week could reignite the level of fame Spears experienced in the early 2000s.

However, with Britney Spears joining as a judge, these concerns regarding ratings may no longer be an issue.

"This news article discusses the ongoing strike by teachers in Chicago and the reasons behind their objections to certain aspects of their evaluations and contract negotiations.  One of the main reasons why teachers are objecting to evaluations tied to performance is because they believe that student performance is influenced by factors outside of their control, such as conditions in students' homes or neighborhoods. They argue that it would be unfair for them to be punished if students don't do well in the classroom due to these external factors.  There is also disagreement about how many jobs will be lost under the evaluation plan. The president of the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), Karen Lewis, claims that up to 6,000 teachers could lose their jobs under this system. However, city and school officials have questioned this number.  Another point of contention is the number of school closings being discussed. The CTU says that 200 schools will be closed, but a spokeswoman for Chicago Public Schools calls this claim ""false"" and asserts that union leaders recently stated only 100 schools would close.  As for the status of the strike itself, there won't be any decision made on Monday as it coincides with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. The mayor has expressed his intention to go to court and file an injunction aiming to end the strike immediately. He believes that Sunday's actions by the union are delaying progress and negatively impacting children.  The House of Delegates, which consists of 800 union representatives, will reconvene on Tuesday afternoon. At this meeting, they could decide whether or not to end the strike. If they choose to do so, classes would resume no earlier than Wednesday. However, even if delegates opt to end the strike before resuming classes, all union members still have a chance later on to accept or reject any proposed contract.  The article also provides some background information about Chicago Teachers Union membership and salaries. The CTU represents around 26,000 teachers, and Chicago's school system is the third-largest in the nation with approximately 35,000 students. The city's teachers are among the highest paid in the country with a median base salary of $67,974 as of 2011.  Regarding the contract negotiations, teachers are being offered a pay raise structured at 3% for the first year, 2% for the second year, and an additional 2% for the third year. If a trigger extends the contract to four years, there would be a further 3% pay increase. Other changes include no longer compensating union members for unused personal days and freezing health insurance contribution rates.  The public reaction to the strike has varied in this pro-union town. While parents have had to navigate work schedules and bear additional childcare expenses during this time, many remain supportive of the union's action.  The article briefly mentions that President Obama's former chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has received little comment from the White House regarding this situation. It also notes that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has criticized the Chicago Teachers Union's decision to strike while emphasizing his disappointment that it affects children relying on public schools for their education.  Overall, this article provides an overview of some key points related to the ongoing teacher strike in Chicago along with various perspectives on different issues raised during negotiations between teachers and city officials.",explain
"The news article discusses the controversy surrounding Israel hosting the UEFA Under-21 European Championship, particularly in light of recent events involving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The article highlights a statement made by former footballer Frederic Kanoute, which criticizes Israel for hosting the championship and suggests it is a reward for actions that go against sporting values.  However, CNN has not found any evidence to support the claim that children were killed while playing football. The article then goes on to report an incident on November 10 where four Palestinians were killed when an Israeli tank fired at a building where mourners had gathered for a funeral. Israeli authorities stated that they were targeting militants who had attacked an Israeli Defense Patrol and injured four soldiers.  The statement on Kanoute's site emphasizes that despite recent ceasefires, Palestinians continue to live under occupation and calls for their protection by the international community. It also mentions the right of all people to live with dignity, freedom, and security.  Despite calls from pro-Palestine groups including Palestine's football association to move the tournament from Israel, UEFA (European football's governing body) rejected these demands. UEFA President Michel Platini defended Israel's right to host through fair democratic voting and expressed confidence in the tournament bringing people together.  FIFA (world football's governing body) also stated its stance of not interfering in political affairs but affirmed its commitment to help rebuild infrastructure destroyed during conflicts. This includes plans to rebuild a stadium in Gaza following an attack similar to one in 2006.  Israeli media criticized FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke's statement about rebuilding infrastructure due to allegations that Hamas militants used the stadium for firing rockets at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.  The article briefly mentions Palestine's bid for recognition as it received upgraded status as a non-member observer state from U.N.'s general assembly despite opposition from both Israel and U.S. Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat explained their intentions were focused on preserving a two-state solution rather than confronting or isolating Israel.  In conclusion, the news article highlights the controversy surrounding Israel hosting the UEFA Under-21 European Championship in light of recent events in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While some criticize this decision, others defend it as an apolitical sporting event. The article also touches on FIFA's commitment to reconstruction after infrastructure destruction and Palestine's recent upgrade in status at the U.N. The news article delves further into the controversy surrounding Israel hosting the UEFA Under-21 European Championship and the differing views on whether it is appropriate given the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Critics like Frederic Kanoute argue that hosting such a prominent sporting event in Israel could be seen as a reward for actions contrary to sporting values. They draw attention to the plight of Palestinians living under occupation and emphasize the need for international protection and a just settlement. These critics believe that rewarding Israel with the tournament undermines efforts to address human rights concerns.  On the other hand, UEFA President Michel Platini defends Israel's right to host based on fair democratic voting. He expresses confidence in football's ability to bring people together and suggests that hosting the championship can be seen as a celebration of football rather than an endorsement of political actions.  FIFA also takes a similar apolitical stance, stating its mandate to rebuild football infrastructure destroyed during conflicts. However, Israeli media criticizes FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke's statement regarding rebuilding infrastructure, citing allegations that Hamas militants used certain stadiums as launching sites for rocket attacks against Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.  The article briefly mentions Palestinian aspirations for recognition through their upgraded status as a non-member observer state at the United Nations' general assembly. While Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat insists their intentions were focused on preserving a two-state solution rather than isolating or discriminating against Israel, this development further fuels tensions between pro-Palestine groups and those who support maintaining sporting events in Israel.  This controversy raises broader questions about politics intersecting with sports events. Some argue that sports should remain separate from political conflicts, emphasizing unity through athletic competition. Others believe that without addressing underlying injustices occurring within host countries, participating in such events may inadvertently legitimize oppressive regimes or policies.  It is important to note that while CNN did not find evidence of children being killed while playing football specifically, there have been instances throughout history where sports facilities have been targeted during conflicts, leading to injuries and deaths of innocent people.  In conclusion, the news article explores the debate surrounding Israel hosting the UEFA Under-21 European Championship in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It discusses differing viewpoints on whether hosting such an event in Israel is appropriate, highlighting arguments both for and against. The controversy raises broader questions about politics and sports, particularly when it comes to events hosted by countries involved in ongoing conflicts or with human rights concerns.",explain

The disturbances resulted in a backlog of work, loss of wages and shifts for workers, and had negative consequences for people in the surrounding areas. The Executive Director of the Port of Oakland, Omar Benjamin, suggested that the Occupy movement should focus on finding real solutions to economic problems instead.  On a typical night, there would be several hundred people working overnight at the port. However, due to these disruptions caused by protesters, this normal routine was affected. Port spokesman Isaac Kos-Read expressed his frustration with these actions by asking what they had actually accomplished and how it was impacting those who were part of the 99% being protested for.  The Occupy movement has been protesting against corporate greed and their belief that 1% of society holds too much power over the remaining 99%. However, both Kos-Read and Oakland Mayor Jean Quan argued that these actions were not considering or understanding their consequences on regular individuals who are already suffering economically.  Oakland has been a focal point for protests since October when police used tear gas to control demonstrators who refused to leave downtown. There were incidents where police projectiles allegedly caused injury to one protester who is an Iraq war veteran.  The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), which represents dockworkers at various ports including those involved in protests criticized attempts by outside groups to co-opt their struggle with port disputes in Washington state. The president of ILWU urged such groups not to divert their attention from key issues affecting workers' rights.  This article also mentions other instances where Occupy protesters engaged in actions outside conventional protest sites. In Washington D.C., three individuals staged a hunger strike outside House Speaker John Boehner's office demanding full voting rights for residents in Washington D.C.. In Baltimore, police dismantled an encampment after two months due to permit denial and safety concerns following incidents such as a stabbing.  The article highlights that the protests in several cities, including Houston and Long Beach, caused disruptions to traffic and led to arrests. However, protests outside the gate of San Diego’s port did not hinder operations. These actions were part of a nationwide Occupy effort following crackdowns by authorities in various cities on demonstrators who had established camps in public spaces.  Overall, this news article presents various viewpoints on the Occupy movement's actions. It emphasizes concerns about the impact on regular people and questions about what these disruptions have accomplished. It also mentions instances where related movements outside conventional protest environments took place, indicating that the movement expanded beyond just occupying public spaces. The article goes on to mention the reasoning behind the Occupy movement's actions. According to the organizers, they are occupying ports as part of a larger day of action, boycott, and march. Their main goals are to draw attention and protest against what they perceive as a criminal system that relies on wealth concentration and exploits workers locally and globally. They also highlight the denial of workers' rights to fair pay, decent working conditions, benefits, and disregard for environmental and community health and safety.  The disruptions at the Port of Oakland were just one part of this nationwide effort by Occupy protesters in response to attempts by cities across the country to clear out their encampments from public spaces. The article mentions cities like New York City, Boston, and Oakland where local authorities took action.  It is worth noting that while some within the Occupy movement were focused specifically on economic inequality issues concerning corporate greed, others started using it as a platform for addressing broader social issues or causes that they saw fit. For example, hunger strikes demanding voting rights in Washington D.C., protests related to police actions in Baltimore encampments, or general calls for social justice.  The reactions from officials featured in this article paint a mixed picture regarding how these actions were perceived. While some officials sympathized with certain aspects or concerns raised by protesters – such as ILWU supporting concerns about middle-class decline – they also voiced frustration over disruptive tactics impacting regular individuals negatively.  Oakland Mayor Jean Quan emphasized her concern over the consequences of these disruptive actions during Christmas time explicitly stating that those affected may be left crying while she believes those being protested against may find it amusing instead.  Despite differences in opinion about methods or specific demands raised by different factions within Occupy-related movements across various locations mentioned here (e.g., Longview port dispute), this article does not delve into detailed discussions surrounding these disputes but rather focuses primarily on documenting notable events unfolding during this particular time frame.  CNN credits several contributors within this article, indicating a collaborative effort from their journalists to cover the multiple locations and occurrences related to the Occupy movement and its effects on various cities' operations.  In conclusion, this news article provides an overview of disruptions caused by the Occupy movement at the Port of Oakland and other West Coast locations. It explores different points of view on the impact, effectiveness, and consequences of these protests on workers, local communities, and broader social issues.",explain

"This news article provides an update on the ongoing conflict in Syria. It begins by reporting that four people were killed at the start of the day, following a day where at least 144 people were reported killed, including 64 in a massacre at a checkpoint in Homs province. The victims were trying to escape shelling in the Baba Amr neighborhood. A survivor reported the attack which led to finding 68 bodies, all of whom had been shot or stabbed.  The article also mentions that explosions and shelling continued in Homs and that 20 people were wounded during an anti-government gathering when a large shell struck. At the same time, Syria announced that their new draft constitution received approval from 89.4% of voters. However, many consider this referendum as a superficial attempt by President Bashar al-Assad to pacify his critics rather than meaningful reform.  Amidst the violence, aid efforts were underway with organizations like the Syrian Red Crescent and International Committee of the Red Cross entering Hama province to provide assistance to civilians. They distributed food, blankets, and hygiene kits to around 12,000 people and managed to enter Baba Amr with medical supplies but couldn't evacuate two foreign journalists who had been injured.  The European Union also imposed new sanctions on Syria after foreign ministers met in Brussels. These measures included freezing assets of seven ministers from Assad's regime as well as freezing assets held by the Syrian Central Bank within EU territories.  The article then briefly mentions other incidents of violence across different parts of Syria such as shelling on Sarmeen village and security forces firing on mourners at a funeral in Damascus.  It concludes by mentioning that according to opposition activists' estimates, approximately 9,000 people have been killed since March when Bashar al-Assad's crackdown began while Syria's government claims more than 2,000 members of its security forces have died at the hands of ""terrorists"".  Overall, this news article provides an account of the ongoing violence in Syria, including a massacre at a checkpoint, ongoing shelling in Homs, and international reactions and aid efforts in response to the crisis. The article highlights the devastating impact of the conflict in Syria, with reports of massacres, shelling, and widespread violence across different regions. It emphasizes that the situation is grave and that both civilians and security forces are being killed.  The news report sheds light on the heinous attack at a checkpoint in Homs province where 64 people were brutally killed while trying to flee from shelling. The violence is described as a ""horrifying massacre,"" and it is noted that women were reportedly abducted by security members during the attack. The discovery of multiple bodies reflects the brutality of this incident.  Furthermore, the article discusses how President Bashar al-Assad's regime has attempted to present a semblance of reform through a referendum on a new draft constitution. However, both analysts and protesters have dismissed this effort as insincere and merely an attempt to maintain control. The ongoing violence in cities like Homs and Hama undermines any possibility for democratic change or fair elections under such conditions.  International responses are also addressed in the article, particularly focusing on EU sanctions imposed against Assad's regime. By freezing assets of key officials within Assad's government as well as those held by the Syrian Central Bank within European territories, these measures aim to exert pressure on those responsible for repressive actions against civilians.  In addition to documenting acts of violence across different areas in Syria, such as shelling in Sarmeen village or clashes in Deir Ezzor, there is mention of arrests made during protests at Aleppo University. These incidents further underscore the continued unrest throughout various parts of Syria.  The article concludes by highlighting estimated death tolls provided by opposition activists who claim that around 9,000 people have been killed since March when the crackdown began. Meanwhile, Syrian authorities argue that over 2,000 members of their security forces have died due to attacks carried out by ""terrorists."" This disparity reveals conflicting narratives surrounding casualties amid intense violence engulfing communities across the country.  Overall, the news article presents a troubling picture of ongoing violence and human suffering in Syria, characterized by massacres, shelling, and repression. The international community's response is limited to sanctions as efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution or protect civilian lives continue amidst a deeply entrenched conflict.",explain
"This news article discusses the fallout from the National Security Agency's (NSA) reported spying on Germany and other European allies. German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her anger and concern about the surveillance during a news conference in Brussels, Belgium. She emphasized that spying among friends is never acceptable and called for discussions on data protection and transparency to be added to the European leaders' agenda.  The article mentions that President Barack Obama understands the need for change from his country's perspective, but he assured Merkel that the United States is not monitoring her communications. The White House spokesman reiterated this statement, while Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser acknowledged that recent disclosures have created challenges in their relationships with other countries.  This revelation comes amidst similar allegations against the NSA regarding France and 35 world leaders. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault described these claims as shocking, calling for a discussion on electronic surveillance at the EU summit.  The article also highlights calls from European leaders for stronger data protection laws in response to these spying scandals. Viviane Reding of the European Commission urged EU nations to commit to adopting a data protection law, emphasizing that it must apply to everyone.  Before these latest allegations surfaced, Germany had already expressed concerns about US spying after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified information about American surveillance programs. Reports had previously claimed that the agency bugged EU offices in Washington and New York.  The British government declined to comment on whether Prime Minister David Cameron's phone had been tapped by US intelligence agencies following Germany's suspicion of Merkel's phone being monitored.  In response to these claims, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper dismissed them as inaccurate and misleading but acknowledged that all nations engage in intelligence gathering activities.  Overall, this article highlights growing tensions between Europe and America due to accusations of US espionage targeting its allies. It also underscores calls for stricter data protection laws within Europe as a means of countering fears regarding mass surveillance. The article goes on to discuss the impact of these spying allegations on diplomatic relations between the United States and its European allies. It mentions that the claims made by Le Monde about the NSA intercepting French phone calls on a massive scale prompted a flurry of activity between President Obama and French President François Hollande. They held discussions to address these concerns, with Obama assuring Hollande that their activities had been distorted in the press.  However, despite these reassurances, there is skepticism among European leaders regarding the extent of US surveillance activities. The article suggests that explanations from US officials about gathering foreign intelligence similar to other nations may not be well-received by Washington's allies in Europe.  The issue of electronic surveillance has overshadowed other topics at the EU summit, which was supposed to focus on digital economy and social policy issues. This shows how significant and disruptive this matter has become within diplomatic circles.  The German government's reaction to being targeted by surveillance has been particularly strong. Chancellor Merkel emphasized that trust needs to be restored between Germany and the United States, but her insistence on bringing data protection issues to the forefront indicates a desire for concrete action rather than just words.  Additionally, Vice President of the European Commission Viviane Reding's call for big European rules to counter fears of surveillance underscores a growing sentiment among European leaders for stronger data protection measures at a continental level.  Overall, this news article portrays an atmosphere of anger and discontent among European allies as they grapple with revelations about US spying activities. There is a sense that trust needs to be rebuilt and concrete steps need to be taken towards protecting privacy rights within Europe. The fallout from these allegations continues with potential implications for diplomatic relations between Europe and America moving forward. ",explain
"This news article discusses the recent conflict within the Democratic Party over a provision in a spending bill that was passed by the Senate. The provision, attached to the bill by Republicans, rolled back a key portion of the Wall Street reform law. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren objected to this provision, prompting many Democrats to defect and causing President Barack Obama to make calls in order to win lawmakers back and avoid a potential government shutdown.  During this time, progressive activists and operatives gathered for the annual Rootscamp gathering in Washington. Panels at the gathering addressed issues such as #HillaryProblems and the lack of understanding between grassroots and establishment wings of the Democratic Party. Attendees at Rootscamp endorsed their elected officials' antagonistic moves against Republican policies.  With Republicans set to take control of the Senate next month, progressives feel it is important for them to stand firm on key issues. Democrats fear that Republicans will attempt to roll back policies passed under Obama using upcoming deadlines like raising debt ceiling next year.  The article also highlights how President Obama's standing within his party has diminished as he enters his final years as President. Democrats no longer feel obligated to follow his lead, especially with Republicans gaining control of Congress.  Many progressives are frustrated with what they believe is indecisiveness from both President Obama and other Democratic leaders on important issues. This frustration led to a progressive backlash against more moderate members of their party and fueled support for Elizabeth Warren, who has been seen as unafraid to stand up for her principles.  The elevation of Warren's prominence in these policy fights is likely going be an issue for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she decides to run for president. More than 300 former Obama campaign staffers signed a letter urging Warren herself run for president this week, showing dissatisfaction with Clinton's perceived coziness with Wall Street.  Overall, this article describes tensions within the Democratic Party between its progressive wing represented by figures like Elizabeth Warren and its more moderate members. These tensions are likely to impact the upcoming presidential primary and could shape the platform of potential candidates like Hillary Clinton. The article goes on to discuss the potential impact of these tensions within the Democratic Party on the upcoming presidential race. It mentions that there is skepticism among progressives towards Hillary Clinton, as they believe she is too closely connected to Wall Street. On the other hand, Elizabeth Warren has repeatedly stated that she is not interested in running for president, but her involvement in these policy fights and her focus on Wall Street reform could influence Clinton's potential candidacy.  Over 300 former Obama campaign staffers signed a letter urging Warren to run for president, indicating that there is significant support for her among this group. The article suggests that even if Warren doesn't run herself, having her in the mix and bringing attention to issues like Wall Street reform could shape Clinton's platform and campaign strategy.  The tensions within the party and the prominence of Warren are leading some Democratic Party officials to predict a spirited primary battle for the presidential nomination. This indicates that there may be a divide between progressive and more moderate Democrats when it comes to selecting a candidate for 2016.  In conclusion, this news article highlights the conflict within the Democratic Party over key issues such as Wall Street reform. Elizabeth Warren's objection to a provision in a spending bill led to divisions within the party and has fueled support for her among progressives who are frustrated with more moderate politicians. The ongoing tensions could impact Hillary Clinton's potential presidential bid and lead to a competitive primary process within the party.",explain
"This news article discusses the ongoing investigations into match-fixing in football, specifically targeting top clubs such as Napoli. It starts by mentioning a raid on the Italy team headquarters ahead of Euro 2012 and highlights the importance of real-time information sharing and Interpol's global network in locating, identifying, and arresting suspects involved in match-fixing.  The head of Interpol, Ronald Noble, emphasizes that the arrest of a suspected match-fixer could not have been possible without close cooperation between Italy, Singapore, and Interpol. He also mentions that Singapore and Italy are among Interpol's most active and effective member countries in combating match-fixing.  The article reveals that Suljic is one of more than 500 fugitives wanted by 59 member countries as part of Operation Infra-Red in 2012. This operation has resulted in the arrest or location of 130 individuals so far. Suljic is suspected to have worked for Tan Seet Eng (also known as Dan Tan), a Singaporean businessman who is wanted by Italian authorities.  Italian police indicate that Suljic spent a significant amount of time inactive in Singapore while maintaining close contact with other members of the organization involved in match-fixing. They also mention his association with a well-known Singaporean citizen.  On another front, Singapore police announce that four senior officers will be sent to Interpol's headquarters in Lyon to assist in match-fixing investigations. They hope to build concrete cases against individuals and syndicates involved while also offering their assistance and sharing available information with affected countries.  The article highlights FIFA secretary general's description of match-fixing as a ""disease"" afflicting football. It mentions recent actions taken against Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua for their involvement in such activities - they were stripped off their domestic league title from 2003 and fined $160k.  Europol's revelation about investigating 380 matches on the continent further emphasizes how widespread match-fixing is. This includes top-level Champions League games, indicating the seriousness of the issue.  In response to the growing concern, FIFPro, the international players' union, plans to launch an online match-fixing hotline for its members. The article also mentions Zhang Jilong, acting president of the Asian Football Confederation, highlighting the need for a joint and coordinated effort to eliminate match-fixing from the game.  Dale Sheehan from Interpol emphasizes that criminals involved in match-fixing can make millions in illicit profits with minimal risk of detection. He also highlights the social costs of match-fixing on society and youth, including murder, suicide, assault, and threats.  In summary, this news article emphasizes ongoing investigations into match-fixing in football involving top clubs such as Napoli. It highlights collaboration between countries like Italy and Singapore with Interpol to locate and arrest suspects involved in these activities. The article also discusses actions taken against Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua and mentions other ongoing investigations related to match-fixing across Europe. Finally, it underscores efforts by organizations like FIFPro and calls for a joint effort to combat this widespread problem within football.  In addition to highlighting the ongoing investigations and actions taken against match-fixing, the article provides important insights into the nature and impact of this illicit activity. It underscores that match-fixing poses a serious threat to football's ethical values and calls for its elimination in order to preserve the integrity of the sport.  The involvement of Interpol in coordinating international efforts against match-fixing is particularly significant. With 59 member countries cooperating through Operation Infra-Red, significant progress has already been made in apprehending fugitives involved. The arrest or location of 130 individuals represents a considerable step forward in dismantling these criminal networks.  The article also sheds light on specific cases, such as Suljic's alleged connection with Tan Seet Eng (Dan Tan), which highlight how far-reaching these networks can be. The fact that Suljic spent an extended period inactive in Singapore while maintaining contact with other members of the organization suggests a deeper substructure operating across borders.  Singapore's commitment to combating match-fixing is underscored by their cooperation with Interpol and sending senior officers to Lyon headquarters. Their goal is not only to build concrete cases but also share information and offer assistance to affected countries. This cooperative approach demonstrates Singapore's determination to play an active role in fighting this pervasive problem within football.  Another crucial aspect specified in the article involves the social costs associated with match-fixing. Dale Sheehan from Interpol points out that criminals involved can make substantial illicit profits while threatening sports' very fabric – fair play – leading to severe consequences such as murder, suicide, assault, and threats. These significant societal impacts further emphasize why it is essential for global entities like Interpol, national authorities, and football organizations to collaborate closely towards eradicating this issue.  Furthermore, it underscores FIFA's acknowledgement of match-fixing as a disease afflicting football worldwide—a sentiment echoed by Zhang Jilong from AFC at the Interpol conference. This recognition adds weight to the urgency of addressing the issue and reinforces the need for unified efforts from various sports bodies, law enforcement agencies, and governments.  The article also briefly touches upon actions taken against match-fixing in other regions such as China, where clubs and individuals involved in such activities faced severe punishments. This serves as a reminder that match-fixing is not confined to specific countries or continents but requires global cooperation to root out this threat entirely.  Overall, this news article provides a comprehensive overview of ongoing investigations into match-fixing within football. It highlights significant collaborations between countries, international organizations like Interpol, and various football associations striving to eliminate this unethical practice. Through joint efforts and stringent measures taken against those involved, it is hoped that the integrity of football can be restored while protecting its players and fans from the detrimental effects of match-fixing.",explain
"This news article discusses the career and recent activities of Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft. It highlights his tenure at Microsoft, his successes and failures, as well as his interest in basketball and bid to purchase the Los Angeles Clippers.  The article starts by mentioning that Ballmer took over the leadership of Microsoft from Bill Gates in 2000. It notes that Ballmer and Gates became friends while studying at Harvard University in the 1970s. While Ballmer earned a degree in mathematics and economics, Gates dropped out of college but still managed to succeed without a degree.  During his time as CEO of Microsoft, Ballmer faced some turbulent periods. Despite taking over a company that was considered the most valuable in the world at the time, Microsoft's market value declined by more than half over a decade under his leadership. Investors criticized him for failing to anticipate the rise of mobile computing.  However, there were also notable successes during Ballmer's tenure. Windows 7 became one of the fastest-selling operating systems ever, and Microsoft's cloud and enterprise businesses remained strong throughout that period. According to Microsoft, revenue tripled and profits doubled under Ballmer's leadership.  Ballmer retired from his position as CEO in February but has maintained an active presence since then. He has been spotted attending basketball games for teams like the LA Clippers. The article describes him as being very animated during corporate presentations while leading cheers for himself.  Interestingly, it is revealed that Ballmer damaged his vocal cords during one such display of enthusiasm for Windows at a sales meeting when he shouted ''Windows! Windows!'' so fiercely that he required surgery on his vocal cords.  The article also delves into personal details about Steve Baller’s background such as being from Detroit with familial ties to Ford Motor Co., excelling academically growing up there while becoming valedictorian before going on to study at Harvard University.  It also mentions how he has expressed his love for basketball and his intentions to make the Clippers successful in Los Angeles. It is revealed that Ballmer made a bid of $2 billion to purchase the team. The article briefly mentions other interested parties, including media moguls David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey, who had a bid of $1.6 billion for the Clippers.  However, it notes that any purchase of the franchise by Ballmer would require approval from 75% of the NBA's 30 owners. In the past, Ballmer was part of a group that attempted to buy another NBA team, the Sacramento Kings but were denied by owners who wanted to keep the team in Sacramento.  The article concludes by suggesting that this time around, there might be a different outcome for Ballmer's bid due to changing ownership circumstances surrounding Donald Sterling - owner at that time.  In summary, this news article covers Steve Ballmer's career at Microsoft as CEO and highlights both his successes and failures during his tenure. It also discusses his current interest in purchasing an NBA basketball team, specifically the LA Clippers, reflecting on previous failed attempts to own an NBA franchise.",explain
"This news article discusses the potential forms of international intervention against ISIS and the implications it may have on the group's propaganda efforts and global appeal. The article starts by highlighting an international consensus that Western countries are not inclined to deploy troops on the ground, except for limited presence to protect national assets. Instead, any intervention is likely to take the form of targeted strikes from the air, such as drone attacks, airstrikes or missile strikes. The focus of these strikes would be specifically on ISIS strongholds in order to minimize civilian casualties.  However, despite efforts to minimize civilian casualties, any attack carried out by Western forces is likely to result in Muslim civilian deaths or injuries. This plays into ISIS's strategy as they rely on attributing civilian casualties to their enemies in order to strengthen their jihadist narrative and defend their false legitimacy. The more civilians that die, the greater opportunity there is for ISIS to amplify their message and gain wider support.  The article argues that if deaths occur at the hands of US or UK forces, it would significantly contribute to bolstering ISIS's propaganda efforts. This is because one of the central ideas within jihadist ideology is a so-called ""War on Islam,"" where any international involvement in conflicts involving Muslims reinforces their narrative and relevance. It questions why Western intervention focuses on Iraq but not Syria under Bashar al-Assad when chemical weapons were allegedly used.  The author suggests that Baghdad's plea for military assistance should be ignored in favor of focusing on humanitarian aid for refugees and diplomatic pressure for reforms within Iraq. The long-term solution lies in politically incorporating marginalized Sunni groups into Iraq's decision-making process; however, this doesn't mean military action should be ruled out categorically.  If Iraqi armed forces fail to stabilize themselves against ISIS threats completely, it may become necessary for military intervention by a Sunni Muslim-majority country instead. By doing so, it aims at diffusing Western armed forces' impact against Muslims while still countering threats posed by ISIS effectively. Countries like Turkey or Jordan are proposed as potential regional players to undertake such actions.  The article concludes by asserting that the West's focus should not be on direct military intervention but rather on undermining the ideological foundation of ISIS. This can be achieved through a policy of restraint, allowing regional powers to handle the group's operational and strategic capacity while countering their rhetoric that Muslims worldwide are under attack by the West.  In summary, this news article analyzes potential international interventions against ISIS and raises concerns about civilian casualties that would play into the group's propaganda efforts. It suggests alternative approaches such as humanitarian aid, diplomatic pressure, and involving Sunni-majority countries in military actions to counter ISIS effectively while undermining its ideological influence. The article goes on to emphasize the importance of undermining ISIS's ideological appeal as a crucial element in combating the group effectively. It argues that focusing solely on military intervention without addressing the underlying narrative that fuels ISIS's recruitment and support will not lead to a sustainable solution.  The author suggests that restraint should be exercised in military action, letting regional players take the lead in dealing with the operational and strategic aspects of countering ISIS. Instead, Western powers should redirect their efforts towards dismantling the core rhetoric of ISIS - that Muslims worldwide are under attack by the West. By challenging this narrative through thoughtful policies and actions, it is believed that the appeal of ISIS can be diminished significantly.  Furthermore, the article highlights another concern regarding selective interventionism. It questions why there is such an emphasis on supporting civilian rights against ISIS in Iraq while neglecting similar actions against Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria when chemical weapons were reportedly used. This perceived inconsistency could reinforce negative perceptions among vulnerable populations in the region, suggesting that Western military actions are solely driven by economic interests rather than a genuine commitment to protect civilians.  In light of these concerns, Baghdad's appeal for military assistance is discouraged as it may inadvertently play into the hands of jihadists by further internationalizing events and bolstering their cause. Instead, focus should be placed on providing humanitarian aid to refugees affected by conflict and exerting diplomatic pressure on Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki for significant reforms within Iraq itself. These long-term reforms would involve bringing back marginalized Sunni groups into Iraq's political process.  Despite arguing against direct Western military action, however, there is recognition within the article that if Iraqi national forces prove unable to stabilize themselves effectively against ISIS threats alone, intervention might become necessary. In this case, it asserts Sunni Muslim-majority countries like Turkey or Jordan would be more appropriate actors to undertake such actions as they would better counteract jihadist narratives about a ""War on Islam.""  To conclude, this news article urges a reevaluation of Western strategies in countering ISIS. It highlights the risks of inadvertently feeding into the group's propaganda efforts through civilian casualties while also calling for consistency in addressing human rights violations across various conflicts in the region. The focus should shift towards undercutting ISIS's ideological appeal, promoting humanitarian assistance, and fostering long-term political reforms within Iraq. The role of military intervention is not ruled out entirely but is suggested to be better carried out by regional actors to avoid reinforcing negative narratives about Western involvement in conflicts involving Muslims.",explain
"The news article discusses the artistic elements that have emerged during the ongoing protest movement in Hong Kong. The author highlights the creativity and talent displayed by different artists who have contributed to the protest encampment.  Douglas Young, a designer and entrepreneur based in Hong Kong, describes the outpouring of creative talent as unprecedented. He points out that he is not an active supporter of the protest movement but acknowledges the remarkable display of artistic expression.  One artist known as Milk draws inspiration from a protester holding an umbrella to shield a police officer from rain. The image of umbrellas has become iconic during these protests, symbolizing protection and resistance against police actions. Umbrellas were used by protesters to shield themselves from pepper spray fired by police. Since then, various artworks featuring umbrellas have been scattered throughout the streets and sidewalks with slogans advocating for democracy, freedom, and justice.  A graphic designer named Carol Hung created a cartoon character resembling Paddington Bear holding an umbrella in response to clashes between police and protesters on September 28th. She explains that her initial intention was to bring some humor into such a tense environment but was ultimately motivated by witnessing tear gas being used against protesters.  Art teacher Josephine Lau engages in her own form of silent protest by painting yellow ribbons onto Chinese paper while sitting amidst student-occupied highways. She believes that art offers another means for people to express their sentiments about Hong Kong's situation beyond traditional forms of activism.  Seventeen-year-old Timothy Sun uses his artistic skills to design posters with slogans directly questioning government officials. He wants his artwork to serve as a way for him to communicate his voice publicly.  The article also mentions a famous artwork at the protest site called the ""Lennon Wall,"" composed of thousands of colorful post-it notes displaying messages and drawings written by passersby in different languages. These notes express love for Hong Kong and demonstrate people's preference for expressing themselves through physical mediums like paper rather than solely relying on social media.  The author notes that despite the freedom to post anything online, there is still a strong attraction to using traditional materials in creative expression. Douglas Young compares this form of expression to ""old school Twitter,"" remarking on the tenderness, passion, and imagination displayed through these physical artworks.  Young ends with a lingering question about the future of these artists and their artwork after the protests subside. He wonders where these artists will be and how they will continue expressing themselves once this movement comes to an end.  Overall, the article emphasizes the powerful role that art has played in supporting and amplifying people's voices within Hong Kong's protest movement. It highlights various artistic works inspired by umbrellas and yellow ribbons while also showcasing different forms of artistic expression ranging from cartoons to post-it note messages. In addition to highlighting the various forms of artistic expression, the article also sheds light on the significance and impact of these artworks within the protest movement. The presence of art at the protest encampment is described as an ""outpouring"" and a ""magnet"" that attracts artists who want to make their voices heard.  The use of umbrellas as a symbol in many of these artworks holds particular importance. Umbrellas have become synonymous with Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement since they were used by protesters to protect themselves from pepper spray during clashes with police. They now serve as a powerful representation of resistance and unity.  The article highlights specific artists who are actively participating in this creative outpouring. We learn about Milk, who was inspired to create his statue based on an image he saw of a protester shielding a police officer from rain. We also hear from graphic designer Carol Hung, whose cartoon depiction referencing the children's book character Paddington Bear aims to bring some humor amidst tense circumstances.  There is mention of art teacher Josephine Lau and her intention to show her support for the students through her painted posters while embracing peaceful and silent forms of protest. Seventeen-year-old Timothy Sun takes advantage of his own artistic skills to design posters that openly question government officials, allowing him to communicate his voice in a public manner.  The impactful nature of these artworks is further emphasized by their ability to transcend digital platforms like social media. The ""Lennon Wall,"" composed entirely out of post-it notes bearing messages and drawings from people passing by, not only showcases love for Hong Kong but also demonstrates how physical mediums can carry significance even in an era dominated by digital communication.  One important aspect highlighted throughout the article is that many contributors consider their artwork as more than just visual creations - it serves as silent protests or expressions against government actions and dynamics within Hong Kong society.  In closing, Douglas Young reflects on what will happen after this protest movement ends - where these artists will be and how they will continue expressing themselves. This question not only prompts us to consider the future of these individuals but also speaks to the power of art as a means of protest and communication.  Overall, this news article emphasizes the role that artistic expression has played in Hong Kong's protest movement. It showcases various artists, their motivation for creating artworks inspired by umbrellas and yellow ribbons, and discusses how their creations have become iconic symbols within the movement. The article also delves into the significance of physical mediums in a digitally-driven world while leaving readers pondering about what lies ahead for these artistic voices once the protests conclude.",explain
"This news article is about the lack of protests and dissent at the Davos World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of influential individuals from around the world. The article starts by describing Alec Gagneux, who was handing out flyers and engaging in quiet conversations with people passing by. The key criticism of Davos is its elite nature and lack of accessibility to the general public. In previous years, there were visible protests around the venue, including during the Occupy movement in 2012.  However, this year's Davos seemed unusually quiet in terms of protests. While there was a small group from Ukraine trying to draw attention to their situation, overall, there were fewer demonstrations than expected. Gagneux's group had been gathered through online means but found themselves far from where all the action was happening. He explained that it was taboo to approach closer to where delegates for the World Economic Forum were meeting due to heavy security.  When asked about why he and his fellow protestors were at Davos, Gagneux mentioned that growth and inequality were significant concerns for them too. He highlighted that although there is a goal to halve extreme poverty by 2015, there isn't enough discussion about reducing extreme wealth as well.  Gagneux's primary concern is the long-term impact of growth on resources like cars, pollution, and exploited natural resources which will leave future generations with nothing. He quoted economist Kenneth Boulding's stance on exponential growth being impossible in a finite world.  Gagneux plans to make what he calls a ""thought stone"" representing Klaus Schwab (the organizer of WEF) as part of his protest actions during his time at Davos. He believes that everyone - humans along with animals and plants - are equal despite Schwab's importance within Davos.  When asked why he waited until Saturday (the end of the week), rather than staging his protest when more people are present during the full swing of WEF, Gagneux explained that most people still have to work during the weekdays. Saturday is therefore the easiest time for those who are not from Davos to come and join the demonstrations.  The article concludes by noting that even protesters need to pay their bills, indicating that there is a practical reason for protesting on weekends when more people can participate. It connects this idea to the global economy getting back on track after previous financial turmoil.  Overall, this news article discusses the relative absence of protests at Davos and highlights Gagneux's concerns about growth, inequality, and limited resources. The news article goes on to address the global economy and the need for change within Davos. It mentions that while the global economy may be recovering, there is still a persistent gap between the wealthy elite attending Davos and the average citizens who are dealing with economic realities and struggling to make ends meet. The article suggests that for Davos to have any meaningful impact, it must adapt and become more inclusive, addressing issues related to income inequality and systemic poverty.  The role of influential figures like Klaus Schwab, who organizes the World Economic Forum, is examined. Gagneux's intention to create a ""thought stone"" representing Schwab symbolizes a desire for everyone – not just those in positions of power or privilege – to be recognized as equal stakeholders in shaping our collective future.  Furthermore, there is an emphasis on sustainability and resource depletion. Gagneux expresses concerns about exponential growth in a finite world, condemning continuous exploitation of resources without considering their long-term consequences. He warns against leaving future generations with nothing.  In addition to Gagneux's message about growth and inequality, other protesters present at Davos likely had their own grievances against various aspects of global economics or politics. However, despite these concerns being shared by many individuals across different societies worldwide, the location restrictions imposed by security measures at Davos hinder larger-scale protests from taking place effectively.  Ultimately, the news article helps shed light on both the quietness surrounding protests at this year's Davos event as well as some of the underlying sentiments behind activists' involvement in challenging economic systems that perpetuate inequality. It also raises questions about how platforms like Davos can evolve to become more inclusive in addressing pressing societal issues affecting ordinary people rather than just benefiting an elite few.

"The news article discusses several key events happening at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in New York. One of the main topics is the success of Libya's revolution and the transition to a post-Gadhafi era. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated Libya's transitional leadership on this historic day and directed that their new flag be presented alongside the UN flag.  The article mentions that the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to accept the credentials of Libya's new leadership after rebels ousted Moammar Gadhafi from power last month. The rebuilding of Libya is expected to be a dominant topic during this session of the General Assembly.  Ban Ki-moon met with Mustafa Abdul Jalil, head of Libya's ruling National Transitional Council, to discuss a support mission run by British diplomat and UN envoy Ian Martin. This mission will focus on post-conflict planning, primarily security-building and electoral assistance. The involvement of various countries, including the United States, is crucial for supporting the new Libyan government as it faces challenges such as pockets of resistance and Gadhafi still being at large.  The article also mentions other issues being discussed at the General Assembly, including global desertification concerns and noncommunicable diseases being recognized as leading killers worldwide. World leaders are gathered to address these issues.  Another significant topic mentioned is Palestinian statehood. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas plans to deliver a formal membership application for full membership in a speech given during this session. However, there are debates surrounding whether they will receive enough support from Security Council members since they oppose Israel's objection.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes Palestinian statehood and calls for a return to negotiations instead. If Palestinians receive permanent observer status through majority voting in the General Assembly, they would have more leverage in pursuing legal actions against Israel.  In total, these events demonstrate various discussions taking place at the UN General Assembly regarding important global issues such as political transitions in countries like Libya and Palestine’s pursuit of statehood. In addition to the discussions on political transitions and Palestinian statehood, the article also highlights other important topics being addressed at the UN General Assembly. One of these is the alarming increase in global desertification, which has become a significant environmental concern. The international community is coming together to address this issue and find potential solutions.  Noncommunicable diseases are another pressing matter that was discussed during a two-day meeting at the General Assembly. Diseases like cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung diseases, and diabetes have now become leading causes of death worldwide. Developing countries, with limited budgets and overwhelmed healthcare systems, often struggle to combat these illnesses effectively. Therefore, delegates unanimously approved a ""political declaration"" aimed at addressing these diseases in developing countries more efficiently.  Furthermore, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's visit to New York is anticipated as he will deliver a speech discussing recent changes in the Middle East. There are speculations about whether he will raise questions related to Palestinian statehood as part of his address or if he will focus on other matters.  The United States has pledged to block any Palestinian membership application that reaches the Security Council but hopes to avoid using its veto power due to its unpopularity in the Middle East region. On the other hand, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas remains determined to attain full membership for Palestine through United Nations support by presenting their natural borders as their representation within Israeli territories.  The article concludes by mentioning that Hamas – which controls Gaza – warns Abbas against making this request as it believes acknowledging and negotiating with Israel would deprive Palestinians of their right to return home.  These events showcase various international concerns being discussed at the UN General Assembly. From political transitions and statehood aspirations to environmental challenges and health issues – world leaders have gathered together with an aim toward finding solutions and promoting global cooperation on these critical matters.

"This news article is about Hurricane Sandy, a Category 1 hurricane that was heading towards the East Coast of the United States. The National Hurricane Center predicted that Sandy would move slowly, resulting in a long-lasting event with impacts lasting two to three days. At the time of the article, Sandy was about 400 miles south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina and heading north at 7 mph with winds of 75 mph.  While it was possible for Sandy to weaken into a tropical storm, experts advised not to take it lightly due to its large size and potential for damage. Strong winds and heavy rain were expected, which could cause trees and power lines to come down as well as significant coastal flooding.  The targeted area for Sandy's landfall in the United States was uncertain at that point. Computer models showed possibilities ranging from North Carolina/Virginia border to Connecticut - densely populated areas of the country. Several states including Maryland, Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania had already declared states of emergency in preparation for the storm.  Due to its potential impact on politics during an ongoing national election campaign season, campaign events were canceled by both Mitt Romney (GOP presidential hopeful) and Vice President Joe Biden in Virginia Beach.  The article highlighted concerns that bad weather caused by Hurricane Sandy could make it difficult for people in Maryland or Washington D.C. area to cast their ballots during early voting periods starting on Monday or Saturday respectively. The possibility of rescheduling or relocating votes was mentioned by Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley.  Forecasts warned residents along Sandy's path to prepare for extended periods without power due to widespread outages that could last weeks if the storm stayed on track.  Though computer models were uncertain about snowfall along coastal areas impacted by Hurricane Sandy, some mountain regions like Appalachians were predicted to experience snowfall.  Preparations were underway among residents influenced by media warnings; e.g., stocking up batteries and bottled water - hardware stores had also displayed preparedness materials.  Various measures were being taken in response to Hurricane Sandy. In South Jersey, residents were stocking up on supplies, and hardware stores reported selling out of electric generators. At the Jersey shore, bulldozers were being used to fortify piers with sand to prevent water damage from flooding. In Norfolk, Virginia area more than two dozen ships were sent to sea for their own protection.  The article ended by mentioning that Miami International Airport had already canceled several flights to and from Jamaica or Bahamas due to the hurricane's approach, while Fort Lauderdale airport canceled flights as well.  Overall, this news article provides updates on Hurricane Sandy's expected impact on the East Coast of the United States and highlights preparations being made by states and residents in its path. It also mentions concerns about potential effects on politics during an ongoing election season and the possibility of weather-related disruptions in early voting areas. In addition to the updates on Hurricane Sandy and preparations being made, the article also discussed the potential severity of the storm. Some experts compared it to the historic ""Perfect Storm"" that occurred in 1991, cautioning that Sandy could be a storm of similar magnitude. This comparison raised concerns about the potential for extensive damage and disruptions.  Cities like Philadelphia were warned that they could take a direct hit from Sandy, prompting authorities to consider suspending public transportation services as a precautionary measure. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York was also evaluating whether or not to suspend all or some of its services ahead of the storm.  The possibility of widespread power outages was emphasized, with meteorologists warning that such outages could last not just a couple of days but potentially weeks if Sandy followed its projected path. This raised significant concerns for residents in affected areas who would need to prepare for several days without electricity.  The impact on both travel and politics was addressed in the article as well. Flights were already being canceled at Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale airport due to Sandy's approach, affecting travel plans for individuals traveling to Jamaica or Bahamas. Furthermore, campaign events for both Mitt Romney and Vice President Joe Biden were canceled due to safety concerns related to Hurricane Sandy.  Overall, this article provided readers with information about Hurricane Sandy's expected impact on various states along the East Coast of the United States while highlighting preparations being made by authorities and residents alike. It also underlined concerns about potential power outages, transportation disruptions, and political ramifications caused by severe weather conditions during an active election season. ",explain
"This news article discusses the case of Charlie Rogers, who was initially reported to have been the victim of a violent hate crime but is now facing charges for allegedly lying to the police about the incident. According to her attorney, Brett McArthur, Rogers had agreed to turn herself in as part of an arrangement and was released on a personal recognizance bond without having to post any money.  McArthur maintains that Rogers is innocent and described the charge as a surprise for someone who had previously been considered a victim. The police cited DNA evidence and pathologists' examinations that did not support Rogers' original statements. They also highlighted inconsistencies in her story during their investigation. The police statement emphasized that these serious allegations garnered national attention and spread fear among citizens, leading them to invest significant time and resources in identifying and arresting the three alleged suspects.  Following the reported attack, a vigil organized by Beth Rigatuso from Heartland Pride attracted over 1,000 people in Omaha. Rigatuso expressed disappointment upon learning that the incident may have been a hoax but hoped people would not abandon Rogers completely. She stated that funds raised during the vigil should be returned so they can be used to support genuine victims of anti-gay violence.  Regarding this fund, McArthur claimed he knew nothing about it or how much money might be involved but mentioned it existed before he became Rogers' lawyer.  The Lincoln Police Department complaint states that Charlie Rogers knowingly provided false information with intent to instigate an investigation into an alleged criminal matter. She reported being held down by attackers who carved derogatory words into her arms and abdomen as well as a cross onto her chest while she lay on her bed. However, according to deposition from investigator Lynette Russell filed with the complaint, there were no apparent signs of struggle on Roger's bedspread which was neatly placed on her bed. A DNA test also found no evidence of blood on it.  Russell additionally mentioned white gloves found at the scene. Rogers denied they belonged to her, but DNA testing revealed her DNA was the primary contributor to the DNA found on the inside of the gloves. Furthermore, a forensic pathologist who examined photos of Rogers' cuts suggested they appeared self-inflicted as they were superficial, symmetrical, avoided sensitive areas of the body, and followed a pattern that would be accessible and familiar to Rodgers.  Rumors had circulated due to the lack of identified suspects in recent weeks both in Lincoln and online. In response to these rumors, Rogers gave one interview where she stated that such incidents do happen even though she refused to discuss the attack itself. Megan Mikolajczyk, who was her attorney at that time, revealed that Rogers had initially been ready for a full interview but later canceled citing changes in circumstances. Mikolajczyk is no longer representing Rogers.  Linda Rappl, a neighbor of Rodgers', recounted finding her bloodied and tied up on her doorstep following the alleged attack. She described taking Roger's inside and calling 911 while providing her with comfort.  In summary, this news article presents an update on Charlie Roger's case involving allegations of false reporting regarding a violent hate crime against her. The article includes statements from Roger's attorney emphasizing her innocence as well as evidence cited by police pointing towards inconsistencies in her story during their investigation. It also highlights community reactions such as disappointment from organizers who had supported Rogers during vigils raising funds on her behalf but now seek those funds returned for support towards genuine victims of anti-gay violence",explain
"The news article discusses a recent incident in Afghanistan that highlights the existence of feudal justice and the lack of a formal judicial system in certain parts of the country. The incident takes place in remote Kand, an area outside the control of NATO and the Afghan government. Here, warlord Mullah Mustafa and his men hold power and rule by force.  The article begins by describing an execution that took place last month. The warlord ordered for shots to be fired at Nawroz, but despite multiple attempts, he was unable to deliver a fatal shot quickly. Spectators expressed their frustration with this failed attempt to kill Nawroz. This scene is a grim reminder that even after a decade of U.S.-led efforts to defeat extremism in Afghanistan, feudal justice still exists.  According to Human Rights Watch and the International Crisis Group, large parts of Afghanistan lack a formal judicial system and rely on tribal or customary forms of justice instead. The report issued by the International Crisis Group further criticizes Afghanistan's judicial system as being in disrepair.  The article points out that while the United States has invested billions into building up Afghan army and police forces, its attention towards justice reform has been modest at best. Only 1% of USAID's budget allocated between 2002 and 2007 ($64 million) was directed towards supporting rule of law establishment initiatives.  Human rights organizations have called upon President Hamid Karzai's government to prioritize establishing a professional judiciary system; however, incidents like Nawroz's execution demonstrate how far Afghanistan still has to go.  The article mentions other cases that have sparked outrage over time. In 2006, Abdul Rahman faced arrest and death threats for converting to Christianity. Last year, there were public executions by stoning ordered by Taliban militants since their fall from power - one such case involved a young couple who had eloped.  In Nawroz's case specifically, witnesses claim Mullah Mustafa gathered local mullahs to reach a verdict according to sharia (Islamic law). The father of the victim was offered compensation, but he refused, leading to the decision for execution. Nawroz attempted to buy his release but was denied. After his killing, conflicting statements were made - initially suggesting assistance from cousins and later stating that he acted alone.  Family members express their desire for law and order in Kand, where the government's presence is nonexistent while Mullah Mustafa holds influence due to his connections.  In conclusion, this news article sheds light on Afghanistan's ongoing struggle with establishing a functioning judicial system in areas beyond government control. The example of feudal justice demonstrated by warlord Mullah Mustafa underscores the need for significant improvements in justice reform efforts. The article highlights the deep-rooted issues with justice and governance in Afghanistan. It emphasizes that despite the U.S.-led war against extremism, many parts of the country still operate under feudal systems of justice, where powerful warlords like Mullah Mustafa hold sway over people's lives.  The incident involving Nawroz's execution reveals the brutal and swift nature of this form of justice. There was no trial or jury involved; instead, a verdict was reached by local mullahs based on sharia law. This eye-for-an-eye punishment reflects a lack of due process and raises concerns about human rights violations.  The article also points out that the United States' focus on nation-building in Afghanistan has primarily concentrated on building up military and security forces rather than investing in judicial institutions. The limited funding allocated to establishing rule of law suggests an oversight in addressing fundamental issues related to governance and ensuring access to fair and impartial justice for Afghan citizens.  Human rights organizations have long called for reforming Afghanistan's judicial system, urging President Hamid Karzai's government to prioritize establishing a professional judiciary that adheres to international standards. However, incidents like Nawroz's execution suggest not only a lack of progress but also a regression in terms of ensuring human rights protections within the country.  Furthermore, throughout this article, there is an underlying sense that areas outside government control are prone to abuse by Taliban militants or criminal power brokers who exploit vulnerable communities. The absence or weak presence of police forces contributes to a cycle where local warlords become de facto rulers enforcing their own form of justice without accountability.  This news article serves as another reminder that while progress has been made over the past decade in some areas regarding security and stability in Afghanistan, significant challenges remain when it comes to establishing effective governance structures and ensuring access to justice for all citizens.  In conclusion, this thought-provoking news article sheds light on persistent issues related to feudal justice prevailing in parts of Afghanistan today. It underscores the urgent need for comprehensive justice reform initiatives, increased investment in building effective judicial institutions, and strengthening government presence in remote areas to prevent such violations and ensure the protection of human rights for all Afghans.",explain
"This news article discusses the ongoing negotiations and potential consequences surrounding the ""fiscal cliff"" situation in the United States. The fiscal cliff refers to a combination of automatic spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect on January 1, 2013.  In his remarks to business leaders, President Obama stated that he believes Republicans are now open to accepting some rate increases as long as they are accompanied by serious entitlement reform and additional spending cuts. He also expressed confidence that a resolution could be reached within a week if Republican leadership acknowledges this reality. These statements reflect how negotiations have evolved since Obama's re-election and Democratic gains in Congress last month.  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner further emphasized the administration's stance, stating that they are prepared to go off the fiscal cliff if there is no agreement that involves tax rate increases on the top 2% of earners. Republican opposition to any new revenue now faces public support for higher taxes on the wealthy, leaving them with less negotiating leverage.  Polls suggest that more Americans would blame Republicans instead of Obama if no deal is reached and taxes increase for everyone in 2013. Economists warn against allowing these automatic tax hikes and spending cuts to take place, as they could lead to a recession.  Despite some softening by Republican representatives such as Senator Tom Coburn, signs point towards a continuing standoff between Democrats and Republicans. While Obama demands an immediate House approval of a measure already passed by the Senate - extending tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 per year while allowing rates for wealthier households to return to higher levels - Republican proposals focus on reducing deficits through measures such as tax reform ($800 billion), Medicare reforms ($600 billion), other health savings ($600 billion), other spending cuts ($600 billion), and revisions in consumer price index calculations ($200 billion).  The article notes that while Republicans have shown willingness towards more revenue through tax reform, their plan lacks specifics regarding which deductions and loopholes would be eliminated. Jason Furman, an assistant to Obama on economic policy, criticized the lack of detail in the Republican proposal.  The article also mentions that some Republican senators have expressed support for the House proposal as a starting point but emphasized the need for Democrats to accept spending cuts at a higher ratio than tax rate increases.  It is important to note that at the time of writing this summary, no breakthrough had been achieved in negotiations between Obama and Republican leaders. The House was scheduled to adjourn on December 14th but House Majority Leader Eric Cantor stated that they would remain in session until a fiscal cliff deal was reached. The article highlights the ongoing disagreement between Democrats and Republicans regarding how to address the fiscal cliff. President Obama is pushing for immediate action, urging the House to pass the Senate measure that would extend tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year while allowing rates to return to higher levels for wealthier households. He argues that this will prevent a tax hike on 98% of Americans and create space for compromises on other spending cuts.  However, Republicans are calling for broader reforms, including reductions in entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. They propose generating additional revenue through tax reform but have not provided specific details on which tax deductions or loopholes they would eliminate.  The article mentions differing opinions among Republican senators regarding the House proposal. Some senators support it as a starting point but emphasize that any agreement must involve significant spending cuts in exchange for raising revenue through tax rate increases.  Both parties understand the potential consequences of failing to reach an agreement before January 1st. Economists warn that allowing the automatic spending cuts and tax hikes to take effect could lead to a recession. Additionally, polls indicate that more Americans would blame Republicans if no deal is reached and taxes increase across all income brackets in 2013.  Despite these concerns, formal negotiating sessions are not scheduled at this time, and no breakthroughs were made during a recent phone call between President Obama and Speaker of the House John Boehner.  In conclusion, this news article highlights the ongoing discussions surrounding how best to address the fiscal cliff situation in order to prevent potential economic downturns caused by automatic spending cuts and tax hikes. While both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge some room for compromise on certain aspects like rate increases or entitlement reform, there remain significant differences between them regarding specific measures necessary for resolution.",explain
"This news article discusses the importance of practice and mental preparation in achieving success as an athlete. It highlights the story of a group of top swimmers who hailed from the same street, and how their dedication to training transformed them from ordinary players into world-class athletes.  The article begins by emphasizing that practice alone is not enough to become perfect. The example of handwriting is used to demonstrate that increased practice does not always lead to improvement. Instead, the author suggests that perfect practice is what leads to perfection. Athletes need to be specific about their goals and target their training accordingly.  The article introduces the concept of ""epigenetics"", which states that the brain is rewired through practice. Top athletes constantly push themselves beyond their limits in order to improve and refine their skills. However, even with honed skills, athletes can still crumble under pressure during high-stakes competitions.  The question is then raised: what causes athletes to crack under pressure? The mental performance coach interviewed in the article explains that when individuals are under pressure, they start thinking consciously about their actions instead of relying on subconscious competence. This intrusion upon subconscious competence triggers a choking response.  To ensure mental readiness for high-pressure situations like Olympic competitions, it is suggested that athletes mentally rehearse vividly imagining themselves performing at their peak level. This kind of mental rehearsal actually activates similar neural pathways as real experiences do in our brains. By creating this mental reality repeatedly, both mind and body become accustomed to it so that when faced with actual competition, athletes are better prepared.  In conclusion, this article emphasizes two key factors for achieving success as an athlete: perfect practice and effective mental preparation. Practice needs to be targeted specifically towards improving desired skills rather than mindlessly repeating actions without focus or intentionality. Mental preparation involves imagining success vividly in order to create a strong internal representation for future performance.  Overall, this news article highlights how dedication, specific training methods, and visualization techniques can contribute to an athlete's journey towards achieving their Olympic success. The article goes on to discuss the importance of mental readiness in high-pressure situations. It poses the question of what causes athletes to crack under pressure, using examples such as a footballer during a penalty shootout or a tennis player at match point. The answer lies in the intrusion upon subconscious competence, where nervousness and conscious thinking disrupt an athlete's natural flow and performance.  To overcome this challenge, the article suggests that athletes preparing for major events like the Olympics need to focus on mentally rehearsing their desired outcomes. When individuals vividly imagine themselves performing at their best, it activates similar neural pathways in their brain as if they were actually experiencing it. This mental simulation helps prepare both their mind and body for the real event.  The concept of creating one's own reality through visualization is highlighted as essential preparation for future success. By repeatedly visualizing oneself excelling in competition, athletes become more familiar and comfortable with that scenario. This leads to improved confidence and performance when faced with actual challenges.  Furthermore, it is mentioned that mental rehearsal can be almost as important as physical training itself. While physical training builds skill and strength, mental preparation enhances focus, resilience, and control over emotions – all vital elements for top-level performance.  Overall, this article serves as a reminder that practice alone is not enough to achieve excellence in sports. While perfecting technique through specific practice is crucial, athletes must also dedicate time and effort towards mental preparedness. By harnessing the power of mental imagery and rehearsal techniques, athletes can enhance their chances of success on the world stage.  It is worth noting that this article specifically discusses swimmers but highlights principles applicable across various sports disciplines. The examples cited may involve different sports contexts like ice dancing or soccer penalties; however, the underlying message remains consistent – practicing with intentionality combined with effective mental preparation are key ingredients to achieving greatness in any competitive field.  In conclusion, this news article serves as a valuable insight into how top athletes succeed by emphasizing the importance of perfect practice and mental preparedness. By constantly pushing their limits, refining their skills, and vividly imagining success, athletes can unlock their full potential and perform at their best when it matters most. This perspective serves as a powerful reminder to aspiring athletes that achieving greatness requires not only physical dedication but also a strong mental game.",explain
"This news article discusses a custody battle over a young girl named Veronica. The biological father, Brown, is an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation, and the key issue in this case is the interpretation and application of the Indian Child Welfare Act – a federal law established in 1978.  Veronica's mother gave her up for adoption and signed a waiver before Brown – who was serving as a U.S. Army soldier – embarked on a one-year deployment. Veronica was placed with Matt and Melanie Capobianco from Charleston, South Carolina through an open adoption agreement that allowed the birth mother to maintain contact with her daughter. However, Brown did not agree with this arrangement and four months after Veronica's birth, he began legal proceedings to seek custody.  According to Shannon Jones, Brown's attorney based in Charleston, he has been fighting for custody since shortly after his daughter's birth because he loves her dearly. Last year, it appeared that Brown had won custody when he traveled to South Carolina on New Year's Eve to pick up Veronica from her adoptive parents and took her back to his home in Oklahoma.  The Indian Child Welfare Act plays a crucial role in this case due to Brown’s enrollment in the Cherokee Nation. According to Chrissi Ross Nimmo from the Cherokee Nation’s Attorney General office, under this act as she interprets it, Native American children should be placed with family members first if they are removed by state or put up for private adoption.  However, CNN legal analyst Avery Freedman argues that while this act is designed to protect Native American families' integrity; it should not be used as a way of destroying existing families. Nevertheless, Jones maintains that even under South Carolina law alone without any reference to the Indian Child Welfare Act provision applicable here; Brown would still be entitled to custody of Veronica.  The emotions surrounding this situation are deeply charged on both sides of the dispute. The Capobiancos have spoken briefly with Veronica since she left, and the adoptive mother expressed concern about how her daughter is coping and wishes they could be there for her during this challenging time.  Overall, this news article highlights the ongoing custody battle over Veronica involving the interpretation of the Indian Child Welfare Act. It portrays differing opinions on whether the law was misused or correctly applied in this specific case. Ultimately, it delves into the emotional toll it has taken on all parties involved, emphasizing their concerns and hope for resolution. The case of Veronica's custody has ignited a heated debate about the interpretation and application of the Indian Child Welfare Act. Supporters argue that the main purpose of this federal law is to safeguard Native American families and prevent the arbitrary removal of Indian children from their tribes and families. They believe that Brown, being an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation, should be entitled to custody according to the placement preferences outlined in the act.  On the other hand, critics claim that using this law as a means to disrupt existing families goes against its intended purpose. CNN legal analyst Avery Freedman argues that while protecting Native American families is essential, it should not be used as a tool to dismantle stable family relationships created through adoption.  Shannon Jones, Brown's attorney, underscores that South Carolina law alone supports his client's claim for custody. It is important to note that even without considering any provisions from the Indian Child Welfare Act, Jones asserts that Brown would still have legal grounds for pursuing custody under state laws.  However, regardless of how this legal battle unfolds and whose position prevails in courtrooms or public opinion, it is clear that emotions are deeply affecting everyone involved. The Capobiancos' anguish over sending Veronica away with strangers and their concerns about her well-being are palpable. They long to be present for her during times when she may feel scared or uncertain.  Meanwhile, Veronica's biological father maintains his love for his daughter and fights tirelessly for her return. This protracted dispute has left both sides grappling with immense emotional distress caused by separation from a child they love deeply.  While this news article provides insights into key aspects of this custody battle – such as Brown's involvement in pending deployment at the time he signed off on adoption – details about specific arguments made by either side remain limited in their portrayal here. It also leaves room for further exploration into how courts will interpret relevant laws based on existing evidence presented before them.  Given its controversial nature surrounding indigenous rights, child welfare, and adoption ethics, this case has garnered significant attention. The outcome will have implications not only for Veronica and her immediate families but also for the application of the Indian Child Welfare Act in similar future cases. As the legal battle continues to unfold, it is essential to monitor developments for a better understanding of how these complex issues will be resolved moving forward.",explain
"According to a news article, the prevalence of autism among children in the United States has increased over the years. In 2006, it was estimated that 1 in 110 children had autism, whereas in 2008, the number rose to about 1 in 88. These findings are based on a report from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).  The report also highlights that boys are more likely to be diagnosed with autism compared to girls. The data suggests that there is a ratio of approximately five boys with autism for every one girl. In fact, it estimates that about 1 in 54 boys in the United States are affected by this disorder.  Mark Roithmayr, president of Autism Speaks - an advocacy group - attributes this rise in diagnosis rates to various factors such as improved diagnostic techniques and awareness about autism spectrum disorders. He also mentions that there is still uncertainty surrounding some cases, with around half categorized as ""We don't know."" Nonetheless, he believes these numbers indicate an epidemic of autism within the United States.  Dr. Gary Goldstein, an expert on autism and president of the Kennedy Krieger Institute, emphasizes how crucial early recognition of signs and symptoms is when it comes to treating autistic children. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired language skills, communication difficulties, and social interactions.  Dr. Goldstein highlights studies demonstrating how behavioral early intervention can significantly impact outcomes for children with autism. This underscores why recognizing signs early on can lead to better access to intervention services.  The article includes a personal story from Roy Sanders and Charlie Bailey about their son Frankie's experience with autism during his infancy. They mention their initial concerns being dismissed by their pediatrician who believed they were overreacting. However, Frankie exhibited significant developmental delays such as lack of speech or communication skills and fixation on certain objects like toy trains.  Despite initial skepticism from medical professionals regarding Frankie's condition at such a young age, his parents persisted and ultimately received an autism diagnosis when he was only 15 months old. Frankie has since developed into a high school student actively participating in sports.  Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the CDC, stresses the importance of early detection for children with autism. He explains that early intervention can lead to better long-term outcomes and reduce the impact on learning and overall quality of life.  To promote early detection, the CDC is collaborating with the Academy of American Pediatrics to recommend autism screening at ages 18 and 24 months. However, despite these efforts, most children are still diagnosed between ages 4 and 5 in communities studied by the CDC.  Dr. Frieden acknowledges that doctors have improved their diagnostic capabilities while communities have become more effective in providing services to children with autism under scrutiny by CDC scientists. Although there has been progress in understanding autism spectrum disorders more extensively than ever before, there is still much unknown about this condition.  In conclusion, this news article highlights an increase in diagnosed cases of autism among children within a specific timeframe. It discusses factors contributing to these rising numbers such as improved diagnostic methods and heightened awareness surrounding this developmental disorder. Moreover, it underlines how crucial early detection is for accessing timely intervention services which can significantly impact outcomes for individuals on the autistic spectrum.",explain
"In this news article, a judge has ruled that two police officers will stand trial for the beating death of Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man who suffered from schizophrenia. Corporal Jay Patrick Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force, while Officer Manuel Ramos faces the more serious charge of second-degree murder.  During the preliminary hearing to determine if there is enough evidence for a trial, prosecutors presented a graphic video showing the brutal beating of Thomas. The footage reveals several officers punching, kicking, and applying pressure on Thomas' chest. They also fired electric shocks from a Taser stun gun to subdue him, even though it appears he was beyond resisting or capable of resisting arrest.  The video captures Ramos saying to Thomas: ""You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up!"" Another officer can be heard stating: ""We ran out of options so I got to the end of my Taser and I ... smashed his face to hell."" At the end of the video, Thomas is shown lying in a pool of blood. Prosecutors state that he suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, broken ribs, and extensive bruises and abrasions from the incident. He tragically passed away five days later.  The article highlights that such incidents should never occur in America and cannot be tolerated or excused when they do happen. The author emphasizes this perspective as both they and their father come from law enforcement backgrounds but firmly condemn police brutality.  Ron Thomas, Kelly's father who is also a retired law enforcement officer himself since his son's passing has dedicated himself to ensuring justice is served by using social media platforms and disseminating graphic photos taken at Kelly's hospital bed detailing what had been done to his son. The article praises Ron for standing up against these actions despite being offered nearly one million dollars by Fullerton city officials as settlement money last year.  Thomas describes what happened as not just an act of violence, but a hate crime against the homeless and mentally ill. The author shares their heartbreak at hearing Kelly cry out for his father's protection as he fought for his life during the incident, stating: ""Daddy, help! They're killing me!"" This deeply affects them as a parent themselves.  The news article concludes by highlighting that if the officers are convicted, they will have to face consequences for their actions. It acknowledges that justice will bring some small comfort to Ron Thomas, who has to carry the pain of losing his son and not being able to protect him from what occurred.  Overall, this article covers the ruling on two police officers standing trial for beating Kelly Thomas to death and emphasizes the need for justice in cases of police brutality. It sheds light on Ron Thomas' fight for accountability while reflecting on personal experiences within law enforcement where such actions are deemed unacceptable. The article goes on to discuss the broader issue of police brutality and the impact it has on society. It references a previous incident from 1991 involving the beating of Rodney King by police officers, with the author's father expressing that those officers had ceased being cops and had become thugs and criminals.  The author highlights that Kelly Thomas' case is another example where excessive force was used against a vulnerable individual - someone who was homeless and afflicted with schizophrenia. The brutality inflicted upon him is seen as an affront to basic human rights, particularly when it involves individuals who are supposed to protect and serve the community.  The article also acknowledges Ron Thomas' refusal to accept a settlement from Fullerton city officials and instead pushing for a criminal trial. This decision reflects his determination to seek accountability for what happened to his son, even at personal cost.  Furthermore, it mentions the use of technology - social media platforms and photographic evidence - employed by Ron Thomas in order to bring awareness to his son's case. By leveraging these tools, he has been able to amplify his voice and ensure that Kelly's story receives attention far beyond just local communities.  In addressing this issue, the article underlines that no one should have their rights violated or be subject to such brutal treatment simply because they are homeless or have mental health issues. It recognizes that there needs to be systemic change within law enforcement agencies in order for incidents like this one not only be prevented but also effectively addressed when they do occur.  By shining a light on cases like Kelly Thomas', those affected hope for justice but also aim for transformation within policing practices so that similar tragedies can be avoided in the future.  In conclusion, this news article delves into a judge's ruling regarding two police officers who will stand trial for their involvement in beating Kelly Thomas – an act which led to his tragic death. The piece emphasizes larger issues surrounding police brutality while giving voice both to victims like Kelly Thomas as well as those who strive for justice and change.",explain
"The news article discusses the inspiring story of a young Indonesian surfer named Rahayu. Born and raised in Seminyak, a coastal town in Bali, Rahayu has been passionate about surfing from a young age. Despite concerns from her friends that surfing is dangerous, she firmly believes otherwise and finds it extremely fun. However, she highlights that many Indonesian girls are reluctant to go surfing due to their fear of getting dark skin, while she feels fortunate to have a love for the beach.  Rahayu's father was a well-known local surfer, but he initially discouraged her from following in his footsteps. Determined to pursue her passion, the 12-year-old went against his wishes and secretly learned how to surf from her uncle.

"This news article discusses the ongoing search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, MH370. The article focuses on recent efforts to analyze underwater sounds in the southern Indian Ocean to determine if they are related to the missing aircraft.  According to the article, low-frequency signals can travel long distances through water under certain conditions, at a speed of about 1 mile per second. Researchers believe that a recent sound detected by listening devices near Perth may be connected to MH370. However, they have not yet been able to pinpoint its exact source.  The researchers at Curtin University have calculated an ""uncertainty box"" for the origin of this sound. It spans over 2,400 miles in length from southeast to northwest across the Indian Ocean and is around 124-186 miles wide at its widest point.  The search for MH370 has been concentrated along an arc where investigators believe the plane ran out of fuel, about 1,000 miles off the coast of Western Australia. Martin Dolan from Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) states that he remains confident that this arc is where MH370's final resting place will be found based on analysis of Inmarsat satellite data and aircraft performance.  However, Dolan expressed skepticism regarding whether the underwater signals analyzed by Curtin University are related to MH370. Although these sound detections were interesting due to their direction, other characteristics make it unlikely that they are associated with the missing aircraft according to Dolan.  The devices used by Curtin University were not originally intended for analyzing airplane crashes but rather designed for listening to marine life or detecting underwater nuclear explosions. They have been repurposed in efforts towards locating MH370.  Mark Prior from Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) explains that their hydro-acoustic stations detect low-frequency sounds but cannot pick up black box ""pings."" He mentions that several circumstances would need to align perfectly in order for a crash detection using these systems.   Prior also mentions the case of the 2009 crash of Air France 447 in the southern Atlantic Ocean. Despite attempts to analyze underwater listening device data at that time, no signals related to the crash were found. Even years later after locating the plane, CTBTO rechecked their data and still couldn't identify any signals related to that crash.  In conclusion, this news article updates readers on recent efforts to detect underwater sounds that may be connected to MH370. Although some researchers believe there is a possibility, Dolan from ATSB remains skeptical about their association with MH370. The article also highlights how technologies designed for different purposes can be repurposed in search and recovery operations like this one. The article goes on to mention the challenges and limitations associated with using underwater listening devices to search for plane crashes. One of the main limitations is that these devices are specifically designed to detect low-frequency sounds in the 0-100 Hz range and are not capable of picking up black box ""pings"" which typically fall within the 30-40 kHz range.  Mark Prior from CTBTO explains that in order for an underwater listening device to detect a plane crash, certain circumstances would need to be present. For instance, a sloping sea bed or close proximity of the crash site to the listening device could increase the chances of detection. However, it cannot be guaranteed that all impacts would be detected due to various factors involved.  The article also mentions previous attempts to use underwater sound analysis following other plane crashes, such as the 2009 Air France Flight 447 crash in the southern Atlantic Ocean. Despite efforts made at that time, no data related to the crash could be found through underwater listening devices. Even when locating the wreckage years later, CTBTO's data did not contain any signals associated with that particular incident.  The uncertainties and challenges surrounding underwater sound analysis highlight some of the difficulties faced during search and recovery operations for missing aircraft. While advancements in technology have provided new methods for investigation, there are still limitations and uncertainties involved in utilizing these technologies effectively.  In conclusion, this news article provides an update on recent efforts using underwater sound analysis in search of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. It highlights both researchers' belief that certain sounds may be connected to MH370 as well as skepticism from officials about their association with the missing aircraft based on other characteristics observed. The article also discusses challenges and limitations related to detecting airplane crashes using underwater listening devices, emphasizing previous cases where such techniques were inconclusive despite extensive analysis efforts.

"The news article discusses the recent provocations by North Korea under its leader, Kim Jong Un. It argues that these provocations are different from those seen in the past, as Pyongyang has become more willing to escalate tensions. Examples of these provocative actions include multiple missile launches, announcement of ending the Korean Armistice Agreement, and warnings for foreign companies and tourists in South Korea to evacuate.  Under Kim Jong Un's rule, North Korea has shown a greater tolerance for risk and a more unpredictable behavior. This unpredictability is attributed partly to Kim's young age (31) and questions about his control over the country's military. Since taking office in 2011, North Korea has faced international sanctions after long-range rocket launches in 2012 and a nuclear test in 2013.  Experts argue that the recent exchange of live-fire drills between North and South Korea is not particularly troubling as they were pre-announced and no land or military installations were targeted. However, it reflects North Korean frustration with issues such as joint military drills between South Korea and the United States.  The lack of concrete information about North Korea makes it difficult to understand its intentions accurately. The country is known for being closed off from the outside world, limiting travel for its citizens and closely monitoring officials who go abroad. This secrecy makes it challenging to collect basic background information or recruit espionage sources.  However, some insight into what is happening inside North Korea came from a U.N. report released earlier this year that outlined egregious human rights abuses within the country. The report described ""extermination, murder... torture,"" revealing a totalitarian state like no other.  Understanding internal workings of North Korean regime remains challenging even for China - its closest ally - which was caught by surprise with the execution of Kim Jong Un's influential uncle.  While there are limitations on knowledge about North Korean affairs due to its closed nature, experts argue that there is still information available through diplomatic records and conversations with former communist allies of North Korea.  In conclusion, the article highlights that although North Korea's recent provocations may appear similar to those in the past, there are differences under Kim Jong Un's leadership that make them more unpredictable and potentially dangerous. The lack of information about the country makes it difficult to fully understand its intentions and actions. The article continues to explore the challenges of understanding North Korea's intentions and actions due to its closed nature. The limited information coming out of the country makes it difficult to make concrete assumptions. The secretive regime restricts travel for its citizens and carefully monitors officials who travel abroad, making it challenging to gather reliable information.  The speculation surrounding Kim Jong Un's rise to power is also discussed in the article. Media reports questioned whether his time at a Swiss boarding school and his apparent love for basketball could indicate a more friendly stance towards the West. However, these speculations were based on limited evidence and proved difficult to validate.  Even China, North Korea's closest ally, struggles to fully comprehend the power dynamics within the North Korean regime. The unexpected execution of Kim Jong Un's influential uncle took Beijing by surprise, highlighting their lack of complete understanding about internal happenings.  Despite these challenges, some experts argue that there is still valuable knowledge available about North Korea if one looks beyond popular conceptions of its impenetrability. For instance, think tanks like the Woodrow Wilson Center have spent years assembling and translating diplomatic records from former communist allies of North Korea.  In conclusion, while understanding North Korean intentions and actions remains a daunting task due to its closed nature, there are still sources of information that can provide insight into this reclusive regime. The recent provocations under Kim Jong Un's leadership demonstrate a greater willingness from Pyongyang to raise tensions unpredictably. However, without access or transparency into their inner workings, concrete assumptions remain elusive for analysts trying to decipher North Korea's true motivations.",explain
"This news article discusses the ongoing scandal involving New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and the closing of bridge lanes in Fort Lee. The article mentions that a former top advisor, David Wildstein, has made allegations that Christie knew about the closures and resulting traffic gridlock in real time, contradicting Christie's previous statements. The importance of this is that it may help answer why the bridge lanes were closed and who authorized it, as well as whether any laws were broken. The article also mentions that there are suggestions of political payback for the Fort Lee mayor who did not endorse Christie for re-election.  The state legislative committee and Justice Department are both investigating this matter. They have subpoenaed documents from Christie's office and he has said his office is complying with these requests. Additionally, his office has hired a private law firm to conduct an investigation.  The article states that Wildstein is important because e-mails released by state legislative investigators suggest that he carried out the closures. He has been subpoenaed but refused to answer questions from investigators.  Another key point mentioned in the article is that a former deputy chief of staff, Bridget Ann Kelly, was fired by Christie after an e-mail from her to Wildstein was made public stating ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee"" weeks before the gridlock occurred. She has also refused to comply with a state legislative subpoena on constitutional grounds.  Christie denies having any knowledge or involvement in these events prior to them being reported by media outlets. He claims he became aware when an e-mail from Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye was leaked to the media and reported on.  The article goes on to mention actions taken by Christie's office against Wildstein, including releasing a statement saying ""David Wildstein will do and say anything to save David Wildstein."" It also notes plans by his office to send tweets and stories focusing on The New York Times' handling of Wildstein's allegations.  The scandal has had negative political consequences for Christie, affecting his poll numbers and potentially his chances at a presidential bid in 2016. The article concludes by mentioning that he trails Hillary Clinton by 16 percentage points in a hypothetical match-up, whereas he was previously leading in the polls. The news article explains that the scandal surrounding Governor Chris Christie has had a significant impact on his political standing. Previously seen as a top contender for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election, Christie's popularity has plummeted since the scandal emerged.  The article mentions that the scandal involves not only allegations of political payback but also accusations of strong-arm tactics by Christie administration officials over Superstorm Sandy aid. These additional allegations have added fuel to the fire and intensified negative public perception of Governor Christie.  It is noted that there has been a wave of negative political fallout for Christie, whose approval ratings have drastically declined. A recent CNN/ORC International survey shows that he now trails Hillary Clinton by 16 percentage points in a hypothetical match-up for president, which is a stark contrast to his previous lead over other potential Republican candidates.  Furthermore, it is mentioned that this turnaround in public opinion could potentially harm Christie's chances at upcoming events such as CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference). While he was initially expected to be a speaker at the conference, his involvement now may bring more scrutiny and criticism due to these scandals.  In conclusion, this news article emphasizes how the bridge scandal and related allegations have significantly damaged Governor Chris Christie's image and political prospects. The ongoing investigations by state legislative committees and the Justice Department will likely determine whether any laws were broken or if there was any abuse of power. This potentially game-changing situation continues to draw attention both within New Jersey politics and on a national scale due to its implications for Christie's potential run for presidency in 2016.",explain
"This news article discusses the upcoming World Cup draw, which will determine the group stages for the tournament. The article begins by mentioning a tragedy that occurred at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo, where two construction workers died after a crane collapsed. This location is set to host the World Cup's opening match.  The draw itself will take place in Costa do Sauipe, a resort in Bahia on the northeast coast of Brazil. Representatives from each participating nation as well as FIFA officials, including president Sepp Blatter, will be in attendance for the ceremony. The event will be broadcast live to 193 countries and will feature entertainment from Brazilian singers and dance troupe Companhia de Danca Deborah Colker.  However, controversy arose when two actors originally scheduled to host the draw were replaced by another celebrity couple who are blond and white. This change raised concerns regarding representation and diversity.  The main purpose of this draw is to determine which teams will face each other in the group stages of the World Cup. The teams will be divided into eight groups of four based on FIFA's seeding system and geographical separation rules. Teams from the same qualification zone cannot be drawn together unless they are from Europe (with a maximum limit of two). The winners of each group will then face off against runner-ups from other groups during playoffs.  Eight teams are already seeded based on their rankings: Spain, Germany, Argentina, Colombia, Belgium, Uruguay, Switzerland along with host country Brazil. These seedings are determined by a team's performance over four years leading up to the tournament.  Due to there being nine unseeded European teams this year instead of eight like previous tournaments posed an issue for FIFA during drawing process logistics. In order to navigate this problem fairly it was decided that one European team would join pot two with five African nations and two unseeded South American sides while keeping nine unseeded European teams together into one pot before deciding randomly which one would join the others.  The draw process becomes more complicated when assigning teams to groups. Brazil, as the host country, will automatically be drawn into Group A. The other seeded teams will be allocated to their groups up until Group H. In order to maintain FIFA's geographical separation principle, a new pot called ""Pot X"" was created for four of the seeded South American teams. One of these teams is then paired with the unseeded European team from pot two.  The article also mentions the possibility of a ""Group of Death,"" which refers to a group with particularly strong and challenging opponents. The unseeded European team that ends up in Pot 2 could potentially face tough competition from South American seeds such as Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, or Uruguay. They may also have to contend with teams like United States from Pot 3 and Italy or Netherlands from Pot 4.  In summary, this news article provides an overview of the upcoming World Cup draw process and highlights various aspects such as seeding rules, geographical separation principles, controversy surrounding hosting choices, and potential challenges for certain teams in the tournament's group stage.",explain
"This news article discusses the case of Mahdi Hashi, a British citizen who was stripped of his citizenship and later charged with supporting a terror organization. The article highlights the allegations made by Hashi's father that he was pressured to become an informant for the government and speculates about possible motivations behind his sudden arrest and transfer to the United States.  According to the article, Mahdi Hashi's father claims that he tried to cooperate with authorities but was never provided any evidence against his son. Instead, he believes that they wanted him to work as an informant for them. This pressure reportedly caused Mahdi Hashi to return to Somalia where he faced constant harassment.  The article then goes on to provide some background information about Mahdi Hashi's travels as a teenager and his eventual return to Mogadishu in 2010 where he settled down, got married, and had a child. In December 2011, however, he disappeared without a trace.  In July of the following year, Hashi's family received a letter from Britain's Home Office stating that he had been stripped of his citizenship due to involvement in Islamist extremism. Later in December 2012 – almost one year after disappearing – Hashi appeared in a U.S. criminal court in Brooklyn alongside two others who were also charged with ""material support"" of Al-Shabaab.  Hashi denies all charges according to his American lawyer but alleges that he was detained June before being handed over first local police then eventually turned over U.S authorities in November after witnessing alleged abuse and being coerced into signing a confession under threat of torture while held captive in Djibouti.  As for why this happened, both Mahdi Hashi’s family and lawyer are questioning why their son ended up facing trial in Brooklyn when they claim there is no connection between him and any wrongdoing involving the United States. They believe their son was essentially kidnapped by foreign countries through what is referred to as ""new and improved rendition,"" a trend characterized by transferring suspects from foreign countries to the United States for trial.  Hashi's case raises concerns as it sets a precedent where individuals are taken from their home countries and tried in the United States without any apparent connection to American soil. Furthermore, due to the withdrawal of his British citizenship, Mahdi Hashi has received no assistance from the British government.  In conclusion, this article focuses on the case of Mahdi Hashi, a British citizen who was stripped of his citizenship and later charged with supporting terrorism in the United States. It highlights his father's claims of pressure to work as an informant and discusses allegations of abuse and coercion during captivity in Djibouti. The article also raises questions about whether this case is part of a new trend in rendition practices. The article further delves into the implications and concerns surrounding Mahdi Hashi's case. His lawyer, Harry Batchelder, describes it as a troubling example of ""new and improved rendition."" This refers to a shift in the practice of rendition where individuals are taken from foreign countries to the United States for trial without any clear connection or jurisdictional basis.  Batchelder suggests that while earlier renditions involved severe abuse, the government has adapted by bringing suspects into the US for trial. He expresses unease about this trend as it potentially sets a worrisome precedent. If carried out to its logical end, Batchelder argues that thousands of people from countries like Somalia could be eligible for transfer to the US and tried in American courts.  Furthermore, due to his loss of British citizenship, Mahdi Hashi has been abandoned by his adopted homeland. His mother expresses disappointment with how they were initially welcomed as asylum seekers but now feel hunted by the British government.  The article concludes by highlighting Hashi's current situation - he is seeking legal support from within a New York detention center while also fighting for reinstatement of his British citizenship. Although these efforts are underway, it remains unclear how exactly he went missing from Mogadishu only to reappear facing charges in Brooklyn.  Overall, this news article sheds light on Mahdi Hashi's case and raises several concerning issues. It questions possible motivations behind his arrest and subsequent transfer to the United States without apparent linkage or justification involving America itself. The allegations made by his father regarding pressure on him to become an informant add another layer of complexity and uncertainty to this perplexing situation. ",explain
"This news article describes the challenges faced by a journalist trying to reach Tacloban, a city in the Philippines, due to multiple flight cancellations caused by bad weather conditions.  The journalist begins their journey in Hong Kong, where they board a Cathay Pacific flight to Tacloban. However, upon arrival at the airport in Hong Kong and proceeding to domestic departures, they realize that there is no boarding call for their flight. They meet other journalists waiting for the same flight who are equally confused about the situation.  They are eventually approached by a Philippines Airlines manager who apologizes for the delay and explains that technical difficulties have grounded the aircraft. However, they are assured that another flight will be available at 1:30 p.m. Despite this assurance, no further information or boarding call is provided as the stated time approaches.  Eventually, an announcement confirms that the 1:30 p.m. flight has been canceled due to ongoing technical difficulties.

Despite this opportunity, moving the ATP tournament from London would be considered a ""gamble"" according to a former head of the ATP's commercial division.  Tournament director Andre Silva expresses that staying in Britain after 2015 is definitely possible due to its financial success and popularity among crowds. Unlike FIFA's goal to spread soccer worldwide with new host countries for each World Cup, the ATP's goal isn't necessarily to take tennis globally but rather ensure the event remains healthy and successful.  Roger Federer also supports staying longer in one place instead of constantly moving locations every year. He compares it to a circus tent which isn't permanent and can be packed away easily. Federer believes that having roots established in one place contributes to success.  Richard Davies, former CEO of ATP Properties, states that London has been twice as successful financially compared to other host cities for this tournament. The joint venture between ATP and O2 venue owner AEG has proven profitable with increasing sponsorship opportunities throughout the years.  However, there are some drawbacks mentioned regarding hosting it in other countries. For example, when Shanghai hosted as Masters Cup before becoming Masters Finals initially faced challenges with lower attendance for opening matches due to tennis being less established there compared to Europe or America. Furthermore , broadcast schedule issues arose due China being on a different time zone than Europe - tennis' largest market - resulting problems attracting viewers. Additionally, players had concerns about the long trip to Asia following the European indoor swing.  Despite potential hurdles, London has proven to be a successful venue with over one million fans attending in the past four years. The O2 arena's capacity of 17,800 makes it the second-largest regularly used tennis venue after New York's Arthur Ashe Stadium.  In conclusion, this news article highlights the success and financial benefits of hosting the ATP tournament in London and discusses various factors that need to be considered when deciding whether to move it to different host cities. In addition to the financial success and popularity of hosting the ATP tournament in London, there is also a mention of potential challenges with Britain's tax laws. These laws restrict the number of days tennis players can spend in the country before being taxed on their overall income. While this may be a concern for some players, it does not seem to outweigh the benefits and success of keeping the tournament in London.  The article also mentions that some companies get involved with sponsoring the World Tour Finals and then decide to increase their affiliation with the tour throughout the year. This indicates that hosting such a prestigious event in London has a positive impact on sponsorship opportunities for both this specific tournament and other tennis events.  The success of the ATP tournament in London has led to discussions about its long-term future as well. The seven consecutive seasons already make it one of the longest-running host cities, but there is mention of New York having an unbroken spell from 1977-1989. This raises questions about whether London can surpass that record or if another city will eventually take over as host.  However, it is important to note that moving away from London would require careful consideration and evaluation. Tournament director Andre Silva emphasizes that any decision must make sense financially and ensure that it maintains a healthy status rather than being an experiment.  Overall, there seems to be general agreement among key figures like Andre Silva and Roger Federer that keeping the ATP tournament in London makes sense due to its established fan base, financial success, convenience for players regarding travel logistics within Europe, and overall positive reception by sponsors. While potential opportunities exist elsewhere, moving would require strong reasons and assurances that these benefits could still be replicated without jeopardizing what has been established in London over several successful years.",explain
"This news article discusses the ongoing threat faced by a blogger in Tamaulipas, Mexico, who goes by the name ""Courage for Tamaulipas."" The blogger has been targeted with fliers offering a reward for information about his identity or his family. However, he remains committed to his work of exposing the prevalent violence and criminal activities in the state.  Tamaulipas is known for having one of the highest levels of violence in Mexico, including homicide, extortion, and kidnapping. The blogger emphasizes that what is happening to him personally is not as relevant as the hundreds of families waiting for their missing loved ones. These families were told by authorities to assume their loved ones were dead when they filed complaints. This showcases the widespread fear instilled by criminals and their influence over local authorities.  According to Courage for Tamaulipas, criminals in the state hold a misguided belief that they are justified in what they do and that others should obey them. They view crime as a profession and causing harm as their right. While shootouts between criminal groups have reduced recently, organized crime activities such as kidnapping, executing people, disappearing them, and causing terror persist.  The article briefly mentions former President Felipe Calderon's administration attributing violence in Tamaulipas to a turf war between cartels - specifically the Gulf cartel and Zetas cartel - over control of drug smuggling routes into the US. To combat this issue during his presidency (2006-2012), Calderon deployed additional security forces to Tamaulipas along with neighboring Nuevo Leon state.  The recent threats against Courage for Tamaulipas emerged through anonymous fliers circulating across key cities like Ciudad Victoria and Reynosa between February 8th to 10th. Although some officials had expressed individual support earlier on; it wasn't until much later that both local and federal authorities officially backed up the blogger against these threats.  The journalist safety organization, Freedom House, conducted a survey among Mexican journalists and bloggers, which revealed that 96% of respondents know colleagues who have been attacked. The report by Freedom House also highlights a tragic incident in September 2011 where two people were found hanging from a bridge in Nuevo Laredo, along with a warning message left near the bodies for any internet user crossing that criminal organization. This incident was followed by the killing of a journalist with the moniker ""la Nena de Laredo"" who had posted against criminal activities on social media platform Nuevo Laredo en Vivo.  Despite these dangers and acts of intimidation, Courage for Tamaulipas remains dedicated to shedding light on the situation people are facing in their state. The blogger believes as long as there are even just one or more collaborators supporting his work, he will continue providing evidence.  The article concludes by mentioning that local authorities claim they do not have information about these threatening fliers targeting Courage for Tamaulipas. Furthermore, they admit to lacking protocols for protecting citizens in similar situations since this is the first of its kind.  In summary, this news article highlights the continued threat faced by Courage for Tamaulipas and emphasizes the pervasive violence and criminal activities prevalent in Tamaulipas state. It sheds light on the blogger's determination to expose these issues despite risks while also underlining challenges faced by journalists and bloggers across Mexico who strive to report truthfully on their experiences with organized crime.",explain
"This news article provides updates on the Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado Springs, which is one of the dozen wildfires that have swept across the state. The article mentions that plans are being made to schedule a meeting with the affected residents, indicating that there will be efforts to provide support and assistance to those who have been impacted by the fire.  The article highlights the magnitude of the fire and its impact on Colorado Springs. Steve Cox, from the Colorado Springs mayor's executive team, describes it as a loss and mentions that there is a grieving process that needs to take place. This emphasizes the emotional toll this natural disaster has taken on local residents.  The FBI's Denver office is mentioned as working with other agencies to determine if any of these fires were started intentionally through criminal activity. This shows an additional level of concern and investigation into these wildfires.  The number of evacuations has increased significantly, reaching 36,000 people by Wednesday. Governor John Hickenlooper expresses determination in fighting against these fires, stating that they are still putting all their effort into containment.  There is mention of progress being made in some areas affected by the Waldo Canyon Fire. However, firefighters continue their aggressive stance against hot spots and remain vigilant in combating any potential flare-ups or spread.  Weather conditions play a significant role in firefighting efforts. While rain fell on a separate fire near Boulder according to weather reports from National Weather Service, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen states that high-based thunderstorms can provide both help and hindrance due to lightning causing additional fires while precipitation may evaporate before reaching ground level.  President Barack Obama plans to visit Colorado Springs area soon after Friday's damage assessment review tour as stated by The White House officials  The article points out landmarks such as Pikes Peak and Air Force Academy being nearby which further adds significance considering its impact toward main attractions within close proximity affecting many visitors  Some stories are shared regarding residents' experiences during evacuations including Chief Richard Brown of Colorado Springs Fire Department describing the Waldo Canyon Fire as a ""firestorm of epic proportions."" Richard and Darlene Colbert waited anxiously before evacuating, taking only family photos as they were irreplaceable. Becky Schormann shares relief that their home was saved with much appreciation towards the volunteer fire department.  The article also mentions the impact on the Air Force Academy. The evacuation order was issued for housing areas nearby, and certain activities and operations have been affected such as flight, glider, and parachuting training due to the availability of runways being used by helicopters fighting fires along Colorado's Front Range.  The report states that there has been significant support from residents offering food for firefighters, shelter for displaced neighbors, or volunteering in some capacity. This demonstrates a sense of community coming together during this challenging time.  In terms of overall statistics related to wildfires in Colorado, it is mentioned that 181,426 acres have been consumed so far by all fires combined and specifically mentions High Park Fire being 65% contained after burning approximately 87,284 acres.  To summarize, this news article provides an update on the Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado Springs. It covers various aspects such as evacuation efforts, firefighting strategies, impact on landmarks like Air Force Academy and Pikes Peak area while highlighting both individual stories and wider statistics related to wildfires across Colorado.",explain
"The news article explains the emergence of ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, and highlights that their actions do not align with Islam. The article states that ISIS took advantage of the marginalization of Sunni Muslims in order to gain support. However, it emphasizes that ISIS does not represent the true teachings of Islam, as the Quran condemns forced conversion and accepts other religions and prophets.  The author mentions the historical presence of Arab Christians in the region and argues that Christianity is an integral part of Arab history just like Islam. The article criticizes labeling ISIS as a Sunni organization because it wrongly associates all Sunnis with extremism. In fact, Sunnis have been one of the main victims of ISIS's atrocities.  The article discusses how to respond to the threat posed by ISIS. It suggests that force alone is not enough to eliminate ISIS; a multipronged approach is required. This includes military confrontation, economic development in affected areas, and addressing issues such as tyranny and a lack of justice.  The author believes that fundamental problems in the region contribute to extremism and need to be addressed for lasting solutions. These problems include Israel's occupation of Arab lands, vindictive government policies in Iraq frustrating large segments of population, and restarting the Geneva process for democratic rule in Syria.  Furthermore, it criticizes suggestions by some in the West to keep Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad on power despite his regime's role in fueling extremism. The article argues for supporting moderate forces in Syria and Iraq while promoting democracy and human rights.  The author emphasizes that lasting peace can only be achieved through a democratic state where all individuals are treated equally regardless of religion or ethnicity. Ending Israeli occupation through a two-state solution and supporting moderation can undermine extremist appeal.  Lastly, the article calls for diversity and pluralism without marginalizing any minority group or imposing one group's lifestyle or policies on others. It cites Lebanon's success following a principle advocated by President Obama - ""the principle of no victor and no vanquished"" - as a model to follow.  In conclusion, the news article highlights the exploitation of Sunni marginalization by ISIS and argues that their actions do not represent Islam. It suggests a multipronged approach to tackle ISIS, address fundamental problems in the region, support moderation, and promote democracy for lasting peace. The news article goes on to discuss the role of the West in addressing the ISIS threat. It welcomes increased engagement by the United States, including military elements like airstrikes, as a step towards containing ISIS. However, it emphasizes that force alone will not be enough to eradicate the group or prevent another extremist organization from emerging.  The article asserts that a key factor contributing to ISIS's rise is tyranny and a lack of justice in the region. It argues that treating tyranny as a viable alternative to radical agendas is futile and only perpetuates extremism. Therefore, addressing issues of governance and guaranteeing true power sharing arrangements are essential components for lasting solutions.  The author suggests several specific steps for the West to take in order to support moderate forces and promote democracy in Syria and Iraq. They highlight the need for genuine support for civil opposition groups rather than solely condemning dictators' actions with empty rhetoric.  The article also touches upon Israel's occupation of Arab lands as one of the problems in the region that should be resolved through a two-state solution. It argues that ending this occupation would undermine extremists' appeal and contribute to stability.  Furthermore, diversity and pluralism are seen as opportunities rather than challenges by acknowledging equal treatment for all religious and sectarian actors in nations like Iraq and Syria. The author emphasizes that democracy should not be used as an excuse to marginalize any minority group but instead should prioritize equality.  In concluding remarks, it states that if real change is desired, empowering moderate forces who actively put principles into action is necessary. This empowers those working towards democratic values while countering extremist ideologies effectively.  Overall, this news article focuses on explaining how marginalization played a role in allowing ISIS to exploit Sunni desires for fair representation while clarifying their actions do not align with Islam's teachings. Additionally, it highlights various steps needed from both regional countries and Western powers alike to address fundamental problems such as injustice, tyranny, occupation issues while supporting moderation through democratic means ultimately achieving lasting peace and stability.",explain
"This news article discusses the adaptation of an early screenplay written by George Lucas for the original Star Wars movie. The script, which is being made into a comic book series, reveals a different version of the Star Wars story, featuring notable differences in character appearances and plot elements.  The article begins by pointing out some of the unique aspects of this alternate version of Star Wars. For example, when Luke Skywalker is older, Darth Vader does not wear his iconic helmet anymore. Additionally, Han Solo is described as resembling a lizard-like creature and there is a character named Kane Starkiller.  CNN interviewed J.W. Rinzler, who adapted Lucas' script for comics, and artist Mike Mayhew to get their insights on working on this project. Rinzler explains that what captured his interest in adapting this script was how similar yet different it was from the final movie we know today. All the essential elements such as Sith and Jedi are there but arranged differently to form a new picture. Rinzler praises Lucas' storytelling abilities and expresses his desire to turn it into a comic book.  Mayhew then shares his experience illustrating this story from a script written nearly 40 years ago. He compares it to other comic book scripts he has worked on before and notes that despite its age, it was easy to envision turning it into a comic due to its well-written nature. Mayhew also explains that the original script had ambitious ideas that may not have been feasible back then but now seem prophetic given recent blockbuster movies like ""Avatar"" and ""The Avengers"".  The artists discuss how this alternate version offers fans an opportunity to see the origins of familiar characters like Darth Vader in their early stages before they assumed their final forms in the movies we know today.  Rinzler believes fans will enjoy reading this alternate universe story because they get to experience George Lucas' vision directly through his adaptation while still recognizing many things they love about Star Wars presented in a different way. Mayhew adds that this comic has the potential to be one of the greatest ""what if"" stories in comics, imagining how things would have turned out if this version had made it to the screen.  The article mentions that Han Solo's character is drastically different in this alternate version, being portrayed as a big green alien without his own ship. The relationships between characters and their roles in the story are also described as more intense and complicated compared to what we see in the original Star Wars.  Rinzler acknowledges that fans are intrigued by some of the hints and mysteries presented in this alternate version and have expressed interest in seeing those aspects explained further. However, he notes that with Episode VII on the horizon, the focus will shift to continuing the main Star Wars storyline.  In conclusion, this news article highlights an upcoming comic book adaptation of an early Star Wars screenplay written by George Lucas. It discusses some of the differences between this alternate version and what eventually became known as Star Wars. Artists involved with adapting this script share their insights on working with such material and express their enthusiasm for introducing fans to a different take on a beloved franchise.",explain
"This news article discusses the decision of several world leaders to not attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Sri Lanka. The article highlights that the prime ministers of Canada, Mauritius, and India chose not to attend as a means of expressing their concerns about alleged human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.  UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who did attend the meeting, stated that he saw his attendance as an opportunity to address these concerns directly and bring global attention to the situation in Sri Lanka. He also called for an investigation into alleged war crimes and human rights violations during and after the civil war.  The UK Foreign Secretary, William Hague, emphasized that Sri Lanka is still a country where civil society is suppressed, media outlets are intimidated, journalists have disappeared, and no one has been held accountable for alleged war crimes such as rape and sexual violence. Hague mentioned that he was visiting northern Sri Lanka because it was where some of the worst fighting occurred during the conflict and many people are still displaced from their homes.  Prime Minister Cameron highlighted his visit to northern Sri Lanka on Twitter stating that he was shining a light on chilling events there firsthand. Additionally, political leaders from northern Sri Lanka expressed appreciation for his visit as they believe it will help highlight what is happening in their region.  During Cameron's visit to Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka, he was met with protesters holding signs saying ""no interference"" and ""leave us in peace."" These protesters included both Tamils whose family members had disappeared during or after the war as well as pro-government supporters opposing any outside intervention.  The article notes that up to 70,000 people were killed during the conflict while around 330,000 individuals were trapped by fighting during its final stage. A UN report released in 2011 stated that there was large-scale shelling by government forces resulting in numerous civilian deaths; however, exact figures remain disputed between different sources.  Cameron reiterated calls for accountability, freedom of expression, demilitarization of the north, and reconciliation between communities in Sri Lanka. He emphasized the need for a thorough investigation into alleged war crimes.  Human Rights Watch UK director David Mepham stated that an international inquiry into what happened at the end of the war is crucial due to the lack of accountability within Sri Lanka's own process. He called on the UK government to exert pressure on human rights abuses in Sri Lanka occurring presently.  Sri Lanka's high commissioner to the UK, Chris Nonis, argued against an international investigation and highlighted a domestic report commissioned by Sri Lanka's president as evidence that they can address their own issues. Nonis claimed that this report was impartial and comprehensive, incorporating international humanitarian law principles.  The Commonwealth is an association of 53 nations formed out of what used to be the British Empire. Its charter aims to develop free and democratic societies while promoting peace and prosperity amongst its member countries. The CHOGM is held every two years where heads of member governments meet.  In conclusion, this news article highlights calls from world leaders for accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka as several leaders decided not to attend CHOGM due to alleged human rights abuses. The article provides perspectives from different parties involved in discussions about holding an international inquiry into war crimes during and after the conflict in Sri Lanka.",explain
"This news article discusses the issue of birthright citizenship in U.S. territories, with a specific focus on American Samoa. It begins by explaining that after the United States acquired Puerto Rico and other territories in 1898, the Supreme Court decided a series of cases known as the Insular Cases. These cases were divisive and controversial but did not directly address issues related to citizenship.  The article highlights an opinion written by Justice Henry Billings Brown in Downes v. Bidwell, where he suggested that citizenship was not a fundamental right in these newly acquired areas, referring to them as ""alien races."" Despite no other justice joining his opinion, it was sufficient for those in Congress who believed that birthright citizenship was not suitable for the inhabitants of these areas who looked and sounded different.  The assumption that Congress controls citizenship in overseas territories has persisted since then but has faced disagreement in lower courts. In response to this assumption, Leneuoti Tuaua, the Samoan Federation of America, and others born in American Samoa have filed a federal lawsuit challenging it before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Their argument is based on their belief that being under the U.S. flag means they are entitled to birthright citizenship guaranteed by the U.S Constitution.  The article moves on to examine what exactly the Constitution says regarding birthright citizenship. It references the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment, which states that all persons born in or subject to U.S jurisdiction are citizens of the United States.  It further elucidates Chief Justice John Marshall's explanation from decades earlier when he stated that ""the United States"" referred to both states and territories within our great republic. The drafters of this clause understood its guarantees applied everywhere within U.S territories – whether states or territories or even Washington D.C.  The author also mentions how four years after ratifying this clause; The Supreme Court firmly established through precedent its intention to guarantee citizenship for individuals born and residing in U.S. territories like the District of Columbia.  The article argues that the original understanding of the 14th Amendment was to overturn the infamous Dred Scott decision and assert that birthright citizenship on any U.S. soil could not be denied by Congress. As at that time, almost half of all land in the United States was within a U.S territory; it would be implausible for an amendment to overlook guaranteeing citizenship in these territories.  Although birthright citizenship continues to be a topic of intense debate, there appears to be remarkable consensus among legal scholars regarding what the Constitution guarantees when it comes to this issue. Examples are given of both conservative and liberal legal scholars who have agreed on birthright citizenship being applicable within territories under U.S sovereignty but outside states.  The article also mentions ongoing debates surrounding how the Insular Cases affect U.S territories today. These cases have been criticized, with one federal Circuit judge comparing them to Plessy v. Ferguson and condemning their race-based doctrine establishing ""separate and unequal"" status for residents of overseas U.S territories.  In 2008, even the Supreme Court expressed doubt about whether Congress has the authority to deny constitutional rights in current U.S territories and noted that over time, constitutional significance may arise from stronger ties between these territories and the United States.  Ultimately, while Congress holds broad powers in regards to governing U.S territories, it does not possess power over rewriting or negating birthright citizenship guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Denying American Samoa's inhabitants their rightful claim to citizenship is not only unjust but also unconstitutional according to this viewpoint presented in the article.  Please note that my explanation is a summary based on my understanding of your request as an AI language model assistant, and I am not providing my own opinions or taking sides on this issue.",explain
"This news article provides an overview of the current situation in Yemen and the actions taken by various governments in response to the escalating security risks in the country. The article starts by highlighting a warning issued by the U.S. government about an ""ongoing risk of kidnapping"" and concerns over possible terrorist attacks on Americans and Western facilities.  Despite these warnings, it is mentioned that there are no plans for a U.S.-sponsored evacuation of American citizens at this time, as such evacuations are only conducted when there are no safe commercial alternatives available. This refusal to evacuate indicates that there is still some level of confidence in the security measures in place, although it is acknowledged that the security situation has deteriorated.  The British Foreign Office also expresses similar concerns about increased risk to its embassy staff and premises, urging British nationals to leave immediately. The French Foreign Ministry issues a statement advising its citizens to temporarily leave Yemen due to recent political developments and increased security risks. It further mentions that their embassy will be closed until further notice.  It is unclear how these embassy closures will affect the work of foreign nations and their efforts against Islamist groups within Yemen. The Pentagon states that despite adjustments made due to political uncertainty, they continue their counterterrorism operations with Yemeni security forces.  Yemen's government has been an important ally in combating al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a group linked to attacks such as those on French magazine Charlie Hebdo. The Pentagon acknowledges AQAP as a dangerous group with intentions of threatening Western interests, including those of the United States.  The presence of nonstate armed groups competing for power raises concerns about potential civil war if President Hadi is not reinstated. Certain areas have already shown resistance against Houthi militias attempting to take control over national government institutions.  While talks have not yet been initiated with Houthis, discussions have taken place regarding whether or not engaging them would be viable.  In conclusion, this article highlights the growing security risks in Yemen and the responses of various foreign governments. It emphasizes concerns about kidnapping, terrorist attacks, and the potential for civil war due to competing armed groups in the country. The closure of embassies raises questions about the impact on anti-terrorism efforts, but it is reassuring to know that counterterrorism operations are ongoing. This news article provides further details about the situation in Yemen and the actions taken by different countries in response to escalating security threats. It highlights the warning issued by the U.S. government about an ongoing risk of kidnapping and terrorist attacks on Americans and Western facilities.  Despite these warnings, there are no immediate plans for a U.S.-sponsored evacuation of American citizens from Yemen. The State Department explains that government-facilitated evacuations are only carried out when no safe commercial alternatives exist. This suggests that there is still some level of confidence in the availability of safe travel options for American citizens at this time.  Similarly, the British Foreign Office expresses concerns over increased risks faced by embassy staff and premises in Yemen. They urge British nationals to leave immediately, indicating a heightened sense of danger in the country.  The French Foreign Ministry also advises its citizens to temporarily leave Yemen due to recent political developments and for security reasons. They announce that their embassy will be closed until further notice, adding urgency to their message.  The closure of embassies raises concerns about how this will impact the work being done by foreign nations against Islamist groups within Yemen. However, Pentagon spokesperson Rear Adm. John Kirby reassures that despite adjustments made due to political uncertainties, counterterrorism operations with Yemeni security forces are still ongoing. He mentions that some counterterrorism training is also still taking place.  It is acknowledged that AQAP poses a significant threat not just regionally but also internationally with intentions to target Western interests, including those of the United States. Therefore, monitoring AQAP closely remains a top priority for US officials.  The article then moves on to discuss internal dynamics within Yemen itself. The Houthi militias—a Shiite Muslim group that has felt marginalized within predominantly Sunni Yemen—have gained control over Sanaa and northern provinces such as Amran and Sadaa.  However, resistance arises from various groups opposing Houthi attempts at taking control over national government institutions. In the south, there is an ongoing secessionist movement, and in the eastern oil-rich province of Marib, opposition to Houthi rule is also observed.  The article notes that while there are currently no talks with the Houthis, discussions have taken place regarding their potential engagement. This suggests that foreign governments are contemplating diplomatic efforts as a means to address the situation in Yemen.  In summary, this news article provides an overview of the security risks in Yemen and details governmental responses from various countries. The warnings and embassy closures highlight a growing concern for potential kidnappings and terrorist attacks. However, despite these challenges, counterterrorism operations by foreign governments continue with adjustments made due to political uncertainties. The article additionally highlights internal divisions within Yemen as different groups resist Houthi control over government institutions.",explain
"This news article discusses the testimony of former FBI agent John Fitzpatrick during the trial of James ""Whitey"" Bulger, a notorious crime boss in Boston. The focus of the trial is whether Bulger was an informant for the FBI.  Fitzpatrick, who worked with the FBI for over 20 years, testified that he believed Bulger should not be considered a trusted informant due to his involvement in criminal activities, including murder and racketeering. He recommended that Bulger's file be closed.  The prosecution introduced a document suggesting that Bulger was indeed an informant, which has been a key part of their case against him. However, the defense argues that while Bulger had FBI agents on his payroll for protection, he did not provide any information to them.  Fitzpatrick also testified about corruption within the FBI in Boston during his time there. He described instances when he tried to report leaks and corruption but faced resistance from other agents and government attorneys. One specific case involved trying to get an informant into witness protection but being met with resistance.  The defense called Fitzpatrick as a witness to highlight alleged corruption within the FBI and shift blame onto them instead of solely focusing on Bulger's actions. They argue that Fitzpatrick's resignation from his post was because he reported higher-level corruption within headquarters.  During cross-examination, there were contentious exchanges between Fitzpatrick and Brian Kelly, one of the prosecution attorneys. Kelly questioned Fitzpatrick's credibility by pointing out discrepancies between what he wrote in his memoir ""Betrayal"" and official reports related to high-profile cases like arresting a mafia crime boss or recovering the rifle used in Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination.  The tension between attorneys is mounting as both sides present their case during these final weeks of trial. The defense plans to call more witnesses, although this may change. The article ends by mentioning arguments made regarding sequestering the jury due to the highly publicized and sensational nature of the case.  Fitzpatrick acknowledged during cross-examination that he was not working for the FBI when the government began building its case against Bulger, suggesting that his testimony might not directly relate to the charges at hand. He also revealed that he lost his pension as a result of being forced to resign from the FBI five years early.  The article highlights Fitzpatrick's reasons for titling his memoir ""Betrayal,"" stating that he felt betrayed by the government, FBI, and Justice Department during his time as an agent.  The defense plans to call 11 more witnesses in their attempt to discredit alleged corruption within the FBI and shift blame away from Bulger. However, it is uncertain whether they will follow through with all of these witness testimonies.  In addition to Fitzpatrick's testimony, there was also mention of arguments about sequestering the jury. The defense argued that due to extensive media coverage and prejudicial statements made against Bulger, sequestering would be necessary for a fair trial. The judge has yet to rule on this motion.  Overall, this news article primarily focuses on John Fitzpatrick's testimony during James ""Whitey"" Bulger's trial regarding allegations of corruption within the FBI and whether or not Bulger was a trusted informant. The prosecution seeks to argue that Bulger was indeed an informant while the defense aims to shift focus onto alleged misconduct within law enforcement agencies.",explain
"The news article discusses the recent leadership challenge faced by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. During a party vote on Monday, 61 out of 102 colleagues voted against removing him from his position, while 39 voted in favor of vacating not only Abbott's position but also that of his deputy, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. The principle of cabinet solidarity meant that nearly 40 votes were secured for Abbott before the meeting even started.  The meeting was originally scheduled for Tuesday but was brought forward to prevent Abbott's detractors from caucusing in Canberra ahead of the first week of parliament this year. This move was criticized by Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who is seen as a potential rival to Abbott. Turnbull hinted at running for the top job but stopped short and would have had to resign if he had chosen to do so.  Even though Abbott survived this leadership challenge, his position is still precarious as 39 members out of a possible 102 have expressed their lack of confidence in him. In Australian political history, leaders facing such challenges have eventually been overthrown by their own party.  Abbott has drawn criticism for failing to sell the government's first budget successfully and making major decisions without consulting his colleagues. These decisions include a controversial paid maternity leave scheme perceived as preferential towards wealthy individuals and the knighting of Prince Philip. His decision to call Monday's vote earlier than expected without apparent consultation raised further concerns about his non-collegiate approach.  The article notes that while some Australians are delighted with or dismayed by these political developments, others are divided between wanting an end to Abbott's government and fearing that replacing him with Turnbull could harm the chances of the opposition Labor Party at the next election.  Political commentator Paul Kelly highlights how frequent leadership changes can damage governmental efficiency and lead Australia down a path where reform becomes more challenging. He argues that politicians must avoid provoking voters leading up to the 2016 election if Australia is to avoid decline and growing discontent.  Overall, the article suggests that while there is agreement that frequent leadership changes are not beneficial for the country, Abbott's survival until the next election is far from guaranteed. The negative vote on Monday signals a strong likelihood that he will not remain in power for much longer. The article also touches on the impact of frequent leadership changes on Australia's political system. It emphasizes the potential long-term consequences of such instability, noting that it undermines the ability of the government to effectively govern and implement meaningful reforms.  There is a general consensus that consistent leadership changes are not in the best interest of Australia. However, this does not necessarily mean that Abbott will survive and lead his party into the next election. The fact that 39 party members voted against him indicates a lack of confidence within his own ranks, which could be a significant blow to his leadership moving forward.  The article also highlights some specific issues that have contributed to Abbott's dwindling support within his party. His failure to sell the government's first budget has created frustration among lawmakers. In addition, decisions made without consulting colleagues, such as the controversial paid maternity leave scheme and knighting Prince Philip, have further eroded confidence in his decision-making abilities.  These criticisms are further compounded by Abbott's decision to bring forward Monday's vote without apparent consultation with Deputy Prime Minister Julie Bishop. This move has been viewed as yet another example of unilateral decision-making and an inability or unwillingness to collaborate with others.  As Australians observe these political developments, they seem divided between those who wish for an end to Abbott's government and those who are concerned about repeatedly removing leaders when unpopular decisions are made. Some fear that replacing Abbott with Turnbull would negatively impact their preferred political party and its chances at the upcoming election.  The article concludes by stating that while there is widespread agreement about avoiding frequent leadership changes for stability reasons, it remains uncertain whether Tony Abbott can survive until the next election. The recent no-confidence vote suggests a highly challenging road ahead for him.

"This news article provides an update on the trial of Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan, who is accused of shooting and killing 13 people in a mass shooting at Fort Hood in 2009. The article focuses on the conflict between Major Hasan and his defense team regarding their ethical obligations.  The defense team, led by Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, argues that working with Major Hasan violates their professional ethics due to the nature of the crimes committed. They believe that assisting him in achieving the goal of receiving a death sentence is morally repugnant. However, Col. Michael Mulligan, the lead prosecutor, counters this argument by stating that Major Hasan deserves a legitimate defense despite being caught with a gun at the scene.  In response to Lt. Col. Poppe's concerns about ethical violation, Judge Osborn requests written documentation from the state bar establishing whether continuing to work with Major Hasan would indeed be an ethical violation for defense counsel. Lt .Col Poppe insists that Judge Osborn's order does not relieve them of responsibility and maintains his position against assisting Major Hasan in achieving a death sentence.  During the trial proceedings, Major Hasan openly declares himself as ""the shooter"" but objects to suggestions that he is seeking the death penalty and refuses to submit his objection in writing for fear of revealing privileged information in open court.  Despite objections from Lt .Col Poppe and his team, Judge Osborn makes it clear that they cannot be relieved from their obligation as defense counsel and allows the trial to proceed unless a higher military court intervenes.  The article also details some harrowing eyewitness testimonies from survivors who describe how they were shot by Major Hasan during his rampage at Fort Hood. These witnesses share chilling accounts of how he targeted them before being stopped by law enforcement officers.  Military justice expert Geoffrey Corn comments on how difficult it must be for defense lawyers tasked with assisting someone who is essentially sealing their own fate through their actions during trial proceedings. However, he acknowledges that Major Hasan has the right to defend himself, even if it means asking for the death penalty.  The article concludes by stating that Major Hasan was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the Fort Hood shooting and that prosecutors plan to argue that his actions were a result of progressive radicalization.  Overall, this news article highlights the ethical dilemma faced by Major Hasan's defense team and provides updates on the trial proceedings as witnesses recount their experiences during the shooting. The article continues by explaining that Major Hasan, who is a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, had requested to represent himself during the trial. However, Judge Osborn ruled that defense lawyers would still act as standby counsel.  Experts, such as Geoffrey Corn from the South Texas College of Law in Houston, express sympathy for the defense attorneys who are put in a difficult position due to their ethical obligations. They have to watch Major Hasan essentially incriminate himself and make choices that could lead to his own death penalty while they are tasked with assisting him legally.  Despite this predicament faced by the defense team, Corn emphasizes that Major Hasan has the right to defend himself poorly if he wishes and even ask for the death penalty. The defense lawyers' desire to be relieved from the case is understandable but not possible because of Judge Osborn's ruling.  The article also provides detailed accounts from witnesses who testify against Major Hasan. Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford describes how he was shot seven times during the rampage at Fort Hood and recounts how his attempts to escape were met with bullets from Major Hasan's weapon.  Lunsford's testimony portrays a scene of panic and chaos as soldiers tried to take cover or flee while Major Hasan continued shooting. Other survivors are scheduled to testify against him as well.  The article explains that prosecutors aim to demonstrate through evidence and testimonies that Major Hasan underwent ""progressive radicalization."" They want to show how he embraced extremist beliefs supporting suicide bombings and questioned soldiers' loyalty when their religious beliefs conflict with military service.  Towards the end of the article, it is mentioned again that Major Hasan was originally scheduled for deployment before committing the Fort Hood shooting. Prosecutors hope this fact supports their argument about his radicalization process leading up to his committing acts of violence at Fort Hood.  In summary, this news article provides further updates on Nidal Hasan's trial concerning his involvement in a mass shooting at Fort Hood. It highlights the ethical concerns raised by his defense team, the testimony of witnesses who survived the shooting, as well as the prosecution's effort to demonstrate Major Hasan's radicalization process.",explain
"This news article discusses the formation of the Internet Defense League (IDL), a non-profit organization that aims to protect internet freedom and fight against legislation that could potentially restrict online rights. The IDL was formed in response to recent protests against piracy legislation, such as SOPA and PIPA, which were proposed by Congress to crack down on pirated content.  Tiffiniy Cheng, co-director of Fight for the Future, one of the organizations behind the IDL, explains that they chose a cat as their symbol because it represents the internet. According to an academic theory she mentions, if people are banned from sharing cat photos online, it would result in massive protests. The concept behind the IDL is building an infrastructure that allows for quick mobilization and activism online through what they call a ""cat signal"" or ""bat signal,"" which can be activated at any moment with just a click of a button.  The article recalls how widespread protests erupted in January when Congress was considering SOPA and PIPA. Wikipedia shut down its English-language version for 24 hours in protest while various other websites also participated in digital protests against these legislations. Ultimately, due to these widespread demonstrations, both SOPA and PIPA died out.  The IDL intends to target upcoming legislation like ACTA and CISPA, which take different approaches towards regulating pirated content. They also plan on seeking promises from U.S presidential candidates regarding their stance on internet openness and related legislations.  Notable web companies such as WordPress, Reddit, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), craigslist founder Craig Newmark's organization have already expressed support for the cause; however larger commercial websites like Google and Facebook have not made any official statement yet.  Experts believe this marks a new era for internet activism where tech companies become more involved politically. Tim Wu from Columbia Law School states that this is considered as first real test of web's political strength where they stood up against powerful lobbyists and achieved some success.  The IDL website allows people to donate money and also encourages them to rally for or against various legislations. In case of an ""internet emergency,"" the IDL will send out code snippets that can be used by websites to participate in the protests. The co-founder of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, sees this as a way to fight against new threats that might try to unravel internet rights after SOPA and PIPA failed.  The article concludes with the idea that with combined reach and influence of multiple websites and social networks, the IDL has greater potential than any individual organization to make a significant impact in preserving internet freedom. This is primarily due to its ability to mobilize people quickly through code snippets, as demonstrated during the anti-SOPA web blackouts.  In summary, this news article discusses the formation of the Internet Defense League (IDL) – a non-profit organization dedicated to safeguarding internet freedom from legislation that could potentially limit it. The IDL aims to mobilize individuals online by creating an infrastructure that allows for rapid response protests using code snippets known as ""cat signals."" Their efforts are aimed at countering current legislation like ACTA and CISPA while seeking commitments from U.S presidential candidates on issues regarding internet openness. Notable web companies have expressed support for their cause, marking a shift towards increased political involvement from tech companies on matters related to internet activism.",explain
"The news article discusses recent changes in the rules regarding media coverage of court proceedings in the 9th Circuit and 2nd Circuit. These circuits have allowed media outlets, such as CNN, to record and air high-profile appeals on occasion. This is in contrast to most other federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, which have banned photographs and video.  Chief Judge Alex Kozinski of the 9th Circuit has stated that they have a history of using technology to make the court more accessible and transparent. These new rules allow for all ""en banc"" oral arguments, which involve 11 judges sitting together, to be covered live through the court's website. However, first hearings by three-judge panels will not automatically be streamed live.  The article mentions that previous televised cases involved issues such as California's same-sex marriage ban, government surveillance, affirmative action, and international terrorism. The 9th Circuit is notably one of the largest and busiest appeals courts in the country.  The late James R. Browning is credited as a nationwide pioneer for bringing technology into courtrooms to improve public access and internal efficiency at the 9th Circuit. Browning served on the circuit from 1961 until his death last year and was chief judge from 1976 to 1988.  It is noted that while most federal courtrooms are accessible for public viewing in person, seating can be limited. As for cameras in the U.S Supreme Court courtroom itself,the justices express concerns about unintended consequences if cameras were introduced during their deliberations.  Overall,the changes discussed in this article aim to make court proceedings more accessible to a wider audience through video streaming on websites but also highlight concerns about potential drawbacks associated with increased media coverage within legal settings The article also mentions that the Judicial Conference, which serves as the policymaking board for the federal courts, allowed federal courts of appeals in 1996 to decide for themselves whether or not to allow cameras in their courtrooms. Three years ago, a pilot program was extended to federal district courts, with about 14 participating and nearly 150 civil proceedings available for online viewing.  While these changes have increased access to court proceedings through technology, it is important to note that most federal courtrooms still remain accessible for the public to watch in person. However, seating can be limited and not always guaranteed. This highlights the significance of having video streaming options available for those who are unable to physically attend hearings.  In regards to the U.S. Supreme Court, there has been relatively limited progress in terms of increasing access through cameras. The justices express concerns about the potential impact on their intercollegial deliberations and fear that introducing cameras could lead to sound bites being taken out of context or sensationalized by media outlets.  Instead of cameras inside the Supreme Court courtroom itself, audio recordings of arguments have been made available since 1955. Initially kept secret, these audio recordings were only accessible at a National Archives and Records Administration annex until three years ago when they became easily accessible on the Supreme Court's website.  Additionally, all oral arguments from 2010 onwards are readily available for listening or downloading on their website. For earlier cases, an online archive called oyez.org provides access to Supreme Court recordings curated by Professor Jerry Goldman from Chicago-Kent School of Law.  Despite these advancements in making argument audio recordings available online rather promptly compared with previous practices where there was often a significant delay before they were released publicly - there still remains resistance towards introducing camera coverage within the highest court's proceedings.  Justice Anthony Kennedy emphasized his concerns during congressional discussions back in 2007 regarding maintaining collegial deliberations free from any perceived desire by justices trying simply secure soundbites for television. It appears that the justices, while accepting some changes in terms of audio access to arguments, remain hesitant about going further and introducing cameras into their courtrooms.  In conclusion, the article highlights recent changes in media coverage of court proceedings in certain federal circuit courts and discusses the challenges and concerns surrounding increased access to courtrooms through technology. While these changes aim to increase transparency and accessibility for the public, there are still debates and reservations about further expanding camera coverage within legal settings like the U.S. Supreme Court.",explain
"This news article discusses the current political landscape in the United States, focusing on the divide between Democrats and Republicans regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.  The author credits Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid for keeping a diverse Democratic Congress united. They highlight how even conservative Democrats like Joe Manchin align with progressive figures like Keith Ellison under their leadership. In contrast, the Republican Party is described as being divided between different factions ranging from conservative to ultraconservative.  The article mentions Senator Ted Cruz's efforts to block consideration of a funding bill related to the ACA and explains that his strategy was ultimately rejected by most of his Republican colleagues. This division within the Republican Party is further illustrated by a divisive atmosphere in the House of Representatives.  The article then explores public opinion on Obamacare, stating that while a majority of voters may not support it, when given specific options about defunding or delaying it, there is even less support for these measures. The author argues that attempting to repeal or defund Obamacare is not seen as mainstream and suggests that Americans would prefer improving it rather than completely eliminating it.  The article concludes by discussing President Obama's stance on negotiations surrounding the debt ceiling. The author believes that although they agree with Obama's position against defaulting on U.S. debt, he could be more effective if he emphasized his willingness to listen to ideas for improvement before negotiating further.  Overall, the author expresses confidence in President Obama and the Democratic Party winning this fight against repeal efforts due to perceived GOP divisions and extremism. They suggest that if Republicans continue along this path, they will appear weak and unreasonable in comparison to Democrats.  Please note: This summary represents my interpretation of the article's key points and does not reflect any personal opinions or biases. The author of the article expresses a belief that the Democrats have an advantage in the ongoing debate over Obamacare and government funding. They argue that as long as Republicans continue to appear divided, extreme, and unreasonable in their opposition to the ACA, they are likely to lose support.  The author also highlights a recent CNBC poll indicating that a majority of Americans do not support defunding Obamacare or risking a government shutdown or default on U.S. debt for this purpose. This suggests that Republicans are out of touch with public sentiment on these issues.  Furthermore, the writer mentions Senator Richard Burr's criticism of the Republican strategy as ""the dumbest idea I've ever heard of."" By highlighting such remarks from within the Republican Party itself, they emphasize growing discontent among conservatives towards their colleagues' uncompromising stance.  In addition to discussing political dynamics surrounding Obamacare, there is some commentary on other controversial actions by North Carolina Republicans wanting to bar federal courts from interpreting the Constitution and declare a state religion. The author offers these examples to reinforce their argument about Republican extremism.  Overall, based on their analysis of public opinion and party divisions, the author predicts success for President Obama and Democrats in this battle over healthcare reform. They suggest that if Republicans wish to regain ground politically and present themselves as reasonable alternatives, they need to adopt more moderate positions.  Again, please note that this explanation is an objective summary reflecting key points made in the article rather than expressing my own opinion.",explain
"This news article describes the vibrant and dynamic atmosphere of several markets in Johannesburg, South Africa. It starts by detailing the scene at a market located on the second and third floors of a parking garage. The entrance is marked with lights, and there are crowds of stylish people visiting for lunch. The market offers a variety of artisanal food such as cured meats, rustic breads, cheeses, cut flowers, raw chocolates, raw oysters with champagne, fried chicken served over watermelon and fries, and stew.  Moving up to the next level is an open-air seating area that overlooks expensive condos and train tracks leading to South Africa's main rail hub. On an even higher level is the fashion section where leather jackets hang alongside children's dresses printed with Nelson Mandela's smile.  The article explains that Braamfontein neighborhood attracts a diverse mix of people due to its proximity to prestigious universities, theaters complex Joburg Theatre (158 Civic Boulevard St., Johannesburg; +27 11 877 6800), and headquarters of major corporations. A decade ago it was considered an urban decay but has since become one of the most dynamic neighborhoods in the city.  The market is crucial for small shops and galleries on surrounding streets as it draws in customers who then browse through products like photos taken by street kids or vintage clothing. On the east end of downtown Johannesburg lies another weekly market called Arts on Main (268 Fox St., Johannesburg; +27 11 334 5947). This market opened five years ago in a hundred-year-old liquor warehouse building. It offers craft beers, cocktails for Sunday shoppers to enjoy while they explore stalls selling cosmopolitan foods from various countries like Ethiopian coffee or Argentine barbecues with Italian gelato.  The author mentions culinary highlights from around South Africa found at Arts on Main such as traditional bread known as roosterkoek cooked on braai barbecue grills where visitors can stuff them with vegetables or meat if they desire. There are also Durban curries, bunny chow (curry served inside a loaf of bread), freshly sliced biltong (dried meat), and street-side grills offering fresh meats served with chips or pap.  The surrounding area of the markets offers visitors more opportunities to explore. Artists have set up studios and galleries where people can purchase enlarged copies of iconic ""Drum"" magazine covers or art books. Independent shops, cafes, and Johannesburg's only art house cinema called Bioscope (286 Fox St., Johannesburg; +27 11 039 7306) can be found on the surrounding streets.  For those who want to stay overnight instead of just visiting for the day, there are accommodation options available in the area. Curiocity Backpackers (302 Fox St., Johannesburg; +27 728 80 9583) is run by Bheki Dube who organizes walking tours and volunteer experiences too.

"This news article discusses the outcome and aftermath of a high-profile trial in which a woman named Arias was found guilty of first-degree murder for killing Travis Alexander. The article highlights the emotional impact on the jurors who had to remain stoic during the trial but expressed their emotions privately during deliberation.   One juror, Zervakos, stated that Arias did not fit his image of a murderer, and he believed that she may have been mentally and verbally abused by Alexander. However, he also admitted that her 18 days on the stand hurt her case as there were many contradictions in her testimony.  The jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on sentencing Arias to death, resulting in a hung jury and triggering a retrial for the penalty phase. In other states, this would have taken the death penalty off the table if there was no agreement among jurors. However, Arizona allows for retrials even with an unresolved verdict.  The announcement of the deadlock led to strong emotions in the courtroom, with Arias appearing close to tears and one of Alexander's sisters sobbing. The usually composed judge also displayed cracked voice while dismissing jurors.  The Maricopa County Attorney announced their intention to retry the penalty phase despite not securing a unanimous decision from this jury.  The article briefly mentions how Arias met Alexander at a business convention in Las Vegas before becoming involved romantically with him. It also mentions some details about their tumultuous relationship leading up to Alexander's murder.  Overall, this article provides an overview of how emotional testimony affected both jurors and individuals involved in this high-profile case. Additionally, it informs readers about what will happen next following a hung jury in Arizona's legal system The article further highlights the gravity of the crime committed by Arias, describing in detail how she stabbed Alexander 29 times, slit his throat and shot him in the face. The jury had previously found her guilty of first-degree murder and determined that she had acted in an ""exceptionally cruel"" manner.  To sentence Arias to death, a unanimous decision from the jury is required. However, this was not achieved in the penalty phase of the trial. The report states that there was an 8-4 split among jurors in favor of handing her a death sentence.  The article then reveals that Arias pleaded with jurors to spare her life during this stage of the trial. She expressed remorse for her actions and claimed that Alexander's murder was ""the worst mistake"" she had ever made and something she would regret for a lifetime.  Background information about Arias and Alexander's relationship is provided, including how they met at a convention and how their romantic involvement escalated over time. Their relationship went through ups and downs, leading to its eventual disintegration before Alexander's brutal murder.  Images related to the case were also discussed throughout the trial, including graphic autopsy photos presented as evidence.  The article concludes by mentioning that this high-profile trial began in January and has attracted significant attention due to its sensational nature involving sex, lies, abuse allegations, digital images, and ultimately violent death.

"The news article describes a scene in which the author and his companion, Louis, are held captive by members of the Belmokhtar Group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). They are forced to watch propaganda videos that showcase various acts of violence and terrorism committed by extremist groups. The videos include footage of terrorist attacks, suicide bombings, and threats made by prominent figures such as Osama Bin Laden.  The captors use these videos to incite and energize their fellow extremists, reminding them of their cause and the importance of sacrifice. The younger members of the group appear particularly excited and enthusiastic while watching Western infidels being targeted and killed. Throughout their viewing, shouts of ""Allahu Akbar"" can be heard from those present, with some eagerly observing the reaction from Louis and the author.  Although unable to understand much without his glasses, Louis reads out loud any signs or subtitles accompanying the videos. However, owing to their disturbing content, the author asks him to stop doing so. The intention behind these propaganda videos becomes apparent - they serve as an effective tool for indoctrinating young extremists into believing in a global cause that justifies violence.  The author expresses discomfort when witnessing scenes depicting mistreatment inflicted by Western forces upon prisoners at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba as well as Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad during Iraq War. These images evoke feelings of deep shame for committing such acts under claims of moral superiority.  Interestingly enough though paradoxical at first glance, these photographs may have contributed unintentionally to a less severe treatment for both Louis and himself during captivity. By displaying indifference towards partaking in similar actions against captives like those depicted on video or photo evidence seen earlier—a myth temporarily upheld—the abductors aim to assert their own moral superiority over Western forces.  In conclusion, while acts committed by Al Qaeda are gruesome but expected given their nature as a terrorist group bent on destruction; it is the evidence of sanctioned abuse and torture perpetuated by individuals representing the ""good guys"" that is truly distressing. The author finds it difficult to comprehend the bureaucratic and legally justified manner in which such brutality is carried out.  Overall, the article portrays a grim picture of extremism and violence, highlighting the impact of propaganda videos on radicalizing individuals while also shedding light on the disturbing actions conducted by both sides involved in conflicts around the world. As the article continues, the author reflects on the paradoxical nature of their captors' behavior. Despite their claims of moral superiority, it is clear that they are not immune to committing violence and acts of terror themselves. It becomes evident that both sides in this conflict have engaged in morally questionable actions, with neither being able to claim absolute moral high ground.  The author acknowledges that while the videos depicting mass murders and assassinations by extremist groups like Al Qaeda are harrowing to witness, they are somewhat expected considering their ideology. However, it is the images and evidence of systematic brutality carried out by their own side – Western forces – under official sanction that disturb him greatly.  He describes scenes from Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib where prisoners were subjected to degrading treatment including torture and abuse. These actions were justified through bureaucratic means and legal technicalities which only further amplifies the barbarity perpetrated in the name of justice or national security.  The author suggests that perhaps these unsettling images from Western facilities may have unintentionally influenced a slightly less violent treatment for themselves as captives. Their captors seemingly want to distance themselves from such atrocities, albeit temporarily maintaining a façade of moral superiority.  In essence, this news article serves as a devastating reminder of how extremism breeds violence on all sides involved in conflicts around the world. It highlights the dangerous consequences when morality becomes compromised for political gains or military objectives.  By exposing both sides' actions – Al Qaeda's deeds driven by ideology versus Western forces' abuse perpetrated under official orders – this article brings attention to ethical issues pertaining to warfare and counter-terrorism efforts. It challenges readers to reflect on the consequences of engaging in brutality even when done so supposedly with good intentions.  Ultimately, it is an exploration into uncomfortable truths about human nature during times of war; truths that expose our capacity for cruelty regardless of which side we find ourselves on.",explain
"In this news article, it is reported that West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has filed a request for a civil injunction related to allegations of sexual assault against two female students by two seventh-grade boys. The incidents occurred between November 2012 and May 2013 at Burch Middle School in Mingo County.  The filing states that the two boys would work together to carry out the assaults, with one restraining the victim while the other groped her. Most of the alleged attacks happened at the school, but one girl claimed she was raped during a class trip to Charleston.  The names of the boys and girls involved have not been released. However, it is mentioned that both suspects are related to employees of the Mingo County school system. Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney Teresa Maynard became aware of the investigation after Morrisey filed for an injunction and subsequently decided to file juvenile charges against both boys.  While charges have not been brought against any other parties, several teachers and administrators are named as defendants in Morrisey's court filing requesting a civil injunction. A civil injunction is an extreme court order used to restrain harassment.   Morrisey's complaint focuses on what he believes was flawed handling of the allegations and conflicts of interest within the investigation process. He details disappearing evidence, connected suspects, sham investigations, deceitful administrators, and refusals to cooperate with law enforcement in his 32-page complaint.  Mingo County has had a history of nepotism, cronyism, vendettas,and public corruption throughout its institutions including law enforcement and government offices.The county has had previous cases involving assassinations,sentencing prison for judges/prosecutors,and guilty pleas given bypublic officials.The mayor was recently found guilty following accusations made about lying related wo workers' compensation case.  According to Morrisey's request for an injunction filing concerning Burch Middle School,the claims made by victims were allegedly ignored or minimized. School officials are accused of threatening the girls, retaliating against them, and protecting the accused boys. Punishments given to the boys were characterized as inadequate and mocking.  One girl who reported the incidents was later written up for bullying after she blocked a teacher's niece on social media. The other victim was allegedly placed in lower-level classes as retaliation by a high-ranking school official. The principal of Burch Middle School also reportedly prevented a State Trooper from taking statements from students about the alleged abuse, citing disruption to the learning environment.  CNN attempted to contact teachers and administrators at Burch Middle School mentioned in Morrisey's filing but did not receive any response. Jason Long, attorney representing Mingo County Board of Education and school superintendent, stated that they are committed to working with Morrisey's office to resolve this investigation promptly.  This article highlights serious allegations of sexual assault at Burch Middle School in West Virginia. It raises concerns about how these allegations were handled by school officials and accuses them of protecting those involved while intimidating and retaliating against victims who came forward.Moringsey believes there was insufficient impartiality in conducting an investigation into these claims due conflicts-of-interest within Mingo County institutions.   Authorities have begun legal action against two male seventh-grade students based on juvenile charges filed against them.Moringsey hopes that his request for a civil injunction will prevent further harassment or intimidation related crimes while maintaining investigator impartiality.

"This news article discusses a Supreme Court case involving a woman named Bond who was accused of poisoning her husband's mistress. The case raises questions about the limits of congressional and presidential authority, specifically in relation to the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act.  The article highlights the debate among tea party conservatives regarding the case's implications in a post-9/11 security-conscious environment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor remarks on the irony of criticizing Syria for using chemical weapons while potentially declaring legislation to implement an international treaty on chemical weapons unconstitutional.  Bond, originally from Barbados but residing in Philadelphia, worked as a microbiologist. She became enraged when she learned her husband had impregnated her closest friend and sought revenge by stealing hazardous chemicals from her workplace and obtaining others online. She sprinkled these chemicals around Haynes' apartment complex, attempting to harm her without causing death.  After facing little help from local police, Bond was eventually arrested by postal inspectors who set up surveillance cameras that captured her actions. She pleaded guilty to federal charges related to mail fraud and violating laws pertaining to chemical weapons possession and use. Bond's lawyer argues that these charges exceed congressional authority and that the treaty was intended for war-like behavior rather than personal disputes.  During arguments at the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts asks if there are limitations on what Congress can do with respect to their police power under a treaty's authority. Justices Elena Kagan and Anthony Kennedy comment on the difficulty of delineating national and international interests when determining what falls within treaty regulations.  Solicitor General Donald Verrilli defends both the treaty and law by emphasizing that there can't be exceptions made for localization under treaties' powers. He dismisses hypothetical concerns about complete federal government control over states through sweeping treaties as highly unlikely given ratification requirements.  Justice Antonin Scalia uses this discussion as an opportunity to delve into another controversial issue – same-sex marriage – highlighting how self-executing treaties could impact state laws and requiring congressional action to enact them.  Justice Samuel Alito expresses concern about the broad scope of the law, noting that even giving out chocolates on Halloween could be considered a violation since they can cause harm. He suggests that such a wide interpretation of the law would shock ordinary people.  The article concludes by mentioning Bond's sentence – six years in prison and fines – and her release in 2012. It highlights how this case raises questions about the extent of federal authority under international treaties.  In summary, this news article covers a Supreme Court case involving a woman accused of using chemical weapons to harm her husband's mistress. It explores the boundaries of congressional and presidential authority within an international treaty context, with various justices expressing different views on the issue. In addition to the specific details of the case, the article touches upon broader themes that are at the center of the ongoing political debate. The case raises questions about federal authority, constitutional interpretation, and the balance between personal liberties and national security concerns.  The tea party conservatives mentioned in the article seem to be particularly concerned about potential encroachments on individual liberties by a powerful federal government. They argue that Congress should have limitations on its power when it comes to implementing international treaties, especially ones that may involve issues traditionally regarded as within states' jurisdiction.  On the other hand, those defending the treaty and law assert that there should not be exceptions or exemptions based on a locality. They argue that treaties are vital tools for addressing global issues, and conceding too much power to localize interpretations can undermine their effectiveness.  These disagreements reflect larger divisions within American politics regarding federalism and how best to strike a balance between national interests and individual rights. Some commentators believe this particular case has significant implications for how various treaties will be interpreted in future cases.  The case also introduces an interesting discussion around just how far-reaching international agreements can be. Justice Scalia's hypothetical scenario involving same-sex marriage serves as an example of potentially contentious issues where treaties might intersect with domestic laws. This sparks debates about who has final authority - national governments or supranational bodies - when it comes to making decisions impacting key social issues.  Furthermore, Justice Alito's comment regarding Halloween chocolates illustrates concerns about overreach in interpreting legislation meant to address serious threats like chemical weapons but potentially being applied too broadly.  Overall, this news article provides insight into a Supreme Court case examining congressional and presidential authority in relation to an international treaty on chemical weapons possession and use. It illustrates different perspectives within both legal circles and public opinion concerning constitutional interpretations related to federal powers versus states' rights when implementing such agreements.",explain
"This news article is discussing the issue of grade inflation in universities, specifically focusing on Harvard University. In the past, professors used to grade students on a bell curve, with only a small percentage of students receiving an A and some even failing. However, this particular professor at Harvard gave every student in his class an A, including a fictitious student who never attended or completed any coursework.  The author of the article criticizes this approach by arguing that grades serve multiple purposes, such as measuring a student's progress compared to their peers and helping in scholarship and job applications. They argue that Harvard faculty members have abandoned their responsibility towards their students by giving out easy grades to all.  The article further explores how this shift in grading practices might be due to the competition between universities for students and between faculty for positive reviews from students. The author claims that higher education has become more consumer-driven, with an expectation from students that they will receive good grades since they are paying high tuition fees.  In order to address grade inflation, the article suggests implementing stricter grading systems like Princeton did in 2004 by limiting the percentage of A or A- grades given out by faculty members. Yale is also mentioned as being in discussions about making similar adjustments.  The author concludes by highlighting examples of exceptional Harvard students who were selected for prestigious scholarships like Rhodes Scholars. However, they also note that with grade inflation at Harvard, it becomes difficult to determine if all these successful candidates are truly deserving of their high grades.  Overall, this article raises concerns about grade inflation at Harvard University and questions whether higher education has turned into a consumer-driven business where good grades are expected rather than earned based on academic performance. The author emphasizes that universities, including Harvard, are now competing for students in the marketplace. This competition extends beyond enrollment and affects faculty as well. Professors strive to be popular among students, as positive end-of-semester reviews can impact their tenure, promotions, and even salaries. This has led to an increase in ""gut courses,"" which are considered easier to excel in.  Furthermore, the landscape of university life has become more contentious and competitive. Departments aim to meet quotas for majors and parents often voice concerns if they feel their children are not being adequately recognized or appreciated academically.  The article poses the question of whether grade inflation has transformed higher education into a consumer-oriented industry where students believe they have paid for good grades along with their exorbitant tuition fees. It suggests that there is a power shift from faculty to students and an emerging sense of entitlement on the part of students.  To address this issue, Princeton is cited as having implemented a grading system in 2004 that restricts faculty from awarding more than 35% A or A- grades. It is mentioned that Yale is currently discussing similar adjustments.  In conclusion, the article criticizes grade inflation at Harvard University and argues that stricter grading systems should be implemented to maintain academic standards. The author highlights exceptional Harvard students who were awarded prestigious scholarships but questions whether their high grades are truly reflective of their abilities due to grade inflation at the university.  Overall, this article raises concerns about the changing dynamics of higher education where academic standards may be compromised due to factors like competition between universities, student expectations influenced by steep tuition fees, and faculty seeking popularity through lenient grading practices.",explain
"This news article discusses the potential candidates for the 2016 presidential election in the United States. It starts with Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, stating that he is still considering a presidential run but hasn't made up his mind yet. He mentions factors such as whether his candidacy could ""lift people's spirits"" and if the sacrifice for his family is tolerable.  The article then moves on to Ben Carson, a renowned neurosurgeon who has gained popularity among conservatives. He rose to political fame after criticizing the country's direction at a National Prayer Breakfast in 2013. He has been compared to a rockstar among conservatives and is currently the only African-American Republican expressing interest in running for president in 2016.  Next, it discusses Rand Paul, a senator from Kentucky, who recently announced that he will run for re-election to the Senate. However, there are complications if he also wants to run for president since Kentucky election law only allows candidates to appear on one ballot at a time. Paul may consider legal challenges or changes to Kentucky's nominating system.  The article then mentions Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey who vetoed a bill banning gestation crates for pigs. While animal rights activists were upset about his decision, it pleased Iowa Governor Terry Branstad who praised Christie's veto since Iowa is a top pork producer.  Lastly, Mitt Romney is mentioned as still being favored by Republican voters despite repeatedly stating he won't be running again. His recent revelation that his hair isn't always perfectly coiffed caused some buzz but hasn't affected his popularity amongst voters.  Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich also briefly discussed another possible presidential run but stated it was unlikely and considered early stages of speculation.  Overall, this article provides an overview of some potential candidates for the 2016 presidential election and highlights their current positions and actions leading up to their decisions on whether or not they will run for office.  In addition to the potential candidates discussed in the previous section, the article touches on other important aspects of the 2016 presidential race. For example, it mentions that Jeb Bush's decision is eagerly awaited by other candidates, particularly his mentee Sen. Marco Rubio and moderate Republicans such as Gov. Chris Christie.  The article also notes that Mitt Romney continues to remain a favorite among Republican voters despite stating multiple times that he will not run again. This indicates that until another frontrunner emerges, voters are inclined to keep him as their top choice.  Furthermore, the article discusses Ben Carson's popularity among conservatives and his status as the only African-American Republican expressing interest in a presidential run for 2016. It highlights his appeal among radio talk shows due to his outspokenness against political correctness.  Rand Paul's announcement of running for re-election to the Senate while still considering a presidential bid presents legal challenges with Kentucky election law only allowing candidates to appear on one ballot at a time. The article suggests possible options for Paul like legal challenges or changing Kentucky's nominating system from a primary to a caucus.  The article concludes with Newt Gingrich briefly discussing the emerging field of candidates but stating it is unlikely for him to personally enter into another presidential race.  Overall, this news piece provides insight into various potential contenders for the 2016 presidency and sheds light on their actions and considerations leading up to their final decisions. It also acknowledges some challenges faced by these individuals and addresses voter preferences based on current polling data. ",explain
"The news article discusses the latest revelations from documents leaked by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the U.S. government. The report highlights that Canada's Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC), a government intelligence agency, may have been involved in spy activities during the G8 and G20 summits.  The article starts by mentioning that CSEC did not comment on these allegations when asked by CBC, a Canadian news outlet. It also mentions that in previous similar reports, U.S. government officials have refrained from commenting on specific claims but have defended their intelligence gathering activities, stating that all nations engage in such practices.  The author then points out that the CBC report does not specify which world leaders were being targeted or what information was obtained during the summits. There is also no clarity on CSEC's role in these activities and whether it violated Canadian laws by conducting surveillance without warrants.  To provide some context for readers unfamiliar with these political events, the article explains that G8 and G20 summits are meetings of world leaders where they discuss important global issues. The 2010 G8 summit held in Toronto focused on economic recovery while addressing concerns about Iran and North Korea.  The connection between Edward Snowden and this report is discussed next. It mentions that Snowden worked as an IT contractor for the US government before leaking classified information to media outlets like The Guardian and The Washington Post. Some of his leaks revealed controversial programs carried out by the National Security Agency (NSA), including mass collection of phone and internet data both within and outside of America.  These revelations put pressure on the Obama administration to justify its spying practices while ensuring citizens' privacy rights were protected. The claims of Chancellor Merkel being spied on strained relations between Germany and the United States, leading to damage control efforts by US authorities with foreign leaders.  Regarding Snowden himself, he has been charged with espionage and theft of government property but currently resides in Russia after being granted asylum there. The article mentions this to provide background on Snowden's current situation and the ongoing legal battle he faces.  The news article also references a previous report by The Guardian, which revealed that Britain's electronic intelligence agency also engaged in spying during a G20 summit held in 2009. This incident demonstrates a pattern of intelligence gathering activities by allied countries during international summits.  In conclusion, the article highlights allegations that Canada's CSEC may have been involved in surveillance activities during G8 and G20 summits. It emphasizes that while specific details are lacking, these claims raise concerns about violations of Canadian law and the potential involvement of other nations' intelligence agencies. The article further connects this story to Edward Snowden's leaks and mentions previous incidents where similar surveillance activities were exposed at international gatherings. The news article continues by noting that the revelations in the CBC report are not entirely surprising given Edward Snowden's involvement. Snowden's leaks have consistently exposed the extent of global surveillance activities carried out by various intelligence agencies, particularly the NSA.  The impact of these leaks has been significant. They have put governments on the defensive, forcing them to justify their actions and address concerns about privacy violations. The Obama administration has faced intense scrutiny and criticism for its spying programs, with assurances made to Americans regarding their privacy rights.  In addition to straining relations with Germany over Chancellor Angela Merkel being targeted, these leaked documents also revealed extensive monitoring efforts by Britain's electronic intelligence agency during a G20 summit held in 2009. This adds another layer of concern as it indicates that allies engage in similar intelligence-gathering practices during international gatherings.  The article raises important questions about CSEC's involvement and potential violations of Canadian law. If it is proven that CSEC engaged in surveillance without proper warrants or oversight, it would be seen as a violation of Canada's laws protecting citizens' rights to privacy.  Furthermore, these allegations raise broader questions about accountability and transparency when it comes to surveillance activities conducted by governments around the world. While some argue that such measures are necessary for national security purposes, others question whether they infringe upon individual freedoms and civil liberties.  It is worth noting that while Snowden is credited with exposing these secrets, his actions have also generated considerable controversy. Some view him as a whistleblower who helped shed light on government overreach and secrecy. Others see him as a traitor who jeopardized national security interests by revealing classified information.  Given his legal situation under charges of espionage and theft of government property in the United States, Snowden sought asylum in Russia back in 2013 and was granted temporary protection for one year initially.  In conclusion, this news article brings attention to new allegations regarding Canada's CSEC involvement in spy activities during G8 and G20 summits. It highlights the global impact of Edward Snowden's leaks, which have revealed extensive surveillance efforts by various intelligence agencies. The article raises important questions about compliance with national laws and international norms when it comes to surveillance practices, as well as the balance between security and individual privacy rights.",explain

"This news article provides an update on the actions of Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA) who leaked classified documents regarding surveillance programs. The article highlights a letter written by Snowden and published in German magazine Der Spiegel.  The letter, written in Moscow where Snowden has sought asylum, accuses governments of attempting to stifle discussion on mass surveillance through a ""witch hunt"" that threatens journalists and criminalizes publication of program details. Snowden asserts that his actions have sparked important debate and brought about calls for political reforms, oversight, and new laws.  The leaked NSA documents revealed top-secret surveillance programs collecting domestic emails and telephone records within the US while also monitoring the communication activities of foreign residents. The report by Der Spiegel includes allegations that the NSA had tapped German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone and carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens. These allegations have led to calls for investigations both in European countries and within the US.  Snowden is currently wanted by US authorities on espionage charges but has been granted asylum in Russia. This open letter follows another sent to German authorities through an intermediary earlier in which Snowden expressed confidence that with international support, the US would abandon efforts to criminalize political speech with felony charges.  The White House has not responded directly to Snowden's claims made in this latest letter but Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer stated there were no discussions regarding clemency for him. Both Senator Dianne Feinstein (chairwoman of Senate Intelligence Committee) and Representative Mike Rogers (Chairman of House Intelligence Committee) emphasized that Snowden should return to face justice as he violated US law by leaking classified information.  In conclusion, this news article discusses an open letter written by Edward Snowden accusing governments of trying to suppress debate about mass surveillance through persecution tactics against journalists. The article provides context about previous leaks highlighting specific allegations made against intelligence agencies such as spying on foreign leaders' phones or conducting surveillance on citizens from other countries. It also includes comments from US officials reiterating their stance on Snowden's actions and the need for him to return to face legal consequences. In addition to the details of Snowden's letter, the article mentions the impact of his leaks on both domestic and international levels. The revelations about widespread surveillance programs have sparked widespread concern and debate around the world. European countries, particularly Germany, have called for investigations into these practices, while in the United States there have been congressional hearings pushing for more transparency and oversight in intelligence operations.  The article also highlights Snowden's assertion that his actions are leading to positive change. He believes that by bringing these surveillance programs into public knowledge, society is now demanding political reforms, oversight mechanisms, and new laws to protect privacy rights. Snowden sees his leaks as a catalyst for increased awareness and scrutiny over government surveillance practices.  Furthermore, the article sheds light on some specific incidents mentioned in Der Spiegel's report based on documents provided by Snowden. It references allegations that the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone communication, which generated significant outrage in Germany. Additionally, it suggests that French and Spanish citizens may have been subject to US surveillance as well.  The letter from Snowden serves as a clear declaration of his intent to continue speaking out against mass surveillance practices despite facing charges in the United States. He accuses governments of trying to silence dissent through intimidation tactics and calls for international support in order to challenge these efforts.  The perspectives of US officials are also included in this news article. White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer dismisses any suggestion of clemency for Snowden, stressing that he violated U.S. law by leaking classified information. Sen. Dianne Feinstein emphasizes that if he considered himself a whistleblower who wanted to reveal important information about government misconduct, he had alternative avenues available instead of resorting to leaking classified documents publicly.  Meanwhile Chairman Mike Rogers insists that Snowden must face responsibility for stealing classified information because it has had consequences on counterterrorism operations by allowing terrorist organizations affiliated with al-Qaeda to change their communication methods.  Overall,the article gives insight into both sides of the debate surrounding Edward Snowden's actions. It presents his own perspective, highlighting the reasons he believes that his leaks have been beneficial for society. It also includes comments from government officials who argue that Snowden should face the legal consequences of his actions and should have pursued alternative channels if he wished to expose any wrongdoing within intelligence agencies.",explain
"This news article discusses the recent events in Israel and the Palestinian territories, specifically focusing on the escalating tensions and violence between Israelis and Palestinians. The article begins by describing how the Israeli government blamed Hamas, a Palestinian political party, for abducting three Israeli teenagers. In response to this accusation, Israel arrested suspects in the West Bank and launched airstrikes against targets in Gaza that are used to fire rockets into Israel.  The article then highlights an incident where a Palestinian teenager named Mohammad Abu Khedair was kidnapped and killed. His body was found in a forest in Jerusalem after he was forced into a car by three people. This incident sparked clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces in the Shuafat neighborhood of Jerusalem.  It is also mentioned that another Israeli teenager named Shelly Dadon had been killed earlier in May by a taxi driver who believed his actions were motivated by Palestinian nationalism. The deaths of both teenagers have caused outrage among their respective communities.  The article goes on to discuss how Tariq Abu Khdeir, a teenage relative of Mohammad Abu Khedair from Florida, was beaten by men wearing Israeli security forces uniforms during protests following Mohammad's death. There is dispute over what led to his beating, with Israel's ambassador to the United States claiming Khdeir had been involved in throwing petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails. However, both videos posted online do not show what triggered the beating.  The question of whether these recent events will lead to a ""third intifada"" is raised - referring to previous armed uprisings by Palestinians against Israel - with some suggesting that if Palestinians do not disassociate themselves from militants responsible for these killings, there may be an increase in violence.  Palestinian leaders have called for an end to ""collective punishments"" imposed by Israel as well as condemning retaliatory killings carried out by Israeli military actions. Meanwhile, there have been anti-racism rallies held within Israel aimed at countering the hatred on both sides.  The article concludes by stating that there are calls for peace from various individuals and groups. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged Palestinian and Arab leaders to join his calls for an end to the violence. The family of one of the murdered Israeli teenagers, Naftali Frankel, also condemned Khedair's killing. The article emphasizes that there is a need for all sides to calm the situation rather than escalate it further.  Overall, this news article highlights the recent violent incidents in Israel and the Palestinian territories, along with the reactions from different parties involved. It covers kidnappings, abductions, killings, clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces, allegations of excessive use of force by Israel against Palestinians during protests, and discussions surrounding a potential escalation in violence. The article further delves into the reactions and positions of various leaders and organizations involved in the conflict. It mentions that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, despite facing criticism from fellow Palestinians, had condemned the kidnappings of the three Israeli teenagers. In contrast to this, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal praised the abductors and called for the release of Palestinian prisoners.  While both sides condemn each other's actions, Palestinian leaders have specifically called for an end to what they term as ""collective punishment"" by Israel. They refer to Israel's demolition of homes and other military actions in response to attacks carried out by Palestinians. On the other hand, some have called on Israel to demolish the homes of those responsible for Abu Khedair's killing.  The article also highlights incidents where acts of racism occurred following the killings. It mentions Israeli Jews yelling ""Death to Arabs"" after news broke about the murder of their three teenage boys. However, it also notes that many Israelis have participated in anti-racism rallies as a countermeasure against such hatred.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu makes a public plea for an end to violence from all sides and calls attention to incitement within his own country, emphasizing his commitment not to let extremists bring further bloodshed into their area.  In summary, this news article presents a comprehensive overview of recent events in Israel and Palestine. It covers multiple incidents including abductions, killings, clashes between protesters and security forces as well as discussions regarding potential consequences such as a third intifada or armed uprising by Palestinians against Israeli occupation. The perspectives and reactions from both sides are explored while highlighting efforts made by some individuals and groups towards peacebuilding amid escalating tensions. ",explain
"This news article is reporting on the severe snowstorm that hit Atlanta and caused chaos for the city's schools. It begins by stating that all children who had been stuck at their schools overnight have now been picked up and are headed home. This includes 2,000 students from Fulton County Schools and 400 students from Atlanta Public Schools.  The article highlights that there has been criticism directed towards the city for its handling of the storm, as some people question how a few inches of snow could cause such problems. In response to this criticism, Mayor Kasim Reed assures residents that the city is working to clear roads and asks them to stay at home. He emphasizes that the safety of the children was ensured by keeping them in school overnight.  Amidst all the chaos, there were heartwarming stories emerging from some schools where students spent the night. For example, at E. Rivers Elementary School, approximately 150 students and teachers spent the night on gym mats watching movies and enjoying warm meals.  However, many worried parents had to spend a sleepless night without their children. One grandmother says her granddaughter ate dinner and breakfast at New Manchester High School but informed her that school officials were asking parents to pick up their children as they had run out of food. The principal later denies these claims.  Further reports from Georgia and Alabama reveal similar situations in other schools with stranded students spending nights in various locations such as bus depots or supermarkets.  Overall, this news article provides an overview of how Atlanta's schools were impacted by a severe snowstorm. It highlights both uplifting stories amidst chaos but also addresses concerns raised by worried parents about food shortages in certain schools due to being trapped or confined during this weather emergency. The article goes on to mention that Marietta City Schools in northwest Atlanta had eight students spending the night at the school bus depot and 669 students staying in eight schools overnight. The spokesperson for the school system assures that all students will be safely returned home.  In Cherokee County, north of Atlanta, around 150 students remained in 11 schools as of Wednesday morning, but this number had decreased to 10 by midday. The schools reassured parents that the students were being kept safe, warm, fed, and entertained with activities such as movies and games.  In Paulding and Douglas counties west of Atlanta, approximately 1,800 collective students sought shelter at county schools due to being stranded or unable to reach their homes. These counties provided refuge for people stuck on the roads or those who walked to the schools.  The situation was similar in Hoover, Alabama where one bus with 61 children was stuck until early morning but all were reported safe. Another stranded bus had its occupants moved to a local children's hospital. Approximately 4,000 students and 350 adults sought shelter at Hoover schools due to road conditions. The cafeteria was stocked well enough for everyone's needs while they played video games and watched movies.  There are also accounts from individuals about their experiences during this snowy night. An iReporter named Monica Cantwell shared that she spent the night in her office at the University of Alabama at Birmingham while her daughter was stuck at a middle school in Hoover. Her daughter mentioned boredom but was being taken care of by school staff who separated them into small groups for entertainment activities.  Bob Ammons from Jefferson County Emergency Management reports that as of early morning hours around 1,400 students spent the night in Birmingham-area schools with none remaining on buses as they were either returned or picked up by their parents.  Lastly, Steve Smith from Atlanta Public Schools claims that around one million people attempted to go home on Tuesday which contributed significantly to traffic congestion and the challenges faced by schools in safely transporting students.  In summary, the news article further provides specific examples from various schools and locations affected by the snowstorm in Atlanta. It gives an insight into how different schools handled the situation, including efforts made to ensure safety, provide shelter, food, and entertainment for stranded students.

"This news article discusses the ongoing challenges faced by the United States Postal Service (USPS) and the recent announcement of an increase in the price of first-class stamps. The author highlights that while mail delivery may seem outdated in a digital era, there are reasons to hope for the continued existence of USPS.  The article begins by describing a scene where people on sidewalks are engrossed in their personal screens while mail carriers with satchels walk amidst them. This stark contrast between traditional mail delivery and modern technology sets the backdrop for discussing the difficulties USPS faces.  The USPS has reported significant financial losses, with $5 billion lost in the last fiscal year and nearly $16 billion lost in the previous year. The decreasing volume of envelopes being carried by mail carriers contributes to these losses, as well as an immense burden of billions of dollars required to pre-fund healthcare for future retirees.  Despite these challenges, USPS differs from private delivery companies like UPS and FedEx as it does not rely on tax money but is expected to sustain itself. However, unlike its private counterparts, USPS requires explicit approval from Congress for rate changes and operational rules. This means that sending a letter across the country costs as much as sending one locally and why USPS provides universal service across every address in America.  The article emphasizes that while 49 cents may seem like a high price for a stamp, if USPS were to collapse under financial pressures or competition from digital communication alternatives, other courier services would likely charge significantly more than 49 cents for long-distance deliveries. The failures by UPS and FedEx during Christmas highlight how their efficiency is influenced by competition from USPS.  One unexpected source of support comes from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Amazon has announced its partnership with USPS to deliver packages on Sundays using postal service employees. This collaboration provides additional revenue for USPS at a time when it is needed most.  Looking ahead, there are doubts about whether daily mail delivery can continue indefinitely given advancements in digital communication. As an example, Canada's postal service is transitioning away from door-to-door delivery and focusing more on package delivery. This shift reflects the changing demands of the digital world.  The article concludes by acknowledging the value and importance of universal and inexpensive mail delivery that USPS has provided throughout the nation's history. It emphasizes that rebuilding such a system from scratch today would be nearly impossible due to its complexity, cost, and logistical challenges.  Ultimately, the author advises caution to those who wish for the disappearance of USPS in favor of digital alternatives. They highlight that while mail delivery may seem outdated at times, it still plays a crucial role in serving communities across America and maintaining competition in the private courier sector. The news article further delves into the potential consequences if the Postal Service were to disappear. It questions whether other courier services like UPS and FedEx could effectively fill the void, especially at a price that is affordable for customers and businesses.  The author draws attention to the fact that while UPS and FedEx may be more expensive than USPS, they rely on competition from USPS to stay competitive in terms of reliability and accountability. By having a reliable alternative like USPS, customers have options and can choose based on their needs. If USPS were no longer available, this check on other carriers would be removed, potentially leading to higher prices or reduced quality of service.  A glimmer of hope for the Postal Service comes from an unexpected source – Jeff Bezos and Amazon. The article reveals that Amazon has partnered with USPS to deliver packages on Sundays using postal service employees. This collaboration not only benefits Amazon by expanding its delivery capabilities but also provides much-needed revenue for USPS.  However, despite these positive developments, it remains challenging for daily mail delivery to continue indefinitely in an increasingly digital world. The author references Canada's decision to transition away from door-to-door mail delivery as an example of how even well-established postal services are adapting to changing customer demands.  The article closes by emphasizing the incredible feat achieved by creating a universal and affordable mail delivery system in America's history. Looking forward, it cautions against casually dismissing or wishing for the disappearance of such a system without considering its value and impact.  In conclusion, this news article highlights both the financial challenges faced by the United States Postal Service as well as its importance in providing universal service at affordable rates. It recognizes some signs of hope but also raises questions about the viability of traditional mail delivery in our increasingly digital age. The piece ultimately serves as a reminder that maintaining a robust postal system is crucial not only for its practical benefits but also for serving as competition which pushes private carriers towards excellence.",explain
"This news article discusses the current state of the oil industry in Iraq amidst the ongoing conflict with ISIS. It highlights two main camps - explorers who have suspended operations due to the volatile situation, and producers who are focusing on increasing production despite the challenges.  According to the Kurdish Regional Government, oil supplies in northern Iraq are still above 300,000 barrels a day. However, ISIS has gained control of seven fields that typically produce about 80 thousand barrels a day. As a result, some of this oil is finding its way onto the black market at discounted prices.  Another issue impacting Iraq's oil industry is the fighting in Baiji, which has disrupted refining capacity of up to 300,000 barrels per day. Additionally, there is an ongoing dispute between Baghdad and the Kurdish region over control of oil exports through Turkey's Port of Ceyhan.  Despite these challenges, Iraq continues to supply ample crude to the market. Overall production stands at 3.1 million barrels per day but down slightly from previous months. Exports have increased to 2.44 million barrels per day and are what investors focus on.  However, due to uncertainties caused by violence and political infighting in Baghdad, international oil companies may delay further investment until there is more stability in Iraq with possible U.S intervention.  The southern region around Basra remains crucial for both Iraq and major energy companies like BP and Lukoil as it boasts substantial reserves and record-level production levels despite initial security threats against foreign workers.  BP CEO Bob Dudley recently assured investors that production was back up to normal levels with plans for expansion while Lukoil's West Qurna 2 field is still producing without interruption despite initial delays.  Although maintaining stability within Iraq as a country or passing petroleum laws for revenue sharing may be challenging prospects currently; securing production and distribution has remained paramount during this conflict which has led to significant earnings for Iraq ($53 billion) last month alone from continuous perseverance.  In conclusion, this news article sheds light on the two different camps in Iraq's oil industry - explorers and producers. Despite the challenges posed by ISIS control of certain oil fields and the ongoing disputes between Baghdad and the Kurdish region, Iraq is still able to supply a significant amount of crude to the market. However, potential instability and political uncertainties in Iraq could deter international investment until there is more stability through possible U.S intervention. The southern region around Basra remains a critical area for production with major energy companies like BP and Lukoil still focused on operational expansion despite initial security threats. Ultimately, while revenue from oil sales has remained substantial, maintaining stability within Iraq may prove to be a challenge moving forward. Furthermore, the article emphasizes the harsh reality that money talks in Iraq's oil industry. Despite the country's struggles to stay unified and pass petroleum laws for revenue sharing, securing and maintaining production and distribution have been prioritized.  The conflict with ISIS has undoubtedly posed significant challenges to Iraq's oil sector. The militants' control over certain oil fields has disrupted production and created a black market where Iraqi oil is being sold at discounted prices. This not only highlights the vulnerability of Iraq's energy infrastructure but also raises concerns about the flow of funds into the hands of extremist groups.  In addition to security threats, political issues within Iraq have further complicated matters. The ongoing dispute between Baghdad and the Kurdish Regional Government over control of oil exports through Turkey's port of Ceyhan has caused tensions and delays in sales. This is reflective of broader disagreements regarding revenue sharing among different regions within Iraq.  Despite these challenges, Iraq continues to produce a significant amount of crude oil for export. The country's overall production stands at 3.1 million barrels per day, slightly down from previous months but still capable of meeting market demands. Exports have increased to 2.44 million barrels per day, which is what investors closely monitor.  However, investor confidence may be wavering due to uncertainties surrounding the security situation in Iraq as well as political instability within Baghdad. International oil companies (IOCs) may hold back on further investments until there is more clarity on these fronts.  The southern region around Basra remains crucial for both Iraqi officials and major energy companies like BP and Lukoil due to its substantial reserves and record-high levels of production. Despite initial security threats against foreign workers in this area, operations have continued without interruption or decline in output.  Unfortunately for Iraq, its original target growth plans for capacity expansion are likely to be missed due to current circumstances according to Luay al-Khatteeb from the Iraq Energy Institute.  While earnings from oil sales remain substantial, reaching $53 billion in a single month, the future of Iraq's oil industry remains uncertain. The intervention of the United States could potentially stabilize the country and reinvigorate investor interest, but until then, international oil companies may adopt a cautious approach before committing additional resources to exploration and production.  In summary, this article highlights the contrasting experiences within Iraq's oil sector. While some exploration activities have come to a halt due to security concerns amid ISIS control over certain oilfields, reduced refining capacity in Baiji after clashes with rebels, and political disputes between Baghdad and Kurdish authorities over sales through Turkey; producers in the south continue to operate at near-record levels. However, ongoing challenges may impact future investments until stability is restored in Iraq with potential U.S intervention playing a crucial role.",explain
"This news article discusses the topic of medical marijuana and its current state in New York. The article mentions that while twenty states and the District of Columbia have already legalized medical marijuana to some extent, New York has not yet joined them. However, Governor Cuomo has taken a step towards allowing medical marijuana in the state.  The article informs us that Colorado recently legalized the sale of marijuana to individuals aged 21 or older, and other states such as Connecticut, Vermont, and New Jersey have implemented medical marijuana programs. Although versions of the Compassionate Care Act have been passed by the state Assembly in New York, they have stalled in the Senate.  Governor Cuomo is taking action without legislative approval, but it is considered legal under a law passed in 1980. This move would establish a highly regulated system for medical marijuana, which is not as liberal as some other states' programs. Under Cuomo's directive, guidelines will be set up by the state health department. Panels at designated hospitals will then determine on a case-by-case basis which patients qualify for medical marijuana.  Regarding production and distribution of medical marijuana elements or products themselves, this aspect has yet to be determined.  Assembly member Gottfried estimates that tens of thousands could potentially receive Medical Marijuana through this policy change but emphasized that legislation would still be required for a truly comprehensive program.  Gabriel Sayegh from The Drug Policy Alliance applauds Governor Cuomo's initial step towards implementing medical marijuana but believes there is still work to do to create broader laws. He emphasizes the need for momentum to create permanent changes.  Overall, this article highlights how Governor Cuomo has made progress towards allowing medical cannabis use in New York through his office's actions rather than waiting for legislative approval. It also provides an overview of how other states have implemented their own systems and emphasizes that legislation will ultimately be needed for a more complete program in New York. The article goes on to mention that the proposal to allow medical marijuana in New York originated from Governor Cuomo's office. While this step is seen as a positive development by advocates like Gabriel Sayegh, the New York state director for the Drug Policy Alliance, he recognizes that there is still more work to be done to create a comprehensive and permanent program.  Sayegh praises Cuomo for taking this ""exciting"" initial step and believes it will help build momentum towards broader medical marijuana laws in the state. He suggests that pushing for further legislation can lead to a more inclusive program that can benefit a greater number of people.  The article also touches on the fact that the exact sources for medical marijuana production and distribution have yet to be determined. This aspect will require careful consideration as part of establishing a highly regulated system. It remains unclear whether licensed producers or other entities will be involved in supplying medical cannabis products.  Additionally, while some may view Cuomo's executive action as an effective method of implementing change without waiting for legislative approval, others argue that true comprehensive reform would still require passing laws through established channels.  In summary, this news article focuses on Governor Cuomo's move towards allowing medical marijuana in New York without legislative approval. It highlights existing programs in other states and emphasizes the need for further legislation to establish a well-functioning system in New York. The response from advocates has been generally positive but calls for continued efforts towards broader reform are made. ",explain
"This news article discusses the race for Best Picture at the Oscars and the importance of Oscar campaigning. The three films in contention for Best Picture are ""The Help,"" ""The Descendants,"" and ""The Artist."" The studios behind these films - Disney, 20th Century Fox, and The Weinstein Company - will be aggressively campaigning to win over the 6,000 members of the Academy before voting closes.  The article compares Oscar campaigns to political campaigns, stating that money is crucial in both cases. One example mentioned is the campaign for the film ""The Hurt Locker"" in 2010. Despite being a low-grossing movie compared to its competitor ""Avatar,"" it won Best Picture because of its successful campaign, which cost between $3 million and $5 million.  Oscar campaigns aim to build momentum by receiving accolades from guilds and film festivals leading up to nominations. This year, The Weinstein Company is ensuring that their film ""The Artist"" gains momentum at the right time by winning awards like Golden Globe and SAG.  Building momentum requires creating buzz around a film, which can be achieved through an intricate web of publicists, party planners, and consultants. These costs can add up significantly; for example, sending DVDs to all Academy members can cost more than $1 million.  Another tactic used in campaigning is hosting third-party Oscar parties where someone unrelated to the Academy supports a particular film. These events can cost around $2 million but are often subsidized by studios.  In addition to these expenses, cast members need to actively promote their films during the two months leading up to the Oscars. Flying them back and forth across countries and organizing their participation in events can incur significant costs.  Furthermore, there are additional costs associated with screenings and advertising. Full-page ads in industry magazines like Variety or The Hollywood Reporter can range from $15k-$1 million each.  While political campaign expenditure is more transparent than Oscar campaigns, this article argues that audiences deserve to know how much effort and money goes into winning an Oscar before considering its credibility. The article emphasizes that Oscar campaigns are not as transparent as political campaigns, and it argues for more transparency to ensure that the public understands what goes into winning an Oscar.  The author highlights the importance of timing in an Oscar campaign. Peaking too early can result in a loss of excitement, while peaking too late may leave insufficient time to engage voters effectively. Therefore, building momentum through accolades and awards from guilds and film festivals before the nomination voting period is crucial.  The cost of an Oscar campaign can be substantial due to various factors. Distributing DVDs to Academy members alone can reach over $1 million when considering packaging, express mailing, and hand delivery. Furthermore, hiring publicists, party planners, and consultants to generate buzz around a film can amount to more than $2 million.  A notable strategy employed by successful campaigners is hosting third-party Oscar parties where individuals outside of the Academy celebrate films featuring their friends or associates. These events can cost up to $2 million each but are often subsidized by studios seeking promotion for their films.  In addition to expenses related directly to campaigning efforts, there are other costs such as flying cast members across countries for promotional activities and keeping them comfortable during this final stretch leading up to the Oscars.  Screening costs and advertising expenses also contribute significantly. Full-page ads in trade magazines like Variety or The Hollywood Reporter range from $15k-$1 million per ad.  Overall, the article argues that while selecting a political leader may have higher stakes than honoring movies with an Oscar win, both processes should maintain transparency. There is a need for audiences to understand what goes into winning an Oscar before placing significant credibility on it. ",explain
"This news article discusses the case of Joran van der Sloot, a Dutch citizen who was recently expelled from Peru after serving his sentence for the murder of Stephany Flores, a Peruvian woman. Van der Sloot was also ordered to pay reparations to Flores' closest relatives.  The article explains that van der Sloot confessed not only to the murder but also to robbery, admitting that he stole Flores' belongings and van as a means to flee the country. His attempt to escape led him to Chile, where he was subsequently arrested. It is suggested that his confession and robbery were part of an effort to secure a more lenient sentence through a plea called an ""anticipated conclusion of the process"" under Peruvian law.  The trial proceedings were delayed when van der Sloot initially refused to enter a plea due to concerns about certain aggravating factors tied to admitting guilt. His attorney argued for a shorter sentence, claiming that his client was under special stress on the day of the murder because it marked five years since Natalee Holloway went missing in Aruba. Van der Sloot had previously been associated with Holloway's disappearance but had never been charged in relation to her case.   Accordingly, his defense argued that van der Sloot faced persecution and had already spent years being viewed as guilty by public opinion concerning Holloway's disappearance. Despite this portrayal, there is no evidence connecting him directly with her death.  Investigations suggest that Flores found something related to the Holloway case on van der Sloot's computer during her visit before he killed her. The judges described in detail how he struck Flores after she hit him following this discovery. He then tried strangling her before ultimately suffocating her with his shirt while she was still breathing.  The article mentions that while no one has been charged or found guilty in connection with Holloway's case in Aruba and her body remains undiscovered; there is still a possibility of van der Sloot being extradited to the United States. In 2010, he was indicted on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegedly attempting to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother by providing false information about her daughter's whereabouts.  The article concludes by mentioning that six and a half years after her disappearance, an Alabama Probate Judge officially declared Natalee Holloway legally dead. This likely has implications for any ongoing legal matters related to the case.  In summary, this news article provides an overview of Joran van der Sloot's crimes in Peru, including his confession to murder and robbery. It also highlights his connection to the high-profile Natalee Holloway case while examining the intricacies and developments surrounding his trials and potential extradition. Continuing from where we left off, the article also touches upon the indictment of van der Sloot on charges of wire fraud and extortion in relation to Natalee Holloway's case. It is alleged that he attempted to extort a significant amount of money from Natalee's mother, Beth Holloway, by claiming to have information about the whereabouts of her daughter's remains.  According to the indictment, van der Sloot managed to obtain $25,000 from Beth Holloway under false pretenses. He supposedly used this money to finance his trip to Peru for a poker tournament where he ultimately crossed paths with Stephany Flores and committed his subsequent crimes.  The extradition possibility mentioned in the article implies that while van der Sloot has now served his sentence in Peru for Flores' murder, there may still be legal consequences waiting for him in the United States regarding the charges related to wire fraud and extortion. If extradited and found guilty, he would face prosecution for those offenses as well.  The controversial nature of this case stems not only from van der Sloot's involvement but also due to his prior connection with Natalee Holloway. Back in 2005, when she went missing during a trip to Aruba, van der Sloot was one of the last people seen with her. However, despite suspicions and extensive media coverage surrounding him at that time, no concrete evidence was ever presented linking him directly or conclusively implicating him in her disappearance.  Van der Sloot had been detained twice during investigations into Natalee Holloway's case but was never officially charged. This lack of formal legal repercussions despite public opinion finding him guilty led some individuals following the story over several years blaming authorities for their inability or failure to bring justice for Holloway.  On another note mentioned in this article is Alabama Probate Judge Alan King signing an order declaring Natalee legally dead roughly six and a half years after she vanished. This declaration is both symbolic and practical, as it allows her family to pursue matters related to her estate and brings a sense of closure for them, acknowledging the high likelihood that Natalee Holloway lost her life.  While this news article provides details about van der Sloot's crimes, trial proceedings in Peru, and his potential extradition possibility, it is important to remember that these events occurred within the context of separate cases. The murder of Stephany Flores in Peru has been adjudicated independently of any involvement or resolution concerning Natalee Holloway's disappearance.  In conclusion, the article gives an account of Joran van der Sloot's criminal actions resulting in his expulsion from Peru after serving his sentence for murder. It also highlights the unresolved case surrounding Natalee Holloway and van der Sloot's connection to it while hinting at potential legal consequences he may face if extradited to the United States.",explain
"This news article discusses the arrest of several individuals who were allegedly involved in a plot to smuggle Saadi Gadhafi, son of the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, and his family into Mexico. The plot was uncovered by Mexican intelligence on September 6th and led to the subsequent arrests of Canadian consultant Cynthia Ann Vanier, Mexican Gabriela Davila Huerta o Cueto, Dane Pierre Christian Flemsborg, and Mexican Jose Luis Kennedy Prieto.  According to Mexican Interior Minister Alejandro Poire, intelligence agents were able to track down Cynthia Ann Vanier as the leader of this smuggling ring. Vanier was in direct contact with the Gadhafi family and responsible for coordinating their entry into Mexico. She was arrested on November 10th. The day after her arrest, authorities also apprehended Gabriela Davila Huerta o Cueto who had been tasked with obtaining false documents for the operation. Pierre Christian Flemsborg, a Danish citizen responsible for logistical arrangements, was also arrested on November 11th. Another individual named Jose Luis Kennedy Prieto assisted in obtaining fake identities and documents.  The suspects face charges including falsifying documents and opening bank accounts under false identities. Poire revealed that if successful, Saadi Gadhafi would have entered Mexico using aliases such as Daniel Bejar Hanan, Amira Sayed Nader, Moah Bejar Sayed, and Sofia Bejar Sayed.  Saadi Gadhafi himself remains in Niger since fleeing Libya earlier this year when his father's regime collapsed. Initially offering to negotiate an end to the war with rebels in Libya after Tripoli fell under rebel control - he later seemed to change his mind.  Saadi Gadhafi's lawyer Nick Kaufman denies any attempt by his client to disregard international restrictions placed upon him since escaping from Libya where he faced grave danger.  The revelation of this alleged plot appears linked to an investigation conducted by the Canadian newspaper National Post. The newspaper had spoken with Gary Peters, CEO of Can/Aust Security and Investigations International, who claimed involvement in the plan to move Saadi Gadhafi and his family to Mexico with the approval of the Mexican government. However, Mexico contradicted this version and made its own allegations.  The Canadian government affirmed that a Canadian national had been arrested in connection with this case, and consular officials were providing assistance as required.  Saadi Gadhafi is known for his involvement in football as he ran the Libyan Football Federation before political unrest erupted. He also played soccer for Perugia in Italy for a season. Leaked US diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks mention scuffle-like incidents between Saadi Gadhafi and European police authorities.  Moammar Gadhafi was killed on October 20th during the conflict in Libya. Another son of his, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, was captured by Libyan rebels after a gun battle in the desert. It is believed that he was also attempting to make his way to Niger - where he would be protected from prosecution by Libya's National Transitional Council (NTC) as President Mahamadou Issoufou previously approved asylum for him.  However, the NTC strongly criticized Niger's position since they have issued an arrest warrant against Saif al-Islam for alleged crimes against humanity.  In conclusion, this news article covers an alleged plot involving Cynthia Ann Vanier and several other individuals who aimed to smuggle Saadi Gadhafi and his family into Mexico using false identities and documents. The arrests were made following Mexican intelligence detection of the plan earlier this year.",explain

"The news article is about the aftermath of a controversial operation called ""Fast and Furious"" that took place during the Obama administration. In this operation, guns were intentionally allowed to be sold to suspected criminals with the hope of tracking them to larger criminal organizations. However, many of these guns were lost or ended up at crime scenes.  Attorney General Eric Holder spoke at a hearing and expressed his concerns about the lasting effects of this operation, as guns from Fast and Furious continue to be linked to crimes in both the US and Mexico. He defended his own actions by stating that he had called for an investigation into the operation and issued a directive stating that such tactics should not be repeated. The results of this investigation are expected later in the year.  Holder did not take direct responsibility for the flawed operation but expressed regret for not being alerted about a similar previous operation called ""Wide Receiver"" under the Bush administration. Republican Senator Charles Grassley criticized Holder for failing to enforce laws effectively, saying that laws are ineffective if those responsible for enforcing them refuse to do their duty.  The article also mentions Grassley's questioning regarding who leaked a sensitive document related to a whistleblower's allegations about gun-walking. Though Holder initially refused to answer, it was later revealed that former U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke had leaked the document.  Despite these disagreements, Holder called for congressional cooperation in strengthening ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) authority and funding in order to combat illegal gun trafficking.  Senator Patrick Leahy expressed support for Holder during his hearing by highlighting successes under his leadership but also raised questions about Operation Wide Receiver during George W.Bush's administration which faced similar issues with weapons moving beyond ATF control.  The article concludes by mentioning that Holder is likely going face more hostile questioning next month when he testifies before a House panel with Republican Darrell Issa leading it.  In summary, this news article discusses Attorney General Eric Holder's defense and acknowledgement of issues regarding the controversial Operation Fast and Furious. It also highlights criticisms from Republican senators, the leak of a sensitive document, and calls for cooperation to address illegal gun trafficking. The article discusses the ongoing controversy surrounding Operation Fast and Furious and its implications for the Department of Justice, particularly Attorney General Eric Holder. It presents contrasting views from lawmakers and highlights the blame game being played between political parties.  Holder, while defending his actions, acknowledges that guns lost during this operation continue to show up at crime scenes in both the US and Mexico. This admission sends a message that efforts to stop illegal gun flow into Mexico have been ineffective, leading to serious consequences in terms of crime.  Republican Senator Charles Grassley criticizes Holder for not taking responsibility for the flawed operation and accuses him of failing to enforce laws properly. Grassley believes that no matter how many laws are passed if those responsible for enforcing them shirk their duties. This criticism reflects growing frustration among lawmakers regarding the handling of Operation Fast and Furious.  The article highlights a particularly significant development during the hearing when Grassley questions Holder about who leaked a sensitive document related to a whistleblower's allegations against gun-walking practices. Initially reluctant to answer, it is later revealed that former U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke leaked the document. The leak raises concerns about transparency within government agencies.  Holder uses his appearance before Congress as an opportunity not only to defend himself but also advocate for strengthening ATF authority in detecting and disrupting illegal gun trafficking. He calls for full funding support to combat gun-running effectively, showing a determination towards ensuring an improvement in future operations.  Senator Patrick Leahy supports Holder by reciting successes achieved under his leadership at the Justice Department but also raises concerns over Operation Wide Receiver during the Bush administration where hundreds of weapons went beyond ATF control into Mexico and Arizona. Leahy suggests investigating this previous operation as well, possibly redirecting some blame away from Holder towards past administrations.  The article concludes by noting that Holder will face even more challenging questioning next month when he testifies before a House panel chaired by Republican Darrell Issa—a situation anticipated with greater hostility given Issa's control over the questioning. This sets the stage for further interrogation and potential controversies surrounding Operation Fast and Furious.  Overall, the article focuses on the aftermath and implications of Operation Fast and Furious, including Holder's defense, criticisms from Republican lawmakers, document leaks, calls for cooperation to combat illegal gun trafficking, questions about past operations under different administrations, and an insight into upcoming congressional hearings.

"This news article discusses the importance of eating strategically when it comes to consuming desserts and sweets. It highlights some positive changes made by major companies, such as cereal brands reducing sugar content, the milk industry lowering sugar in chocolate milk served in schools, and Walmart aiming for less added sugar in select foods. The article also mentions that there is a role for sugar in our diet and that enjoying life is part of being healthy.  The genetic aspect of having a sweet tooth is discussed, with researchers finding two sweet-receptor genes that can predict a preference for sweets. The American Heart Association recommends most women consume no more than 24 grams of added sugar per day, which roughly equals six teaspoons or 100 calories. However, the average American woman consumes around 18 teaspoons daily.  The article warns that sugar can be hidden in various foods like salad dressing and crackers, which can easily push individuals past their recommended daily intake. It advises readers to read labels carefully and look for low- or no-sugar options if there are sweeteners listed prominently.  Sugar's negative effects are also highlighted, with the AHA linking it to obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Consuming excess sugar can cause fat buildup in the liver leading to these problems. However, naturally occurring sugars found in fruits, vegetables, and low- or nonfat dairy are not as concerning because they come with essential vitamins and minerals along with water and fiber that slow down the release of sugars into the bloodstream.  The article addresses misconceptions about ""natural"" sugars like raw cane sugar or agave nectar stating that they are not necessarily better alternatives due to their composition. Some sweeteners like raw honey may contain trace nutrients but ultimately have similar calorie content as white table sugar or even more calories.  Calorie-free sweeteners (like stevia) receive approval from FDA as safe alternatives because they do not cause blood-sugar spikes or weight gain like regular table sugar does. The article also mentions that as a nutritional biologist, one of the professionals interviewed uses calorie-free sweeteners to avoid extra calories.  In summary, the article emphasizes the need for strategic and mindful consumption of sugar and desserts. It encourages individuals to be aware of added sugars in their diets, read labels diligently, and opt for low- or no-sugar options when possible. It also acknowledges that naturally occurring sugars in fruits, vegetables, and low- or nonfat dairy are generally healthier choices due to accompanying vitamins, minerals, water, and fiber. The use of calorie-free sweeteners is deemed safe by experts as they do not cause blood-sugar spikes or weight gain like regular sugar does. The article provides a balanced perspective on sugar consumption, acknowledging that while sugar is an important part of our lives and can be enjoyed in moderation, excessive intake can lead to various health issues. It highlights the role of added sugars in obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, providing readers with valuable information about the potential risks associated with overconsumption.  Moreover, the article emphasizes the importance of reading food labels to identify hidden sources of added sugars. It mentions common aliases for sugar such as high-fructose corn syrup and fruit juice concentrate and encourages readers to choose brands that offer low- or no-sugar alternatives. This advice allows individuals to make informed decisions about their sugar intake and take control of their health.  Additionally, there is a discussion about the genetic aspect of having a sweet tooth. By identifying two sweet-receptor genes that predict a preference for sweets, researchers have shed light on why some people may have a stronger desire for sugary foods than others. This information adds depth to the conversation surrounding sugar consumption by recognizing that individual differences exist.  The article also addresses misconceptions around ""natural"" sugars like agave nectar or raw cane sugar. While these options might seem healthier due to their natural origin, they are not necessarily better choices as they still contain similar calorie content or even more calories compared to regular table sugar. This clarifies any confusion individuals may have had about alternative sweeteners.  Furthermore, calorie-free sweeteners such as stevia are deemed safe by regulatory bodies like the FDA. The article reassures readers that using these artificial sweeteners does not lead to blood-sugar spikes or weight gain commonly associated with regular table sugar consumption. These alternatives provide individuals with options for satisfying their cravings without negatively impacting their health goals.  In conclusion, this news article serves as an educational piece aimed at improving readers' understanding of strategic dessert consumption and managing their overall intake of added sugars. By exploring topics such as genetic predispositions towards sugar preferences, recommendations from health organizations, hidden sources of added sugars, and the safety of calorie-free sweeteners, the article equips individuals with the knowledge needed to make better choices when it comes to their sugar consumption.",explain
"The news article discusses an incident involving Uber, a ride-sharing company, and its executive Emil Michael. During a dinner attended by influential technology figures, Michael suggested that Uber should use its vast amount of consumer data to investigate Sarah Lacey, the founder of Pando, a Silicon Valley news site. Lacey has been critical of Uber and its CEO for their alleged misogynistic behavior.  Michael proposed spending money to hire a team of researchers and journalists to delve into Lacey's personal and family life. This idea was leaked by Buzzfeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith after the dinner, leading to widespread outrage in the tech community.  Many people condemned Michael's behavior and called for him to be fired. However, despite the public backlash and popular opinion against him, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote an unapologetic Twitter ""apology"" defending Michael and refusing to dismiss him from his position.

The director of the cartoon, Deng Jianglei, explains that his company, Shenzhen Qianheng Cultural Communication Company, won a tender to create this animation as part of an initiative by Xinjiang authorities to raise awareness about Uyghur folk customs and encourage cross-cultural communication.  Deng and his colleagues were inspired by the natural beauty and rich culture they experienced during their visit to Xinjiang in June. They wanted to help promote and preserve these cultures through their animation project.  However, there are challenges in appealing to both Han Chinese and Uyghur audiences. For example, it was difficult to find a composer who was familiar with both Han Chinese and Uyghur musical traditions when selecting someone for composing the theme song. Additionally, there are alternative interpretations of the story behind Princess Fragrant - while many Chinese see her as a symbol of national unity; some modern Uyghur interpretations portray her as an imperial sex slave who meets tragic fate after rejecting advances from the emperor.  Despite these challenges, Deng wants the animated series not only to be entertaining but also fulfill political needs. He believes it is significant for children's education and teaching them acceptance towards different cultures. The collaboration between Deng's company and Kashgar government plans on showing this cartoon not only within China but also abroad, especially in Islamic regions.  Xinjiang has had a long history of ethnic unrest with tensions between Han Chinese and Uyghurs. Some Uyghurs feel resentment towards Han Chinese due to perceived discrimination from security forces as well as lack of economic opportunities. In response, Chinese authorities have launched anti-terror campaigns and implemented measures to end the violence. However, they also recognize the importance of soft power and passing on positive energy to counter extremist ideologies.  The creation of ""Princess Fragrant"" faced difficulties, even among the animators themselves. Some conservative Xinjiang artists objected to the use of animal characters in the cartoon due to negative connotations associated with certain creatures based on Islamic traditions. Additionally, Uyghur families rarely own pets. Deng believes that it's important to find a compromise between respecting history and culture while catering to market demands.  In conclusion, this news article highlights the production of an animated series called ""Princess Fragrant"" aiming to promote cross-cultural communication and social harmony in China's Xinjiang region. Despite challenges faced in appealing to different audiences and cultural sensitivities, the creators hope this animation will help educate children about acceptance towards diversity while also boosting positive energy in efforts against extremism. The creation of the animated series ""Princess Fragrant"" is part of a larger campaign by Xinjiang authorities to promote social harmony and bridge the gap between different ethnic groups in China. Xinjiang, which shares borders with eight countries and is the size of Iran, has a diverse population consisting primarily of Han Chinese and Uyghurs.  The region has experienced ethnic tensions and sporadic violence in recent years. Some Uyghurs feel marginalized and discriminated against by the Han Chinese majority, leading to resentment and occasional acts of violence perpetrated by extremist groups. In response, Chinese authorities have implemented strict security measures to curb terrorism, including executing convicted terrorists and banning Islamic dress in some areas.  However, alongside these security measures, the promotion of soft power through cultural initiatives like ""Princess Fragrant"" aims to tackle the root causes of unrest. By showcasing a cartoon that promotes cross-cultural understanding and acceptance between Han Chinese and Uyghur communities, authorities hope to foster unity, reduce prejudice, and dispel misconceptions.  Deng Jianglei's animation company won a tender last year for creating this 3-D animation project. During their visit to Xinjiang in June, Deng and his colleagues were captivated by its natural beauty as well as its rich cultural heritage. They recognized that while Xinjiang's economy may be less developed compared to other regions in China, its cultural diversity could be harnessed as a valuable asset.  However, finding common ground between Han Chinese traditions and Uyghur culture proved challenging during the production process. The selection of a composer who was familiar with both musical traditions took over a year due to difficulties reconciling these two styles. Additionally,Listenzonenot possible..Then there was also debate among animators about whether or not animal characters should be included due topictorialconnotations associated with certain creatures accordingislamic law practices.conservativeXinjiang artistssome expressed objectionsartebeconcerned  The decision to include animal characters ultimately went forward but highlights the delicate balance that must be struck between respecting cultural sensitivities and appealing to a broader audience.  Deng emphasizes that beyond entertaining audiences, this animation aims to fulfill political needs by promoting friendship and understanding between Han Chinese and Uyghurs. The hope is that by educating children about different cultures through ""Princess Fragrant,"" they will grow to be more accepting of diversity.  The collaboration between Deng's company and the Kashgar government further emphasizes their commitment to showcasing this cartoon within China as well as abroad, especially in Islamic regions. They aim to use soft power initiatives like ""Princess Fragrant"" as a means of countering extremist ideologies, spreading positive energy, and fostering harmony among diverse communities.  In conclusion, ""Princess Fragrant"" represents a significant effort by Xinjiang authorities to promote cross-cultural communication and social harmony within the region. By creating an animated series that bridges the gap between Han Chinese and Uyghur cultures, they seek to address ethnic tensions and promote unity while countering extremist narratives.

"This news article discusses the case of Haleigh Cox, a young girl who suffered from seizures until she began using cannabis oil as a treatment. Haleigh's condition improved significantly after starting the regimen, and she was able to reduce her dependence on another medication that was causing damage to her liver. She even started walking and talking for the first time. However, the Cox family had to move from their home in Georgia to Colorado in order to access medical marijuana legally.  The article introduces a bill being introduced in Congress that could potentially change federal law regarding medical marijuana use. The bill aims to amend the Controlled Substances Act to exempt plants with low levels of THC (the chemical component that produces a high) from being considered illegal. If this bill is passed, it would be the first time federal law permits any form of medical marijuana use.  The bill has been named the Charlotte's Web Medical Hemp Act of 2014 after another young girl named Charlotte Figi who successfully controlled her seizures with CBD oil derived from cannabis plants with minimal THC content. Similar strains have gained attention and demand because of their reported effectiveness in treating seizures.  The article also mentions critics who argue against using marijuana as treatment due to lack of evidence supporting its efficacy for seizure control. They mention clinical trials testing a pharmaceutical version called Epidiolex but note that many children are unable to get into these trials either due to exclusion criteria or long waiting periods.  Currently, 23 states and DC have laws allowing some form of medical marijuana use, but at the federal level, it remains illegal for any purpose. This conflict between state and federal laws creates challenges for patients who rely on medical marijuana but cannot travel across state lines with it.  The article explains that research into potential medical uses for marijuana is limited due to restrictions imposed by current legislation and regulations citing its Schedule I classification as having ""no currently accepted medical use."" However, recent memos from the Justice Department state that targeting individual medical marijuana users is not a priority for federal prosecutors, and large commercial operations are only targeted on a case-by-case basis.  The Food and Drug Administration is also conducting a review to determine if looser treatment of marijuana is warranted, although no specific timeline is mentioned.  In summary, the article highlights Haleigh Cox's positive response to cannabis oil treatment and the potential impact of a new bill that could legalize certain low-THC strains. It also mentions the challenges faced by patients who cannot access clinical trials or travel with medical marijuana due to conflicting state and federal laws. The article continues by discussing the broader context of medical marijuana in the United States. It mentions that this year alone, 11 states have passed legislation to loosen regulations on cannabis strains with high cannabidiol (CBD) and low THC content. This shift in public opinion and state laws has created a more favorable environment for the bill introduced by Rep. Scott Perry to gain support.  The bill is expected to receive overwhelming support once members of Congress and their staff are educated about its contents. Advocates argue that if this bill passes, it would demonstrate recognition of marijuana's potential medical benefits.  The article introduces critics who believe alternative treatments should be pursued rather than medical marijuana, citing a lack of evidence for its efficacy in treating seizures. Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, insists that anecdotal stories should not form the basis for medical decisions without published studies to support them.  However, parents like Mark Knecht argue that there are limited options available for their children's treatment apart from pharmaceutical clinical trials. Many families are desperate for immediate relief for their children who suffer from seizures but cannot access Epidiolex trials due to exclusion criteria or extensive waiting periods.  Currently, federal law classifies marijuana as an illegal substance under the Controlled Substances Act because it has ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" This classification hampers research efforts as well since tight restrictions make conducting studies difficult.  While individual use may not be a priority for prosecution according to memos from the Justice Department, transporting or shipping across state lines poses significant challenges due to federal laws remaining unchanged even as some states rewrite their own regulations regarding medical marijuana.  The article concludes by mentioning that while progress is being made at various levels (state governments passing legislation and Justice Department memos), there is still no definitive timeline from the Food and Drug Administration regarding when they will complete their review on whether looser treatment of marijuana is warranted.  Overall, the article highlights the case of Haleigh Cox and her positive response to medical marijuana treatment, along with the potential impact of Rep. Scott Perry's bill, which could change federal law regarding medical marijuana use. It also showcases the complexities and challenges surrounding medical marijuana due to conflicting state and federal laws, limited research opportunities, and ongoing debates about its effectiveness as a treatment option for various conditions.",explain
"This news article discusses the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the use of stolen passports by two individuals on the flight. The flight, carrying more than 200 passengers, disappeared from radar on Saturday and has not been seen or heard from since.  Interpol identified the men using stolen passports as Pouri Nourmohammadi and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, both Iranians. Malaysian police believe Nourmohammadi was attempting to emigrate to Germany using a stolen Austrian passport. The men entered Malaysia on February 28 with valid Iranian passports.  Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble expressed concern that only a few countries worldwide are taking precautions to ensure that individuals with stolen passports are not able to board international flights. Prior to Flight 370's departure, no country had checked the stolen passports against Interpol's list since they were added in 2012 and 2013.  The article highlights that while countries have access to Interpol's data, many governments do not routinely check passports against the database. In fact, in 2013 passengers were able to board planes more than a billion times without their travel documents being checked against Interpol's data.  Despite initial concerns about terrorism related to the use of stolen passports on Flight 370, Interpol head Ronald K. Noble stated that there is no evidence suggesting a terrorist connection at this time. It is common for people to travel with stolen or fake passports for reasons unrelated to terrorism such as illegal immigration or smuggling goods.  Interpol does not charge countries for access to its databases; however, some member countries may lack the resources or technical capacity necessary for accessing this information.  The article mentions that Austria and Italy reported their respective passport thefts in Thailand in previous years, highlighting Thailand as a market for stolen passports. However, it is noted that not all lost passports are necessarily considered stolen - some may have been sold by the holder or replaced at an embassy with a routine ""lost passport"" report.  As part of the investigation into Flight 370, authorities are reviewing video and documentation to identify not only the individuals who used the stolen passports but also how these illegal passports cleared security. Thailand's Prime Minister stated that the country is cooperating with Interpol in this investigation.  Interpol's Secretary General urges governments and airlines worldwide to adopt routine checks against its lost and stolen document database in light of this tragic incident. The article goes on to highlight the importance of checking passports against Interpol's lost and stolen document database. Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database was created in 2002 after the September 11, 2001 attacks to assist countries in securing their borders. Since then, it has grown significantly, with over 40 million entries and more than 800 million searches per year.  Countries like the United States, United Kingdom, and United Arab Emirates have been actively searching the database millions of times annually. However, access to this database is not universal among all countries due to factors such as technical capacity or resources.  The article also mentions that Customs and Border Protection in the United States conducts thorough checks through the Advanced Passenger Information System for any issues of concern when travelers are booked on flights to or from or heading through the United States. This review includes reports of stolen documents.  Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble expressed his hope that governments and airlines around the world would learn from this tragedy and implement routine passport checks against Interpol's lost and stolen document database for all passengers as a security measure.  The focus then shifts back to Flight 370 itself. The search for true identities of those who used these stolen passports on board Flight 370 was underway, with Malaysian authorities cooperating with Interpol in their investigation. The article does not provide any further information about other aspects related to flight operations or potential leads regarding its disappearance.  In summary, this news article discusses how two individuals traveling on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 used stolen passports, raising concerns about security measures surrounding travel documentation worldwide. It highlights that though there is no evidence suggesting terrorism at this time, it emphasizes the need for more comprehensive checks against Interpol's databases by governments and airlines alike as a precautionary measure against illegal activities involving travel documents.

"The news article discusses the creation of a working gun using a 3-D printer. The gun, called the Liberator, was made using a Stratasys Dimension SST printer, which is available for purchase online at a relatively low cost. The man behind this project is Cody Wilson, who posted a video of himself firing the gun on YouTube.  Wilson's group, known as the Wiki Weapon Project, has been working on creating plastic parts for firearms for about a year. However, this is the first time they have been able to build an entire weapon. The Liberator consists of 16 interchangeable pieces and uses a nail as its firing pin. The barrel can be changed to accommodate different types of ammunition.  These developments have ignited concerns about 3-D printed guns falling into the wrong hands and bypassing metal detectors due to their plastic composition. Several politicians are advocating for stricter legislation to ban firearms created through 3-D printing technology. New York Senator Charles Schumer is particularly vocal in supporting such measures because he fears that anyone, including criminals and terrorists, could set up their own gun factory using this technology.  Congressman Steve Israel of New York has also introduced legislation to renew an expiring ban on plastic guns with hopes of preventing criminals and terrorists from smuggling them onto airplanes through metal detectors.  Despite these concerns and calls for stricter regulations, Cody Wilson remains passionate about his project as he sees it as an important symbolic statement against government control over access to objects like guns. Defense Distributed (the group behind the Liberator) even sells components named after politicians who advocate gun control measures to further express their ideology.  Interestingly enough, Defense Distributed legally obtained a federal firearm license in March that allows them to manufacture arms legally despite potential risks associated with their creation being used by criminals or individuals with malicious intentions.  Defense Distributed plans on expanding its range of ammunition that can be used with 3-D printed guns and aims to make these weapons printable using more affordable printers like the Replicator 2 by Makerbot.  In conclusion, the news article highlights the creation of a functional gun through 3-D printing technology. This development has raised concerns about its accessibility to criminals and potential risks associated with bypassing metal detectors. Various politicians are advocating for stricter legislation, while Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed see their project as a symbolic statement against government control over personal access to objects like guns. The creation of a working gun using a 3-D printer has sparked a heated debate around the world. On one side, there are those who argue that these 3-D printed guns pose significant risks and should be subject to stricter regulations, while on the other side, supporters emphasize personal freedoms and the potential of this technology.  Critics express concerns about the accessibility and potential misuse of 3-D printed guns. They fear that individuals with criminal intentions could easily obtain these weapons without going through background checks or facing any legal barriers. Moreover, their plastic composition makes them undetectable by traditional metal detectors, which raises serious safety concerns in places like airports or public facilities.  To address these concerns, politicians such as Senator Schumer and Congressman Israel have called for more stringent legislation to ban firearms created with 3-D printers. They argue that such measures would not only prevent criminals from obtaining these weapons but also raise public awareness about the risks associated with unrestricted access to this technology. Schumer emphasizes that anyone – including felons or terrorists – could potentially set up their own gun factory using 3-D printing technology if it remains unregulated.  However, Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed take an opposing stance on government regulation. They see their project as an embodiment of personal liberty and individual empowerment in future manufacturing technologies. For Wilson, it is crucial to make a political statement challenging governmental control over access to objects like guns.  Despite acknowledging that his creation could be used harmfully by criminals, Wilson argues for the importance of putting this technology out there as an exercise in preserving freedom: ""I think that liberty in the end is a better interest.""  Defense Distributed had even obtained a federal firearm license earlier this year, making them legally authorized gun manufacturers despite widespread concern regarding potential misuse.  The article also sheds light on some technical details of the Liberator gun itself. With its design comprising 16 interchangeable pieces and using unconventional materials like nails instead of proper firing pins, it showcases the group's ability to create an entire firearm using 3-D printing technology. They also highlight the potential for further development, like expanding the range of ammunition usable in 3-D printed guns and making them compatible with more affordable printers.  In summary, this news article explores the creation of a functional gun using a 3-D printer and delves into the ensuing debate between supporters emphasizing personal freedoms and critics concerned about public safety risks. The article presents arguments from both sides, highlighting calls for stricter regulations from politicians while also detailing Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed's perspective on individual liberties. Overall, this development has ignited discussions regarding responsible use of emerging technologies and their potential impact on society.",explain
"This news article discusses the uncertain fate of Comet ISON, as well as its impact and significance. According to scientists, it is still unknown whether any significant part of the comet remains intact.  The first point highlighted in the article is that despite initial assumptions that Comet ISON was destroyed, further confirmation is needed from telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope. A scientist named Battams states that while it seems unlikely anything substantial remains, observations from telescopes would provide clarity.  NASA also mentions that there might be a small chance of a new, smaller version of Comet ISON being hidden by dust. They state that up to 90% of ISON was destroyed, leaving approximately 10% intact. However, they require observations from multiple telescopes before confirming its status.  Regarding what to call ISON now, Battams suggests referring to it as a ""comet remnant."" While there isn't an official term yet, this seems appropriate given the current situation.  Although ISON may not have lived up to expectations as a ""Great Comet"" or ""Comet of the Century,"" it gained significant attention on social media and provided scientists with valuable data. Matthew Knight cites its success in terms of public engagement via social media and high website traffic for NASA's observing campaign dedicated to studying ISON.

"This news article discusses Google's revenue generation through its email service, Gmail. The article explains that one of the ways Google makes money from Gmail is by automatically scanning and indexing emails to display relevant ads to users. Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, states that the premise of Gmail is to provide a robust email service in exchange for displaying ads alongside emails and scanning them to determine the most relevant advertisements.  The scanning process involves looking for keywords that identify topics discussed in emails based on factors such as frequency and context. For example, a conversation about meeting up for a spinning class might trigger an ad for a weight-loss product. The data collected through email scanning can also be used to create user profiles for future ad targeting.  The article highlights that many consumers may not fully consider the extent of information sharing when using free email services such as Gmail. Companies like Google can create comprehensive profiles of each user based on information collected from various products such as search history, maps usage, email content, and their social network activity on Google+. Behnam Dayanim, a partner at Paul Hastings LLP law firm in Washington advises people to understand the value they bring to any free service and what information they are sharing.  The article also mentions that all major email providers like Microsoft Outlook and Yahoo benefit from offering free services in different ways. This can include showing general or targeted ads, building marketing leads or brand recognition.  While targeted advertising based on user data has become the primary business model for many tech companies like Facebook and Bing search engine, it has also led to privacy lawsuits against several companies including LinkedIn, Yahoo, and Facebook itself. Any company collecting personal information must disclose what they are doing with customer data and comply with privacy laws.  Google's approach towards customer data has faced legal scrutiny too. When Gmail was launched in 2004 with contextual ads displayed alongside emails threads matching their topic was upfront about its intention without charging users anything directly. However, some non-Gmail users who sent emails to Gmail accounts filed a class-action lawsuit against Google, arguing that they had not agreed to Google's privacy policy. Google responded by stating that the plaintiffs did not have any expectation of privacy when sending emails to Gmail users.  The article mentions that the privacy landscape has significantly changed over the years with stricter laws and regulations regarding personal information. State laws and Federal Trade Commission have been actively pursuing privacy violations, leading to industry-wide best practices being adopted for data sharing.  Lastly, the article highlights that a federal law called the Electronics Communication Privacy Act, passed in 1986 before cloud-based email era, has a considerable impact on how companies can share data with third parties. There have been calls from legislators and technology companies including Google for updating this law to align it with current times.  In conclusion, this news article sheds light on Google's revenue generation strategy through Gmail by scanning emails for targeted advertising purposes. It also discusses the importance of understanding data sharing when using free email services and highlights the evolving legal landscape surrounding user privacy rights and data protection.

"This news article discusses the phenomenon of the yartsa gunbu harvest in Nepal's Dolpa district, where thousands of people flock every year to search for this highly prized caterpillar fungus. The article highlights the economic potential and environmental concerns surrounding this informal industry.  The article begins by describing the scene of people gathering to witness a woman who has discovered a specimen of yartsa gunbu. Using an ice pick, she digs a hole and sifts out the specimen, prompting speculation about its value. It is revealed that middlemen offer around $3 for such specimens and then sell them in markets in Tibet at three times that price.  The market value of yartsa gunbu has increased significantly over the years, with experts stating that top-quality specimens can sell for up to tens of thousands of dollars in Tibet or Shanghai. This creates an incentive for many people from rural areas with low annual incomes to migrate to Dolpa district in search of wealth.  The commercialization and demand for yartsa gunbu as an elixir or aphrodisiac have led to its labeling as ""Himalayan Viagra."" This has further driven up demand and market value worldwide. However, this influx of harvesters raises concerns about environmental impacts, including deforestation and habitat destruction due to excessive digging.  Local residents are also feeling the effects on their livelihoods. The increased number of harvesters is depleting grasslands necessary for their livestock's survival. Furthermore, there are worries about over-harvesting leading to fewer fungal spores for future seasons.  In response to these challenges, some communities have implemented taxation systems on harvesters aimed at controlling numbers and protecting the environment. However, there are doubts about their effectiveness as it may actually heighten perceptions of value and attract more people.  Daniel Winkler, an expert on Himalayan caterpillar fungus, emphasizes that sustainable resource conservation requires education regarding fungal reproduction and establishing limits on the collection season. Cooperation between village, district, and national leaders is also essential for conservation efforts.  The article concludes by acknowledging the economic benefits of the yartsa gunbu industry but highlights the importance of balancing it with long-term sustainability. The challenge lies in finding ways to ensure its preservation for future generations while addressing environmental concerns and promoting responsible harvesting practices.  Overall, this news article provides insights into the yartsa gunbu harvest in Nepal's Dolpa district and emphasizes the need for sustainable resource management to protect both natural ecosystems and local livelihoods. The article further explores the impact of the yartsa gunbu harvest on Nepal's rural economy. Many people, attracted by rumors of riches, are willing to travel long distances in search of this valuable fungus. The economic potential is significant, especially considering that the average annual income in Nepal's rural mid-and-far-western hills is only $283.  However, as more and more people join the harvest each year, concerns about environmental degradation intensify. The hills and grasslands are being torn up from excessive digging, leading to fears that they will turn into deserts within a year. Local residents have witnessed firsthand how their yaks suffer due to depleted grass caused by over-harvesting.  To address these issues, some communities have implemented taxation systems on harvesters. Locals are charged a lower fee compared to outsiders in an attempt to control the number of people participating in the harvest and generate funds for environmental protection measures. However, there is debate over whether this system effectively limits participation or inadvertently increases demand due to perceptions of higher value.  Daniel Winkler, an ecologist and geographer specializing in Himalayan caterpillar fungus, emphasizes education as a key factor in promoting sustainable resource conservation. By increasing knowledge about fungal reproduction and establishing an end-date for the collection season, sufficient spore dispersal can be ensured for future sustainability.  Cooperation between leaders at various levels is crucial for effective conservation efforts. This includes collaboration between village residents, district officials, and national authorities who must work together to find balance between economic gains from yartsa gunbu harvesting and long-term environmental preservation.  Despite its challenges and environmental concerns raised by experts like Winkler and local residents like Gyalpo Thandin (a student from Dolpa), there is no denying that this informal industry helps buoy rural economies within Nepal. The lure of quick wealth has led thousands of people each year to migrate temporarily for harvesting purposes. However, ensuring the long-term viability of this industry will require careful consideration of its impact on the environment and the establishment of sustainable harvesting practices.  In conclusion, the yartsa gunbu harvest in Nepal's Dolpa district presents a complex situation with both economic benefits and environmental challenges. While it promises financial opportunities for rural communities, over-harvesting and habitat destruction pose threats to both local ecosystems and livelihoods. Striking a balance between economic gains and ecological preservation requires education, cooperation between leaders, and responsible resource management practices. Only through these measures can Nepal's yartsa gunbu industry be sustained for future generations.",explain

"Title: Wife of Suspected Child Murderer Defends Husband's Mental State  In a recent news article, it was reported that law enforcement authorities executed a search warrant at the New Jersey residence of Rosemary Hernandez and her husband, Pedro Hernandez. The search took place from Wednesday afternoon until 3 a.m. Thursday and aimed to discover evidence related to Pedro's alleged involvement in the 1979 disappearance and murder of Etan Patz, a six-year-old boy. Rosemary's attorney, Robert Gottlieb, asserted that his client was unaware of the purpose behind the search.  During the search, authorities found satchels containing personal items belonging to Rosemary Hernandez; however, no specific details were provided as to their contents or relevance to the case. It was highlighted that Rosemary cooperated fully with investigators throughout their endeavor. Prior to commencing the search in her home, an assistant prosecutor reached out to Rosemary through her attorney requesting her presence for assistance. She promptly arrived at her home shortly after receiving this call.  Gottlieb shared that his client believes Pedro's confession is unreliable due to his mental illness history and continued questioning of his mental state. Pedro Hernandez has been diagnosed with various mental disorders and is currently receiving medication called olanzapine used for treating symptoms of schizophrenia according to a source familiar with his medical history.  Pedro allegedly confessed choking Etan Patz after luring him into a basement in May 1979; however, no physical remains have been found yet. Gottlieb did not elaborate on specific details about Pedro's mental disorders but attested that Mrs. Hernandez had observed her husband experiencing delusions, hallucinations, along with other symptoms over an extended period.  Law enforcement officials have been focusing on collecting evidence supporting Pedro's statements regarding Etan Patz but have not uncovered any additional proof or motive thus far apart from their suspect’s confession.  A relative of Hernandez stated she had reported his involvement in the murder to authorities in the 1980s, but her claims were dismissed. However, police have indicated that they do not have a record of this report. Additionally, Pedro supposedly confided in a prayer group about killing a boy. Rosemary's frustration with the case, along with her desire to ensure that prosecutors appreciate the severity and nature of Pedro's mental illnesses prompted her decision to seek legal representation.  Rosemary Hernandez has not been able to visit her husband at Bellevue Hospital but has maintained communication with him over the phone. According to Gottlieb, this situation has been immensely challenging for both Rosemary and their daughter.  Pedro Hernandez is scheduled for his next court appearance on June 25th while prosecutors continue working towards building a solid case against him. As of now, no official comment has been made by the district attorney's office regarding the search or Pedro's mental health status.  In conclusion, this news article highlights an ongoing investigation into Pedro Hernandez's alleged involvement in Etan Patz's disappearance and murder from over four decades ago. Rosemary Hernandez firmly asserts that her husband’s confession is unreliable due to his extensive history of mental illness and questions surrounding his mental state during interrogation. The authorities' search at their New Jersey residence sought evidence supporting Pedro’s statements but did not disclose any significant findings related to Etan Patz’s case or motive behind it.",explain
"This news article is a commentary written by LZ Granderson. Granderson criticizes the Republican presidential candidates, particularly Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, for what he perceives as pandering and making ridiculous statements during their campaigns. He highlights instances where they made comments that seemed disconnected from reality or were perceived as insincere.  The author argues that the GOP's attacks on President Obama have become incredible and reflects negatively on the intelligence of the country. He mentions how some voters may be gullible enough to appreciate certain comments made by Rick Santorum, such as calling Obama a snob for promoting college education, but points out that Santorum himself has benefitted from attending universities.  Granderson expresses his disappointment with Santorum's criticism of higher education while benefiting from it. He also criticizes Santorum for expressing disgust towards John F. Kennedy's speech supporting the separation of church and state.  The author suggests that instead of pushing each other closer to idiocy, the candidates should focus on convincing voters with their ideas and policies. Granderson believes that this approach may hurt the GOP's chances in the general election.  The article concludes by stating that many people have already lost faith in these candidates due to their statements and actions during the campaign. The author claims not to be surprised anymore by what comes out of their mouths and expects more exaggerated remarks in the future.  It is important to note that this article represents LZ Granderson’s personal opinion rather than objective reporting of facts. In this news article, LZ Granderson continues to criticize the Republican presidential candidates for their campaign tactics and statements. The author argues that the candidates are more focused on appealing to their base and playing to certain ideologies, rather than presenting substantive ideas or policies.  Granderson points out certain instances where the candidates made remarks that he deems as ridiculous or disconnected from reality. He mentions Newt Gingrich invoking George Washington as if he were alive today, Mitt Romney commenting on the height of trees in Michigan, and Rick Santorum vilifying higher education while personally benefiting from it. These examples are seen by the author as pandering to specific audiences without offering meaningful substance.  The author expresses frustration with what he perceives as a dumbing-down of rhetoric in political discourse. Granderson believes that instead of engaging in intellectual debates about policy solutions, the candidates resort to juvenile tactics and exaggerated statements to appeal to voters.  Additionally, Granderson argues that this approach may be detrimental for the Republican Party's chances in the general election. He cites polling data showing President Obama gaining ground among independents since earlier in the campaign when Romney was leading. The author suggests that voters may perceive these comments and tactics as lacking sincerity or intelligence.  Granderson concludes by stating his own lack of surprise at what comes out of these candidates' mouths and predicts even more extreme rhetoric in the future. He asserts that many people have already lost faith in these candidates due to their statements and actions during the campaign.  It is important to reiterate that this news article is an opinion piece by LZ Granderson, expressing his personal views on the Republican presidential candidates' strategies during their campaigns.",explain
"This news article discusses a legal dispute in which the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is being challenged over its regulations on explicit content on broadcast television. The article highlights the arguments presented by both sides and the potential implications of the court's ruling.  The main issue at hand is whether the FCC's regulations on indecency and profanity are too vague and inconsistently applied. The article quotes one person who criticizes the FCC for defining what is indecent in an arbitrary manner. However, Chief Justice John Roberts argues that the government simply wants a few channels where explicit language and nudity are not allowed, as there are already numerous programming choices available on broadcast, cable, and satellite TV.  The case specifically involves an episode of ABC's ""NYPD Blue"" in which a naked woman was shown. The Justice Department provided a DVD of this episode as evidence for their appeal against the FCC's actions against ABC. ABC's lawyer argues that they were taken aback by the FCC's sudden strict action against them.  In recent years, there have been instances of controversial words and images appearing on major networks such as ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox. These incidents prompted concerns about explicit content on public airwaves, leading to discussions about establishing clearer guidelines regarding what can be considered acceptable.  Previous cases involving celebrities like Bono using expletives during live shows or Nicole Richie making vulgar comments have also contributed to this ongoing debate. The Supreme Court had previously ruled that regulators had authority to clamp down on isolated cases of profanity but did not address whether these regulations violated free speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.  One argument raised during oral arguments was whether radio and TV networks should be treated differently from cable and satellite providers in terms of regulating content. Despite most people having access to cable or satellite TV, it was pointed out that there are still millions with only broadcast television access who need protection from potentially offensive material.  Ultimately, this case has wider implications for the interpretation of the First Amendment and the FCC's authority over regulating explicit content on public airwaves. The court's ruling, expected in a few months' time, will determine whether the FCC's regulations are constitutional or need to be revised.  In conclusion, this news article covers a legal dispute between the FCC and major television networks regarding regulations on explicit content. The arguments presented focus on issues of arbitrariness, inconsistency in applying regulations, and free speech rights. The court's decision will have significant implications for how explicit content is controlled on broadcast television in the future. The article further delves into the arguments made by both sides in the case. The networks argue that there is a level of uncertainty surrounding what is considered indecent or acceptable due to the FCC's inconsistent application of regulations. They point out instances where profanity and nudity were allowed in certain movies aired on broadcast television but fined stations for other content that was deemed indecent.  Chief Justice Roberts raises an interesting point about context, stating that people, including children, understand that certain situations may warrant the use of explicit language, such as when someone accidentally hurts themselves. He questions whether it would be appropriate for the government to regulate all instances of language usage without considering the real-life circumstances.  Another issue brought up during arguments is whether there should be a distinction between broadcast television and cable/satellite programming regarding content regulation. While most households have access to cable or satellite TV, it is argued that broadcasting remains popular and reaches a significant portion of viewership who may require additional protection from explicit material.  Justice Kennedy raises the question as to why broadcast media should have stricter standards when there are so many alternative viewing options available. However, it is countered by pointing out that not everyone can distinguish between channels on cable and those broadcast over-the-airwaves.  The article concludes by highlighting how this case will have broader implications for First Amendment rights and freedom of speech on public airwaves. It notes that previous cases only addressed enforcement power rather than constitutionality issues related to regulations on explicit content.  Ultimately, this legal dispute raises important questions about what defines indecency in broadcasting and how regulations should be applied consistently across major television networks. The court's ruling will determine if current FCC regulations are constitutional or if revisions need to be made to strike a balance between protecting sensitive viewers while respecting free speech rights.

"""It was our way of escaping reality, the poverty, and just dreaming,"" Abedi continues. ""We didn't need TV or fancy equipment to enjoy the beautiful game.""  As Abedi describes his humble beginnings, it becomes evident that his passion for football was ingrained in him from an early age. Growing up in a large family with limited resources meant that he had to make the most of what he had. And what he had was an unwavering determination and love for football.  With no formal training or access to professional coaching, Abedi relied on his natural talent and street football matches to hone his skills. Every spare moment was devoted to playing with friends on makeshift fields and practicing drills they improvised themselves.  Despite facing numerous challenges ranging from inadequate facilities to discouraging social norms that questioned the viability of a career in sports, Abedi's perseverance never wavered. He knew deep down that football held immense potential not only for personal success but also as a means of uplifting his entire community out of poverty.  Through sheer resilience and unwavering dedication, Abedi caught the attention of scouts from local youth academies who recognized his exceptional talent. This opportunity opened doors for him beyond anything he could have imagined growing up without electricity or proper infrastructure.  Joining one club after another within Ghana's domestic league proved instrumental in shaping Abedi into the athlete we know today. His unmatched technique combined with unbreakable mental fortitude garnered admiration from teammates, rivals, and fans alike.  But it wasn't until European clubs came knocking on Abdul's door that he truly began making waves on an international stage. Recognized as one of Africa's brightest talents, Abebi seized opportunities offered by Europe's top competitions such as France's Ligue 1 while donning jerseys for clubs like Marseille and Lille.  Meanwhile back home in Ghana news spread like wildfire whenever Abebi appeared on television screens during international tournaments representing both club and country playing alongside the likes of Michel Platini and Diego Maradona.  Abedi's success transcended the sport itself. He inspired a generation of young Africans who, like him, grew up in disadvantaged circumstances but dared to dream big. Reflecting on the journey from his modest village to worldwide acclaim, Abedi is grateful for every step along the way.  ""I never imagined that football would take me this far,"" he says with a smile. ""But I am proud to have represented my country and continent on such grand stages.""  Today, long after retiring from professional football, Abedi continues to give back to his community through philanthropic efforts aimed at providing opportunities for young athletes like himself. His focus remains on empowering others through education and sports as vehicles for social change.  Indeed, Abedi Ayew's story is a testament to the transformative power of passion and resilience -- a reminder that greatness can emerge from even the humblest beginnings. From not knowing who Pele was as a child playing behind modest windows in a small Ghanaian village to becoming one of Africa's greatest football legends, he has shown us that dreams can indeed transcend barriers and create infinite possibilities.",continue
"Petro Poroshenko's victory in the Ukrainian presidential election marked a significant turning point in the tumultuous landscape of Ukrainian politics. As a billionaire and seasoned politician, Poroshenko brought with him a wealth of experience and resources that positioned him as a capable leader to guide Ukraine through its current difficulties.  With preliminary exit polls indicating that Poroshenko had secured 56% of the vote, it was clear that he had garnered broad support from the Ukrainian people. Despite facing stiff competition from Yulia Tymoshenko, who conceded after exit polls showed her with only 13% of the vote, Poroshenko's victory demonstrated his ability to connect with voters on both personal and political levels.  Poroshenko's success is partly attributed to his appeal as an entrepreneur. His business ventures in the confectionery industry earned him the nickname ""Chocolate King,"" endearing him to many Ukrainians who saw his success as evidence of his shrewdness and competence. This business acumen also allowed him to finance his own election campaign, providing him with independence from other political factions and strengthening his position as a unifying figure.  The fact that Ukraine held elections amidst ongoing violence in the east further emphasized Ukrainians' determination for change. Pro-Russia separatists' threats to disrupt voting did not deter citizens from exercising their democratic rights. Instead, their commitment showcased their desire for stability and unity in this divided nation.  Ukraine faced enormous challenges at this critical juncture in its history. The Russian annexation of Crimea had caused upheaval within Ukraine, exacerbating long-standing tensions between pro-Russian factions and those seeking closer ties with Europe. Moreover, violent clashes between government forces and separatist fighters destabilized regions such as Donetsk and Luhansk.  Poroshenko prioritized addressing these issues head-on. He advocated for increased dialogue between Ukraine's different ethnic groups while also pursuing diplomatic channels for resolving conflicts externally. His vision centered around a future where Ukraine regained control over its territories and solidified its place as an independent, democratic nation.  Bringing about this vision, however, would not be an easy task. Poroshenko recognized that restoring peace and securing the country's territorial integrity required support from international allies. He immediately embarked on diplomatic initiatives to build alliances with Western countries and gain their backing in countering Russian aggression.  Furthermore, Poroshenko understood the importance of strengthening ties within Ukraine itself. He sought to bridge divides between different regions by promoting economic development across the country. His background as a successful businessman provided him with unique insight into fostering growth and job creation, which he believed would serve as a catalyst for unity amongst Ukrainians.  Throughout his campaign, Poroshenko acknowledged that achieving stability in Ukraine would require sacrifices from all sides involved. He stressed the need for compromise and urged citizens to rally behind him in rebuilding their nation torn apart by conflict.  As Poroshenko assumed office amidst high expectations from both domestic and international communities, he faced immense pressure to deliver on his promises swiftly and effectively. The road ahead was daunting, but Ukrainians were hopeful that their new leader would steer them towards a brighter future of peace, prosperity, and unity. If anyone had the potential to navigate these challenging times successfully – it was Petro Poroshenko – a man whose entrepreneurial spirit had taken him from confectionery success to leading a nation through one of its most critical moments in history.",continue
"The 2012 election was a heated battle between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, with both candidates using bumper sticker slogans to simplify complex issues and appeal to voters. Romney's bumper sticker slogan, ""Detroit DID go bankrupt. Russia IS a geopolitical foe,"" highlights his stance on the auto industry bailout and foreign policy.  Romney's statement about Detroit going bankrupt referred to his belief that the government should not have provided financial assistance to the struggling car industry. He argued that allowing companies like General Motors to go through bankruptcy would have been a better solution because it would force them to restructure and become more competitive. Democrats, however, saw this as an attack on American jobs and accused Romney of being out of touch with working-class Americans.  Similarly, Romney's assertion that Russia is a geopolitical foe was aimed at highlighting President Obama's perceived weakness in dealing with foreign adversaries. During the campaign, Russia had recently invaded Ukraine, leading many Republicans to criticize Obama for not taking stronger action against Putin's aggression. Democrats criticized Romney for being stuck in a Cold War mentality and failing to understand the complexities of modern-day international relations.  While these slogans may catch attention on bumper stickers or in campaign speeches, they oversimplify complex issues. The reality is that Detroit did receive government assistance through loans and bankruptcy proceedings which helped stabilize the industry and preserve jobs. On the other hand, labeling Russia as solely an enemy oversimplifies its role as both a competitor and potential partner on key global challenges such as nuclear proliferation or counterterrorism efforts.  But political campaigns thrive on sound bites rather than nuanced explanations. Joe Biden's ""Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive!"" slogan effectively encapsulated two significant achievements of President Obama's first term: The successful military operation against Bin Laden in Pakistan and the subsequent revival of GM after it emerged from bankruptcy restructuring.  By juxtaposing these two achievements together in a catchy phrase, Biden highlighted both national security accomplishments (Bin Laden's death) and economic progress (GM's recovery). This slogan appealed to voters by linking Obama's leadership to concrete outcomes, while also attempting to discredit Romney's position on the auto industry bailout.  It is important to recognize that bumper sticker slogans do not provide comprehensive solutions or nuanced policy positions. They serve as shorthand for complex ideas in a political landscape where attention spans are short and messaging must be concise. While they may be effective in rallying support, they often lack the depth necessary for informed decision-making.  Ultimately, bumper sticker slogans are just one tool used in the political arena to capture attention and sway public opinion. They can simplify complex issues but should never be relied upon as a sole source of information or analysis. It is up to voters and citizens to delve deeper into the complexities of policy debates and make informed decisions based on a variety of sources and perspectives. So, while catchy slogans may have their place in campaigns, it is crucial for individuals to think critically beyond the surface-level messaging.",continue
"Mariam Yehya Ibrahim's case has gained international attention and sparked outrage from human rights organizations and religious leaders around the world. Her story is seen as a symbol of the ongoing struggle for religious freedom in Sudan. Supporters have rallied behind Mariam, advocating for her release and challenging Sudanese authorities to uphold basic human rights.  The case has put a spotlight on Sudan's legal system, which employs Sharia law as the basis for its judicial decisions. Under Sharia law, apostasy is considered a crime punishable by death. However, critics argue that this violates international standards of religious freedom and freedom of conscience.  Since Mariam's sentencing last month, her husband Daniel Wani has been tirelessly working to save his wife's life. He believes that the appeals court offers their best chance at overturning the death sentence and securing Mariam's release.  Daniel received formal notification from the court on Thursday that they had begun deliberating Mariam's case. This development brings hope to both him and supporters around the world who have been following Mariam's story closely.  Numerous petitions have circulated online calling for Mariam's release while protests have taken place outside Sudanese embassies worldwide. World leaders like US President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Pope Francis, and countless others have publicly condemned her sentence.  The case also serves as an opportunity for reflection within Sudan itself about issues of religious tolerance and protection of minority rights. It exposes divisions within society between those who advocate for strict adherence to Islamic law without question versus those who yearn for a more inclusive society where individuals are free to choose their own faith.  However, there remains significant resistance within certain segments of Sudanese society towards change or any compromise when it comes to matters related to religion or cultural practices. Advocates like Wani face an uphill battle against conservative forces that cling stubbornly to traditional interpretations of Islam.  While the outcome still hangs in balance awaiting final deliberations from the appeals court, Mariam's case has already had a powerful impact on attitudes towards religious freedom and human rights in Sudan. It has brought renewed attention to the country's legal system and sparked discussions about potential reforms to ensure greater protection for minority groups.  Regardless of the ultimate outcome of Mariam's appeal, her case has highlighted the importance of continuing efforts both within Sudan and internationally to challenge religious persecution and campaign for universal human rights.  The international community must not forget individuals like Mariam who find themselves trapped in oppressive legal systems. It is crucial that governments around the world speak out against religious discrimination and actively push for change in countries where such injustices occur.  Mariam Yehya Ibrahim's case represents a microcosm of larger global struggles for freedom of religion and belief. Her courage in standing firm despite facing a death sentence reflects the indomitable spirit that propels individuals to fight against tyranny even at great personal risk.  As deliberations continue, hope remains that justice will prevail, not only for Mariam but also as an example setter for future cases concerning religious freedom around the world.",continue
"Hundreds of couples descended upon the county clerk's office, their faces beaming with excitement and anticipation. They had been waiting for this moment, fighting for their right to marry the person they loved, regardless of gender. The atmosphere was electric, filled with a sense of celebration and victory.  As same-sex couples lined up outside the office, they couldn't help but reflect on the journey that brought them to this historic day. For years, they had faced discrimination and inequality simply because of whom they loved. They had watched as other states granted them the right to marry one by one, leaving Utah as one of the last holdouts.  But today was different. Today was a day for love to triumph over prejudice.  Inside the clerk's office, clerks worked tirelessly to process marriage licenses as quickly as possible. The air buzzed with excitement and nervous energy as couples eagerly awaited their turn. Some held hands tightly while others whispered loving words of encouragement.  Karen and Sarah stood near the front of the line. They had been together for ten years and had never dreamed that this day would come in their home state. Tears welled up in Karen's eyes as she turned to Sarah and said softly, ""Can you believe it? We're finally getting married.""  The doors opened promptly at 8:00 am, and cheers erupted from those waiting outside as a couple emerged hand in hand—newlyweds legally recognized by both federal law and now their home state law too.  The joy spread like wildfire through social media channels leading more hopeful souls who longed for equality in love's embrace inside those overcrowded offices where dreams were no longer deferred but realized instead.  John stood nervously at his partner Tom's side; he could hardly believe his luck when he saw John reach into his pocket before getting down on one knee—the ring sparkling under fluorescent lights inside that dimly lit room filled with equal parts anticipation (and elation).  One by one, couples exchanged vows, sealing their commitment with a kiss—a kiss that symbolized not only their love for each other but also the progress of an entire movement. The love and happiness radiated from those newly married couples as they left the clerk's office, clutching their marriage licenses tightly to their chests.  Outside, the crowd had swelled into a sea of rainbow flags and colorful banners celebrating this momentous occasion. Strangers embraced each other with tears streaming down their faces. It was a powerful reminder that love knows no boundaries and that hope can overcome even the biggest obstacles.  As news of Utah's embrace of marriage equality spread across the nation, supporters rejoiced while critics silently took note. This ruling was more than just a legal victory—it was a testament to human rights and freedom; it was an affirmation that progress is possible in even the most unlikely places.  The joyful mayhem in Salt Lake City that Friday night marked not only a turning point for same-sex couples in Utah but also for everyone fighting for equality worldwide. It showed that love will always be stronger than hate, and when given the chance to shine through, it can illuminate hearts and minds with its power.  As same-sex couples continued to marry in Utah over subsequent days and weeks, they became pioneers—trailblazers who paved the way for future generations to live authentically as their true selves. Their courage would ripple out beyond state borders—inspiring change nationally and internationally.  In time, more states would fall in line alongside Utah—a united front standing up against discrimination—until one day no person would ever have to fight for something as basic as marrying someone they loved again. And on that day we would look back at this joyful mayhem—the tears shed and hearts bursting—and know it had all been worth it.",continue
"The invasion of Iraq in 2003 marked a turning point not only for the people of Iraq but for the entire world. As a member of the United Nations inspection team, I had witnessed firsthand the escalating tensions and looming threat of war. The phone call requesting our withdrawal was not unexpected, but it carried an undeniable weight that left me feeling hollow.  We had dedicated ourselves to our mission, diligently searching for any evidence of weapons of mass destruction. Our job was entrusted to us by the U.N. Security Council, and we took it seriously. We were making progress too - contrary to popular belief at the time - as Iraqi officials cooperated and provided access to suspected sites.  But everything changed when allied forces invaded on that fateful day in March. Our peaceful presence was abruptly replaced by a massive military occupation. It wasn't just a few hundred unarmed U.N inspectors anymore; it was hundreds of thousands of soldiers armed with weapons to enforce their will upon an already vulnerable nation.  The cost swiftly became evident as lives were lost and suffering grew exponentially under this new regime. The promise they made about finding weapons turned out to be unfounded, leaving many questioning if this invasion was truly justified. Innocent civilians bore the brunt of the chaos and violence that ensued in what seemed like an endless cycle without any clear resolution or exit strategy.  As I reflect on those times now, my heart aches for Iraqis who endured immense hardship during those years under occupation. Families torn apart, neighborhoods demolished, essential infrastructure destroyed – all in pursuit of elusive goals that remained unattained despite countless sacrifices made.  The repercussions extended far beyond borders and affected global security dynamics deeply entrenched within regions adjacent to Iraq as well as those further away from its shores. The resultant power vacuum created fertile ground for sectarian strife and extremist ideologies that continue to plague not just Iraq but also neighboring countries even today.  Looking back now with hindsight, it is painfully clear how the war in Iraq was a grave miscalculation. The consequences of this ill-fated decision are still felt today, with Iraq struggling to rebuild and stabilize itself as it faces relentless challenges on multiple fronts.  In the aftermath, lessons must be learned from this tragic chapter in history. Diplomacy and dialogue need to be prioritized over military might, fostering understanding and cooperation instead of perpetuating violence. The U.N., through multilateralism, should play a more significant role in preventing conflicts and resolving disputes through peaceful means.  As for myself and my fellow U.N. inspectors, we continued our work elsewhere, dedicated to promoting peace while honoring our commitment to the principles upon which the United Nations is founded: respect for sovereignty, non-aggression, and upholding international law.  The invasion of Iraq taught us that there are no easy solutions or quick fixes when it comes to global conflicts. It is imperative that we strive for genuine collaboration among nations based on trust, empathy, and a shared vision of peace if we are ever to prevent another tragedy like the one witnessed in Iraq from repeating itself again elsewhere in the world.",continue

While the development of drug-resistant bacteria is a well-known issue, there is another concerning outcome: the depletion of our own beneficial bacteria.  Our bodies are home to trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as our microbiota or microbiome. These tiny organisms play an essential role in maintaining our overall health and wellbeing. They aid in digestion, produce vitamins, support our immune system, and even regulate mood and brain function. A diverse and balanced microbiome is crucial for optimal functioning.  However, the constant onslaught of antibiotics has disrupted this delicate ecosystem within us. Antibiotics act indiscriminately against both harmful and beneficial bacteria, wiping out vast numbers with each course prescribed. Each time we take antibiotics, we not only kill off the intended target but also harm the friendly microbes that reside within us.  The depletion of these friendly bacteria weakens our defense against future infections. As they suffer losses from successive rounds of antibiotic treatment over time, their populations dwindle until they reach critically low levels or vanish altogether in some individuals. With fewer good bacteria to protect us, we become more vulnerable to infections caused by pathogens that would typically be kept at bay by a thriving microbiome.  Furthermore, these depleted microbial communities can no longer perform their crucial functions effectively. Digestive problems may arise as food is not properly broken down or absorbed due to diminished bacterial assistance. Our immune systems may struggle to identify threats accurately without the guidance of microbial signals often present in a healthy gut environment.  Beyond individual health implications lie significant global concerns as well. The hyperconnected nature of today's world allows for rapid spread and transmission of diseases across countries and continents before any effective response can occur - evident during recent pandemics like COVID-19. If we continue depleting our internal defenses through indiscriminate antibiotic use, we risk facing future plagues that could sweep across populations unhindered.  Picture a highly contagious pathogen that harbors antibiotic resistance. If our collective protection has been compromised due to the depletion of friendly bacteria, this pathogen would find optimal conditions to spread rapidly from person to person without any natural barriers. Our ability to control and contain such outbreaks could be severely hampered, leading to devastating consequences.  It is essential for us to recognize the long-term consequences of our current antibiotic usage habits. While antibiotics are undoubtedly valuable tools in treating bacterial infections, we must use them judiciously and limit unnecessary prescriptions. Additionally, efforts should focus on developing alternative therapies that do not disrupt the delicate balance of our microbiota or accelerating research towards targeted treatments that only eliminate harmful bacteria while sparing beneficial ones.  By safeguarding the diversity and abundance of our friendly bacteria within us, we can enhance our resilience against potential future plagues or outbreaks with unknown boundaries. It is time for both individuals and healthcare systems worldwide to prioritize preserving this vital aspect of human health as we navigate through an increasingly interconnected world.",continue
"In his response to President Obama's State of the Union address, Senator Marco Rubio highlighted his concern over the negative impact the president's proposals could have on middle-class citizens. Rubio believed that Obama saw a free enterprise economy as being responsible for problems, rather than a solution.  Rubio firmly emphasized that his opposition to Obama's plans did not stem from a desire to protect the wealthy but was driven by his desire to protect and support everyday Americans. His speech aimed to convey that he understood and empathized with the struggles faced by ordinary people in their daily lives.  As a popular and potential presidential candidate, Rubio's selection by the Republican Party was seen as strategic. Time Magazine even labeled him ""The Republican Savior,"" showcasing both his rising stardom within the party and their hopes for him as a future leader.  During his rebuttal, Senator Rand Paul also spoke on behalf of conservative tea party members, providing an additional perspective opposed to President Obama's policies. The diverse representation in response highlighted Republican concerns about government intervention in economic matters.  Rubio's focus on protecting middle-class citizens aligned with conservative values emphasizing individual liberty and limited government involvement in markets. He argued that true economic growth came from empowering individuals rather than relying heavily on government initiatives.  Highlighting this point, Rubio expressed support for simplifying tax codes and reducing business regulations as measures needed for fostering economic growth. His vision imagined an environment where small businesses could thrive without being burdened by excessive red tape or high taxes.  Additionally, Rubio encouraged investments in education reform that would equip Americans with skills relevant to modern industries while promoting school choice initiatives allowing parents more control over their children's education options.  The senator also touched upon immigration during his speech—a topic close to home given his Cuban heritage—in which he advocated for comprehensive immigration reform. He sought balance between keeping America secure while offering opportunities for those seeking better lives through legal means of immigration.  Throughout his address, Marco Rubio projected an image of a compassionate leader committed to representing and protecting the interests of ordinary Americans. His speech resonated with many who saw his ideas as offering solutions that would directly benefit their lives.  However, critics argued that Rubio's response failed to address pressing issues in enough depth, including the growing wealth gap and income inequality. Despite this criticism, Rubio's performance further boosted his status within the Republican Party and strengthened speculation about his potential bid for higher office.  Ultimately, Rubio's rebuttal exemplified the contrasting ideologies shaping American politics. While President Obama focused on government intervention as a means to address social and economic challenges, Republicans like Rubio advocated for less government interference and a robust free market system as the key solution. Rubio's rebuttal also underscored the broader ideological differences between the two major political parties in the United States. While Obama and his supporters believed in a more interventionist role for government to address societal issues, Rubio and many conservatives championed limited government intervention, individual freedoms, and personal responsibility.  The Republican response to Obama's State of the Union address highlighted their commitment to fiscal conservatism as well. Rubio expressed concern about the national debt and criticized excessive government spending. He argued that reducing unnecessary expenditures would help alleviate financial burdens on the middle class while fostering a healthier economy.  In addition to fiscal restraint, Rubio emphasized the importance of American energy independence. He called for an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy policy that would promote domestic production while exploring alternative sources of energy such as natural gas, solar power, and nuclear energy. Rubio believed that prioritizing American energy resources would not only create jobs but also reduce dependence on foreign countries.  Another central aspect of Rubio's speech was his emphasis on American exceptionalism—the notion that America is a unique nation with unparalleled opportunities for its citizens. He praised America as being different from other countries because it offered individuals freedom and unlimited possibilities to achieve success through hard work.  Rubio also highlighted examples of personal success stories within immigrant communities to emphasize his belief in equal opportunities for all Americans regardless of their background or heritage. This message resonated with many conservatives who believed in promoting individual initiatives over government redistribution programs.  Overall, Marco Rubio's response aimed at advancing conservative principles while appealing directly to middle-class Americans who might have felt left behind by Obama's policies. By positioning himself as a champion for everyday citizens against what he portrayed as misguided government interventions, Rubio sought to bolster his standing within his party and lay down markers for future political ambitions.  In conclusion, Senator Marco Rubio delivered a counterargument against President Obama's State of the Union address by challenging the perception that free enterprise was responsible for societal problems rather than being a solution. Rubio's emphasis on protecting middle-class citizens, reducing government interference, and fostering economic growth through individual empowerment showcased the core values of the Republican Party. His speech solidified his position as a rising star within the party and added fuel to speculation about his presidential ambitions. While both parties offered different approaches to addressing societal challenges, Rubio's response represented conservative perspectives aiming for limited government involvement and promoting personal responsibility as foundations for progress in America.",continue

"""He told me that he was against same-sex marriage, but he also understood the need to respect and support all individuals,"" Marquez recalled. ""He urged me to meet with him and other members of the Catholic Church to have an open dialogue about the issue.""  Marquez, a prominent gay rights activist in Argentina, was taken aback by this unexpected invitation. He had spent years fighting for equal rights for the LGBTQ+ community and had faced opposition from many religious leaders. But here was Bergoglio, reaching out to engage in a genuine conversation.  The meeting took place in a humble room within the archbishop's residence. As Marquez entered, he couldn't help but notice how different it felt from his previous encounters with Catholic officials. There were no grand gestures or proclamations; instead, there was an authentic desire to understand one another's perspectives.  ""We sat down together and spoke openly about our beliefs,"" Marquez recounted. ""Bergoglio acknowledged that while he considered marriage as between a man and a woman according to church doctrine, he recognized the complexity of modern society.""  Throughout their discussions, Bergoglio emphasized the importance of compassion and empathy towards all individuals, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. He shared stories of encounters with people struggling with their sexual orientation or gender identity within his own congregations.  ""They are children of God deserving love and understanding,"" Bergoglio expressed during one particularly heartfelt moment of their conversation.  Marquez left that meeting feeling hopeful—the encounter had exceeded all expectations. While they may not have completely seen eye-to-eye on same-sex marriage itself, they managed to find common ground on empathy towards marginalized communities.  In subsequent years following their initial meeting, Marcelo Marquez witnessed Pope Francis' continued commitment to fostering inclusion within the Catholic Church. The pontiff made headlines worldwide when asked about homosexuality during an interview in 2013: ""Who am I to judge?""  These words marked a significant departure from the rhetoric often associated with religious leaders, and it resonated deeply with LGBTQ+ individuals worldwide. Pope Francis went on to advocate for greater tolerance and acceptance within Catholic communities, urging followers to embrace the inherent dignity of all human beings.  Marcelo Marquez witnessed firsthand the transformative power of dialogue. The experience taught him that change is possible even in contexts where it seems improbable. It also highlighted the vital role of courageous individuals who are willing to engage in sincere conversations, challenging long-held beliefs and bridging divides.  In retrospect, Marquez realizes that their meeting was not just about same-sex marriage; it was a stepping stone towards a more inclusive future within the Catholic Church and society at large. While there is still work to be done, he remains hopeful that dialogue can continue breaking down barriers and building bridges between diverse perspectives.  The story of Marcelo Marquez's encounter with Pope Francis serves as an inspiring reminder that empathy and understanding have the power to transcend differences. In a world often marked by polarization and animosity, their conversation offers hope—for both LGBTQ+ rights advocates seeking acceptance within religious communities and for anyone striving for more inclusive societies.  Ultimately, it reveals the potential for growth when willingness exists on both sides—to listen without judgment, find shared values rooted in compassion, and move forward together towards a more compassionate world.",continue
"The introduction of the National Identity Smart Card, or NeID, in Nigeria has sparked a conversation about what it truly means to be Nigerian. With its versatile capabilities and convenient features, the card symbolizes a new era of technological advancement and progress for the country.  Nigeria, with its population exceeding 200 million people, faces numerous challenges in terms of social and economic development. One major obstacle is the lack of access to banking services for a significant portion of the population. Opening a bank account requires proof of identity, which many Nigerians struggle to obtain. The NeID card aims to address this issue by providing a means for individuals to establish their identity easily.  By utilizing cutting-edge technology from MasterCard, the NeID card not only serves as an identification document but also enables electronic payments. This innovation marks a significant step forward for financial inclusion in Nigeria. With the ability to deposit funds into their accounts using this card, Nigerians gain access to financial services previously out of reach.  Additionally, receiving social benefits becomes more efficient with this integrated system. Government aid programs can now utilize electronic platforms that transfer funds directly onto NeID cards held by beneficiaries. This eliminates intermediaries and ensures that resources reach those who need them most efficiently.  Moreover, merchants across the country are adapting their payment systems to accept transactions made through these smart cards. In an increasingly digital world driven by convenience and efficiency, this development enhances Nigeria's participation in global commerce while promoting cashless transactions within the country.  However exciting these advancements may be, some concerns have arisen regarding data privacy and security. Given that personal information will be stored on these smart cards' embedded chips and shared electronically during each transaction or interaction with government agencies or private companies authorized by cardholders themselves; safeguarding user privacy becomes paramount importance.

"In his second inaugural address, President Obama spoke of the importance of turning lofty ideals into tangible realities for every American. He emphasized that it was the task of his generation to make these rights and values, such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, a true and accessible experience for all.  Throughout his first term in office, President Obama had championed various social justice movements. He had pushed for healthcare reform with the Affordable Care Act, aimed at providing affordable healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured Americans. He had also fought for marriage equality by supporting the legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide.  However, as Obama began his second term, there were those who questioned whether he would be able to follow through on his promises. Some believed that he had fallen short on certain issues or compromised too much in order to navigate a divided Congress. Now with a fresh start and renewed energy in his inaugural address, he sought to inspire hope and bridge any gaps between what was said before and what could be accomplished moving forward.  President Obama acknowledged that progress might not always come quickly or easily but insisted that it was worth pursuing nonetheless. He understood that change often faced resistance but urged Americans not to lose faith in their collective power to shape a better future together.  Having already witnessed Obama's leadership style during his first term allowed many observers to approach this renewed commitment with skepticism. They remembered moments where compromises were made or where promises seemed unfulfilled. It became crucial for them to assess whether this inauguration speech held genuine intentions or merely served as political lip service.  As President Obama continued speaking during this historical moment on Capitol Hill, some listened intently while reflecting on both past achievements and missed opportunities from the previous four years. They wondered if he could truly overcome these challenges and be an agent for transformative change once again.  At times like these when expectations are high yet tempered by experience,  it is essential not just to scrutinize words spoken but also actions taken. President Obama's vision for social justice had always been a driving force, but now it was up to him to prove that his words were more than just rhetoric.  As the nation tackled pressing issues such as income inequality, racial injustice, and climate change, many Americans yearned for their president to be unwavering in his commitment and resolute in his actions. They hoped that this second term would bring about a new era of progress and harmony guided by principles of equal opportunity and empathy for all.  In conclusion, a second inaugural address may lack the novelty and excitement of the first but brings with it the wisdom gained from previous experiences. President Obama understood the weight of public expectations as he embarked on his final four years in office. His speech resonated with those who believed in progress and social justice while also reminding skeptics to hold him accountable for turning these ideals into reality. The success or failure of his promises would ultimately be judged not just by words spoken on inauguration day but by tangible results achieved throughout his second term.",continue
"The controversial remarks made by Toru Hashimoto, the Mayor of Osaka, regarding the issue of comfort women during World War II have caused a wave of criticism and condemnation both domestically and internationally. Japanese officials moved quickly to distance themselves from his comments, stating that they do not reflect the official stance of the government.  Hashimoto's assertion that comfort women were ""necessary"" for soldiers risking their lives reveals a disturbing lack of empathy and understanding for the thousands of women who were victimized during this dark period in history. The term ""comfort women"" refers to women who were coerced or forcibly taken from their homes across Asia and made to work as sex slaves for Japanese troops. These women endured unimaginable suffering, ranging from physical abuse to psychological trauma, as they were subjected to horrific conditions in brothels established by the Japanese military.  The international community has long recognized these actions as a grave violation of human rights and war crimes. Japan issued an official apology in 1993 acknowledging its responsibility for creating such circumstances. However, Hashimoto's comments make it clear that there are still individuals within Japan who either deny or downplay these atrocities.  Moreover, Hashimoto's attempt to justify his remarks by claiming that other countries also used prostitutes during wartime is a poor excuse at best. While it is true that various governments throughout history have engaged in similar practices, it does not absolve Japan from its role or responsibility in perpetrating these acts against humanity.  Hashimoto's suggestion during his visit to an American military base on Okinawa that U.S. personnel should utilize Japan's adult entertainment industry further exemplifies his misjudgment regarding this sensitive issue. Such a statement not only trivializes the pain experienced by comfort women but also demonstrates a lack of respect for human dignity.  The reactions within Japan have been swift and fierce. Many civil society organizations and survivors' groups have condemned Hashimoto's comments as deeply offensive and insensitive towards victims who are still alive today. Protesters have taken to the streets demanding his resignation, and even politicians within his own party have distanced themselves from his remarks.  Internationally, there has also been a strong rebuke of Hashimoto's position. The United Nations and several human rights organizations have called on Japan to address this issue more sincerely and ensure that the victims receive just compensation. It is crucial for Japan not only to offer apologies but also take concrete actions that promote healing, support survivors, and educate future generations about the atrocities committed during World War II.  In conclusion, Toru Hashimoto's comments regarding comfort women represent a gross misinterpretation of history and a failure to acknowledge the profound suffering experienced by these women. It is essential for Japanese officials at all levels to distance themselves from such views and work towards an inclusive society that recognizes past wrongdoings while striving for reconciliation with the affected countries. Only through genuine remorse, education, and efforts towards justice can healing truly begin for both survivors of comfort women atrocities as well as future generations.",continue
"But that's not the America I know. That's not the America I believe in."" President Obama stressed the importance of investing in education, providing quality schools and teachers, and expanding access to affordable college. He acknowledged that this alone would not solve every problem, but it was a crucial starting point.  The President highlighted statistics that showed children from disadvantaged backgrounds faced numerous obstacles on their path to success. They were more likely to grow up in poverty, experience violence in their communities, and face discrimination based on their race or ethnicity. These factors could make them feel trapped and hopeless, limiting their aspirations for a better future.  Obama emphasized that government agencies had a role to play in addressing these issues. He called for increased funding for programs aimed at reducing poverty and improving education in underserved areas. He also stressed the need for stronger gun control measures to prevent further loss of life due to gun violence.  However, he also recognized that solving these problems required collective effort beyond just the government's involvement. Schools needed strong partnerships with families and community organizations to provide comprehensive support for students. Parents needed access to job training programs and opportunities for economic advancement so they could provide stable homes for their children.  The President spoke about the importance of mentorship from trusted individuals within communities who could inspire young people and guide them towards success. Whether it be family members, clergy members or community leaders – everyone had a stake in creating an environment where children could thrive.  President Obama urged young people listening to his speech not to lose hope but instead find strength within themselves and seek out opportunities despite any obstacles they may face. He shared stories of individuals he knew who had grown up under similar circumstances but had managed to overcome adversity through hard work, determination, and support from others.  He ended his speech by calling on all Americans to recognize that investing in the future generation was an investment in the nation itself. The success of these young individuals would determine America's success as a whole. He called for unity and a shared responsibility to create a society where every child had the chance to achieve their full potential.  The President's words resonated with many in the audience and sparked conversations about the inequalities present within their communities. It prompted discussions on what needed to change, how each individual could contribute, and what steps were necessary to bring about lasting improvement.  In the days following this speech, there was renewed energy around addressing issues of poverty, violence, and lack of opportunity. Community organizations launched initiatives aimed at providing mentorship programs, educational resources, and job training opportunities. Businesses stepped up their commitment towards hiring individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The impact of President Obama's words extended far beyond that high school auditorium in Chicago. His call for community-wide support ignited a national conversation about social justice and equality of opportunity. It served as a reminder that every child deserved a chance to climb those ladders of opportunity towards success – regardless of their background or circumstances.  And while progress might not happen overnight, that day marked an important step forward in acknowledging the systemic barriers faced by children from impoverished communities. It reaffirmed America's commitment to creating a fairer society where every young person had an equal shot at achieving their dreams – no matter where they were born or raised",continue
"The report from the Bipartisan Policy Center's Homeland Security Project highlights the growing concern surrounding homegrown militants and their potential to carry out acts of violence within the United States. The case of Mufid Elfgeeh serves as a stark reminder that Americans, influenced by extremist ideologies propagated by groups like al Qaeda and ISIS, can become radicalized and pose a serious threat to national security.  Elfgeeh, an American citizen of Yemeni descent, ran a pizza parlor in Rochester, New York. That seemingly ordinary facade hid a much more sinister agenda. According to the federal indictment against him, Elfgeeh actively sought to provide support to ISIS and even planned an attack on American soldiers. This case is particularly concerning because it demonstrates how individuals with seemingly normal lives can become inspired by terrorist organizations and plot acts of violence on their own soil.  The report goes on to analyze the current threat posed by these homegrown militants and identifies several key factors contributing to their radicalization. One such factor is the ease of access that individuals now have to extremist propaganda through various online platforms. Social media sites act as breeding grounds for radical ideologies where vulnerable individuals are easily swayed towards violence.  Furthermore, social exclusion plays a significant role in pushing these individuals towards extremism. Many feel marginalized within society due to discrimination or societal barriers, leading them down a path where they feel disconnected from mainstream values. Terrorist groups exploit this vulnerability by offering them a sense of belonging and purpose through violent actions against perceived enemies.  The report emphasizes that while there may not be one singular profile for potential homegrown militants, there are certain commonalities among those who become radicalized. They often exhibit signs of social isolation or struggle with personal issues such as unemployment or mental health problems which make them susceptible targets for extremist recruitment efforts.  To address this growing threat effectively, the report offers several recommendations for policymakers and law enforcement agencies. First and foremost is enhancing community engagement efforts aimed at identifying and preventing radicalization. Building strong relationships with diverse communities is crucial in creating channels of communication that can provide early intervention and support for individuals susceptible to extremist ideologies.  Additionally, the report recommends improving intelligence sharing between federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. This collaboration is essential in tracking potential threats and disrupting any planned attacks by homegrown extremists.  Furthermore, countering extremist narratives must be a priority. Efforts should focus on promoting alternative messages that emphasize positive aspects of society while debunking the false promises put forth by terrorist organizations. This includes engaging community leaders, religious figures, and social media platforms to counter online propaganda effectively.  The threat posed by homegrown militants is real and cannot be ignored. The report from the Bipartisan Policy Center's Homeland Security Project provides valuable insights into this pressing issue and offers concrete recommendations for action. By implementing these measures promptly and effectively, it is possible to mitigate the risk posed by individuals radicalized within our own borders while preserving the fundamental principles of liberty and security upon which this nation stands.",continue
"The shocking photos of alleged mass torture in Syria have sent shockwaves throughout the international community and added another layer of difficulty to the already complex task of negotiating peace in the war-torn country. As United Nations-led negotiators prepare for peace talks, these images serve as a grim reminder of the brutalities endured by the Syrian people over the years.  The photos, which were revealed by CNN just a day before the peace talks were set to begin, showcase what is being described as ""industrial killing"" carried out by President Bashar al-Assad's regime. The Syrian opposition group, known as the Syrian Coalition, has called for world leaders to exert pressure on Assad's regime and remove him from power so that Syrians can finally have a chance at building a free and democratic nation.  The release of these images has once again ignited calls for political transition in Syria. Marie Harf, deputy spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, emphasized that these disturbing images only reinforce the urgency of establishing a political transition plan and removing Assad from power. The international community is united in its belief that lasting peace in Syria can only be achieved if Assad steps aside.  However, achieving this goal remains an arduous task. The civil war has waged on for nearly ten years now with no clear end in sight. Military interventions and proxy wars involving various regional and global powers have further complicated efforts to find a viable solution. And while negotiations provide hope for some semblance of resolution, there are significant challenges ahead.  One major obstacle is garnering genuine commitment from all parties involved - whether it be government forces or opposition groups - to engage constructively at the negotiating table. Previous attempts at peace talks have been marred by broken ceasefires and lack of trust between opposing sides.  Another challenge is ensuring representation for all key stakeholders within Syria’s diverse population. The voices of marginalized groups must be heard and respected during negotiations to ensure an inclusive process that addresses their specific concerns and aspirations.  Furthermore, the international community must commit to providing the necessary resources to help rebuild a shattered nation. The Syrian people have endured immeasurable suffering, and any peace agreement must include provisions for humanitarian aid, reconstruction assistance, and support for post-conflict reconciliation.  In addition to tackling these immediate challenges, any long-term solution for Syria must focus on addressing the root causes of the conflict. This includes addressing underlying socio-economic grievances, promoting transitional justice and accountability for war crimes, as well as implementing political reforms that guarantee inclusive governance and protect minority rights.  It is evident that achieving a lasting peace in Syria is an extraordinarily complex task. However, despite the despair caused by these gruesome images of torture, there still remains a glimmer of hope. The fact that negotiations are taking place at all signifies a willingness from all parties involved to seek a political resolution rather than continuing down the path of endless violence.  As negotiators gather in search of common ground in their quest for peace, it is imperative that they remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding human rights and dignity for all Syrians. The release of these shocking photos serves as a sobering reminder that justice must be served and accountability upheld if we are ever to move towards healing and reconciliation in Syria.",continue
"The Mevlevi Order, also known as the Order of the Whirling Dervishes, is a mystical religious group that originated in the 13th century. With their distinctive white robes and cone-shaped hats resembling gravestones, they have captivated both curiosity and controversy. It is not surprising that their spiritual practices have gained attention from both tourists seeking a glimpse into this esoteric world and political authorities questioning its place in society.  At first glance, watching the whirling dervishes perform seems like an exquisite dance. However, it is far more than just an aesthetically pleasing spectacle; it represents a profound spiritual journey. The Mevlevis believe that by spinning in repetitive circles with outstretched arms, they can achieve a state of transcendence where they commune with the divine.  Celaleddin Loras explains that their purpose goes beyond physical existence – it is about shedding one's ego and achieving unity with God even while alive. He describes this as dying before actually dying – letting go of one's sense of self to experience true enlightenment. The symbolism ingrained within their attire reflects this philosophy; wearing white robes resembles shrouds we don when we pass away.  The Mevlevi Order views life as an opportunity for self-refinement and reaching higher levels of consciousness rather than focusing on worldly possessions or achievements. Their devotion to spiritual pursuits has drawn comparisons to secret brotherhoods or ancient mystery schools – organizations obscured from common knowledge yet holding sacred knowledge accessible only to initiates.  It comes as no surprise then that discussions surrounding the Mevlevis often touch on matters beyond spirituality alone. Some politicians question whether such rituals belong in contemporary society or if they undermine conservative values upheld by mainstream religions. Nonetheless, many argue for preserving cultural heritage while acknowledging its significance for historical understanding and tourism appeal.  Tourists flock from all corners of the globe to witness these soul-stirring performances firsthand. For them, the opportunity to witness the Mevlevis' intense spiritual connection and ethereal movements offers a chance to broaden their perspective and delve into mystical traditions. The captivating blend of physical discipline and metaphysical exploration enchants audiences, leaving an indelible impression on their minds and hearts.  Yet, there is a danger in reducing these religious practices solely to tourist attractions. It is crucial to remember that at its core, the Mevlevi Order is a deeply rooted spiritual tradition with profound meaning for its practitioners. Although they welcome outsiders with hospitality and extend invitations to participate in their rituals during public events, these ceremonies are primarily intended for personal devotion rather than mere entertainment.  As societies wrestle with questions of cultural preservation against modern perspectives, finding a harmonious balance becomes essential. Accommodating cultural heritage while honoring the rights and beliefs of different individuals can foster mutual understanding between those who practice ancient traditions like the Mevlevi Order and those who may view them through different lenses.  In embracing diversity within society, it becomes possible for spiritual practices like those of the Mevlevi Order to coexist alongside various belief systems. By engaging in respectful dialogue instead of divisive debates or totalitarian exclusions, we can create spaces where everyone's religious or spiritual pursuits can flourish without impeding progress or causing harm.  The Mevlevis hold steadfastly onto their centuries-old rituals as a conduit for attaining higher realms of consciousness. Whether it be through whirling dances or intricate chants accompanied by traditional instruments, they strive for transcendence amidst an ever-changing world. In their pursuit lies both wisdom to behold within oneself and lessons about tolerance that resonate far beyond this enigmatic order - reminders that beneath our differences lies our shared humanity seeking answers on our respective paths towards meaning.

"Coming into the World Cup slalom finale, Mikaela Shiffrin faced fierce competition from Tina Maze, who had been dominating the skiing world throughout the season. However, Shiffrin showcased her exceptional skills and nerves of steel as she sailed down the challenging course in Lenzerheide.  The pressure was on for both athletes. A win for Maze would have secured her a record-breaking 2,414 points for the season, breaking Hermann Maier's long-standing record set in 2000. Shiffrin not only had to contend with this looming feat but also with her own expectations and ambitions.  As she prepared herself at the starting gate, adrenaline coursing through her veins, Shiffrin took a deep breath and pushed off with conviction. She attacked each turn with precision and fluidity, effortlessly gliding past every gate like a well-oiled machine.  The crowd watched in awe as she continued to navigate through the technical slalom course flawlessly. Her technique appeared effortless yet powerful—a testament to years of arduous training and dedication to her craft.  Meanwhile, Maze was forced to give it her all in an attempt to keep up with Shiffrin. The pressure seemed almost palpable as both skiers raced against time and each other. However, despite giving an admirable performance towards the end of her run, Maze fell short by a mere fraction of a second.  As Mikaela crossed the finish line victorious, emotions flooded over her; relief washed away any residual tension that remained within her body. This win meant more than just securing another title—it was evidence that hard work truly pays off.  Shiffrin's journey toward becoming one of skiing's brightest stars was not without its challenges. The road had been fraught with setbacks—broken bones healed only through countless hours of rehabilitation and mental resilience required after each injury or loss sustained along the way.  But throughout it all, Shiffrin's unwavering determination pushed her forward. She emerged from these trials stronger and more focused, determined to make her mark in the skiing world.  Now, as an 18-year-old standing on the podium with both the World Cup slalom crown and a world championships title to her name, Shiffrin has firmly established herself as one of the planet’s best young skiers.  With each victory, she continues to inspire aspiring athletes worldwide. Her innate talent and relentless work ethic serve as reminders that age is just a number when it comes to achieving greatness.  As she returns to the United States for her television appearance, Shiffrin reflects on her journey so far. She acknowledges that despite her remarkable achievements on the slopes, she remains human—a clumsy one at that.  Nonetheless, it is this humility combined with grace under pressure that endears Shiffrin not only to ski enthusiasts but also to those who may be unfamiliar with the sport. Her ability to excel in moments of adversity resonates deeply with people from all walks of life.  As Mikaela graces television screens across America later today, audiences will witness not just an extraordinary athlete but also a young woman who represents determination and perseverance personified—a true embodiment of what it means to chase dreams against all odds.",continue
"Despite facing criticism and opposition, General Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency (NSA), boldly defended the agency's intelligence-gathering programs during his speech at the Black Hat computer-security conference in Las Vegas. In front of a crowd of hackers and security experts, Alexander revealed that these controversial programs have successfully thwarted 54 terrorist attacks worldwide, with 13 of them being potential threats to United States' national security.  This revelation came as a response to the ongoing debate surrounding the NSA's practices. The programs in question involve collecting phone metadata and online communications data. According to Alexander, these operations aim to identify and prevent potential terrorist activities by analyzing patterns that might raise suspicions.  The programs' existence was brought into public consciousness when former CIA contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified information about them in June. Since then, they have faced significant backlash from citizens who are concerned about privacy infringements and potential abuse of power by intelligence agencies.  During his speech, Alexander acknowledged these concerns but assured attendees that he would provide honest insight into their operations while simultaneously safeguarding vital national defense strategies. Facing interruptions from hecklers within the audience who accused him of lying and shouted profanities, he remained composed and resolute in his commitment to transparency.  The General emphasized the NSA's responsibility to maintain national security while respecting citizens' rights to privacy. He explained that their techniques focus on metadata rather than actual content – i.e., they collect information such as call duration or email recipients rather than eavesdropping on calls or reading messages verbatim. This approach intends to strike a balance between protecting public safety without overly intrusive surveillance measures.  Furthermore, Alexander urged critics of these intelligence-gathering practices not only to scrutinize their methods but also propose viable alternatives for ensuring national security against terrorism threats. He highlighted how laws governing such activities had been established through democratic processes with lawmakers making informed decisions based on necessary trade-offs between civil liberties and collective security interests.  In response to concerns about the potential misuse of data collected by the NSA, Alexander stressed that they operate within strict legal frameworks and undergo rigorous oversight from Congress, executive agencies, and the judiciary. He maintained that significant efforts are made to minimize data collection on law-abiding citizens and foreign allies while primarily focusing on suspicious activities related to terrorism.  Finally, General Alexander called upon individuals attending Black Hat – a conference known for attracting skilled hackers – to consider using their expertise to help strengthen cybersecurity measures rather than using their skills solely for malicious purposes. He acknowledged that skilled hackers could uncover vulnerabilities in various systems and encouraged them to contribute positively by working with government agencies or private industry stakeholders.  His address presented an opportunity for both sides of the debate to engage in a more constructive dialogue rather than resorting solely to criticism. In choosing this platform at Black Hat, General Alexander demonstrated a willingness not only to listen but also seek ways in which experts from different backgrounds can collaboratively enhance national security measures while preserving individual privacy rights.",continue
"The sudden acquisition of Instagram by Facebook is a testament to the fast-paced and unpredictable nature of the tech industry. With reports suggesting that the deal was finalized in just three days, it highlights how young and agile entrepreneurs can make swift and significant business decisions.  Mark Zuckerberg, at just 27 years old, has already proven himself as a trailblazing innovator. His decision to purchase Instagram for a staggering $1 billion demonstrates his continued ambition to expand Facebook's reach into other areas of social media. However, what truly captures attention is his approach to sealing this deal.  Zuckerberg's hacker spirit, which played an integral role in Facebook's early success, was once again on full display during these negotiations. He chose to meet with Kevin Systrom, Instagram's head and co-founder who was also in his late twenties at the time, at Zuckerberg's luxurious home in Palo Alto. This choice reflects Zuckerberg's desire for an informal setting where he could engage directly with Systrom.  These meetings exemplify the spirit of collaboration and innovation that defines Silicon Valley culture – two young minds coming together in an environment that encourages rapid decision-making. The proximity of their ages likely fostered an instant rapport between Zuckerberg and Systrom; they could relate to each other as fellow entrepreneurs navigating similar challenges within the tech industry.  While some might view this multi-billion-dollar transaction as impulsive or risky due to its seemingly short timeframe for negotiation, those familiar with Silicon Valley understand the philosophy behind such speedy action. In this ever-evolving industry marked by fierce competition and rapidly changing trends, quick decision-making can be a crucial advantage.  Additionally, buying out Instagram demonstrated Facebook's commitment to staying ahead of emerging competitors threatening its dominance over social media platforms. By acquiring one of its potential rivals while it was still relatively new on the scene but rapidly gaining popularity – especially among younger demographics – Zuckerberg exhibited foresight and strategic thinking.  Moreover, this acquisition highlights the importance of recognizing and investing in innovative start-ups that possess significant growth potential. Instagram's ability to amass millions of dedicated users and create a unique photo-sharing experience resonated with Zuckerberg, who understood the value it could add to Facebook's already substantial user base.  The pace at which this deal was closed demonstrates the remarkable speed at which technology companies operate. Traditional acquisition processes often involve weeks or even months of negotiations, due diligence, and paperwork. However, in this dynamic industry where market conditions can change rapidly, waiting too long could mean missing out on a game-changing opportunity.  In conclusion, Mark Zuckerberg's decision to acquire Instagram within a mere three days showcases his entrepreneurial spirit and willingness to take calculated risks. It exemplifies how the tech industry operates outside conventional norms with its emphasis on constant innovation and aggressive decision-making. While critics may question the speed at which deals like this occur, those familiar with Silicon Valley understand that swift action is often necessary in order to seize opportunities before they slip away in an ever-evolving landscape.",continue
"The rise of technology and the Internet has undoubtedly revolutionized our lives, allowing us to connect with people across the globe and access information at our fingertips. However, this immense connectivity has also given birth to a new breed of behavior: online rudeness and lack of decorum. In this digital age, it seems that the notion of class is being left behind in favor of instantaneous reactions and unfiltered thoughts that are shared for all to see.  Social media platforms have become breeding grounds for this lack of sophistication. People often hide behind their screens, feeling invincible as they unleash their vitriol on others without facing any immediate consequences. The anonymity the internet provides has paved the way for individuals to eschew basic human decency and engage in behaviors they would never dare exhibit face-to-face.  Online discussions can quickly turn into toxic environments where insults are hurled back and forth, differing opinions are dismissed without thoughtfulness or respect, and personal attacks take center stage instead of constructive dialogue. It seems that many have forgotten how to engage in civil discourse or consider the impact their words may have on others.  Furthermore, social media platforms have cultivated a culture where popularity is measured by likes, shares, and followers rather than one's values or integrity. This creates an environment where people will say anything to gain attention or provoke a reaction simply for the sake of validation from an online audience.  The prevalence of cyberbullying is another disheartening consequence stemming from this lack of online decency. The relative anonymity provided by social media emboldens individuals to harass others relentlessly from behind a screen. The consequences can be devastating; cyberbullying has led some victims down dark paths filled with depression, anxiety, self-harm or even suicide.  Even beyond social media platforms lies an array of internet forums where people vent their frustrations without regard for others' feelings or dignity. Comment sections on news articles or YouTube videos often descend into chaos as users resort to name-calling and inflammatory language to make their point, all while hiding behind a screen name.  It is essential to remember that the internet is not some alternate reality devoid of real-life consequences. The words we choose online have the power to wound just as deeply as those spoken face-to-face. While freedom of speech is a vital aspect of any open society, there must be an equal emphasis on responsible and respectful communication.  So how do we combat this war on class in the digital age? It starts with each individual taking responsibility for their own actions online. Before hitting send or submit, it's crucial to pause and reflect on what we are about to contribute to the conversation. Is it constructive? Is it respectful? Will it add value or simply inflame tensions?  Additionally, social media platforms themselves can play a role in curbing this lack of decorum by implementing stricter policies and monitoring user behavior more closely. While many platforms have made efforts in this regard with features like content moderation and reporting mechanisms, further action needs to be taken to ensure a safer environment for users.  Education is another crucial component in transforming our digital culture. Schools should prioritize teaching students about responsible digital citizenship from an early age, emphasizing empathy, critical thinking skills, and ethical conduct online.  Ultimately, reclaiming class in the digital age requires intentional effort from both individuals and society as a whole. By fostering an atmosphere of respect online and utilizing technology responsibly, we can rebuild virtual spaces where decency prevails over hostility - spaces that exemplify true sophistication even amidst the chaos of digital connectivity",continue
"Etan Patz's disappearance in 1979 sent shockwaves throughout the nation and forever changed the way we approach missing children cases. Decades later, a relative of the man now charged with his murder has shed some light on what may have been happening behind closed doors during that time.  The teenage stock clerk, whose name is being withheld for legal reasons, had seemingly led a relatively normal life in Manhattan until he decided to seek solace in his mother's home in south Jersey. According to the relative, his decision to move was accompanied by visible signs of distress. He appeared nervous and shaken, constantly plagued by diarrhea and spending long hours gazing out of the window.  It is unclear what triggered this apparent turmoil within him or whether it had any relation to Etan Patz's disappearance. However, it provides a glimpse into the state of mind of a young man who would go on to be accused of one of America's most infamous crimes.  Etan Patz was only six years old when he embarked on that fateful walk to catch the school bus alone for the first time. Little did anyone know that this simple act would lead to an enduring mystery that haunted parents across America. The desperate search for Etan began immediately after his disappearance was discovered - an intensive effort involving law enforcement agencies at all levels.  Authorities quickly adopted a groundbreaking strategy by printing thousands of milk cartons with Etan's image emblazoned across them - marking the birth of what became known as ""missing children"" campaigns. This innovative approach aimed to harness public attention and raise awareness about child abductions nationwide.  Now, four decades later, these efforts are still ingrained within our collective memory as a reminder both of Etan Patz himself and countless other children who have gone missing since then.  The recent arrest and subsequent charges filed against this former stock clerk have reignited interest in one question: What happened on that day? While the relative's account offers some insight into the accused's state of mind at the time, it does not provide definitive answers.  The forthcoming trial will undoubtedly scrutinize every detail and piece together a portrait of this troubled man. In an era where advancements in forensic science have given us a better understanding of criminal behavior, there is hope that justice will finally be served for Etan Patz.  For many parents who lived through this horrific crime, the memories remain vivid. The case was a stark reminder that danger could be lurking just around the corner - even in an allegedly safe neighborhood like Lower Manhattan.  Etan Patz's disappearance not only changed the lives of his family but also became a turning point for law enforcement agencies and society as a whole. It demonstrated that child abductions were not isolated incidents but rather a pervasive issue requiring immediate attention and action.  Decades later, we continue to grapple with cases of missing children, often relying on technology and public awareness campaigns to facilitate their safe return. While progress has been made, there is still much work to be done to ensure every child finds their way back home unharmed.  As we await further developments in this high-profile case, may it serve as a reminder that no child should ever vanish without consequences. The legacy left by Etan Patz continues to resonate within our society today - urging us all to remain vigilant and protective of our most vulnerable members: our children.",continue
"For some artists, participating in singing competitions can be a crucial career move, helping to revive their stardom and regain public favor. Pop icon Jennifer Lopez is a prime example of how shows like ""American Idol"" can provide a platform for redemption. After facing a decline in her music career in the late 2000s, Lopez took on the role of judge on ""American Idol"" in 2011. This opportunity allowed her to connect with fans on a personal level again and showcase her talent as both an entertainer and mentor.  As the show progressed, Lopez utilized this newfound exposure to release her seventh studio album, ""Love?"" The album saw great success, with several chart-topping singles including ""On the Floor,"" featuring Pitbull. It became evident that being part of a show like ""American Idol"" not only reestablished Lopez's relevance but also reignited her presence as an influential artist in the industry.  Similarly, Maroon 5 experienced a rejuvenation of their career thanks to lead singer Adam Levine's role as coach on ""The Voice."" The exposure he received through regular appearances on the show undoubtedly played a significant role in revitalizing interest in Maroon 5's music amongst both old and new fans alike. Their hit single ""Moves Like Jagger,"" featuring Christina Aguilera—an original coach and occasional collaborator from ""The Voice""—became one of their most successful songs to date.  The success stories don't end there—other artists have also reaped benefits from these competition shows. Although Britney Spears had already made an impressive comeback with her album ""Circus"" after experiencing personal struggles earlier in her career, taking up a judging position on Simon Cowell's talent search show called ""The X Factor"" wasn't instrumental for selling albums at that point. Spears' involvement demonstrated not only her enduring popularity but also showcased diversity within her multifaceted career.  While these shows undoubtedly generate exposure and rekindle success for already established talents, they can also launch promising new stars into the limelight. Contestants like Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood emerged from ""American Idol"" as chart-topping artists. These shows provide a platform that propels up-and-coming singers into mainstream recognition, granting them the opportunity to showcase their skills to millions of viewers.  However, it is essential to acknowledge that participation in these shows does not guarantee long-term success. For every star created, there are countless contestants who fade into obscurity after their fifteen minutes of fame. Nonetheless, for those who seize this chance with determination and talent, there is potential for significant career growth.  Moreover, the impact extends beyond just album sales—it influences public perception. Singing competition shows allow audiences to reconnect with artists on a personal level by witnessing their vulnerability and growth throughout the competition process. This enables viewers to form emotional attachments with contestants during their journey towards stardom—the very same journey that some of these established stars have had before.  In conclusion, singing competition shows like ""American Idol"" and ""The Voice"" offer redemption and rehabilitative opportunities for seasoned artists looking to revive their careers or enhance their public image. These platforms not only generate excitement among fans but also provide a chance for rediscovery by showcasing exceptional talent or mentoring budding musicians seeking recognition in the industry's ever-evolving landscape",continue
"The ongoing Chicago teachers strike has entered its second week, causing disruptions for over 350,000 children in the third-largest school district in the United States. Despite reaching a tentative contract deal between union leaders and school officials, representatives of the Chicago Teachers Union have decided to continue their walkout.  One of the main points of contention in the negotiations revolves around the length of the school day. The teachers are pushing for changes that would bring about longer school days for both elementary and high school students. Under the proposed agreement, elementary students would experience an additional 75 minutes in their schedule, resulting in a seven-hour school day. High school students would also see an extension to their day by an extra 30 minutes, making it a seven-and-a-half-hour schedule.  While extending instructional time may seem like a positive change aimed at maximizing learning opportunities, it has faced resistance from teachers who are concerned about burnout and maintaining work-life balance. Some argue that longer hours without adequate breaks or preparation time could lead to decreased effectiveness in teaching. Additionally, many educators worry that increasing demands without appropriate compensation may not only affect their overall job satisfaction but also impact recruitment and retention rates within the profession.  Another key issue during negotiations is related to how teacher evaluations are tied to performance metrics. The Chicago Teachers Union is fighting against this connection as they believe it places too much emphasis on standardized testing outcomes rather than recognizing different teaching styles and student needs. Critics argue that relying solely on test scores as a measure of teacher performance oversimplifies complex educational processes and fails to capture important aspects such as creativity or critical thinking development.  Furthermore, fears over potential job losses add another layer of unease among educators amidst contract talks. As schools face budget constraints and fluctuating enrollments, there is concern that some positions could be eliminated or consolidated under new measures. Teachers worry about losing job security if they resist certain changes proposed by administration or if schools undergo restructuring due to financial pressures.  The stakes of this strike are high, with students and families shouldering the consequences of the ongoing impasse. Many parents have expressed frustration and concern as disruptions to their children's education continue. Schools have been forced to rely on alternative staffing solutions, such as substituting non-unionized teachers or employing online instruction methods, which may not provide the same level of educational support as regular classroom teaching.  Negotiations between union leaders and school officials appear to be at an impasse, making it difficult to predict when a resolution will be reached. Both sides must find a compromise that addresses concerns regarding the length of school days, teacher evaluations, and job security. This requires considering multiple perspectives while prioritizing the best interests of students and ensuring fair treatment for educators.  As negotiations resume, it is vital for all parties involved to maintain open lines of communication and engage in constructive dialogue. Collaborative efforts that focus on finding common ground can lead to a mutually beneficial agreement that supports quality education while respecting teachers' rights and well-being. Ultimately, resolving this strike will require compromise from both union leaders and school officials so that Chicago's schools can reopen their doors and provide stability for students who depend on them for learning opportunities and growth.",continue
"The petition goes on to state that awarding Israel the hosting rights for the European age-grade tournament sends a message of acceptance and tolerance towards the actions of the Israeli government. The players argue that this goes against the principles of equality, justice, and human rights that football should stand for.  However, the petition has sparked controversy and divided opinions within the football community. While some players believe it is important to use their platform to raise awareness about human rights abuses, others argue that sport should remain separate from politics.  One player who voiced his support for Israel as a host country is Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese superstar emphasized that sport should be used as a means to bring people together rather than create divisions. He believes in the power of football as a unifying force and hopes that by participating in tournaments held in various countries, positive change can be promoted.  On the other hand, there are those who argue that sports events like this tournament provide an opportunity to shed light on social and political issues. They believe it is vital to use such platforms to highlight injustices and advocate for change.  Organizations such as Human Rights Watch have also raised concerns about holding major sporting events in countries with questionable human rights records. They argue that awarding hosting rights without considering these factors sends a message of indifference toward human suffering.  In response to this growing debate, UEFA (Union of European Football Associations), which organizes European tournaments including this age-grade competition, issued a statement acknowledging their commitment both to impartiality and respect for human dignity. However, they maintained their decision not to get involved politically or religiously by assessing individual situations or conflicts when selecting host nations.  This statement reiterates UEFA's long-standing policy of separating sports from politics while emphasizing their role in promoting solidarity among nations through football. They argued it would be unfair if one incident or conflict were singled out while ignoring other instances around the world where freedom or justice may also be compromised.  Ultimately, the decision regarding Israel's hosting rights for the tournament rests with UEFA. It is a difficult balancing act between promoting football as a peaceful and unifying activity and addressing serious human rights concerns.  While it may seem controversial to some, the petition from soccer stars reflects their desire to use their influence for issues they believe in. By raising awareness about the situation in Gaza, they hope to contribute to positive change not just within football but also on a larger scale.  This debate highlights how professional athletes have become more than just sports figures; they are also role models and advocates for causes close to their hearts. The power of their voices should not be underestimated, as they have the ability to spark important discussions and push for change.  Regardless of whether or not Israel retains its hosting rights for the tournament, it is clear that these soccer stars' petition has already succeeded in bringing attention to an ongoing conflict and prompting further dialogue about human rights abuses. The world will be watching closely as UEFA makes its decision, hoping that it takes into account both the principles of fairness in sport and respect for human dignity.",continue
"The Occupy protestors in Oakland had successfully managed to shut down the port terminal overnight, causing major disruptions and financial losses for the Port and City of Oakland. The officials expressed their disappointment with the protesters' actions, emphasizing that it not only affected the port's operations but also had negative consequences for businesses and job creation.  Robert Bernardo, the communication manager for the port, conveyed his concern about the impact on businesses that contribute taxes and play a pivotal role in generating employment opportunities in Oakland. He further emphasized that regaining partners' confidence who bring business to Oakland was of utmost importance to ensure recovery from this setback.  Initially, on Monday, despite some delays in truck traffic due to protestors' presence, officials assured that the port remained operational. However, as nightfall approached, protests escalated significantly and began impairing workers' access to their workplaces. As a result, it drastically hampered the port's ability to operate at its full potential.  The closure of Oakland's port terminal proved costly in terms of both financial resources and overall reputation. As one of California's busiest ports serving as a crucial hub for international trade activities along America’s West Coast corridor, any disruption has reverberating effects economically and logistically across various interconnected industries.  Oakland’s shipping industry plays an essential role not just regionally but also nationally by facilitating import-export activities through its state-of-the-art facilities. Temporary closures such as these have severe implications beyond just immediate monetary losses; they undermine dependability and reliability expected from such vital infrastructure facilities.  Furthermore, impacts reached far beyond just laborers employed directly or indirectly by companies operating at or near the port. Local businesses relying on efficient transportation networks provided by a functioning terminal suffered from delayed shipments leading to disrupted supply chains nationwide. In turn necessitating additional costs incurred due to logistical challenges created during this period of protest-driven disruptions.  Unquestionably recognizing these negative implications upon reinstalling normalcy at the port facilities will be critical. Damage control strategies need to be employed urgently to regain partners' and businesses' confidence, reaffirming their trust in the port's reliability and stability.  Moreover, collaboration between various stakeholders will become essential in order to devise necessary preventive measures aimed at avoiding similar disruptions in the future while ensuring peaceful demonstrations can also occur without causing significant harm.  The incident at Oakland's port terminal serves as yet another example of how protests, although a constitutional right and important means of expressing dissent, can lead to unintended consequences impacting the economy and employment extensively. The delicate balance between exercising the freedom of speech and preserving economic stability is a challenge that must be tackled judiciously by protestors, policymakers, and law enforcement agencies alike.  In conclusion, while protests carried out with genuine concerns lay bare social issues deserving attention from authorities; they should not overshadow efforts made by businesses or infrastructure facilities towards creating job opportunities or catalyzing economic growth. The disruption caused by overnight shutdowns at Oakland's port terminal accentuates this delicate interdependence between activism and industrial progress. It serves as a reminder that consideration of potential adverse repercussions is vital when choosing interaction mechanisms for societal change.",continue
"The shooting at the Family Research Council headquarters sent shockwaves through Washington, D.C., as authorities scrambled to understand the motive behind this act of violence. As investigators delved into the background of Floyd Lee Corkins II, troubling details emerged, shedding light on a potential motive.  Corkins, a 28-year-old from Herndon, had been linked to various radical groups advocating for LGBT rights. His attack took aim at the Family Research Council because of their conservative stance on social issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion. In his twisted mind, he believed that by targeting this organization, he would strike a blow against what he perceived as bigotry and intolerance.  The injured security guard who bravely tackled Corkins was hailed as a hero by law enforcement officials. His swift action prevented further harm and possibly saved lives. As news spread across the nation about this shocking incident, it ignited debates about hate speech and its potential consequences.  Advocacy groups on both sides condemned the violence but differed in their responses. Supporters of organizations like the Family Research Council argued that extreme rhetoric can incite acts of violence from individuals who feel justified in taking matters into their own hands due to perceived injustices perpetrated by those with opposing views.  On the other hand, activists fighting for LGBT rights stressed that this tragic event should not be used to vilify an entire movement or discredit legitimate concerns regarding discrimination against sexual minorities. They emphasized that disapproval of an organization's ideology should never justify resorting to violence but urged fair scrutiny of hate speech.  While debate raged over these complex issues surrounding freedom of speech and political open dialogue versus dangerous rhetoric influencing violent acts, lawmakers faced pressure to take concrete action in response to such incidents.  In addition to addressing hate crimes legislation in Congress and strengthening gun control measures following yet another shooting incident on Capitol Hill—an issue that had come under renewed national attention—an examination into how radicals are radicalized online also gained traction among policymakers.  The investigation into Corkins' online presence revealed that he had frequented extremist websites and forums that disseminate hatred towards conservative organizations. Questions were raised about the role of these platforms in fostering radicalization and whether they should face greater scrutiny or regulation to prevent further violence.  The shooting at the Family Research Council headquarters served as a stark reminder that ideological differences can lead to dangerous and deadly consequences if not approached with caution, respect, and an open mind for dialogue. It heightened calls for civility in political discourse and prompted soul searching within advocacy groups on how best to combat bigotry without veering into violent extremism themselves.  As the wounded security guard recovered from his injuries, support poured in from across the nation. His heroism became a symbol of resilience against hate, illustrating that even in times of darkness, there are individuals willing to risk their lives for the greater good.  Ultimately, this tragic event underscored the significance of upholding democratic values such as freedom of speech while also acknowledging the responsibility to engage in respectful conversation rooted in understanding rather than blind hatred. It urged both sides of any given debate to seek common ground instead of resorting to violence as a means of silencing opposing viewpoints—a message that resonated far beyond Washington's political corridors.",continue
"Moallem's words, however, stand in stark contrast to the reality on the ground in Syria. The death toll from the uprising has surpassed 10,000, with countless others injured and displaced. It is a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions. Reports of arbitrary arrests, torture, and extrajudicial killings have become all too common.  The Syrian government's claim to be providing necessary services is met with skepticism by human rights organizations and international observers. Many areas of the country are cut off from essential supplies like food and medicine due to government blockades. Basic infrastructure has been destroyed in bombings and shelling by government forces.  Furthermore, the economic international boycott that Moallem mentions is a result of widespread condemnation of the Syrian regime's brutal crackdown on protestors seeking political reform and freedom. The European Union, United States, and many Arab countries have imposed sanctions on Syria as a means to pressure its leaders into stopping the violence.  While Moallem tries to paint a picture of a caring government looking out for its people's welfare, it is evident that his claims are nothing more than propaganda meant to deflect blame from his own regime's actions. The world is witnessing an unprecedented level of cruelty inflicted upon civilians by their own government.  The international community has repeatedly called for an end to the violence in Syria through peaceful means but Moallem dismisses these efforts as interference in Syria's internal affairs. He maintains that any action taken against his regime will be viewed as aggression against Syrian sovereignty.  However passionate his defense may seem, it cannot mask the fact that countless lives are being lost at an alarming rate while governments argue over semantics and political ideologies. It is clear that mere words cannot bring an end to this bloodshed; concrete actions need to be taken.  The responsibility falls not only on world leaders but also on individual citizens who can raise awareness about what is happening in Syria and put pressure on their respective governments to take meaningful action. The suffering of the Syrian people cannot be ignored any longer.  Moallem and his government may claim they are defending Syria's independence, but what they are really defending is their own grip on power. They have sacrificed the lives and well-being of their citizens in order to maintain control, leading to a fractured nation on the brink of collapse.  As the death toll continues to climb, it becomes increasingly clear that Moallem's words do not match the reality on the ground. The Syrian people deserve better than empty promises and hollow rhetoric. It is imperative that the international community steps up its efforts to bring an end to this humanitarian crisis and hold those responsible for atrocities accountable for their actions. Only then can Syria begin its long road towards healing and rebuilding a nation torn apart by violence. The international community must take a strong stance against the Syrian regime and hold them accountable for their actions. It is not enough to simply condemn the violence; meaningful action needs to be taken to protect innocent civilians and bring an end to this senseless bloodshed.  Humanitarian aid organizations must be given unfettered access to those in need, regardless of their political affiliations. The suffering of Syrians should not be politicized or used as a bargaining chip in diplomatic negotiations. Every effort should be made to provide immediate medical assistance, food, water, and shelter to those affected by the conflict.  In addition, efforts should focus on facilitating dialogue between all parties involved in the conflict. A peaceful resolution can only happen through meaningful negotiations that address the grievances of all sides and allow for a transition towards a more democratic system that respects human rights.  The Syrian people have shown immense resilience throughout this crisis. Despite facing unimaginable hardship, they continue to fight for their freedom and dignity. Their voices must not go unheard.  The international community needs to come together in support of these brave individuals who are risking their lives every day for a better future. Economic sanctions alone are not enough; targeted measures against key figures within the Syrian regime who are directly responsible for crimes against humanity need to be implemented.  Furthermore, accountability is crucial in addressing atrocities committed during this conflict. The International Criminal Court (ICC) should play an active role in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated by both sides of the conflict.  Syria's neighbors also have a significant role to play in finding a peaceful solution. They must take steps towards ending any support they may provide to groups engaged in violence or hinder efforts towards peace negotiations. Regional powers can use their influence over various factions involved in the conflict as leverage towards encouraging them into dialogue rather than perpetuating further bloodshed.  Ultimately, what matters most is protecting innocent lives and fostering conditions for long-term stability within Syria. This will require the collective efforts of the international community, humanitarian organizations, neighboring countries, and the Syrian people themselves.  The conflict in Syria has gone on for far too long. The death toll continues to rise, families are displaced, and a whole generation is being scarred by violence. It is imperative that immediate action be taken to end this crisis once and for all.  The Syrian people have suffered enough. It is time for the world to stand united in support of their quest for freedom, justice, and a brighter future. Now is the time to act before more lives are needlessly lost and Syria becomes another tragic chapter in human history.",continue
"We need to be reassured that our privacy will be respected, and that the actions of our allies will not compromise our trust and security. Trust is a fundamental pillar of any relationship, whether it be between individuals or nations. It is built on openness, honesty, and respect.  The recent revelations about NSA surveillance have exposed a breach in this trust. The United States has long been seen as a champion of democracy and individual rights, but these allegations have called into question its commitment to these ideals.  In order to rebuild trust between Europe and the United States, concrete actions need to be taken. Merkel's call for ""true change"" reflects the sentiment shared by many world leaders who feel violated by this intrusion into their private communications.  First and foremost, there needs to be transparency regarding the activities of intelligence agencies. It is understandable that certain operations must remain classified for security reasons. However, there should be clear guidelines in place that define the scope of surveillance and ensure that it is carried out only when absolutely necessary.  Additionally, there should be stricter oversight mechanisms in place to ensure accountability. This could come in the form of independent commissions or courts with the power to review intelligence activities and determine if they are within legal bounds.  Furthermore, data protection laws need to be strengthened both within individual countries and at an international level. The digital age has brought about new challenges when it comes to privacy rights, and legislation needs to catch up accordingly.  Another important aspect of rebuilding trust is open dialogue between world leaders. Communication channels need to remain open so that concerns can be addressed promptly before they escalate into full-blown crises. Regular meetings between heads of state would provide an opportunity for frank discussions about global security issues while also building personal relationships based on mutual understanding.  It is crucial for both Europe and the United States to work towards creating a mutually beneficial framework for intelligence sharing. Intelligence gathering plays a vital role in combating terrorism and other global threats; however, it should be conducted in a way that respects the privacy of individuals and maintains trust between nations.  Collaboration and cooperation should be the guiding principles going forward. By sharing information and expertise, Europe and the United States can create a comprehensive network that addresses security challenges effectively while also upholding the fundamental rights of their citizens.  Lastly, rebuilding trust requires patience and time. It will not happen overnight, but consistent efforts to address concerns and rectify past mistakes will go a long way towards restoring faith in the alliance between Europe and the United States.  Trust is fragile, but it can be rebuilt with sincerity, openness, and a commitment to transparency. The allegations of spying have shaken the foundations of trust between Europe and the United States, but by taking concrete actions to address these concerns head-on, both sides can work towards rebuilding a relationship based on mutual respect and shared values. Only then can we move forward with confidence in our collective security efforts while safeguarding our cherished right to privacy.",continue
"Among the first skirmishes is likely to be a battle over healthcare. Democrats are determined to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, while Republicans have long been keen on dismantling it. The fight over the fate of Obamacare has been ongoing for years, but with Democrats now in control of the House, they are expected to push back against any attempts by Republicans to undermine or repeal it.  Progressives argue that access to affordable healthcare is a fundamental right and vow to defend it vigorously. They point to millions of Americans who have gained coverage under the ACA and argue that any attempts by Republicans to roll back these gains would be disastrous for those who rely on it.  In addition to healthcare, progressives are also prepared for battles on other fronts such as climate change, income inequality, gun control, and campaign finance reform. These issues have become rallying cries for progressive activists across the country who see them as vital parts of their agenda.  On climate change, progressives are pushing for bold action such as transitioning to 100% clean energy by a certain date and investing heavily in renewable technologies. They argue that this is not only necessary from an environmental standpoint but also crucial for creating jobs and stimulating economic growth.  When it comes to income inequality, progressives are advocating for policies such as raising the minimum wage, expanding access to affordable housing and education, and implementing tax reforms that ensure corporations pay their fair share. They believe that addressing these disparities in wealth distribution is essential for creating a more just society where everyone has equal opportunities.  Gun control remains another contentious issue where progressives stand firmly in favor of stricter regulations. They support measures such as universal background checks and banning assault weapons in an effort to reduce gun violence across the nation. Progressives argue that common-sense gun laws can coexist with Second Amendment rights while making communities safer.  Finally, campaign finance reform is another key priority for progressives who believe that big money has too much influence over our political system. They advocate for transparency, limiting corporate donations, and overturning the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which opened the floodgates for unlimited spending in political campaigns.  While progressives are prepared to fight tooth and nail for their priorities, they also recognize that compromise may be necessary to advance their agenda. They understand that with a divided government, reaching across the aisle will be crucial to achieving meaningful progress.  But they also warn against prioritizing bipartisanship at the expense of their core values. Progressives are determined not to repeat mistakes made during previous Democratic administrations where concessions were often made without getting enough in return. They believe that it's time for Democrats to stand firm and unabashedly fight for their principles.  As Washington enters this new era of kamikaze governance with Democrats at the helm, one thing is clear: progressives are ready for battle. With millions of Americans behind them and a strong determination to defend their values, they are prepared to take on Republicans and push forward an ambitious agenda aimed at creating a more just and equitable society. The coming months and years will undoubtedly test their resolve but whether it's on healthcare, climate change or income inequality - progressives have no intention of backing down.",continue
"The arrest of Admir Suljic marks a significant breakthrough in the ongoing battle against soccer match-fixing. The transnational criminal group he is accused of being a part of had been under investigation for several years, and his surrender is a major victory for law enforcement agencies.  Suljic, once a promising football player himself, is believed to have played a substantial role in manipulating the outcomes of Italian league matches between 2009 and 2011. His involvement with the Singaporean and Balkan individuals implicated in this match-fixing organization has raised concerns about the global reach and complexity of such criminal operations.  The ""Last Bet"" investigation has shed light on how these groups operate. It revealed that high-stakes gambling syndicates based in Asia exploit vulnerabilities within football institutions to ensure specific outcomes suitable for their betting schemes. With enormous sums wagered on professional football matches worldwide, these criminals see an opportunity to profit illicitly by manipulating match results.  To achieve their aims, members of these organizations corrupt players, coaches, referees, and other officials involved in the game. They use various techniques such as bribery or blackmail to coerce individuals into participating in match-fixing activities. By compromising key figures within football teams or leagues, they can influence game outcomes without arousing suspicion.  The impact of match-fixing extends beyond financial losses for bettors; it undermines the integrity and credibility of one of the world's most popular sports. Soccer's loyal fan base relies on fair competition as its foundation — where skill determines success rather than fraudulent activities behind closed doors.  Law enforcement agencies around the globe are increasing their efforts to crack down on this pervasive issue. Collaborative initiatives between national police forces as well as international organizations like Interpol have been established to combat match-fixing syndicates effectively.  However, addressing this problem requires not only better coordination among stakeholders but also reforms within football itself. The implementation of stringent regulatory frameworks that prioritize transparency and accountability is crucial. Governing bodies must work towards establishing robust mechanisms for detecting and investigating instances of match-fixing, promptly punishing culprits, and protecting whistleblowers.  Additionally, greater emphasis should be placed on educating players, coaches, and officials about the severe consequences of participating in such illegal activities. By raising awareness and promoting ethical behavior within the sport, the appeal of joining match-fixing operations can be diminished.  As Admir Suljic awaits trial for his alleged involvement in this criminal network, his arrest serves as a reminder that those responsible for manipulating soccer matches will not evade justice indefinitely. This development will surely send shockwaves throughout the underground gambling networks that thrive on match-fixing.  Nonetheless, it is important to remain vigilant as new schemes may emerge to replace old ones. Ultimately eradicating soccer match-fixing requires an ongoing commitment from all stakeholders involved — law enforcement agencies, football associations, players, fans—and a collective determination to protect the integrity of the game we all love. The arrest of Admir Suljic is expected to lead investigators to more significant players within the match-fixing organization. Law enforcement agencies will now have the opportunity to interrogate him and gather valuable information about the inner workings of the criminal group. This could potentially unveil additional operatives involved in manipulating matches and provide insights into their methods.  Suljic's choice to surrender suggests that he might be willing to cooperate with authorities, which could further aid in dismantling the network. His firsthand knowledge of how match-fixing operations are carried out, as well as his connections within the underworld, could prove invaluable for ongoing investigations.  The soccer community has been rocked by numerous match-fixing scandals over recent years, tarnishing its reputation and putting a question mark over fair competition. To combat this issue effectively, a united front must be established between football authorities, government agencies, and law enforcement bodies.  One positive step forward has been enhanced cooperation between FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) and Interpol. The two organizations have joined forces under Operation Pangea—an initiative designed to uncover global match-fixing networks and bring those responsible to justice.  Furthermore, football associations worldwide have started implementing stricter regulations in an effort to deter individuals from engaging in illicit activities related to gambling and match manipulation. These measures include increasing surveillance on players' behaviors both on and off the field, establishing integrity units within football clubs or leagues dedicated solely to combating corruption issues.  At a grassroots level, education plays a vital role in deterring young players from becoming involved in match-fixing schemes. By instilling strong moral values at an early age through anti-corruption campaigns and educational programs focused on ethics within sport, we can help create a generation of athletes who value integrity above all else.  Simultaneously addressing illegal betting syndicates is equally important. Collaboration between governments must focus on intensifying efforts against these underground networks by strengthening legislation surrounding illegal gambling activities while imposing stricter penalties for those involved.  The battle against match-fixing is an ongoing and complex one. It requires continuous vigilance, cooperation, and adaptability from all parties involved. While the arrest of Admir Suljic is undoubtedly a significant step forward, it should be viewed as a catalyst for more extensive investigations into other areas where corruption may persist.  Protecting the beautiful game from the clutches of match-fixing should remain a top priority not only for football associations but also for fans who cherish the purity and unpredictability that make soccer so captivating. By collectively striving to eradicate this threat, we can restore faith in the sport and ensure that future generations can enjoy it without suspicion or doubt.",continue
"During his tenure as CEO from 2000 to 2014, Ballmer oversaw tremendous growth and expansion for the tech giant. Under his leadership, Microsoft's annual revenue more than tripled, reaching a peak of $78 billion in 2013. Ballmer played a crucial role in diversifying the company's product line beyond its flagship Windows operating system, expanding into areas such as cloud computing and enterprise software.  Ballmer is known for his energetic and passionate personality. His enthusiasm for Microsoft was often on display during company presentations and events where he would jump around on stage, yell and cheer to pump up employees and audiences alike. While some found his antics entertaining, others criticized him for coming across as overly boisterous or even arrogant.  After retiring from Microsoft, Ballmer shifted his focus towards philanthropy and other ventures. In 2014, he purchased the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team from Donald Sterling's trust after Sterling was banned from the NBA for making racist remarks. The $2 billion price tag shocked many but demonstrated Ballmer's commitment to becoming a sports team owner.  As owner of the Clippers, Ballmer has been praised for transforming the franchise both on and off the court. He brought in new management with an emphasis on transparency and accountability while investing heavily in player development facilities. Under his ownership, the team experienced one of its most successful stretches in history, making several playoff appearances.  Ballmer has also been involved in various philanthropic endeavors since leaving Microsoft. Together with his wife Connie Ballmer (nee Snyder), he founded the Ballmer Group which focuses on improving economic mobility through investments in education initiatives that support underserved communities.  In addition to their charitable efforts aimed at reducing poverty levels throughout America by addressing social issues like homelessness, unemployment rates among young people or inadequate access to healthcare services - Steve & Connie have committed over half their net worth ($1 billion) towards these causes already!  Furthermore ,He also serves on the board of directors for several organizations, including USAFacts, an initiative aimed at promoting an evidence-based understanding of government data and statistics. Ballmer has been vocal about the need for transparency in government spending and believes that accessible and accurate information can lead to more informed decision-making.  Despite his vast wealth, Ballmer has a reputation for being a relatively frugal individual. He famously still drives a Ford SUV and is known for his simple lifestyle. This down-to-earth approach may stem from his upbringing in a middle-class Detroit household where he learned the value of hard work and perseverance.  While Ballmer's bid to become the owner of the Clippers was initially met with some skepticism due to his lack of experience in professional sports team ownership, he has proven himself to be dedicated, passionate, and deeply invested in bringing success both on and off the court. His vast wealth provides ample resources for building a top-tier organization while his commitment to philanthropy ensures that he will continue giving back to communities in need.  If approved by NBA owners, Steve Ballmer's ownership would mark a new chapter for the Clippers franchise. With his leadership skills, financial clout, and genuine passion for success both on and off the court - it seems likely that with him at the helm, the future is bright for this once-struggling team. As fans eagerly await final approval from NBA officials regarding this acquisition deal - one thing remains clear: Steve Ballmer is ready to make a lasting impact as Clippers' next owner",continue
"First and foremost, military intervention in Iraq would only perpetuate the cycle of violence that has plagued the region for years. The Western states have a long history of interfering in Middle Eastern affairs, often resulting in unintended consequences and further destabilization. It is evident from past interventions such as the invasion of Iraq in 2003 that military force alone cannot bring stability or bring an end to extremism.  Moreover, intervening militarily would only serve to strengthen ISIS's narrative of resistance against foreign occupation. This extremist group thrives on exploiting grievances and portraying themselves as defenders of Islam against Western imperialism. A direct military intervention by the West would validate their claims and bolster their recruitment efforts.  The situation in Iraq is highly complex and deeply rooted in sectarian tensions between different religious groups. Military action would not address these underlying issues but rather exacerbate them. It could potentially lead to a broader regional conflict if neighboring countries with vested interests become involved.  Furthermore, any Western military intervention would undoubtedly result in significant civilian casualties, further alienating local populations and fueling anti-Western sentiments. The West should focus on supporting diplomatic efforts aimed at fostering dialogue between different factions within Iraq rather than resorting to violence.  The argument that Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has requested Western assistance does not outweigh the potential negative consequences of intervention. Maliki's leadership has been marred by sectarian policies that have alienated Sunni populations and fueled support for ISIS among disenfranchised communities. Supporting his government without addressing these fundamental issues will only prolong instability.  Instead of intervening militarily, the West should concentrate its efforts on providing humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict and supporting regional actors who are dedicated to countering ISIS through non-military means. Working closely with neighboring countries like Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran can help create a coalition focused on political solutions rather than military ones.  Additionally, addressing root causes such as political marginalization, economic inequality, and sectarian divisions is crucial in combating the rise of extremist groups like ISIS. By promoting inclusive governance and providing economic opportunities, the West can help address grievances that fuel support for such organizations.  In conclusion, military intervention in Iraq by Western states would not provide a viable solution to the current crisis. It would only perpetuate violence, strengthen ISIS's narrative, and lead to further destabilization. Instead, the West should focus on supporting diplomatic efforts and addressing underlying issues through political means. By doing so, there is a greater chance of fostering long-term stability and countering extremism in Iraq and the wider region. Furthermore, the Western states should learn from their past mistakes and acknowledge that military intervention alone cannot solve the complex issues in Iraq. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 serves as a stark reminder of the unintended consequences of such actions. The power vacuum created by the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime paved the way for sectarian violence and the rise of extremist groups like ISIS.  It is essential to recognize that ISIS has not emerged out of thin air but is a symptom of deeper political, social, and economic grievances within Iraq. These include widespread corruption, government mismanagement, and a lack of inclusive governance. Instead of focusing solely on military strategies, Western countries should prioritize long-term efforts to address these root causes.  Supporting political reconciliation among different factions within Iraq is crucial for achieving sustainable peace. This can involve facilitating an inclusive dialogue that takes into account the concerns and aspirations of all communities. By promoting unity, cooperation, and respect for human rights, there is a greater chance to undermine ISIS's appeal among marginalized populations.  Moreover, investment in infrastructure development and job creation can help alleviate economic disparities that contribute to social unrest. Providing vocational training programs and empowering local communities economically will not only reduce support for extremist ideologies but also foster stability.  International assistance should also be channeled towards strengthening security forces within Iraq so they can effectively combat extremism without relying heavily on external intervention. By focusing on training local police forces and supporting intelligence sharing between nations, it becomes possible to build stable institutions capable of maintaining security in the long run.  Another critical aspect is countering extremist propaganda online through digital diplomacy efforts led by Western governments working closely with tech companies. By spreading counter-narratives emphasizing peacebuilding, tolerance, inclusion,and respect for diversity,a more balanced narrative can be offered as an alternative to radicalization propaganda spread by groups such as ISIS.  However,it is crucial that any assistance provided by Western states focuses on reinforcing Iraqi sovereignty rather than infringing upon it.The involvement of international actors should be coordinated with the Iraqi government and respect their decisions and sovereignty.  In conclusion, the West should refrain from military intervention in Iraq and instead pursue a comprehensive approach that tackles the root causes of instability. This includes supporting political reconciliation, addressing socio-economic grievances, strengthening security forces, countering extremist propaganda, and promoting inclusive governance. By doing so, there is a greater likelihood of achieving lasting stability and countering extremist ideologies in Iraq. The long-term goal should be to empower local actors in finding sustainable solutions rather than imposing external military interventions that only perpetuate violence and exacerbate existing tensions.",continue
"Each piece of artwork tells a story, a message of defiance and determination in the face of an oppressive regime. The Umbrella Man sculpture, in particular, has become an iconic symbol of the movement. Its towering presence embodies the strength and unity of the protesters who have taken to the streets.  The yellow umbrella itself has deep significance to Hong Kong's democracy movement. It became a powerful symbol during the 2014 Umbrella Movement when protesters used umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas fired by police. These umbrellas became both a physical protection and a visual representation of their resistance.  Now, as pro-democracy activists once again fill Hong Kong's streets, reclaiming their voices and demanding change, the Umbrella Man sculpture serves as a constant reminder of their fight for freedom. It stands tall amidst handwritten posters declaring slogans such as ""Power to the People"" and ""Democracy Now!"" Every passerby is invited to reflect upon what this statue represents and join in solidarity with those demanding political reform.  Beyond just sculptures and posters, art has permeated every corner of Admiralty district. Artists have taken over empty shopfronts and transformed them into temporary galleries showcasing paintings depicting scenes from protests or expressing dissent against government policies. Vibrant murals cover once drab walls - portraits capturing moments of bravery or reflecting on lost freedoms.  The artistic expression doesn't stop at physical forms; it extends into performance art as well. Spontaneous poetry readings take place on street corners while drama troupes stage impromptu plays that speak directly to issues facing society today. Music fills the air with songs written specifically for this movement – lyrics that provide solace, inspiration, and fuel for further action.  This explosion of creativity is not limited to professional artists but includes ordinary citizens who find solace in expressing themselves through art during these uncertain times. People young and old - students exercising their right to free speech for perhaps one of their first times, and older generations who pass down stories of Hong Kong's fight for freedom - all contribute to the growing tapestry of artistic resistance.  The artwork in Admiralty district serves as a powerful symbol, representing Hong Kong's unwavering spirit in the face of adversity. It transcends language barriers and spreads its message far beyond the confines of one city. Images of these art installations have gone viral on social media platforms, capturing the attention and support of people around the world.  Art has long been a form of protest and expression during times of political upheaval. It has the ability to inspire, unite, and give voice to those who may otherwise be silenced. In Hong Kong, where freedom is at stake, art becomes a lifeline for those fighting for their rights.  As each day passes, more pieces are added to this open-air gallery - an ever-growing testament to the resilience and creativity that exists within Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. The streets become a living canvas where hope and defiance merge into tangible works that demand change. And while statues may crumble or banners fade over time, the impact that this outpouring of artistic expression leaves on hearts and minds will endure long after democracy is achieved.",continue
"As the protesters chanted and danced, their messages of economic inequality and social justice filled the air. Their presence was a stark contrast to the elite gathering that had just taken place in Davos, where world leaders and business tycoons had discussed global issues behind closed doors.  The small group of activists represented a larger movement known as Occupy Davos, inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement that gained international attention in 2011. Their goal was to challenge the concentration of wealth among a small percentage of individuals and corporations, highlighting the growing disparities between the rich and everyone else.  With colorful costumes and face paint, they aimed to capture attention and generate discussion about these pressing issues. Their message resonated with many people who believed that the world's economic system was rigged in favor of a privileged few. The megaphone-wielding protester passionately spoke about representation for ""the 99%,"" referring to those outside of the wealthiest percentile.  The strumming guitarist provided an acoustic backdrop to their demonstration, adding an artistic touch amidst their advocacy for change. The Italian rock music blaring from an amplifier contributed to an atmosphere buzzing with defiance against established power structures.  Amidst this vibrant display, stood a man sporting a woolly hat with peace symbolically draped around his waist—his presence emphasized unity amidst protest; his rainbow flag represented hope for peace and acceptance amid global unrest.  Their presence did not go unnoticed by conference attendees crossing paths on their way out from Davos. Some stopped briefly to observe or engage in conversations with protesters—a chance encounter that often led them questioning if current systems were indeed equitable.  For many activists here at Occupy Davos, participation alone held great significance—being able to voice concerns directly outside spaces symbolizing wealth accumulation showcased both conviction and resilience against systemic oversights. It allowed them opportunity for dialogue beyond traditional channels such as media coverage or online discussions—an immediate physical connection where impassioned arguments could be made without digital filters.  But while the protesters sought to amplify their message through creative displays and peaceful protests, they faced many challenges. The security cordon surrounding them was a reminder of the tight control maintained by authorities during such high-profile events. Their temporary presence on the outskirts of Davos felt symbolic—an attempt to infiltrate spaces inaccessible to ordinary citizens across much of the year.  However, Occupy Davos understood that change often occurred gradually, through perseverance and a collective momentum growing from grassroots efforts. They hoped their demonstration would spark conversations and inspire others to join in addressing inequality head-on.  As police eventually began dispersing the crowd, the activists knew their time in Davos had come to an end—for now. But they left with a renewed determination to continue fighting for economic equality, social justice, and a more inclusive world. Their actions were small steps towards dismantling systems that perpetuated injustice, striving for transformative change—and making sure voices of dissent remained at the forefront of global discussions impacting society as a whole. As the activists scattered, they took solace in the fact that their message had reached even a few individuals. They knew that true change would require sustained efforts, not just a one-time protest.  Back in their own communities and across social media platforms, Occupy Davos members continued to organize discussions, workshops, and local events. They aimed to educate others about the economic disparities plaguing society and encourage them to take action in their own lives.  Their online presence allowed them to connect with like-minded individuals from around the world who shared similar concerns about inequality. Through virtual forums and webinars, they exchanged ideas on strategies for promoting economic justice and challenging existing power dynamics.  Occupy Davos also recognized the importance of supporting initiatives that aimed to redistribute wealth more equitably. They partnered with local organizations advocating for fair wages, accessible healthcare, affordable housing, and quality education for all. By joining forces with these groups fighting on various fronts against systemic injustices worldwide, they hoped to amplify their collective impact.  Additionally, realizing the significance of engaging policymakers directly in effecting change at a systemic level; some members of Occupy Davos turned their attention toward lobbying efforts locally and internationally. They organized meetings with elected officials or those holding positions of influence within financial institutions. Armed with well-researched data and compelling personal stories illustrating the consequences of inequality firsthand—they sought to persuade decision-makers towards implementing policies promoting fairness and ensuring corporate accountability.  Occupy Davos understood that creating lasting transformation required strategic partnerships across different sectors—uniting workers' unions with grassroots movements; collaborating with academics exploring alternative economic models; seeking alliances within religious organizations advocating for moral responsibility towards marginalized communities.  Their commitment went beyond temporary demonstration or symbolic acts—a sustained effort was necessary if they were ever going to achieve socio-economic justice on a global scale.  As years passed since that day at Davos when protesters briefly grabbed international attention through their colorful display of dissent - it became apparent that Occupy Davos had sparked a conversation that would not be easily silenced. Their spirit of defiance and the fight against inequality resonated with individuals from all walks of life, transcending borders and cultures.  Their influence extended beyond specific policy battles or legislative victories. Occupy Davos had brought attention to systemic issues that had long been swept under the rug. They challenged the status quo and forced leaders to question their own roles in perpetuating inequality.  In the years that followed, there were gradual shifts towards greater economic inclusivity in some countries. Tax reforms were enacted, ensuring that corporations paid their fair share, while social safety nets were strengthened to provide assistance for those struggling to make ends meet. The struggle was far from over, but small victories began accumulating—proof that sustained effort could indeed bring about change.  Occupy Davos became a beacon of hope for activists around the world who believed in challenging entrenched power structures and fighting for justice. They inspired subsequent movements dedicated to addressing issues such as climate change, racial equity, gender equality, and more—not just through protests but also by leveraging technology and social media platforms as powerful tools for organizing and amplifying their voices.  The legacy of Occupy Davos lives on—a reminder that ordinary people possess immense power when they unite behind a common cause. Their actions serve as a blueprint for future generations determined to create a fairer world—one where wealth is not concentrated in the hands of few but is shared equitably by all members of society.

"He also mentioned that the priority would be given to including representatives from different regions and tribes to ensure inclusivity and representation. Jibril's announcement comes at a crucial time for Libya, as it emerges from years of conflict and seeks to establish a stable and unified government.  Since the overthrow of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has faced significant challenges in its transition towards democracy. The power vacuum left by Gaddafi's regime led to a fragmented country with various armed groups vying for control. This instability not only hindered the political process but also created fertile ground for extremist groups like ISIS to gain a foothold.  The establishment of a new government is seen as an important step towards overcoming these challenges. A unified government can provide effective governance, maintain law and order, and work towards national reconciliation. It can also focus on rebuilding infrastructure, reviving the economy, and restoring basic services that have been neglected during years of conflict.  The negotiations surrounding the formation of the new government highlight the complexities involved in uniting various factions within Libya. With diverse regional interests and tribal affiliations at play, reaching consensus on ministerial positions and their distribution across different parts of the country requires careful deliberation.  However, Jibril expressed confidence that most of this work has already been completed. The National Transitional Council has been engaging in intensive discussions with representatives from different factions to build consensus behind this new government formation process.  International stakeholders have played a crucial role in supporting Libya's path towards stability as well. The United Nations has facilitated dialogue between conflicting parties while providing technical expertise for constitution drafting processes. Foreign diplomats have also provided financial aid to assist with reconstruction efforts.  As discussions continue regarding the number of ministries, their allocation across regions becomes equally important. Various cities within Libya have disparate needs stemming from differing priorities such as security concerns or economic revitalization projects. Ensuring each region feels adequately represented could foster trust among Libyans and build a sense of nationhood.  The successful formation of a new government will be vital in addressing the current challenges facing Libya. In addition to internal security and governance issues, Libya also faces external pressures. The ongoing conflict in neighboring countries like Sudan and Chad has the potential to spill over the border, further destabilizing an already fragile region.  Moreover, Libya's geographical location makes it a significant transit point for migrants seeking to cross the Mediterranean into Europe. A functioning government can effectively manage migration flows while working with international partners on comprehensive approaches to address this humanitarian crisis.  Overall, Jibril's announcement of an imminent new government signals hope for Libya's future. It underscores progress made towards national reconciliation and stability after years of division and conflict. While challenges persist, including political divisions and security concerns, the formation of a unified government is crucial for unlocking Libya's potential as a prosperous nation with restored state institutions serving its citizens' needs. International support must continue in assisting this process while respecting Libyan sovereignty and allowing space for local leadership to navigate their own path forward.",continue
"The potential for destruction and devastation that Hurricane Sandy holds is a cause for concern among meteorologists and residents along the U.S. Northeast coast. As the storm continues to gather strength near the northern Bahamas, there is a growing fear that it could make landfall as soon as Monday, unleashing its fury on highly populated areas.  Already responsible for an alarming death toll in the Caribbean, Sandy presents a double threat scenario that could potentially merge with a strong cold front from the west. If this were to happen, it could create what experts are calling a ""superstorm."" This menacing weather event could linger over New England for days, wreaking havoc on communities and infrastructure like never before.  Comparisons have been drawn to 1991's ""Perfect Storm,"" which caused extensive damage along the East Coast. The combination of Hurricane Grace and an extratropical cyclone had devastating consequences, pummeling several states and leaving behind billions of dollars in damages.  However, while parallels can be drawn between these two ominous events, each storm has its distinct characteristics that make them unique. In the case of Sandy, variables such as timing, trajectory, and intensity play crucial roles in determining its potential impact on affected areas.  What sets Hurricane Sandy apart from typical storms is its unusually large size coupled with erratic movement patterns. The immense size of this system enables it to cover vast stretches of land and sea simultaneously — intensifying both wind speeds and precipitation levels within its reach.  Furthermore, current projections suggest that Sandy may take an unprecedented path once it reaches certain latitude conditions. Instead of veering out into open water or curving harmlessly away from coastlines like previous storms often do after reaching this point — known colloquially as ""the turn"" — Sandy might start heading inland instead. If this occurs while simultaneously merging with a powerful cold front coming from the west—a scenario meteorologists refer to as phasing—it would amplify not only wind speed but also rainfall totals, exponentially increasing the threat to affected regions.  Concerns are also being raised about the potential storm surge that would result from Sandy's approach. The combination of high winds and low air pressure creates conditions where seawater can be pushed ashore with devastating force, causing extensive flooding along coastal areas. Low-lying regions susceptible to storm surge, such as parts of New York City and New Jersey, are urged to take necessary precautions and prepare for possible evacuation orders.  As emergency management agencies closely monitor Sandy's progress, residents in vulnerable areas are strongly advised to stay informed and heed any warnings or evacuation orders issued by local authorities. The importance of preparedness cannot be emphasized enough when faced with such an unpredictable and potentially catastrophic event like Hurricane Sandy.  While hope is crucial during times like these, it is equally important for individuals to take proactive measures in securing their properties, stocking up on essential supplies, and ensuring the safety of themselves and their loved ones. By staying vigilant and working together as a community, we can minimize the impact of this impending disaster while standing ready to support those most affected by its wrath.  In times of adversity, resilience is tested—and through collective efforts backed by sound preparation—we can overcome whatever challenges Hurricane Sandy brings our way. Let us not underestimate the power of nature but instead face it head-on with determination, courage, and unity.",continue
"Charlie Rogers' alleged hate crime drew significant attention and sparked outrage across the country, as people rallied together in support of the openly gay woman. Candlelight vigils were held locally, and messages of solidarity flooded social media platforms nationwide. However, as authorities dug deeper into the case, they uncovered evidence that challenged Rogers' version of events.  The Lincoln Police Department's investigation revealed multiple inconsistencies in Charlie Rogers' account of the attack. Physical evidence contradicted her claims and raised doubts about the validity of her story. As a result, authorities decided to charge Rogers with lying to police, ultimately transforming her from victim to suspect.  The news sent shockwaves through both the local community and those who had fervently supported Rodgers from afar. People struggled to make sense of why someone would fabricate such a heinous crime and deceive those who stood behind them passionately.  While authorities began to piece together their case against Rodgers, questions emerged about what could have motivated her actions. Was this an elaborate cry for attention? Or was there something more complex at play?  As news spread about Rodgers' arrest, reactions varied widely among those who were initially sympathetic towards her cause. Some individuals felt betrayed by her alleged deceit while others expressed compassion for any underlying issues she may be facing.  Psychologists weighed in on possible explanations for such false reports or ""factitious disorder imposed on self,"" commonly known as Munchausen syndrome. Individuals with this disorder often create situations that cast them in a role of victim-hood or illness-seeking sympathy and attention from others. While speculation abounded regarding Rodgers' motivations, experts cautioned against making assumptions without further information or professional evaluation.  While public opinion teetered between disappointment and concern for Charlie Rodgers' mental well-being, legal proceedings were set into motion following her arrest. The court system now had the task of determining whether prosecution was warranted given the circumstances surrounding this unusual case.  Local activists who worked tirelessly to combat hate crimes within their community reacted with mixed emotions. On the one hand, they were relieved that this specific incident was not a true hate crime, potentially dispelling fears that their efforts had been in vain. On the other hand, they grappled with how to address this situation moving forward and embodied a renewed commitment to their cause.  For the LGBTQ+ community at large, Rodgers' case highlighted the ongoing struggle for acceptance and equality. False reports like these can create doubt and diminish the credibility of real victims who have experienced hate crimes firsthand. But it also provided an opportunity to reevaluate support structures for those struggling within the community.  As Charlie Rodgers' case continued through the legal system, mental health experts were brought in to evaluate her state of mind during the alleged incident and throughout subsequent events. Their findings would play an instrumental role in determining both her guilt or innocence as well as assessing any underlying psychological factors contributing to her actions.  Ultimately, this case shed light on a complex issue that goes beyond just one individual's actions. It highlighted society's desire to support victims of hate crimes while simultaneously questioning instances where deception may occur. The repercussions of such false reports are significant but should not overshadow our collective responsibility to address and fight against real acts of discrimination faced by marginalized communities every day.",continue
"Nawroz's heart pounds in his chest as he looks up at the crowd. Fear and resignation mix in his eyes, aware that this moment will mark the end of his life. The weight of guilt for taking another man's life weighs heavy on his soul, but he knows that there is no escaping his fate now.  The wind carries whispers through the crowd as they await the impending tragedy. Some are here out of curiosity; others watch with a sense of vindication, believing justice is being served before their eyes. The sun beats down relentlessly, mirroring the tension that hangs heavily in the air.  As Nawroz stands facing his executioner—his lover's grief-stricken father—he searches for a glimmer of humanity within him. This man was once like a father figure to him, offering guidance and support during difficult times. Now their affection has been submerged beneath an ocean of betrayal and vengeance.  With trembling hands, the victim’s father grips the gun tightly while trying to steady himself mentally for what lies ahead. Awash with grief fueled by rage and sorrow, he struggles to reconcile love for both his deceased son and unwanted protectiveness towards Nawroz.  Suddenly memories rush through Nawroz's mind: stolen moments hidden away from prying eyes, wild whispers under moonlit skies – love that they hoped could conquer all barriers erected by society and tradition. But love had led them astray; it had cost them everything they held dear—a hefty price neither were willing to pay until it was too late.

Until society can replace vengeance with compassion and redemption, stories like these will forever stain their soil with sorrowful tears shed by those both guilty and innocent alike.",continue
"The ongoing debate between House Speaker John Boehner and President Barack Obama over the issue of tax revenue has brought the fiscal cliff negotiations to a standstill. While Boehner is adamant that the wealthy should contribute more towards addressing the nation's financial challenges, Obama remains firm in his belief that only the highest-earning 2% should face increased taxes.  Boehner's argument centers around cutting spending and increasing revenues. He acknowledges that it is necessary to put additional funds on the table, but believes these funds should come from those who can afford it most - the rich. The Speaker suggests limiting deductions, closing loopholes, and implementing mechanisms to ensure higher-income individuals pay a larger share of their income towards federal taxes.  This approach is met with resistance from Obama, who argues against raising tax rates as he believes it will harm economic growth. Instead, he insists on ensuring that only those individuals earning above a certain threshold face an increase in their taxes. Once this condition is met, he proposes moving forward with broader discussions to address long-term deficits and debt issues.  The divide between Democrats and Republicans on this matter reflects deeper ideological differences regarding wealth redistribution and government intervention in economic matters. Democrats argue for a more progressive taxation system where those who earn more contribute proportionally higher percentages of their income towards societal needs. On the other hand, Republicans tend to advocate for lower tax rates across all income brackets as they believe this stimulates economic growth by incentivizing private investment.  As both sides refuse to budge from their respective positions, there are concerns about what may happen if no agreement is reached before reaching the fiscal cliff deadline. This scenario would trigger automatic spending cuts—also known as sequestration—and tax increases across various sectors of society.  Many economists warn that going over the fiscal cliff could push the country back into recession or exacerbate existing economic challenges caused by COVID-19 effects. Furthermore, failure to address long-term deficits could result in increased borrowing costs for the government and potential downgrades in the country's credit rating.  With high stakes on both sides, it is imperative that political leaders find common ground to strike a deal that addresses short-term economic concerns while also setting the foundation for long-term fiscal responsibility. Both Boehner and Obama must recognize the importance of compromise and understand that no single party can achieve all of its objectives in this negotiation.  The American people are looking for leadership and solutions, not partisan bickering. It is crucial for Boehner and Obama to put aside ideological differences and prioritize the well-being of the nation. By sitting down together, they have an opportunity to set an example of bipartisan cooperation, showing that effective governance is possible even in times of disagreement.  Time is running out, and failure to reach an agreement would have dire consequences not only for Washington policymakers but also for millions of Americans who rely on their decisions. The future direction of the economy hangs in the balance, emphasizing just how critical it is for Boehner and Obama to find common ground before it's too late.",continue
"""But then I realized that there were other players who were just as talented, if not more so, but they didn't have the same level of coaching or access to facilities that I did. It made me realize that talent alone is not enough.""  Syed's viewpoint challenges the traditional belief that talent is innate and cannot be taught or developed. He argues that while some individuals may have certain genetic advantages, such as being tall for basketball or having a high metabolism for endurance sports, these factors alone do not guarantee success.  Instead, Syed highlights the importance of what he calls ""purposeful practice."" This is not just aimlessly repeating an activity but rather engaging in deliberate and focused training with specific goals in mind. According to Syed, world-class athletes like Bolt and Phelps are not just naturally gifted; they have put in countless hours of purposeful practice to hone their skills.  ""You don't become great by accident,"" Syed asserts. ""It takes years of focused effort and deliberate practice to reach the top level.""  In his book ""Bounce,"" Syed cites numerous studies highlighting the power of purposeful practice in achieving mastery. One study by psychologist Anders Ericsson found that expert violinists had practiced an average of 10,000 hours before reaching international levels of performance.  But it's not just about quantity; quality also matters. Purposeful practice involves pushing oneself beyond one's comfort zone and constantly seeking out new challenges and feedback. It requires disciplined focus and mental fortitude.  Another crucial component often overlooked is coaching. According to Syed, a key factor separating elite athletes from amateurs is the support they receive from skilled coaches who provide guidance, expertise, and motivation.  ""A good coach can shape an athlete's development by identifying weaknesses, providing valuable feedback on technique or strategy, and instilling a winning mindset,"" says Syed.  Coaches play a critical role in creating the conditions for success: designing effective training programs tailored to individual needs, monitoring progress, and offering psychological support. Their experience and expertise are invaluable in helping athletes overcome obstacles and reach their full potential.  Access to facilities is another aspect that Syed believes influences an athlete's journey towards excellence. World-class training facilities equipped with state-of-the-art equipment can provide athletes with the resources necessary for optimal performance. However, he acknowledges that not all athletes have equal access to such facilities due to economic or geographical constraints.  While talent alone may not determine athletic success, it would be naive to dismiss its role entirely. Syed acknowledges that certain individuals may possess genetic advantages or innate physical attributes that give them a head start in specific sports. However, he emphasizes that even these individuals must put in the work through purposeful practice and quality coaching if they want to excel at the highest level.  Ultimately, Syed's perspective offers hope for aspiring athletes who may have been discouraged by the notion of ""natural talent."" It suggests that anyone with dedication, discipline, and access to proper training can overcome perceived limitations and achieve greatness in their chosen sport. Talent is just one piece of the puzzle; hard work and opportunity play equally important roles on the road to sporting stardom.",continue
"Veronica's birth mother, Christy Maldonado, was of Hispanic and Caucasian descent, while her birth father, Dusten Brown, was a member of the Cherokee Nation. The couple had been engaged but later separated before Veronica was born.  Christy decided to place Veronica for adoption as she believed it would provide her with a stable and secure future. Dusten supported the decision at that time, feeling it was best for their daughter. Without knowing the complexities that lay ahead, they chose a non-Native American couple from South Carolina, Matt and Melanie Capobianco, to be Veronica's adoptive parents.  However, when Veronica turned four months old and custody proceedings were underway for her adoption in South Carolina state court in 2011, Dusten discovered his Native American heritage could have far-reaching implications on his parental rights under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The ICWA is a federal law enacted in 1978 to counteract long-standing practices of removing Native American children from their families and tribes unjustly.  Since Dusten belonged to the Cherokee Nation -- making Veronica part Native American - ICWA came into effect in their case. Under this law, preference is given to placing Native American children with extended family members or within their tribe whenever possible.  Dusten contended that he wasn't properly notified about Christy's plans for adoption nor provided with an opportunity to assert his rights as a father before agreeing to relinquish custody. He believed he should have been accorded these considerations under ICWA due to his Indian heritage.  A lengthy legal battle ensued as both sets of parents fought vigorously over custody rights. In June 2013, after multiple appeals and court proceedings across different jurisdictions including state courts in Oklahoma and South Carolina as well as federal courts weighed on various aspects of the case – including constitutional issues – the U.S Supreme Court handed down its decision: reconciliation panels had found sufficient evidence indicating Veronica's placement with her biological father was in her best interests and conformed to ICWA's requirements.  Veronica, aged two at the time, was transferred into Dusten's custody. Heartbroken and devastated, but upholding their belief in the sanctity of the law and acknowledging Veronica's right to have a relationship with both her birth parents, Matt and Melanie returned home to South Carolina without their beloved daughter.  Since then, Veronica has been living with Dusten in Oklahoma. Custody exchanges between Matt and Melanie continued for a while to allow visitation rights as they sought alternative legal avenues. However, despite these efforts, they had not been able to regain custody or establish regular contact with Veronica over the years.  The case reignited debates surrounding adoption laws involving Native American children and explicitly highlighted complexities within ICWA itself. Supporters of ICWA advocate its necessity for preserving cultural identity among Native American tribes by preventing forced assimilation through adoption outside of tribal communities. Critics argue that supremacy given exclusively based on race can infringe upon individual parental rights or prevent children from finding loving homes outside their tribes if necessary.  Ultimately, these complex issues boil down to determining what is truly in a child's best interests – weighing cultural preservation against individual autonomy – presenting an ongoing challenge within this legal framework that will likely continue shaping future cases concerning Native American adoption.",continue
"This steady rise in the number of children diagnosed with autism is a cause for concern among experts and parents alike. Autism is a complex developmental disorder that affects a person's ability to communicate and interact with others. While there is no known cure for autism, early intervention and therapy can significantly improve a child's quality of life.  One possible reason for the increase in autism diagnoses is improved awareness and screening practices. Over the past decade, there has been greater recognition of the signs and symptoms of autism, leading to more accurate and timely diagnoses. In addition, healthcare providers have become better equipped to identify children on the autism spectrum through various screening tools.  Another factor contributing to the rising numbers could be changes in diagnostic criteria. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association revised its diagnostic manual (DSM-5), broadening the definition of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and eliminating separate subcategories such as Asperger's syndrome. This change may have led to more individuals being included under the umbrella term of ASD.  Genetic factors are also believed to play a role in the prevalence of autism. Research has shown that certain genetic variations may increase an individual's susceptibility to developing ASD. However, these genetic factors alone cannot explain such rapid increases over a short period.  Some scientists also suggest environmental influences as potential contributors to this surge in autism cases. Exposure to certain chemicals or toxins during prenatal development or early childhood has been hypothesized as possible risk factors for developing ASD but concrete evidence linking specific environmental triggers remains limited.  Regardless of causation, addressing healthcare services for individuals with ASD must be prioritized given this upward trend observed over time drastically impacting educational systems requiring additional funding per special needs student requirements.  Early identification and intervention are crucial as they can greatly impact an individual's overall development and prognosis throughout adolescence into adulthood.As communities better understand how pervasive developmental disorders affect each child differently specialists can create personalized treatment plans utilizing various therapeutic interventions tailored specifically towards their needs.  With the increasing prevalence of autism, it is essential that public awareness and acceptance also grow. Society needs to embrace neurodiversity – the understanding that individuals with autism have unique strengths and abilities, albeit sometimes with added challenges in certain areas. By fostering inclusivity and support for individuals on the autism spectrum, society can help create an environment where each person can thrive to their fullest potential.  In conclusion, the rise in autism prevalence highlights the need for continued research, improved healthcare services, early detection and intervention efforts. The increase may be due to factors such as increased awareness, changes in diagnostic criteria, genetic predisposition or environmental influences. Regardless of causes, it is vital that resources and support are allocated adequately to help individuals with ASD live fulfilling lives while receiving appropriate care throughout their lifespan. Moreover, the increase in autism prevalence also calls for increased funding and resources to support individuals with ASD and their families. Many families face significant financial burdens due to the costs associated with therapy, specialized education, and other necessary interventions. It is crucial for policymakers to recognize this growing demand for services and allocate sufficient resources to meet the needs of these families.  Additionally, schools must be adequately equipped to accommodate students with autism. With more children being diagnosed with ASD, classrooms are becoming increasingly diverse in terms of learning styles and needs. Teachers need access to training programs that provide them with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively support students on the spectrum. Furthermore, schools should consider implementing inclusive practices that create a welcoming environment for all students, regardless of neurodiversity.  Beyond education settings, workplaces also need to prioritize inclusion and accommodation for individuals with autism. With appropriate support systems in place, individuals on the spectrum can excel in various careers and contribute valuable skills to society. Encouraging employers to embrace diversity and provide accommodations will not only benefit employees but also foster a more inclusive work culture overall.  Furthermore, continued research is essential in understanding the causes of autism as well as developing more effective interventions. The field of genetics holds promise for identifying specific gene variations associated with ASD while environmental research can shed light on potential triggers or risk factors linked to its development.  Finally yet importantly, spreading awareness about autism is crucial for reducing stigma surrounding it within societies.This increased awareness will encourage acceptance,and understanding.To achieve this goal,it is vital that media represents individuals living on autistic spectrum truthfully while promoting accurate information.Organizations,hospitals,and advocacy groups should collaborate towards creating platforms dedicated imparting correct information about diagnosis,treatment options,and dispelling common myths.As a result,society at large will foster inclusivity by accommodating needs actionable guidelines based on trusted theories & proven scientific methodologies  In conclusion,the rising number of children diagnosed with autism demands attention from both an individual care perspective and broader societal approach. It calls for comprehensive support systems, increased funding, improved education, and inclusive practices to ensure that individuals with autism can live fulfilling lives and fully participate in their communities. By addressing the challenges associated with autism, society can create a more inclusive and accepting environment for all individuals, regardless of neurodiversity, fostering a stronger sense of unity and understanding amongst everyone.",continue
"The case against the two police officers in Fullerton, California, sparked outrage and public outcry due to the excessive force used that resulted in the death of a suspect. It is clear that this incident represents a larger issue within law enforcement: the abuse of power by those who are supposed to protect and serve.  It is essential to address this issue head-on with a strong message: no one is above the law, including those with badges. By holding these officers accountable for their actions, we send a powerful signal that the days of unchecked police brutality are over.  The role of juries in cases like this becomes crucial. They bear the responsibility of determining guilt or innocence based on evidence presented during trial. In this particular case, it will be up to them to examine all aspects, hear testimonies from witnesses and experts, and come to an informed decision about whether these officers should be held criminally responsible for their actions.  But more than just deciding the fate of these two individuals, this jury has an opportunity to make a statement about how society views police misconduct. The outcome of this trial could set a precedent whereby future instances of abuse by police officers are met with swift punishment rather than being brushed under the rug or excused as ""isolated incidents.""  By prosecuting officers who commit acts of violence and abuse while on duty, we not only seek justice for victims but also work towards restoring trust between law enforcement agencies and communities they serve. When community members perceive authorities as accountable for their actions and genuinely dedicated to ensuring public safety without prejudice or discrimination, they may feel more comfortable cooperating with them.  It should be reiterated that most police officers fulfill their duties honorably every day; however it is vital not to overlook instances where trust has been breached. In order for our society's relationship with law enforcement agencies to thrive mutually beneficially — facilitating cooperation between communities and authorities — action must be taken against those who misuse their power.  This case also brings attention to the importance of proper training and oversight within police departments. Officers should be equipped with the necessary tools to handle difficult situations without resorting to excessive force. Moreover, internal systems need to exist for reporting and addressing instances of misconduct promptly.  In recent years, there have been significant steps toward reform in this area, including increased use of body cameras, independent review boards, and improved officer training. However, there is still much work to be done. Instances like this one in Fullerton serve as painful reminders that progress can only be achieved through sustained effort and a commitment from both law enforcement agencies and communities.  Ultimately, it is up to us as citizens to demand accountability and transparency from those who hold positions of power – particularly those entrusted with ensuring our safety. By supporting thorough investigations into allegations of police misconduct and actively participating in our justice system through jury duty or advocacy for policy changes, we can work towards a future where no one abuses their authority without consequence.  The fate of the two police officers in Fullerton will have implications beyond their individual case; it will send a resounding message about society's intolerance for abuse by anyone wearing a badge. It is time for us all – civilians, law enforcement agencies, judicial systems – 	to stand together against injustice within our ranks so that we may build safer and more equitable communities for everyone.",continue

"The release of the audio recording has sparked renewed hope in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The aircraft was carrying 239 people onboard and its disappearance remains one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history.  The underwater sound captured by the listening devices is a significant development in the ongoing investigation. However, experts caution that it is still too early to confirm whether this signal is indeed related to the missing plane. Additional analysis and confirmation will be required before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.  The researchers at Curtin University have been meticulously studying records from underwater listening devices for weeks, focusing on signals that could potentially be linked to the final moments of Flight 370. These devices were originally installed to monitor underwater nuclear explosions but have since proved useful in other research areas.  Alec Duncan explains that they detected ""one signal"" on multiple receivers that could possibly be connected to the crash. This particular signal exhibits characteristics that are consistent with either an impact or a structural failure of parts as they sank into the water. By analyzing its unique frequency and intensity patterns, scientists hope to determine whether it aligns with what would be expected during such an event.  To validate their findings, researchers are cross-referencing this audio data with other known sounds associated with past airplane crashes into bodies of water. This comparison will enable them to identify any similarities or discrepancies and enhance their understanding of what transpired during Flight 370's unfortunate fate.  It's important to note that this potential breakthrough comes after years of exhaustive search efforts involving multiple countries and advanced technologies such as satellite imagery, sonar scans, and extensive ocean floor mapping exercises. Despite these substantial endeavors covering vast stretches of oceanic terrain where debris could potentially lie hidden beneath layers of silt or scattered across rugged seabed topography – no substantial piece has ever been definitively linked back to Flight 370.  The underwater sound recording provides renewed motivation for authorities and investigators to continue their search, despite the numerous setbacks faced thus far. The potential breakthrough could be a turning point in shedding light on the mysterious disappearance of Flight 370 and providing closure to families who have long awaited answers.  However, it is crucial not to elevate expectations prematurely or overlook the immense challenges that lie ahead. The vastness of the search area, which spans thousands of square miles, coupled with limited technological capabilities when it comes to deep-sea exploration, adds significant complexity to locating any wreckage.  Furthermore, even if debris is eventually discovered in the identified vicinity of this audio signal, issues concerning retrieval and confirmation still remain. Deep-sea salvage operations are intricate undertakings that require specialized equipment and expertise. Moreover, positively identifying retrieved debris as belonging to Flight 370 necessitates rigorous forensic analysis, a process that can take considerable time.  In conclusion, while this audio recording offers a glimmer of hope in uncovering answers about Flight 370's disappearance after nearly eight years of uncertainty, caution should be exercised until further investigations corroborate these findings. The world remains vigilant as we wait for conclusive evidence regarding one of aviation's most baffling mysteries – Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.",continue
"However, it would be a mistake to dismiss North Korea's actions as simply part of this ongoing dance. The severity and frequency of their provocations have escalated in recent years, raising concerns about the stability of the Korean Peninsula and the potential for conflict in the region.  One reason for this escalation is Kim Jong Un's desire to consolidate his power within North Korea. When he assumed leadership after his father's death in 2011, he faced skepticism both domestically and internationally about his ability to lead. To prove himself as a strong leader, Kim has pursued increasingly provocative actions, such as nuclear tests and missile launches.  Furthermore, North Korea sees these provocations as a means of gaining leverage in its negotiations with the international community. The regime seeks concessions in exchange for toning down its aggressive behavior. By displaying its military capabilities and testing weapons, Pyongyang hopes to demonstrate that it cannot be ignored or undermined.  Moreover, North Korea faces significant economic challenges that contribute to its belligerent behavior. International sanctions have severely limited its access to foreign markets and resources. Additionally, decades of mismanagement and neglect have left the country economically impoverished.  By engaging in provocative acts like missile launches or nuclear tests, North Korea aims to divert attention away from these internal problems while signaling its desperation for economic assistance. The regime believes that by creating regional instability through military posturing, it can force negotiations that could lead to sanctions relief or aid from other countries.  The West must take these provocations seriously because they threaten regional stability and global security. While diplomatic efforts should always be prioritized over military retaliation when dealing with such situations, ignoring or downplaying North Korea's actions could embolden the regime further.  North Korea already possesses nuclear weapons capability – one of few countries outside established nuclear powers – along with an arsenal of ballistic missiles capable of reaching neighboring countries including South Korea and Japan. As their technology continues to improve through ongoing testing programs like those witnessed recently, the potential danger posed by North Korea becomes ever more significant.  The international community must put pressure on North Korea through united and coordinated efforts. Sanctions should be strengthened, targeting not only weapons programs but also key individuals and entities responsible for human rights abuses within the regime.  Additionally, diplomatic channels should remain open, with an emphasis on dialogue and negotiation to address the underlying issues driving North Korea's provocations. This includes concerns about its security, economic hardships, and desire for international recognition as a legitimate nation.  In conclusion, it is crucial for the West to avoid complacency when it comes to North Korean provocations. The country's actions are escalating in severity and frequency with each passing year. A calculated approach that balances diplomatic efforts with firmness will be necessary to address this ongoing threat to regional stability and global security effectively. Moreover, the international community should work towards engaging regional powers, such as China and Russia, in finding a solution to the North Korean crisis. Both countries have close ties with North Korea and can exert influence over its actions. By involving them in the diplomatic process, there is a greater chance of finding a peaceful resolution.  It is important to remember that any military response to North Korea's provocations would likely result in catastrophic consequences. The heavily fortified border between North and South Korea, known as the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), is one of the most volatile areas in the world. Any miscalculation or escalation could trigger a full-scale conflict with devastating casualties.  Instead, cultivating dialogue and seeking common ground should be prioritized. The West should explore avenues for engagement with North Korea that address its concerns while upholding international norms and principles. This could include offering economic incentives or security guarantees in exchange for verifiable steps towards denuclearization.  Efforts should also be made to improve communication channels between all parties involved. Regular dialogue can help de-escalate tensions and prevent misunderstandings that may trigger unintended consequences. Establishing dedicated hotlines or increasing diplomatic exchanges could contribute to building trust and reducing the likelihood of an inadvertent conflict.  Furthermore, humanitarian assistance should not be forgotten amidst political calculations. The people of North Korea already suffer from severe economic hardships due to sanctions imposed on their government. It is crucial for humanitarian aid organizations to have access to vulnerable populations within the country so that necessary supplies can reach those who need it most without being used as tools for political gain by the regime.  Lastly, it is essential for Western governments and media outlets to provide accurate information about North Korea. Sensationalism only serves to heighten fears and misunderstanding about this isolated nation which already faces significant challenges both domestically and internationally.  By understanding the complex factors behind North Korea's actions rather than resorting solely to demonization or fear-mongering, the West can approach the situation with a more balanced and effective strategy. This includes recognizing that North Korea's provocations stem from a desire for self-preservation, economic assistance, and international recognition.  Ultimately, finding a peaceful resolution to the North Korean crisis requires patience, perseverance, and an unwavering commitment to diplomacy. The West must continue to work towards de-escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula while addressing the underlying issues that give rise to North Korea's provocative behavior. By doing so, there is hope for stability and peace in this region fraught with tension and uncertainty.",continue
"Christie's steadfast denial of any involvement in the traffic lane closures known as ""Bridgegate"" has become a defining aspect of his response to the scandal. However, despite his assertions, many people remain skeptical and questioning his credibility.  The alleged motive behind the lane closures was political retribution against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee for not endorsing Christie's gubernatorial reelection campaign. The closures caused massive gridlock on the bridge and surrounding areas, inconveniencing thousands of commuters for several days in September 2013.  As investigations into Bridgegate unfolded, evidence began to suggest that members of Christie's administration might have been involved. Emails and text messages were discovered linking top officials in Christie's office to discussions about a plan to create traffic problems as punishment for the mayor. The documents indicated a possible cover-up by those involved.  Despite mounting evidence implicating key members of his staff, Christie reiterated that he had no knowledge or involvement in these activities. He insisted that he first learned about it when it became public through news reports in January 2014.  Skeptics doubted how someone so close to the operation could be unaware of such significant actions taken by their subordinates. Critics questioned whether this demonstrated incompetence or willful ignorance on Christie's part.  The scandal took a toll on Christie's popularity and political stature. Once seen as a rising star within the Republican Party with presidential ambitions, he found himself under intense scrutiny and lost credibility among both supporters and opponents alike. His approval ratings plummeted as doubts grew about his honesty and leadership abilities.  To salvage what remained of his reputation, Christie launched an internal investigation led by prominent attorney Randy Mastro to examine what happened during Bridgegate fully. The report declared that no evidence exists linking Governor Christie directly to any wrongdoing or prior knowledge regarding the lane closures.  However, critics argued that this report lacked impartiality since it was commissioned by Governor Christie himself rather than through an independent body such as state or federal law enforcement agencies. They criticized the investigation's limited scope and argued that it may have been more of a public relations effort to protect Christie.  In the years following the scandal, Bridgegate continued to cast a shadow over Christie's political ambitions. He attempted to distance himself from any association with those involved in the lane closures and sought to rebuild his reputation as a bipartisan problem solver. Nonetheless, many people remained unconvinced about his innocence and sincerity throughout this process.  While Bridgegate may have hindered Christie's chances at seeking higher office, he eventually found a role within the administration of President Donald Trump. In 2016, Christie endorsed Trump for president and became one of his most prominent surrogates during the campaign.  Although Chris Christie avoided prosecution in relation to ""Bridgegate,"" it remains a stain on his political legacy. The episode served as a cautionary tale about the dangerous consequences of abusing power or turning a blind eye to wrongdoing within an administration.  Whether or not he was directly involved in orchestrating Bridgegate, Chris Christie will always be associated with this scandal that marred his time as governor and impacted public trust in government officials. It is an enduring reminder of how quickly reputations can unravel when integrity comes into question.",continue

The process itself has evolved over time. This year's draw promises to be more intricate than previous editions. In keeping with FIFA's objective to promote fairness and competitiveness, several changes have been implemented. The traditional method of placing teams into pots based solely on geographical regions has been abandoned in favor of a new system.  Under this new approach, teams will be divided into four pots based on their FIFA rankings rather than geographic proximity or confederation affiliation alone. This ensures greater balance in each group by distributing powerhouses and underdogs more evenly across the board.  The significance of this restructuring cannot be overstated; it adds an extra layer of intrigue to an already captivating event. Traditional football giants may find themselves pitted against strong lower-ranked teams early on in what could potentially turn into David vs Goliath encounters.  For host nation Brazil, this draw presents an opportunity beyond simply knowing their group stage opponents. It is a chance for renewed positivity amidst months of negative headlines surrounding construction delays and protests against escalating costs.  Brazilian fans will anxiously wait to see where their beloved Seleção falls within the brackets at this crucial moment in their journey towards redemption after suffering disappointment on home soil back in 1950 when Uruguay snatched victory from under their noses at Maracanã stadium.  Their hopes are undoubtedly high, and the draw can either fan the flames of excitement or temper their expectations. Playing on home turf brings its own set of pressures, but it is also a chance for Brazil to capitalize on the support and passion of their fervent fans. They will be determined to recreate past glories and hoist that coveted trophy once again.  However, as the participants anxiously wait for their fate to be revealed, one thing remains certain: this World Cup promises to be an unparalleled spectacle. From the iconic stadiums like Maracanã and Estádio Mineirão to the vibrant atmosphere that only Brazil can deliver, football enthusiasts worldwide are in for a treat.  The tournament itself will serve as a celebration of unity among nations as they compete with grace and sportsmanship. For one month, boundaries are blurred as people from all walks of life rally around their respective teams, forming temporary allegiances based on shared dreams and joyous celebrations.  Ultimately, while the draw sets the stage for thrilling matchups and heated rivalries, it is important not to underestimate the power of sheer determination and belief that each team possesses. Past tournaments have taught us that underdogs can defy all odds while favorites may stumble along their journey.  In just a few days' time when those delicate balls are plucked from glass bowls under intense scrutiny at Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia state by legends of football past -- dreams will be forged anew. The road to Rio beckons; let the games begin!",continue
"They allegedly asked him about his son's activities and threatened that if Mahdi did not cooperate, they would make his life difficult. The Hashi family felt trapped, caught between the security services and the fear of being wrongly targeted as terrorists.  Growing increasingly desperate, Mahdi Hashi made the difficult decision to leave Britain in 2009 and go to Somalia. He thought that by leaving, he could escape the pressure from MI5. However, little did he know that his troubles were far from over.  In Somalia, Hashi struggled to find stability amidst a country plagued by violence and terrorism. Nevertheless, he managed to build a life for himself there. He got married and had children while working as a web designer for local organizations.  But everything changed when Mahdi decided to visit his family in Djibouti in 2012. As he left Somalia through Mogadishu airport, he was abruptly detained by local authorities who handed him over to U.S intelligence agents.  Hashi's family received no information regarding his whereabouts or well-being for months until news broke that he had been secretly flown to an undisclosed location outside of Somalia. It wasn't until two years later that they discovered Mahdi was being held at a maximum-security prison facility in New York City.  Mahdi Hashi was accused of conspiring with Al-Shabaab terrorists in East Africa and providing them with material support. The charges stunned both him and his family; they vehemently denied any involvement with terrorism or extremist groups. To them, it seemed like a blatant attempt by MI5 to justify their relentless pursuit of their son.  His trial proceedings were shrouded in secrecy under national security grounds while accusations piled up against him based on classified evidence unavailable even to his defense team. Despite numerous attempts from advocates demanding transparency and fairness in court proceedings, justice remained elusive for Mahdi Hashi.  Finally, after years of legal battles and imprisonment without conviction, Hashi struck a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors in 2014. In exchange for admitting to conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, he received a shorter sentence of nine years.  The Hashi family saw this as a bittersweet victory. While relieved that their son would serve a reduced sentence compared to the potential life imprisonment he faced, they believed that his guilty plea was coerced and an outcome of the years of pressure from MI5.  Now serving his time in federal prison in the United States, Mahdi Hashi maintains his innocence and strives for justice. He hopes that one day people will see through the web of secrecy surrounding his case and recognize the truth about his ordeal.  Mahdi's story is not unique, highlighting larger issues surrounding national security agencies' tactics and accountability. The case raises questions about how far intelligence services can go in their pursuit of national security before intruding on individual liberties and resorting to harassment tactics against innocent civilians.  For now, Mahdi Hashi continues to fight from behind bars while his family remains determined to shed light on MI5's alleged misconduct. They believe that holding these powerful agencies accountable is crucial not only for their son but also for upholding justice and protecting civil liberties in society as a whole.",continue
"I arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila with a sense of urgency. The airport was buzzing with activity as people hurriedly made their way to their respective destinations, trying to beat the arrival of the approaching storm. The departure board showed that my flight to Tacloban was still on schedule, giving me hope that I would make it in time.  As I boarded the plane, there was an air of apprehension among the passengers. We all knew what awaited us at our destination - a town still reeling from the devastation caused by Haiyan just over a year ago. Many had lost their homes and loved ones, and now they had to brace themselves for another potentially catastrophic typhoon.  The flight took off without any issues, and for a brief moment, I allowed myself to relax. However, my relief quickly turned into concern as ominous dark clouds loomed ahead. Turbulence shook the plane violently, causing uneasiness among both seasoned travelers and first-timers alike.  It became clear that we wouldn't be able to land in Tacloban due to worsening weather conditions. The pilot announced that we were being rerouted back to Manila for safety reasons. Disappointment washed over me as I thought about the valuable time lost.  Back in Manila's overcrowded airport, chaos ensued as hundreds of stranded passengers scrambled for information on rescheduled flights or alternative transportation options. With limited resources available during such times of crisis, frustration grew among weary travelers desperately trying to reach their destinations.  After hours spent negotiating ticket changes and countless phone calls trying to secure any mode of transport available, I managed to book a seat on an overnight ferry heading towards Leyte Island where Tacloban is located.  Stepping onto the crowded ferry felt like entering another world altogether – one filled with exhaustion but also resilience and determination among those who refused to be defeated by nature's wrath once again.  The journey across rough seas seemed never-ending as the ferry battled strong winds and turbulent waves. Many passengers succumbed to seasickness, their faces pale and drained of color. Nonetheless, there was a sense of solidarity among us, knowing that we were all in this together.  As we finally neared Tacloban's port, the storm had already made landfall. The once bustling city now lay eerily quiet under dark skies and heavy rain. Piles of debris from previous disasters served as haunting reminders of what this community had endured.  I reached out to locals who shared their stories with me – tales of survival, loss, and resilience. They recounted how they had rebuilt their lives after Haiyan's wrath tore through their homes and families. Now facing another major typhoon, their determination to rebuild once again shone through their tired eyes.  Over the next few days, I witnessed firsthand the impact of Hagupit on Tacloban – flooded streets, damaged infrastructure, and people seeking shelter in evacuation centers. But amidst the destruction and despair, I also saw hope and compassion as individuals came together to support one another in times of need.  Covering such tragedies is never easy but witnessing humanity's strength in the face of adversity is what drives journalists like myself to keep telling these stories.  As I finally left Tacloban for my journey back home; weary yet grateful for experiencing firsthand both nature's fury and human resilience; I knew that this was just one chapter in an ongoing story for these communities affected by natural disasters.  The memory of those determined faces will forever stay with me - a reminder that no matter how unpredictable or relentless storms may be - hope prevails even when it seems lost among dark clouds looming overhead.",continue

In a region plagued by violence, where journalists are often targeted for reporting on drug cartel activities, this Facebook page has become a lifeline for those seeking accurate information about the realities of life in Tamaulipas.  Tamaulipas is a state that has long struggled with security issues due to its strategic location along the US-Mexico border. It serves as a major transit point for drug smuggling, making it the battleground for rival cartels seeking control over lucrative trafficking routes.

"As the Waldo Canyon Fire continued to rage on, firefighters from across the nation joined forces to combat the relentless flames. With their skills and expertise put to the test, they matched wits with this fiendish wildfire that seemed determined to outsmart them at every turn. The blaze had already consumed structures and forced thousands of residents in Colorado Springs and neighboring communities to evacuate.  However, just as officials had predicted, Mother Nature provided yet another challenge — erratic winds. As afternoon descended upon the area, strong gusts fanned the flames and created an even more dangerous situation. The gusty winds increased the likelihood of embers jumping fire lines, igniting new fires elsewhere, and further exacerbating an already dire situation.  Despite these challenging conditions, incident commander Rich Harvey expressed cautious optimism. He acknowledged that they were learning from their experience fighting this fire and discovering some of its tricks along the way. A key revelation was that when facing these hillsides ablaze with wildfire, it would often choose a specific path downwards – a pattern our seasoned firefighters were beginning to grasp.  Harvey acknowledged that while they may be initially deceived by these tricks once or even twice, there was no doubt that they would adapt quickly as they gained insights into its behavior patterns. They remained determined not only to contain this vicious inferno but also outsmart it at every step.  With containment still standing at a measly 5%, officials knew they had an arduous task ahead before achieving any significant progress against this rampant wildfire. Sadly, due to ongoing firefighting efforts and prioritizing public safety above all else during these early stages of containment measures — conducting an inventory of lost or damaged structures had been impossible until now.  The destructive nature of wildfires can leave long-lasting scars both physically and emotionally on affected communities. As families anxiously awaited updates about their homes' fate in Waldo Canyon's path — concerns for loved ones' well-being weighed heavily on their hearts.  Amidst the chaos and uncertainty, the response from neighboring communities and even nationwide was overwhelming. Volunteers rallied together to provide crucial support to those who had lost everything or were forcibly displaced from their homes. As makeshift shelters were established, individuals offered supplies, food, shelter, and a shoulder to lean on during these trying times.  Fundraising initiatives were born out of the collective determination to assist those affected by the fire's wrath. Donations poured in from concerned citizens across the country wanting to make a difference. These acts of compassion served as a reminder that in times of tragedy, humanity can unite for a greater cause, lending strength and hope when it is needed most.  As darkness fell over Colorado Springs on that fateful day, firefighters continued battling tirelessly against an adversary that seemed relentless. They knew they couldn't let their guard down for even a moment as embers danced through the air like fireflies in search of fresh fuel.  The resolve within these heroes remained unshakeable as they persisted with their mission — bringing this mighty inferno under control once and for all. They fought not only for themselves but also on behalf of every person whose lives had been disrupted by this devastating wildfire.  The battle may have been far from over, but with each passing hour spent combating this formidable blaze — firefighters grew more determined than ever before. They would conquer these tricks played by Waldo Canyon Fire and ensure its reign of destruction came to an end soon. For now, all they could do was press forward with renewed vigor and unwavering determination until victory was secured at last",continue
"These factors laid the groundwork for the rise of ISIS, a radical extremist group that has capitalized on the chaos and grievances in both Syria and Iraq. The beheadings of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff served as a wake-up call to the international community, but unfortunately, it took the tragic death of British aid worker David Haines for action to be taken.  The West's failure to address the root causes of instability in Syria and Iraq allowed ISIS to flourish. It is not enough to simply condemn their acts of violence; a comprehensive approach is needed to tackle this complex issue. This means addressing not only the immediate threat posed by ISIS but also addressing its underlying causes.  One crucial factor that contributed to ISIS's rise was President al-Assad's brutal crackdown on peaceful protestors during the Arab Spring. The West failed to take decisive action at that time, allowing al-Assad's regime to continue its atrocities unchecked. Instead of supporting moderate rebel groups early on, which could have potentially stabilized Syria and countered extremism, there was hesitation and indecision from Western powers.  In Iraq, after years of war and intense sectarian tensions, democratic elections were held in 2010 with hopes for a more inclusive government. However, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki pursued policies that alienated Sunni populations which felt marginalized under his rule. The West turned a blind eye or even supported these exclusionary policies because it perceived al-Maliki as an ally against terrorism.  The West made short-sighted decisions by prioritizing stability over long-term inclusivity and democracy-building efforts in both countries. This created fertile ground for extremist groups like ISIS to recruit disenchanted individuals who felt ignored or oppressed by their own governments.  Furthermore, Western interventions in Libya without proper planning for post-conflict stabilization also contributed indirectly to ISIS's rise across North Africa and the Middle East region. These interventions left power vacuums filled by competing armed factions where extremist ideologies easily took hold.  It is essential that the international community learns from these mistakes and takes a comprehensive approach to combatting the ISIS threat. This means not only carrying out military operations against their strongholds but also addressing the underlying grievances that have allowed extremism to flourish.  This requires supporting moderate opposition groups in Syria, pushing for political solutions and an inclusive government that represents all segments of society. In Iraq, it means using diplomatic pressure to promote national reconciliation and urging the government to be more inclusive.  At the same time, efforts must be made to address the ideological appeal of ISIS. Countering extremist narratives should involve not only governments but also civil society organizations, religious institutions, and social media companies working together to challenge their rhetoric and propaganda online.  Ultimately, defeating ISIS requires a long-term commitment from the international community. It cannot be achieved through military action alone; a comprehensive strategy is required that addresses both immediate threats and root causes. The West must learn from its past mistakes and take decisive action before more innocent lives are lost at the hands of extremist groups like ISIS.",continue
"""The Star Wars"" comic book series takes fans back to the origins of George Lucas' imaginative universe. It provides a unique opportunity to witness the early concepts and ideas that eventually evolved into the iconic ""Star Wars"" saga we know and love today.  The story begins in a galaxy dominated by an oppressive Empire, led by an Emperor who seeks to expand his control over all planets. Standing in their way are the remnants of an ancient order called the Jedi. This order was once vast and powerful but has been hunted down and decimated by the Sith, dark side users who are loyal to the Empire.  In this early version of events, General Luke Skywalker takes center stage. He is not yet portrayed as Darth Vader's son or a naïve farm boy from Tatooine; instead, he is a seasoned warrior leading Jedi Knights against Sith warriors on behalf of a rebel alliance aiming to dismantle the grip of tyranny across galaxies.  One pivotal aspect that sets this first issue apart is its focus on political disputes regarding trade agreements within multiple systems across star realms. This core conflict gives rise to tension between different factions in power, adding depth and complexity to this evolving narrative.  Through crisp illustrations by Mike Mayhew, readers can visualize these alternative visions of familiar characters such as Skywalker, Princess Leia (who wields her own lightsaber), Han Solo (depicted here as a green-skinned alien), Chewbacca (an intimidating reptilian creature), and many others. It is fascinating for fans accustomed to well-known depictions of these characters - it is like seeing them through an entirely different lens.  As one dives deeper into ""The Star Wars,"" one cannot help but notice details that have become iconic elements in later versions: The droids R2-D2 and C-3PO play roles similar to what we have seen before – R2-D2 remains resourceful while C-3PO offers comic relief with his endless chatter.  Some aspects, however, differ significantly from what fans know. For instance, Jedi Knights are not the noble peacekeepers we are familiar with. They can be flawed and morally ambiguous. This portrayal pushes characters into a gray area that challenges preconceived notions of good versus evil.  ""The Star Wars"" provides a fresh and exciting journey for long-time fans while also welcoming newcomers to explore Lucas' early ideas. It allows readers to marvel at the way these concepts have transformed over time and appreciate the intricate world-building that ultimately led to the blockbuster film franchise we adore today.  For those who have always wondered about how ""Star Wars"" could have been different had it followed this initial concept, this comic series is a treasure trove of imaginative exploration. Through its vibrant visuals and compelling storytelling, it showcases how even minor deviations in character arcs or plotlines can create an entirely new narrative experience.  ""The Star Wars"" comic book series invites readers on a thrilling adventure across vast galaxies filled with lightsaber battles, spectacular space battleships, political intrigue, and captivating characters working towards their own ends in this early version of George Lucas' enduring creation.",continue
"The chaos surrounding British Prime Minister David Cameron's visit to northern Sri Lanka underscored the heightened tensions and deep divisions still present in a country scarred by a long and brutal civil war. As both pro- and anti-government demonstrators rallied around his presence, the scenes descended into pandemonium.  ITN correspondent Bill Neely described the situation as ""full-scale chaos,"" with hundreds of screaming protesters engulfing the area. The clashes between police forces and demonstrators resulted in people being pushed to the ground, trampled on by the surge of bodies locked in confrontation.  Jaffna, where these tumultuous events occurred, was once a stronghold for the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during Sri Lanka's civil war. For 26 years, it bore witness to intense battles between government troops and Tamil rebels who fought for an independent Tamil homeland.  The scars left by this conflict are still fresh in Jaffna's streets. Buildings bear bullet holes from past skirmishes, while families mourn missing loved ones who vanished during those turbulent times. It is within this backdrop that Prime Minister Cameron found himself navigating amidst fervent demands for justice and accountability.  Cameron's visit coincided with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), held against a backdrop of concerns about human rights violations committed during Sri Lanka's war with Tamil rebels—a conflict that officially ended in 2009 but has left lasting wounds on both sides.  Critics argue that holding such an important international conference in Sri Lanka sends an implicit message of acceptance towards a government accused of grave human rights abuses. They contend that focusing solely on economic development obscures more pressing issues related to justice and reconciliation.  Human rights groups allege widespread abuses committed by Sri Lankan security forces during the final stages of the war—including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, sexual violence against women—and assert that little progress has been made towards addressing these grievances since then.  For the Sri Lankan government, however, hosting CHOGM is an opportunity to showcase the country's post-war progress and potential for economic growth. They argue that significant improvements have been made in terms of infrastructure development and reconciliation efforts.  This stark contrast in perspectives was on full display as protesters on both sides fiercely clashed outside Cameron's visit. The pro-government demonstrators expressed their support for Sri Lanka's leadership, holding signs praising the government's achievements since the end of the war. On the other hand, anti-government protesters demanded justice for past atrocities and criticized Cameron for participating in a summit they view as legitimizing a regime accused of rights violations.  The scenes witnessed during Cameron's visit highlight not only these deep divisions but also underlying tensions within Sri Lankan society. As calls for accountability grow louder around the world, it becomes increasingly challenging to strike a balance between focusing on economic progress and addressing unresolved grievances.  Cameron himself acknowledged these complexities when he stated that his main priority was to address human rights concerns while also recognizing the positive steps taken by the Sri Lankan government since his last visit in 2013.  The chaos surrounding this high-profile visit emphasizes that resolving Sri Lanka's turbulent past requires more than just economic development or international conferences; it necessitates genuine efforts towards truth-seeking, reconciliation, and healing broken communities—a task far more arduous than any political gathering can achieve alone.",continue
"American Samoa is an unincorporated territory of the United States, which means it is under the sovereignty of the federal government but does not have the same rights and privileges as a state. As a result, individuals born in American Samoa are considered ""non-citizen nationals"" rather than full-fledged U.S. citizens.  This situation has led to a long-standing debate and legal challenge concerning the constitutional rights of American Samoans. Critics argue that denying citizenship to individuals based solely on their place of birth goes against core principles enshrined in the Constitution, such as equal protection under the law and due process.  In recent years, various legal attempts have been made by American Samoans to gain full U.S. citizenship. One notable case involved Leneuoti Fiasili Haleck, who sued for his right to vote in federal elections as an American living in a U.S. territory. In 2019, however, his request was denied by the District Court for Hawaii.  The court's reasoning echoed a longstanding argument that territorial inhabitants fall into a unique category not explicitly granted citizenship by birthright under constitutional framework. However, this argument fails to acknowledge that birthright citizenship has been consistently recognized by courts for individuals born in other U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam.  Moreover, there is no explicit mention in either Article II or Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment about making distinctions between natural-born citizens based on their place of birth within U.S. territories.  The denial of citizenship to American Samoans also brings up broader questions about representation and democratic participation. While residents of Puerto Rico are able to vote for president if they move stateside or through absentee ballots if they reside on the island itself - including earlier this month when it conducted its own nonbinding referendum favoring statehood - those from other territories like Guam cannot do so without first becoming residents elsewhere within US boundaries.  These disparities give rise to concerns about the democratic legitimacy of a system that allows some American citizens to fully participate in the political process while others are denied that same right merely due to their place of birth.  While Congress has been hesitant to address this issue, there have been recent attempts to rectify the situation. In 2019, legislation was introduced in both the House and the Senate called the ""American Samoan Citizenship Bill."" This bill sought to grant citizenship rights to individuals born in American Samoa, putting an end to this legal limbo.  However, progress on these measures has been slow and uncertain. The complexity of territorial status and constituent rights require careful deliberation by lawmakers, who must navigate a historically contentious area of law and consider potential ramifications for other territories as well.  Ultimately, granting citizenship rights to Americans born in American Samoa would not only correct an unfairness but also align with principles of equality and justice enshrined in the Constitution. It would allow individuals who have faithfully served their country, often at great personal risk, equal access to all rights afforded by their birthright as U.S citizens. Until these challenges are addressed head-on by Congress or through judicial action reaching up into Supreme Court consideration itself; however – tens of thousands remain trapped between two worlds: Identifying as Americans yet fundamentally lacking full recognition under constitutional law despite being U.S. passport holders themselves.  In conclusion, denying citizenship based solely on place of birth within a U.S territory undermines fundamental principles enshrined within America's founding documents. The intersection between territories' status within the United States remains a complex legal debate that begs for resolution. Rectifying this situation is not only about providing equal treatment but also ensuring fairness and justice for all those who call themselves American Samoans - regardless of which side these islands happen fall upon when they're looking out towards open waters or across international boundaries alike",continue
"The decision by the American and British embassies to suspend their operations in Yemen and evacuate their staff highlights the deteriorating security situation in the country. The move comes as no surprise, given the recent power vacuum created by the Houthi rebels' takeover of key government institutions.  For months now, Yemen has been teetering on the edge of armed conflict, with various factions vying for control. The Houthis, a Shiite rebel group from northern Yemen, have been steadily gaining ground and consolidating their power. Their actions culminated in January when they seized control of the presidential palace and effectively placed President Hadi under house arrest.  These developments have caused widespread concern among foreign governments and organizations operating in Yemen. The U.S Embassy had already reduced its staff to a minimal level since late January due to security concerns. With this latest move to suspend operations entirely, it is clear that there is little confidence in Yemen's ability to maintain stability or protect foreign personnel.  The State Department's travel warning emphasizes the ongoing threats faced by anyone remaining in Yemen at this time. It urges U.S citizens to leave immediately due to the uncertain situation on the ground. Similarly, other nations like France have also decided that it is no longer safe for their embassy staff or citizens.  Yemen's instability goes beyond just internal politics; it also poses a threat internationally. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), an extremist group based in Yemen, has taken advantage of this chaos to expand its influence and launch attacks both domestically and abroad. AQAP remains one of Al Qaeda's most dangerous branches globally and has repeatedly demonstrated its intent and capabilities for striking Western targets.  The effective collapse of governance in Yemen not only fuels AQAP but also creates opportunities for other terrorist groups seeking safe havens or resources within an unstable state structure. This is why Western nations are particularly concerned about developments there — they want to prevent another failed state becoming a breeding ground for extremists and a launching pad for attacks.  Additionally, Yemen's strategic location at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula is of great concern when it comes to maritime security. The Bab el-Mandeb strait, which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden, is a crucial international shipping route, allowing passage for hundreds of merchant vessels daily. Any disruption or threat to this crucial chokepoint could have severe economic and geopolitical consequences.  As foreign governments evacuate their personnel and issue travel warnings to their citizens in Yemen, it is evident that there are few prospects for an immediate resolution or return to stability in the country. Efforts by regional actors and international organizations must be intensified to find a political solution that addresses the grievances of different factions while preserving Yemen's territorial integrity.  The situation in Yemen serves as a reminder of how swiftly political instability can spiral into wider chaos if left unchecked. It underscores the importance of early intervention and engagement by both regional powers and global players to prevent further deterioration and protect civilian populations from violence and extremism. Without decisive action now, Yemen risks becoming yet another failed state in an already volatile region.",continue
"Fitzpatrick's testimony set the stage for the defense's strategy - to challenge the credibility and integrity of the government's witnesses, many of whom were involved in criminal activities themselves. The defense aimed to portray Bulger not as a ruthless crime boss but as an informant who provided valuable information to law enforcement.  Over the next few days, the defense team called several more witnesses who had interacted with Bulger during his alleged reign of terror in Boston. They painted a picture of a man deeply embedded in the South Boston community, known for his generosity and kindness towards those he considered loyal.  One witness testified how Bulger helped secure jobs for local residents struggling with unemployment during tough economic times. Another recounted instances where Bulger provided financial assistance to families facing hardships or medical emergencies. These testimonies seemed intent on challenging public perception and showing another side to Bulger that was not widely known.  The defense also began attacking the credibility of some key prosecution witnesses, questioning their motives and reliability. They highlighted inconsistencies in their statements and attempted to associate them with rival gangs or individuals with personal grudges against Bulger. By doing so, they aimed to plant seeds of doubt in the jurors' minds regarding their testimony.  Throughout these proceedings, James ""Whitey"" Bulger maintained his stoic demeanor, seldom showing any visible emotion. He sat quietly observing the proceedings from behind thick-rimmed glasses while occasionally conferring with his attorneys.  As more witnesses took the stand, it became evident that there were conflicting narratives about Bulger within South Boston itself. Some witnesses reinforced prosecution claims about his involvement in numerous violent crimes while others vehemently denied ever seeing him engaged in such activities.  The defense team was also able to unearth evidence suggesting corruption within law enforcement agencies during that period. Testimonies highlighted instances where FBI agents allegedly protected informants within organized crime groups like Charles Manson’s gang members or members affiliated with Mexican cartels while simultaneously taking down rivals or individuals deemed expendable.  This revelation opened the door to a larger discussion about the nature of law enforcement's relationship with Bulger and whether he had operated with their knowledge and even support.  With each passing day, it became increasingly clear that the trial was not just about Bulger's alleged crimes but also about the failings of law enforcement. The defense sought to capitalize on this by portraying Bulger as a figure who had been protected and allowed to operate freely due to corrupt relationships within these agencies.  The trial proceeded for several more weeks, with both sides presenting compelling arguments and witnesses. The jury listened intently, weighing the credibility of each side's claims. Finally, after months of emotionally charged testimonies and legal arguments, it was time for deliberations.  The fate of James ""Whitey"" Bulger rested in the hands of twelve jurors who were tasked with evaluating mountains of evidence while interpreting conflicting accounts that spanned decades. Their decision would determine whether Boston's most feared underworld crime boss would be held accountable for his actions or walk away a free man.  As they filed out of the courtroom to begin their deliberations behind closed doors, all eyes remained fixed on them, waiting anxiously for justice to be served in one form or another.",continue
"The controversial decision to knight Prince Philip was the breaking point, leading to a loss of faith in Abbott's leadership. The move was widely criticized as out of touch and disconnected from the concerns of everyday Australians. It highlighted a perception that Abbott was more focused on pleasing his conservative base than governing for the entire nation.  As news spread about the potential leadership spill, speculation began mounting about who would replace Abbott if he were ousted. The most likely contender appeared to be Malcolm Turnbull, a former leader who had been popular among voters but had been previously removed from the position in 2009.  Turnbull's popularity had only grown since his time as leader and there was widespread support for him amongst both party members and the general public. Many saw him as a more moderate and pragmatic choice compared to Abbott, with an ability to unite different factions within the party and bring stability back into government.  However, there were also concerns that Turnbull's more progressive stance on issues such as same-sex marriage and climate change could alienate some conservative members within his own party. Despite this, it seemed that many were willing to support him if it meant ending what felt like an ongoing state of chaos under Abbott's leadership.  As tensions continued to rise within Liberal Party ranks throughout the week, media coverage reached fever pitch. Journalists camped outside Parliament House waiting for any sign of movement or announcement from party insiders. Speculation grew about potential challenges being mounted against Abbott’s leadership and whether or not he could retain control over his own party.  It all came down to a meeting late on Thursday night when Liberal Party members decided whether or not they would proceed with a vote on their leader. In an outcome that surprised few, they voted in favor of holding a ballot.  The next day brought anticipation tinged with anxiety for observers across Australia as they waited for news from Canberra – would Tony Abbott remain as prime minister or would Australia have its fourth leader in just over two years?  Finally, the result was announced: Malcolm Turnbull had won the leadership spill and would become Australia's 29th prime minister. The news was met with a mix of relief, excitement, and caution from those both within and outside the Liberal Party.  Turnbull wasted no time in setting out his vision for the country. In his first speech as prime minister, he emphasized the need for economic innovation, climate change action, and a more inclusive approach to social issues such as marriage equality. He spoke of a new style of leadership that would be respectful and consultative – a stark contrast to Abbott's more combative style.  As Turnbull settled into his new role, there was an air of optimism in Australia. People hoped for an end to instability and a return to effective governance. However, challenges still lay ahead for the new leader as he sought to unite his party behind him while also delivering on his promises to the Australian people.  The events surrounding Tony Abbott's near removal from office served as a reminder that leaders must adapt and govern with their constituents' interests in mind. The episode highlighted how quickly public opinion can turn against leaders who seem out of touch or fail to deliver on their promises. It was a lesson in political survival that both current and future leaders would do well not to forget.",continue
"The trial of Maj. Nidal Hasan has been a contentious and emotionally charged affair since it began. The case is marked by the tragic events that unfolded at Fort Hood in November 2009, when Hasan opened fire on his fellow soldiers, leaving behind a trail of death and destruction.  Throughout the proceedings, Hasan has consistently maintained his desire to represent himself in court, despite the objections of his defense attorneys. This decision has raised eyebrows and created tension within the courtroom as legal arguments clash with ethical concerns.  At the heart of this latest development is the defense's belief that allowing Hasan to continue representing himself would only serve to facilitate his desire for martyrdom. They argue that by providing him with legal guidance, they are effectively aiding him in achieving a death sentence - an outcome he seems to long for.  This perspective has placed both the judge and defense counsel in a difficult position. While it is their duty to ensure a fair trial for all parties involved, they must also navigate delicate moral considerations surrounding this particular defendant's wishes.  Judge Col. Tara Osborn's ruling maintains that defense attorneys cannot withdraw from their role as standby counsel solely based on disagreements with Hasan's chosen approach to his own defense strategy. Osborn emphasizes that such disagreements should not undermine their responsibility to uphold justice and provide competent assistance within legal boundaries.  In response to Osborn's decision, tensions flared between both sides of the courtroom as tempers ran high amid accusations and counter-accusations about motives and intentions. The emotionally charged atmosphere only served to highlight just how deeply vested each side is in their respective positions.  Supporters argue that allowing Hasan unfettered access to represent himself gives him an undue platform for expressing extremist beliefs or promoting further violence against innocent people should he choose to do so during these proceedings.  However, opponents believe that denying someone their right to defend themselves would undermine fundamental principles of fairness within our judicial system - regardless of how repugnant some may find the defendant's actions or beliefs.  The trial of Maj. Nidal Hasan has not just posed legal challenges but also raises broader questions about the nature of justice in a society that values individual rights and liberties. It forces us to confront the limits of those rights when they clash with our collective responsibility for public safety and the well-being of all citizens.  As tensions continue to simmer within the courtroom, it is important to remember that at stake in this trial are not just legal arguments or strategic maneuvers but the lives and memories of 13 individuals who perished at Fort Hood that fateful day. Their families deserve a fair and just resolution, irrespective of whether it aligns with personal desires or societal expectations.  In navigating this complex terrain, Judge Osborn will bear the weighty responsibility of balancing competing interests while ensuring due process for both sides. Her decisions will undoubtedly set precedents for future cases involving defendants who wish to represent themselves while raising significant ethical questions about freedom, justice, and security in an increasingly volatile world.  With each passing day in court, more light will be shed on these challenging issues. As we grapple with their implications, we must strive for a legal system that upholds principles fundamental to our democracy while also safeguarding public safety - an equilibrium upon which true justice can ultimately be achieved.",continue
"The Internet Defense League has created a new and innovative way to rally open-Internet activists against legislation that threatens the freedom and openness of the web. Taking inspiration from Batman's iconic bat signal, they have introduced their own version called the ""cat signal."" With a simple but powerful message, ""Make sure the Internet never loses. Ever,"" this organization aims to protect our online rights.  Wikipedia's blackout earlier this year was a significant event that drew attention to anti-piracy laws being discussed in Congress. It showed that online platforms have tremendous power in shaping public opinion and influencing policy decisions. The Internet Defense League recognized this potential and sought to build on it with their own unique approach.  It all began when tech entrepreneurs, including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, decided they could make a difference by harnessing the collective power of internet users. They believed that by teaming up with various websites and mobilizing their user bases simultaneously, they could create an influential force capable of defending digital rights.  The cat signal serves as a symbol for summoning internet users worldwide to action whenever threats against the open and free internet arise. The group's website acts as a platform through which organizations can join forces with the league, adding their name to its roster of supporters willing to stand up against harmful legislation.  By signing up to be part of this league, websites commit themselves to display alerts or banners during critical moments when decisive action is needed. These alerts inform users about pending laws or regulations that threaten online freedoms or privacy rights. Through these warnings, users are encouraged to take immediate action such as contacting lawmakers or participating in relevant protests and demonstrations.  The Internet Defense League aims not only for sheer numbers but also for strategic timing. Similar tactics have been used successfully before; however; they lacked coordination across different platforms at crucial moments when legislative decisions were being made.  With its cat signal initiative, the league strives for better synchronization among participating websites so that messages are sent out simultaneously, amplifying the impact of their collective call to action. This approach maximizes attention and creates a sense of urgency, ensuring that lawmakers understand the breadth and depth of public opposition.  The league is not limited to opposing just one specific piece of legislation or policy. They are committed to defending all aspects that make the internet an open and accessible space for users around the world. Whether it's protecting net neutrality, preserving privacy rights, or fighting against censorship laws, the Internet Defense League is determined to safeguard our digital freedoms.  The internet has become an integral part of our lives. It serves as a platform for expression, innovation, learning, and connecting with others globally. The idea behind this initiative is simple but powerful: united we stand against threats to online freedom. By coming together under one banner – or rather one cat signal – these activists hope to defend the principles on which the internet was built.  In a world where legislation can often be shaped by powerful interest groups lobbying behind closed doors, organizations like the Internet Defense League provide ordinary citizens with a voice. By joining forces in this way and harnessing technology's reach and influence effectively, they aim to protect our digital rights in an increasingly interconnected world.  So next time you see that cat image shining through the night sky on participating websites worldwide, remember it signifies more than just a furry face - it represents millions of individuals standing up for what they believe in: preserving an open internet for generations to come",continue
"This landmark decision by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals marks a significant step towards increased transparency and accessibility in the judicial system. For years, there has been a call for cameras to be allowed inside courtrooms, particularly in high-profile cases, but the Supreme Court has remained resistant to this idea. The 9th Circuit's move to provide live streaming video for some of its oral arguments is a response to this demand for greater openness.  By offering live streams of oral arguments on its website, the court is ensuring that anyone with an internet connection can watch these important proceedings in real-time. This not only allows members of the public to witness and understand how their justice system works but also enables individuals who are unable to physically attend court hearings – including journalists and legal experts outside San Francisco – to have access to these crucial events.  The decision by the 9th Circuit also demonstrates their commitment to embracing technology as a means of enhancing public trust and understanding. By harnessing their own equipment and making use of modern advancements, they are setting an example for other federal appeals courts across the country.  The timing of this announcement is particularly significant given recent controversies surrounding police conduct and privacy rights. The first case scheduled for live streaming involves an important privacy issue: whether or not law enforcement agencies should be able to keep DNA profiles of criminal suspects after charges against them have been dismissed. This case raises questions about data retention policies, civil liberties, and constitutional rights — topics that impact every citizen.  By allowing viewers online access to these critical conversations on legal matters pertaining directly or indirectly to society at large, the 9th Circuit is fostering greater awareness about issues that can shape our nation's laws.  Moreover, this initiative could potentially lead lawyers arguing before this circuit or petitioners filing new cases here into taking more caution in crafting sound legal arguments because they know that their statements will be scrutinized beyond just those present in the courtroom.  While the move to live streaming video does open up its own set of challenges and concerns, such as potential disruptions or misuse of the footage, it also presents an opportunity for constructive discussions on improving court procedures and fostering public trust in the judiciary.  Undoubtedly, Supreme Court justices may continue to resist allowing cameras into their proceedings. However, this bold step taken by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals sets a precedent that could push other courts to follow suit. It marks a significant milestone in leveraging technology to bridge the gap between citizens and their justice system.  As more federal appeals courts recognize the value of transparency and access in our increasingly digital world, it is conceivable that one day even the Supreme Court will reconsider its long-standing prohibition on cameras. Until then, we can celebrate this crucial development by the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals as a step forward towards making our justice system more democratic and inclusive for all citizens who seek engagement with legal matters that shape our society's future.",continue
"With the looming threat of a government shutdown, it is important to move beyond simplistic blame and delve into the intricacies of the situation. To truly understand what is happening, there are three key metrics that can shed light on who will emerge victorious in this political standoff.  The first metric to consider is the level of unity within each side. As President Clinton astutely observed, Democrats tend to be driven by a sense of passion and loyalty to their causes. They seek candidates they can fall in love with - individuals who align closely with their values and ideals. Republicans, on the other hand, have historically valued party discipline above all else. Their focus lies not in finding charismatic leaders but rather in maintaining a united and cohesive front.  However, what sets this current government shutdown apart is the surprising instance of Republican fratricide. In an unusual twist, it is now Republicans who find themselves engaged in bitter infighting. Colleagues are being savaged, leaders undermined, and backbiting/backstabbing has become an unexpected norm within their ranks. This departure from traditional party behavior adds intrigue to an already complex situation.  The second metric worth monitoring relates to public opinion during this period of uncertainty. The American people play a critical role by influencing politicians' decision-making process through public sentiment and pressure tactics like phone calls or protests. Consequently, understanding which side holds popular support becomes crucial when predicting its eventual success.  Opinion polls during previous government shutdowns have highlighted that while initial blame tends to be equitably distributed among both parties, over time one side often shoulders more responsibility as deemed by voters. This shift arises from various factors such as effective messaging or perceived disregard for citizens' well-being during prolonged negotiations.  The third metric revolves around long-term consequences for each party involved. A government shutdown has far-reaching effects on not only governmental operations but also on people's lives across the nation – think delayed paychecks for federal workers or disrupted services vital to citizens' welfare. Past experiences have shown that the party perceived as causing the shutdown often suffers political repercussions in subsequent elections.  Examining these three metrics can offer insights into who may emerge as the winner in this high-stakes standoff. As Republicans grapple with internal divisions, it remains to be seen whether their unity, traditionally a source of strength, will ultimately unravel under mounting pressure. Conversely, Democrats face the challenge of transforming public opinion to hold their opponents accountable for any negative consequences resulting from a shutdown.  Ultimately, both parties must navigate these turbulent waters with strategic precision if they hope to prevail politically. It is essential for Americans seeking informed opinions not to fall into the trap of lazy equivalencies that oversimplify complex political dynamics. By analyzing factors such as party cohesion, public perception shifts over time, and long-term ramifications, an astute observer can gain a more nuanced understanding of which side may come out ahead in this government shutdown battle.  The outcome of a government shutdown carries significant implications that extend beyond party politics. It affects the American people, their trust in the government, and the overall functioning of the country. As such, it is essential to remain engaged and informed about the progress and developments surrounding this issue.  One crucial aspect to consider is how each side's messaging strategy shapes public perception. In today's digital age, communication plays a pivotal role in shaping public opinion. The party that effectively communicates its position and rationale to the American people can gain an advantage during this tumultuous time.  Furthermore, understanding historical precedents can provide valuable insights into potential outcomes. Past government shutdowns have varied in their duration and impact, with some leading to concessions from one side or both parties reaching compromise agreements. By examining these past scenarios, observers can gauge whether history may repeat itself or if there are unique factors at play that could shape a different outcome.  Additionally, it is crucial to assess how external factors may influence negotiations between Democrats and Republicans. Geopolitical events or pressing issues not directly related to domestic policy could exert pressure on both sides to find timely resolutions rather than risking prolonged stalemates that harm national interests.  Ultimately, navigating through these challenging times demands leadership from both parties - leaders who are willing to prioritize the needs of the American people above political posturing or partisan agendas. Compromise becomes imperative for any viable solution as neither side holds absolute power nor possesses a monopoly on good ideas.  While assigning blame might be tempting for those seeking simple answers in complex situations such as a potential government shutdown, true understanding requires careful analysis of various metrics: party unity levels within Republicans' surprise fracturing dynamics; shifts in public sentiment over time; long-term consequences for both parties involved; effective messaging strategies; historical parallels from previous shutdowns; exterior pressures impacting negotiations; and leadership capabilities displayed by politicians on either side of the aisle.  In summary, don't settle for simplistic ""pox-on-both-houses"" rhetoric. By delving deeper into the intricacies of this potential government shutdown and examining the aforementioned metrics, individuals can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics at play and who may come out ahead in this high-stakes political battle. It is only through informed engagement that we can hold our elected officials accountable and work towards finding solutions that prioritize the welfare and best interests of the American people as a whole.",continue

"The highly publicized trial of Jodi Arias has captivated the nation since its inception, and the recent deliberations over her sentencing have only intensified the emotional rollercoaster. As the jury foreman, William Zervakos, opened up about the grueling decision-making process, he revealed that it was a gut-wrenching experience for everyone involved.  Zervakos explained that each member of the jury had to confront their own emotions while weighing whether Arias deserved the ultimate punishment for her heinous crime. The enormity of their task was not lost on them; they held someone's life in their hands. The weight of this responsibility forced them to scrutinize every piece of evidence and testimony with utmost care.  One aspect that made this process particularly challenging was listening to heart-wrenching testimonies from Travis Alexander's grieving relatives. Zervakos recounted how these accounts deeply impacted him and his fellow jurors: ""Until you're face to face with people that have gone through something like that, it's something that you really can't put into words.""  The opportunity to hear firsthand accounts from those who had endured an unimaginable loss brought a profound sense of empathy and understanding to Zervakos. Sitting just six feet away as these devastated loved ones shared their pain allowed him no choice but to feel deeply moved by their tragic stories.  For Zervakos, this emotional connection became a driving force behind his decision-making process: ""If you can't feel that, then you have no emotion, no soul."" He emphasized the need for empathy when dealing with such delicate matters because detached logic alone cannot fully comprehend or address human suffering.  Throughout the trial, both sides presented compelling arguments aimed at swaying jurors one way or another. Prosecutors painted Arias as a cold-blooded killer who meticulously planned and executed Alexander's murder out of jealousy and rage. On the other hand, defense attorneys argued fervently for a life sentence, highlighting Arias' troubled past and the possibility of rehabilitation.  Zervakos revealed that the issue of premeditation played a significant role in their deliberations. The jury wrestled with determining whether Arias had the intention to kill Alexander before carrying out her actions. This critical element held substantial weight in their final decision.  Ultimately, after long hours of intense discussions, Zervakos and his fellow jurors reached an impasse - they were unable to unanimously agree on whether Arias deserved death or life imprisonment. The fate of Jodi Arias now lies in the hands of the court as they decide whether to pursue another trial or accept a life sentence.  This case serves as a stark reminder that justice is not easily served and often comes with emotional turmoil. The burden carried by those tasked with deciding guilt or innocence and appropriate punishment can take an immense toll on their mental wellbeing.  As William Zervakos concluded his interview, he expressed relief that this trying chapter had come to an end: ""I'm glad it's over because I think everybody can go back and take stock."" While one trial has concluded, its impact will undoubtedly linger on for everyone involved – from those who lost someone dear to them, through the jurors who weighed each piece of evidence meticulously until finally reaching their own emotional verdicts.",continue
"As the video played, I felt a mixture of fear and fascination. It was surreal to see myself and my fellow hostages on this screen, being watched by these young boys who were being indoctrinated into the world of terrorism. The video continued with images of violent acts committed by Islamist jihadists around the world, accompanied by a narrator spewing rhetoric about holy war and martyrdom.  The room was filled with an eerie silence as we all watched in horror. It was clear that these men had been brainwashed into believing that their ruthless acts were justified in the name of religion. They saw themselves as warriors fighting for a cause, but to us, they were monsters.  After what felt like an eternity, the video finally ended. The captors turned off the laptop with a sense of satisfaction, as if they had achieved something great. We were left alone once again in our dank and filthy cell, trying to process what we had just witnessed.  Unfortunately for us, this was just the beginning of our ordeal. Over the next few months, we would experience unimaginable torture at the hands of these ruthless extremists. Beatings became a daily routine; sleep deprivation became our norm. We were subjected to psychological torture designed to break us down mentally and emotionally.  One method they used involved isolation. They would separate us from each other for days on end, leaving us alone with our thoughts and fears in solitary confinement cells barely big enough to stand in. The darkness engulfed me as I tried desperately to hold onto my sanity.  They also used waterboarding techniques on some individuals – strapping them down onto tilted boards and pouring water over their faces until they thought they would drown – leaving victims gasping for air and begging for mercy.  But perhaps one of the most dehumanizing forms of torture was when they made us wear orange jumpsuits similar to those worn by prisoners at Guantanamo Bay detention center - stripping away any ounce of dignity we had left.  Throughout it all, we clung to hope. Hope that one day we would be rescued and brought back to our families. Hope that the world would not forget about us amidst the chaos and violence happening in the region.  And eventually, after what felt like an eternity, our prayers were answered. A meticulously orchestrated operation led by special forces from multiple countries led to our liberation. The joy and relief we felt were overwhelming as we finally tasted freedom once again.  But even after being physically freed, the scars of captivity remained with us. The mental trauma was immense, and for some of us, it would take years of therapy to heal fully.  It has been over a decade since my kidnapping ordeal, but recent events serve as a chilling reminder that the threat of Islamist jihadists is far from over. As they continue to gain strength in various parts of Africa and beyond, it is crucial that governments around the world work together to combat this menace and protect innocent lives from falling into their clutches.  I share my story not only as a testament to human resilience but also as a call for action against these extremist ideologies fueled by hatred and intolerance. We must remain vigilant in safeguarding our societies from such threats while also addressing the root causes that drive individuals towards radicalization.  Only through education, inclusivity, and understanding can we hope to prevent future generations from enduring their own season in hell at the hands of ruthless terrorists like Moktar Belmoktar's al Qaeda group.",continue
"The allegations of sexual assault in Mingo County have sent shockwaves through the community, reigniting memories of a dark and violent past. The Hatfields vs. the McCoys feud, which gripped this region nearly a century ago, now serves as an eerie backdrop to the current battle for justice.  Accusations of repeated sexual abuse on two schoolgirls by their male classmates have left many questioning the safety and integrity of the local education system. As details emerged about these alleged crimes, so too did claims of cover-ups and inadequate investigations by school district officials.  In a shocking twist to an already distressing story, it was revealed that one accused student had allegedly been denied an ice-cream break as punishment for his actions. This trivialization of such a grave matter only fueled public outrage and led to demands for accountable action.  The case finally reached the court's chambers on a somber Friday afternoon. Two school district officials and four faculty members stood before a judge, facing serious charges brought against them by the state's top lawyer. The civil complaint accused them of concealing information related to instances of sexual abuse within Mingo County Middle School.  As spectators filled the courtroom in anticipation, it was clear that this trial would be about more than just seeking justice for two young victims; it would be a litmus test for whether history would repeat itself or if progress could prevail over secrecy and corruption.  The proceedings began with testimonies from both victims who bravely shared their traumatic experiences in front of strangers. Their words painted vivid pictures of fear, powerlessness, and betrayal – emotions all too familiar within these walls where justice had been sought before.  Their stories were corroborated by witnesses who provided additional evidence supporting their claims. It became increasingly apparent that these students' pleas for help had gone unanswered or worse yet, silenced under pressure from those entrusted with their safety.  Behind closed doors lay not only tales of victimhood but also accounts of alleged negligence and misconduct by individuals tasked with protecting young minds. As details unfolded, it became evident that a systematic failure had allowed these crimes to fester within the educational system.  The Hatfields vs. the McCoys may have ended in tragedy, but there was still hope that Mingo County could prevent history from repeating itself. The outcry from community members demanding transparency and accountability signaled a rallying cry for change.  Outside the courthouse, concerned parents became advocates for policies ensuring the safety of their children within school walls. They organized support groups, held public meetings, and raised awareness through social media platforms.  In response to mounting pressure and growing evidence against them, several school district officials stepped down from their positions pending further investigation. This move was seen as an initial step towards rebuilding trust between the community and its educational institutions.  While justice remained elusive at this stage of the legal process, what emerged from this harrowing ordeal was a renewed commitment to protecting future generations. The legacy of Mingo County would no longer be defined solely by violence and feuds but also by resilience and determination to create a safer environment for all its residents.  As proceedings continued inside the courtroom walls in subsequent weeks, tensions remained high throughout Mingo County. People anxiously awaited an outcome that would shape not only justice for two young victims but also determine whether lessons had truly been learned from their troubled past.  The battle against sexual assault seemed intertwined with broader battles for truthfulness and integrity within institutions designed to protect society's most vulnerable members – its children. And as witnesses came forward one after another, shedding light on corruption that hid behind closed doors for far too long, it became clear that healing these wounds required confronting painful truths.  The Hatfields vs. the McCoys feud serves as a stark reminder of how deeply rooted conflicts can shape communities over time. But perhaps now is an opportunity for redemption – an opportunity to rewrite Mingo County's narrative through justice served and lasting change.",continue
"The case of Carol Anne Bond has brought to the forefront an issue that raises questions about the balance of power between the federal government and the states. At its core, it is a story of a love triangle gone awry, but its implications reach far beyond domestic disputes.  Bond's legal battle began when she discovered that her husband had been having an affair with one of her close friends. Consumed by anger and driven by a desire for revenge, Bond decided to take matters into her own hands. She attempted to harm her husband's lover by spreading toxic chemicals on surfaces she knew her friend would touch.  Unbeknownst to Bond at the time, this act violated an international agreement on chemical weapons – namely, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The United States had ratified this treaty, which aimed to prevent the use and proliferation of chemical weapons. As a result, when authorities discovered what Bond had done, they charged her not only under state law but also under federal law for violating this treaty.  Bond's lawyers argued that Congress lacked the authority to criminalize her conduct under its power to ratify treaties. They contended that such matters should fall under state jurisdiction since they involve traditional areas of police powers such as criminal law and domestic disputes. Furthermore, they challenged whether treating Bond as a terrorist instead of someone involved in a domestic conflict was appropriate or fair.  Supporters argue that if Congress were allowed unchecked authority in criminalizing conduct through treaty ratification power without any consideration for state autonomy or relevance to national security concerns or foreign policy priorities—it could fundamentally undermine states' rights protected by the 10th Amendment.  The case thus brings into focus broader constitutional concerns surrounding federalism – specifically regarding how much room there is for state sovereignty within a system primarily focused on centralized government power at the federal level.  While some may dismiss this case as trivial due to its seemingly personal nature or view it solely through their prurient lenses due to its soap-opera-esque storyline, the underlying legal questions it raises have significant implications. They affect not only individual rights but also the delicate balance of power between federal and state governments that has undergirded this nation's political structure from its inception.  The Supreme Court's intervention represents a rare opportunity to clarify the boundaries of federal power and address potential deviations from the intent of the Founding Fathers when creating a system designed to distribute authority between centralized and localized bodies.  Ultimately, this case is about more than just one woman's actions; it serves as a microcosm for broader debates over constitutional interpretation and the vast consequences that can arise from seemingly minor conflicts. It highlights our ongoing struggle to strike an appropriate balance between federal authority and state autonomy in a changing world where national security concerns are increasingly interconnected with traditionally local issues.  As the court deliberates, legal scholars, policymakers, and citizens alike eagerly await their decision – one that could have far-reaching implications for both domestic disputes and international agreements within our complex system of governance.",continue
"These rumors were met with disbelief and outrage, as it was seen as an affront to the principles of academia and a devaluation of hard work. Fast forward to today, and it seems that Harvard has embraced this approach wholeheartedly.  The argument put forth by Harvard's Dean of Undergraduate Education is that students at the institution are exceptional individuals who have demonstrated immense intellectual capacity even before arriving on campus. Therefore, it is only fair to recognize their brilliance with high grades. However, this reasoning neglects the purpose of grading in education. Grades serve as a reflection of a student's mastery of the material or their effort put into completing assignments.  With such generous grade inflation, one might question whether every student at Harvard truly deserves the accolades they receive. Does everyone truly excel? Or has mediocrity simply been elevated to greatness? Grade inflation not only diminishes the value placed on these exceptional achievements but also fails to differentiate between students who perform exceptionally well and those who struggle more in their studies.  Moreover, inflated grades can result in detrimental consequences for students once they leave their academic bubble and enter the real world. Employers may find it challenging to differentiate between candidates from elite institutions when everyone has high grades attributed to them. A simple A- holds less weight when virtually everyone receives one.  Grade inflation also raises concerns about integrity within academia itself. If almost every student receives top grades effortlessly, what message does this send about ethical behavior? It undermines things like competition, perseverance through challenges, and dedication to learning for its own sake – all important values that should be fostered within higher education institutions like Harvard.  One possible explanation for grade inflation could be pressure from students themselves – a desire for high GPA's that are increasingly necessary in today's competitive job market or for entry into prestigious graduate programs. Students relentlessly pursue ""easy A"" courses or professor reputations known for leniency in grading practices rather than seeking out rigorous academic challenges. The result is a system that rewards compliance rather than intellectual growth.  But the consequences of grade inflation extend beyond the individual level and affect education more broadly. By inflating grades, institutions like Harvard perpetuate an image of academic excellence that may not necessarily be reflective of reality. This creates false narratives about educational attainment and undermines efforts to improve teaching methods or address shortcomings within the system.  Instead of awarding high grades indiscriminately, institutions should focus on providing a robust and challenging curriculum aimed at actual learning outcomes. Grading should reflect true mastery of the material, encouraging students to put in effort instead of aiming for easy achievements. Moreover, employers and graduate programs need to take a holistic approach to applicant evaluation, considering other factors such as creativity, critical thinking skills, and practical experience alongside GPA.  In conclusion, grade inflation at prestigious institutions like Harvard raises serious concerns about educational integrity and misrepresents student achievement. It diminishes the value placed on hard work and undermines differentiation between exceptional students and those who struggle more academically. A shift towards a more balanced grading system that reflects true academic performance is crucial in ensuring meaningful education outcomes for both students and society as a whole.",continue
"However, Portman's decision to run for re-election to his Senate seat comes as no surprise to political observers. Despite his experience and potential appeal as a moderate Republican, Portman faced numerous challenges in a crowded field of potential candidates. With big names like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio already in the mix, it would have been an uphill battle for Portman to gain traction and stand out among his competitors.  Furthermore, Portman's support of same-sex marriage could have been a double-edged sword in the Republican primary. While it may have appealed to more moderate and independent voters, it would likely have alienated conservative Republicans who strongly oppose such rights. In a party that has traditionally held more conservative views on social issues, Portman's stance on same-sex marriage may have made it difficult for him to win over the base.  Portman's decision not to run leaves more room for other potential candidates who may see a better chance at success in the increasingly competitive race. It allows them to focus their resources and energy on building name recognition and support without having to compete against an established incumbent like Portman.  One potential candidate who could benefit from Portman's absence is Florida Senator Marco Rubio. Rubio has been making moves that suggest he is seriously considering a run for president. In recent weeks, he has hired staff members with ties to key early primary states and has traveled extensively across the country speaking at events that cater specifically to conservative Republicans.  Rubio also gained attention recently when he delivered a compelling speech criticizing President Obama's foreign policy approach towards Cuba. This speech was well-received by many Republicans who view Obama's efforts towards normalizing relations with Cuba as misguided.  Another contender who may benefit from the field narrowing is former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. As one of the early frontrunners in polls measuring Republican primary voter preferences, Bush now faces less competition from other establishment candidates like Mitt Romney or Chris Christie.  Bush has been working diligently to build a strong campaign infrastructure and assemble a team of experienced advisers. He has also been actively fundraising, a critical component for any successful presidential campaign. With less competition from other heavyweights like Romney or Christie, Bush can focus more on shaping his message and gaining support from voters who may be looking for an alternative to the polarizing figures in the party.  While it is still early in the race, the decision by Rob Portman not to run for president has already had significant implications. It has created more room for potential candidates like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush to gain momentum and establish themselves as serious contenders. As the field continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these candidates navigate the demands of a heightened public scrutiny and whether they can differentiate themselves enough to secure support from Republican primary voters. As the field continues to evolve, other potential candidates are also starting to make their moves. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, known for his strong conservative views and fiery rhetoric, has been actively courting the party's base. He has been making appearances at grassroots events and conservative gatherings across the country, aiming to position himself as a champion for the Republican Party's core values.  In addition to Cruz, other notable figures such as Rand Paul and Mike Pence are also contemplating runs for president. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Senator with libertarian-leaning views, has been working hard to broaden his appeal beyond the traditional Republican base. His efforts to reach out to minority communities and young voters may prove fruitful in gaining support from those who may be looking for a fresh perspective within the party.  Meanwhile, Indiana Governor Mike Pence is considering whether he should enter into the presidential race or run for re-election. As a staunch social conservative with strong ties within evangelical Christian circles, Pence could potentially rally support from religious conservatives who prioritize issues such as abortion and religious freedom.  One factor that is likely to influence all potential candidates is their ability to fundraise effectively. The cost of running a successful campaign has skyrocketed in recent years, especially since Citizens United led to an influx of money into politics through unlimited donations from corporations and individuals.  Candidates will need substantial financial resources not only for advertising but also for building strong ground game operations in key states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Fundraising prowess will play a critical role in determining which contenders have staying power as they navigate through a lengthy primary process where momentum can quickly shift based on wins or losses in early voting states.  Moreover, besides fundraising challenges, candidates will need well-defined policy positions that resonate with Republican primary voters while still appealing to general election voters if they secure the nomination. Striking this balance can be particularly challenging given Republicans' diverse range of opinions on issues such as immigration reform or government spending.  As we look ahead towards 2016, the Republican primary field is starting to take shape with candidates making their intentions clear. While some contenders have decided not to run, others are seizing the opportunity to gain momentum and position themselves as viable candidates. The coming months will be crucial as these candidates work tirelessly to build support, raise funds, and craft messages that resonate with the Republican electorate. Only time will tell who will emerge as the frontrunner in this crowded field of contenders vying for the Republican nomination.",continue
"The revelation that the United States and Canada engaged in widespread surveillance during the 2010 G8 and G20 summits has sparked concerns about privacy and the extent of government surveillance. According to documents obtained from whistleblower Edward Snowden, America's National Security Agency (NSA) collaborated closely with its Canadian counterpart to conduct surveillance operations during the summits.  The purpose of this operation was to ensure the safety of meeting sites, protect against potential terrorist threats, and provide support to policymakers. The NSA briefing document emphasizes that the surveillance was conducted with the explicit goal of assisting policymakers in making informed decisions. However, critics argue that such extensive spying goes beyond what is necessary for security purposes and infringes upon individuals' privacy rights.  The revelation comes at a time when there is already heightened public scrutiny over government surveillance practices. In recent years, whistleblowers like Snowden have exposed numerous instances of global mass surveillance programs operated by intelligence agencies around the world. These revelations have ignited debates about balancing national security needs with individual rights to privacy.  Opponents argue that governments should not be granted unchecked power to conduct intrusive surveillance on their citizens without proper oversight or justification. They believe such activities undermine democratic values and erode trust between citizens and their governments. Critics also question whether gathering vast amounts of information actually leads to effective counterterrorism efforts or merely creates a massive haystack where finding meaningful intelligence becomes increasingly difficult.  On the other hand, proponents argue that gathering intelligence at major international events like these summits is crucial for preventing potential threats and ensuring leaders' safety. They assert that in today's interconnected world filled with various security challenges, governments must employ robust intelligence capabilities to stay ahead of emerging risks.  While it is expected for nations to engage in some level of diplomatic espionage as part of traditional statecraft, there remain concerns about how far-reaching these efforts may be under an increasingly interconnected global society.  In response to these revelations, civil liberties groups are calling for greater transparency around government surveillance programs. They argue that citizens have a right to know when and why their communications are being intercepted, and there should be strict oversight mechanisms in place to prevent abuse of these powers.  Debate also continues about the balance between security and privacy in the digital age. Technological advancements have made it easier for governments to collect data on individuals, leading some to call for stronger legal protections against unwarranted surveillance. It remains a challenging task for policymakers to strike the right balance.  As public awareness about government surveillance grows, there is increasing pressure on leaders around the world to address these concerns and find a consensus that respects both national security needs and individual privacy rights. The debate sparked by these revelations from 2010 will likely continue as society grapples with finding the appropriate boundaries for surveillance activities in an increasingly interconnected world. Furthermore, the joint surveillance operation during the 2010 G8 and G20 summits raises questions about the extent of cooperation between intelligence agencies of different countries. Some may argue that collaboration is necessary to effectively combat global security threats. However, critics fear that these partnerships could lead to an overreach of power and potential violations of international laws.  The implications of this revelation also extend beyond just privacy concerns. It sheds light on how governments view major international events as opportunities to gather intelligence not only on potential terrorist activities but also on other world leaders and their policies. This information can then be used to shape diplomatic strategies or gain advantages in negotiations.  The timing of this disclosure is significant as well. Coming amidst a global pandemic where digital surveillance measures have been implemented for public health purposes, it raises important questions about the boundaries of mass surveillance during times of crisis. How far are governments willing to go in order to protect their citizens? And at what cost?  In response to these concerns, there have been calls for stricter regulations on government surveillance practices and increased transparency from intelligence agencies. Many argue that there must be clearer guidelines regarding when surveillance operations can be conducted, who can be targeted, and how data collected is handled.  Additionally, there needs to be greater accountability for intelligence agencies involved in such operations. Oversight bodies should include independent representatives who can ensure that privacy rights are respected while still allowing for necessary security measures.  Furthermore, technological advancements have outpaced legislation when it comes to protecting citizens' digital rights. Governments need to update legal frameworks in order to address new challenges posed by increased connectivity and evolving surveillance capabilities.  Ultimately, finding a balance between national security needs and individual privacy rights remains a complex task that requires careful consideration from policymakers around the world.  The disclosure surrounding the 2010 G8 and G20 summits serves as another reminder of the ongoing debate about government surveillance practices within democracies worldwide. It highlights the need for greater public awareness regarding the scope and implications of surveillance activities, as well as the importance of robust legal protections to safeguard citizens' privacy.  As we navigate an increasingly digitized world, it is crucial that discussions around surveillance prioritize the protection of civil liberties while still acknowledging legitimate security concerns. Only through open dialogue and democratic decision-making can societies ensure a balance between national security and individual rights in the face of evolving global threats.",continue

"The leaked classified documents have shed light on the extensive and unchecked mass surveillance carried out by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and its British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Edward Snowden, the former NSA contract analyst who exposed these practices to the world, has once again brought attention to the agencies' egregious breaches of privacy.  In an open letter titled ""A Manifesto for Truth,"" published by Der Spiegel, Snowden reaffirms that these surveillance programs are not isolated incidents but rather a global issue that requires a global solution. He notes that while NSA and GCHQ may be at the forefront of public knowledge regarding mass surveillance, it is essential to remember that this problem extends far beyond their borders.  Indeed, governments around the world have also been implicated in engaging in similar activities with varying levels of oversight. The revelations brought forth by Snowden's leaks have forced societies worldwide to confront their own governments' role in violating citizens' privacy rights for purported national security interests.  Snowden's letter underscores how these secretive operations not only circumvent democratic checks and balances but also undermine trust between nations. The monitoring of communication data from foreign leaders has sparked diplomatic tensions between countries, as governments grapple with questions of trustworthiness and accountability.  Furthermore, this revelation highlights a concerning trend wherein security agencies prioritize their surveillance capabilities over individual privacy rights. By using advanced technologies to collect vast amounts of data indiscriminately, intelligence agencies risk undermining civil liberties without adequate justification or oversight mechanisms in place.  Snowden's words echo those of privacy advocates who have long called for transparency and stronger legal protections against mass surveillance. The indiscriminate collection and analysis of personal information pose significant threats to individual freedoms guaranteed under international human rights standards such as freedom of speech and privacy.  Amidst these concerns about government overreach into citizens' lives comes an increasing demand for comprehensive regulations that strike a balance between national security interests and protection against unwarranted intrusion. It is crucial for democratic societies to establish robust oversight mechanisms and legal frameworks that can hold security agencies accountable and prevent abuses of power.  In recent years, several nations have taken steps toward enhancing privacy protections in response to the leaks brought forth by Snowden. Legislative reforms, court cases, and public debates have ensued as governments grapple with how best to align national security priorities with individual rights.  However, achieving a global solution remains a daunting task. International cooperation will be pivotal in establishing norms and frameworks that transcend borders since mass surveillance technologies operate on a global scale regardless of jurisdictional boundaries.  Snowden's manifesto serves as a wake-up call for governments worldwide to address the systemic issues underlying mass surveillance practices. Public awareness campaigns, enhanced transparency measures from intelligence agencies, and increased collaboration among nations are vital components of attaining meaningful change.  Ultimately, resolving the global problem of mass surveillance necessitates an ongoing dialogue between citizens, lawmakers, experts in technology and human rights fields alike. Only through concerted efforts can we hope to restore privacy as a fundamental right while ensuring national security interests are met in responsible and lawful ways.",continue
"The discovery of the bodies of Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar, and Naftali Frankel on June 30th sent shockwaves through Israel and further inflamed an already tense situation. The abduction and murder of these three Israeli teenagers by Hamas militants was the catalyst for the recent wave of violence in Jerusalem.  Following the discovery of their bodies, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to bring those responsible to justice. In response, Israel launched a massive manhunt targeting Hamas operatives in the West Bank. While searching for the perpetrators, clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian residents intensified.  Palestinians saw Israel's aggressive operations as collective punishment, as hundreds were arrested or placed under administrative detention without trial. This sparked widespread anger among Palestinians who felt marginalized and oppressed under Israeli occupation.  The tension reached its boiling point after a retaliatory attack by Jewish extremists further escalated tensions. Sixteen-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdeir was abducted from his East Jerusalem neighborhood by Jewish radicals who allegedly sought revenge for the deaths of the three Israeli teenagers. Khdeir was brutally beaten and burned alive.  News of this horrific act shocked Palestinians across East Jerusalem and ignited riots throughout Arab neighborhoods. Protesters clashed with Israeli police forces on an unprecedented scale since violence erupted over disputed land rights in 2000.  In addition to clashes between Palestinians and Israelis in Jerusalem, Gaza once again became a major focal point for hostilities during this flare-up. Rockets fired from Gaza into southern Israel prompted retaliatory airstrikes by the Israeli military against Hamas targets within Gaza Strip towns such as Rafah and Khan Yunis.  This escalation led to an increased number of casualties on both sides – civilians included – intensifying international concerns about civilians caught up in this conflict zone irrespective of which side they belonged to or identified with politically or ethnically. This latest wave of violence exposed deep-rooted divisions within Jerusalem along religious lines as well as socio-economic disparities that had long simmered beneath the surface. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has often been framed as an ethnic or religious clash, but it also reflects a broader struggle for political power, land rights, and national identity.  As tensions persist in the aftermath of this outbreak of violence, there are concerns that the situation will continue to deteriorate. The decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains one of the most complex and volatile issues in international relations.  Efforts by world leaders to broker a lasting peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians have repeatedly faltered. This latest round of violence represents another setback on the path towards achieving a peaceful resolution to this deeply entrenched conflict.  In conclusion, this recent flare-up of violence in Jerusalem was sparked by the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers followed by retaliatory actions from both sides. It brought long-standing tensions to a fever pitch, exposing deep divisions within Jerusalem while raising concerns about wider regional stability. As both Israelis and Palestinians mourn their losses amidst continued unrest, finding a lasting solution that addresses their respective grievances remains an elusive goal.",continue
"The situation in Atlanta was undeniably dire. The unexpected snowstorm that hit the city had turned the road conditions into a treacherous nightmare, causing chaos and confusion throughout the region. Atlanta, a city known for its bustling businesses and vibrant energy, was now a ghost town.  As residents struggled to make sense of the situation and cope with their disrupted lives, one group of individuals suffered even more profoundly - the city's cubs. Reports poured in from across the state and even neighboring Alabama about children being stranded overnight at their schools. Their parents or school buses were unable to navigate the icy roads to retrieve them.  The uncertainty surrounding these trapped children intensified an already angered community. People's worries escalated as news of almost 1,000 accidents in Atlanta alone spread rapidly. Concerned parents were pushed into states of anxiety about their children's well-being.  With each passing minute, it became clear that immediate action was necessary to ensure these young souls were safe and sound. Authorities mobilized forces despite the difficult conditions - police officers ventured out onto virtually deserted streets braving freezing temperatures towards schools where students remained stuck on buses or within empty classrooms.  Among those affected were fifty Atlanta students who found themselves spending an unexpected night on school buses, away from their families' warm embrace. The idea of such young children shivering alone amid layers of snow caused alarm throughout the community.  In response to this desperate situation, Atlanta police took matters into their own hands – literally delivering sustenance to these stranded cubs on wheels. They made sure essential supplies like food and water reached these children who had unknowingly become pawns in Mother Nature's game.  Throughout that long night when anxiety threatened to suffocate hope, dedicated voices worked tirelessly behind-the-scenes coordinating efforts between authorities and worried parents desperate for any information about their precious ones' whereabouts.  By 5 a.m., seven students still hadn't returned home despite concerted rescue attempts by brave emergency responders. However, relief soon followed as those remaining seven were finally delivered safely to their families. The city's collective breath was held, then released with a sigh of gratitude.  In the aftermath of this unprecedented event, Atlanta Public Schools spokeswoman Kimberly Willis Green assured the public that all students who had been stranded on buses were accounted for. She mentioned that while it was a harrowing experience for these young individuals, they were either reunited with their families or returned to their schools by 9 a.m., marking an end to an agonizing night.  The incident served as a somber reminder of the fragility of life and how easily we can be thrown into unpredictable circumstances. It also highlighted the resilience and resourcefulness of communities faced with adversity.  As Atlanta began to slowly emerge from its hibernation and road crews worked diligently to clear the paths ahead, people reflected on what had transpired. Conversations about improved infrastructure plans during severe weather events began circulating among residents and officials alike.  This unexpected pause in daily life acted as a catalyst for change – urging society to reevaluate its emergency response capabilities, prioritize safety measures, and ensure vulnerable members are never left behind when disaster strikes.  Atlanta would eventually regain its vibrant energy once more, but the memory of that fateful night would forever serve as a reminder that when crisis strikes our youngest citizens, it is our duty to protect them at all costs - even if it means braving treacherous conditions ourselves.",continue
"As the visitor from outer space or from the future observes this scene, they would undoubtedly be intrigued by the stark contrast between the postal carrier's traditional method of communication and the modern phenomenon happening all around them. These instantaneous interactions taking place through smartphones would represent a leap in human communication that surpasses anything previously imagined.  To someone unfamiliar with Earthly customs, it might seem counterintuitive that physical delivery of messages persists in a society so deeply integrated with advanced technology. The visitor may question why people continue to rely on a slower, tangible medium like mail when instant communication is readily available at their fingertips.  The concept of sending letters may appear quaint and archaic to this observer. They might wonder about how these messages remain private as there is no guarantee that letters won't be tampered with during transit. Additionally, it could be intriguing to ponder if there are any unique experiences associated with receiving personal letters delivered by hand, noting how each envelope might contain a unique story within its folded contents.  However, upon closer observation, our visitor would realize that there are still numerous reasons for maintaining physical mail delivery alongside digital forms of communication. Despite its reduced frequency and importance in an increasingly connected world, mail holds sentimental value for many individuals. It allows for tactile experiences such as feeling paper between one's fingers or cherishing handwritten notes—a rarity amidst electronic convenience.  Moreover, certain sectors continue to heavily rely on physical documents due to legal requirements or simply because some individuals find comfort and trust in traditional methods. From essential governmental paperwork like passports and licenses to official business correspondence requiring signatures—these tasks cannot solely migrate into virtual realms without substantial societal adjustments.  Although text messaging has undeniably created new avenues for social connection and information dissemination never before possible; face-to-face conversations can now traverse great distances within seconds thanks to video calls; one may argue nonetheless that some aspects of interpersonal relationships have suffered unintended consequences under these new systems.  In an era where screens reign, the visitor might question whether the quality of these digital connections can ever truly match face-to-face encounters. They may wonder if this new form of communication reinforces a sense of isolation or superficiality. Are people less present in the physical world because they are perennially connected to others through their devices?  The observer from outer space or the future might further ponder whether this constant connectivity brings more harm than good. As they witness everyone immersed in their individual bubbles, engrossed by screens, it could raise concerns about lost opportunities for communal activities and genuine connection with the outside world.  In conclusion, as our visitor contemplates this scene unfolding before them—an age-old tradition intertwined with cutting-edge technology—they would realize that communication is a multifaceted concept requiring various means to satisfy humanity's diverse needs. The mail carrier's persistence reflects our collective appreciation for tradition and personal connection through tangible mediums. Meanwhile, the prevalence of instant messaging highlights our desire for efficiency and convenience in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Both coexist harmoniously on Earth, allowing different people to derive satisfaction from distinct methods of communication—a testament to human adaptability and ingenuity throughout history",continue
"The calm in the energy markets amidst the chaos in Northern Iraq can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the global oil market has been experiencing an oversupply for quite some time now. The shale boom in the United States and increased production from other countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia have resulted in a surplus of crude oil. This excess supply has created a buffer that temporarily shields prices from major shocks.  Furthermore, Iraq's oil production is concentrated mostly in the southern part of the country, far away from the conflict zone. The majority of Iraq's exports come from fields located around Basra, which remain largely unaffected by the unrest in Northern Iraq. As long as these fields continue to operate smoothly, there will be no significant disruption to global oil supplies.  Additionally, market participants seem to view this conflict as more localized rather than widespread across major oil-producing regions. While tensions are high in Northern Iraq and there is constant threat of violence spreading further, investors are confident that it will not spill over into neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia or Iran - two key players in global energy markets.  Another reason for market stability is that most companies operating in Northern Iraq have taken precautionary measures to protect their assets and ensure continued operations. Many have fortified their facilities and established robust security measures to ward off potential attacks or seizure attempts by insurgents. Gulf Keystone's ability to maintain production at 25,000 barrels per day despite unfavorable conditions demonstrates how companies are adapting and responding effectively.  The lack of panic can also be attributed partially to financial interests overshadowing humanitarian concerns. Despite displacement camps being overcrowded with thousands of displaced civilians fleeing violence, it seems that geopolitical considerations continue driving decisions rather than empathy for those affected by conflict.  However, while there may not be an immediate impact on prices or supply disruptions globally due to this regional conflict alone; a prolonged unrest or expansion of violence could eventually result in market volatility if international involvement increases or extends beyond current borders.  Given these factors, it is essential for market participants to continue monitoring the situation closely and assess the potential risks posed by the conflict. Any escalation could create significant disruptions in global energy markets, leading to price spikes and a renewed sense of market panic.  In conclusion, while the ongoing conflict in Northern Iraq has not yet had a direct impact on energy markets, various factors such as oversupply, geographical concentration of oil production, localized nature of the conflict, and precautionary measures taken by companies have helped maintain stability. However, it remains essential to remain vigilant as any expansion or intensification of violence could have severe consequences on global oil prices and supplies. Moreover, the stability of energy markets amidst the crisis in Northern Iraq is also influenced by geopolitical dynamics and international interests. The region is home to key players who have a stake in ensuring that oil prices remain stable. For example, both Saudi Arabia and Iran have been working towards maintaining market stability as they rely heavily on steady oil revenues to support their economies.  Saudi Arabia, being the world's largest oil exporter, has significant influence over global prices. The country has consistently reassured the market that it will step in to fill any supply gaps if needed. This assurance helps alleviate concerns about potential disruptions from Northern Iraq.  Similarly, Iran, another major regional player and oil producer, has a vested interest in stable energy markets as it seeks relief from economic sanctions. With negotiations surrounding its nuclear program ongoing at the time of this crisis, Iran understands that any volatility in global oil markets would negatively impact its chances of attaining sanctions relief.  Furthermore, the international community is closely monitoring developments in Northern Iraq and remains committed to preventing further destabilization of energy markets. Organizations such as OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) are continually assessing potential risks and are ready to take action if necessary to stabilize prices.  In addition to these factors affecting market calmness so far, there are also speculations within the industry that some larger companies might see an opportunity arising from these uncertain times. Oil majors with vast resources could potentially acquire distressed assets or secure favorable contracts for future production if smaller players divest due to safety concerns or financial strains caused by prolonged conflict.  However, it is important not to underestimate how quickly situations can change and escalate within conflict zones. In recent history alone we have witnessed unexpected surges in violence leading to disruption of crude flows within Libya's civil war or Nigeria's militant attacks on its southern delta region facilities - both examples proving how quickly conflicts can unravel amidst political uncertainties.  Therefore it remains crucial for governments around the world as well as industry stakeholders to engage actively in diplomatic efforts and ensure regional stability. Collaborative efforts to find peaceful solutions and end the conflict would be the most effective way to safeguard not only energy markets but also the lives of all those affected by violence in Northern Iraq.  In conclusion, while several factors have contributed to the market's resilience so far, it is crucial to recognize that ongoing conflicts can quickly spiral out of control and lead to significant disruptions. Market stability should not be taken for granted, and proactive measures must be taken by all relevant parties to mitigate risks effectively. Only through cooperative diplomatic efforts can lasting peace be achieved, ensuring stable energy markets and a safe future for those living in conflict-affected regions.",continue
"The news of Governor Andrew Cuomo's plan to legalize medical marijuana in New York has received mixed reactions. While some advocacy groups and lawmakers believe it is a significant step forward, others feel that the program could be too limited and cumbersome.  State Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, one of the leading proponents of comprehensive medical marijuana legislation in New York, expressed his excitement about the governor's executive action. He described it as a ""key interim step"" towards achieving broader access to medical cannabis for patients in need.  The limited nature of the program means that only select hospitals will be permitted to dispense medical marijuana. Additionally, only select patients will have access to this treatment option. These strict criteria have raised concerns among some advocates who believe that many patients who could benefit from medical marijuana will still not have access.  However, other advocates see this as a positive development and an opportunity to prove the effectiveness and safety of medical cannabis through selective implementation. They argue that starting with a small-scale program allows for careful monitoring and evaluation before expanding access statewide.  The decision by Governor Cuomo comes after years of debate on the topic of medical marijuana in New York. The state already has laws allowing for limited use of non-smokeable forms of cannabis for certain conditions such as epilepsy or chronic pain. However, comprehensive legislation allowing broader accessibility has remained elusive until now.  Critics argue that limiting access only to hospitals creates unnecessary barriers for patients seeking relief through medical cannabis. They suggest that dispensaries should also be allowed to provide this medicine so that patients can choose where they receive their treatment based on convenience and expertise.  Despite these concerns, there is growing recognition across the country about the potential benefits of using cannabis as medicine. Many states have already legalized its use for various conditions such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and chronic pain management.  Proponents point out that legalizing medical marijuana can potentially provide an alternative treatment option for patients who may not respond well to traditional medications or who experience severe side effects. It can also help address the opioid crisis by offering a less addictive and potentially safer alternative for pain management.  Moreover, the legalization of medical marijuana has proven to be a lucrative industry in states where it is allowed. This can potentially create jobs, generate tax revenue, and stimulate economic growth in New York.  It remains to be seen how successful this limited program will be in meeting the needs of patients and addressing concerns about access. However, Governor Cuomo's decision is undoubtedly an important milestone for advocates pushing for more comprehensive medical marijuana legislation in New York.  As the program unfolds and more information becomes available, there will likely be ongoing discussions about expanding access to include more hospitals or even allowing dedicated dispensaries to provide medical cannabis. The ultimate goal is to ensure that all patients who could potentially benefit from this form of treatment have legal access without unnecessary hurdles or limitations.",continue
"These events are seen as indicators of who will likely take home the Oscar. Just as in politics, there are frontrunners and dark horses, surprises and disappointments.  The early frontrunners for this year's Oscars include films like ""La La Land,"" which has been praised for its nostalgic homage to Hollywood musicals and its captivating performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. The film won a record-breaking seven awards at the Golden Globes, solidifying its position as a strong contender in multiple categories.  Another frontrunner is ""Moonlight,"" an intimate and groundbreaking exploration of identity, race, and sexuality. With its poignant storytelling and powerful performances by an ensemble cast, ""Moonlight"" has captured the hearts of critics and audiences alike.  Meanwhile, films like ""Manchester by the Sea"" and ""Hell or High Water"" have also garnered critical acclaim for their compelling stories and stellar performances. These films have gained momentum through various awards shows leading up to the Oscars, further solidifying their chances of taking home coveted golden statuettes.  But just like in politics, nothing is set in stone until the final votes are counted. In previous years, dark horse candidates have surprised everyone by taking home top honors on Oscar night. Films like ""Spotlight"" in 2016 or ""Birdman"" in 2015 were not initially seen as frontrunners but emerged victorious at the end of the night.  Behind all these contenders are teams of lobbyists working tirelessly to sway Academy voters' opinions. Studios hire consultants who specialize in crafting effective campaigns to promote their films' chances at winning awards. These consultants work with publicists to create buzz around nominated movies through interviews, screenings for Academy members, Q&A sessions with directors and actors, as well as schmoozing events where voters can hobnob with celebrities.  Similar to political candidates seeking endorsements from influential figures within their party or community leaders who can sway voters, Hollywood studios rely on endorsements from respected filmmakers and actors to boost their films' chances. A glowing endorsement from a respected figure can carry significant weight with Academy voters and could be the deciding factor in securing an Oscar win.  In recent years, there has been growing criticism of the influence of money and lobbying in the Oscars race. Some argue that it diminishes the integrity of the award and puts smaller independent films at a disadvantage since they often have limited resources to mount extravagant campaigns.  Despite these criticisms, there is no denying that the Oscars are still one of the most anticipated events in entertainment. The glitz and glamour surrounding the night make it a spectacle not only for industry insiders but also for audiences around the world. The red carpet fashion, emotional acceptance speeches, and surprise wins create a captivating narrative that keeps viewers engaged year after year.  As we approach Oscar night on February 26th, all eyes will be on Hollywood's version of campaign season. Which movies will emerge victorious? Which contenders will fall short? And just like in politics, only time will tell who will take home those little golden men as trophies of their success in capturing hearts and minds through exceptional storytelling on screen. Until then, let the campaign continue with all its drama, suspense, and Hollywood magic.",continue
"Van der Sloot's sentencing has brought some sense of closure to the family and friends of Stephany Flores, who have been waiting for justice for over a decade. The brutal murder of Flores in May 2010 shocked Peru and gained international attention due to van der Sloot's connection to another high-profile case.  In 2005, Joran van der Sloot came under suspicion in the disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway while she was on vacation in Aruba. Despite being arrested multiple times and facing extensive media scrutiny, he was never convicted in connection with Holloway's disappearance. This previous case hung heavily over the trial as Peruvian prosecutors argued that it demonstrated a pattern of violent behavior.  During the trial, Van der Sloot tearfully confessed to killing Stephany Flores after arguing with her about information she found linking him to the Natalee Holloway case on his laptop. He claimed that he became enraged during their altercation and struck her repeatedly before suffocating her. His defense team attempted to argue diminished responsibility due to a history of psychological trauma stemming from his involvement in the earlier case but failed to convince the judges fully.  The courtroom proceedings were emotionally charged, with many observing tears streaming down the faces of both Flores' family members and van der Sloot himself. The victim impact statements delivered by Flores' loved ones painted a picture of a vibrant young woman whose life was tragically cut short by an act of senseless violence.  While some might view Van der Sloot's sentence as lenient given the gravity of his crime, it is important to understand Peru's penal system does not allow for life sentences without the possibility of parole or capital punishment. Thus, 28 years represents one possible maximum sentence under Peruvian law.  The judges cited several factors contributing to their decision not to impose a full 30-year sentence on Van der Sloot. They took into account his confession as well as other mitigating factors such as lack of prior criminal record and his age at the time of the crime. Still, they made it clear that his actions were heinous, and he would face significant consequences for them.  The reparations ordered by the court require Van der Sloot to pay a significant amount of money to Flores' family. This financial penalty is meant to provide some compensation for their loss and help them rebuild their lives after enduring such a tragedy. It also serves as a reminder that justice comes in various forms and that offenders should be held accountable not only criminally but also financially.  Following his conviction, Van der Sloot will be transferred back to Challapalca Prison, located high in the Andean mountains near Peru's border with Bolivia. The conditions in this prison are harsh, with extreme temperatures and limited amenities. It is likely he will serve out his sentence there unless additional legal proceedings arise.  As the courthouse emptied on Friday, both Flores' family and van der Sloot's supporters left with mixed emotions. While there is relief that justice has been served to some extent, no punishment can bring back Stephany Flores or erase the pain felt by her loved ones.  Van der Sloot's case remains a cautionary tale about how one moment of rage can alter multiple lives forever. As society grapples with issues surrounding violence against women and domestic abuse, it becomes even more critical to reflect on cases like these as we work towards creating safer communities for everyone",continue
"The shocking revelation that Saadi Gadhafi, son of the deposed Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, attempted to travel to Mexico using false documents has sent shockwaves through the international community. Mexico's interior minister, Alejandro Poire, disclosed that four individuals have been implicated in this audacious plot - a Canadian, a Dane, and two Mexicans. The arrests of these alleged plotters occurred last month but were only announced today under the codename ""Operation House Guest.""  Mexican authorities hailed the operation as a significant contribution to ensuring safety within North America. Alejandra Sota, a government spokeswoman, emphasized that their actions demonstrated the federal government's active role in creating a secure environment. However, questions regarding how such an elaborate scheme went undetected for so long remain unanswered.  According to Poire, the plan involved providing false documents claiming Mexican nationality for Saadi Gadhafi and his family while also acquiring several properties in Mexico for use as safe houses. The alleged plotters aimed to create an intricate network of hideouts where Saadi and his family could evade detection from international authorities.  This revelation raises concerns about Mexico's vulnerability to conspiracies involving high-profile individuals seeking refuge within its borders. While previous cases have seen drug lords and criminals attempting similar strategies successfully or with varying degrees of success; this incident involves a former political figure from another country altogether.  Investigators are now delving into how deeply connected these individuals are and whether they had any assistance or support from local Mexican contacts. This case exposes potential weaknesses within both national security measures and immigration control protocols in Mexico.  The involvement of foreign nationals is particularly alarming as it suggests larger networks operating internationally might exploit existing gaps in securing borders worldwide. In recent years there has been increasing concern over organized crime syndicates extending their reach globally by forming powerful alliances across borders.  This discovery also throws light on Saadi Gadhafi's intentions following his father's downfall. It appears he was actively seeking refuge in Mexico, indicating a lack of safe havens available to him despite his family's once prominent status. The question remains: why Mexico? The country's proximity to the United States, its rich cultural diversity, and its complex criminal landscape all make it an attractive destination for individuals attempting to disappear discreetly.  While this operation is viewed as a success in thwarting Saadi Gadhafi's plans, it serves as a reminder that no nation can consider itself immune from the threat of high-profile individuals seeking refuge within their borders. As countries enhance their security measures, criminal masterminds attempt ever more audacious approaches to evade capture.  The fallout from this incident will undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences for international cooperation and intelligence sharing efforts. Nations worldwide must remain vigilant and committed to combating international crime syndicates effectively.  As investigations continue into ""Operation House Guest,"" Mexican authorities are left facing difficult questions about their border security infrastructure and immigration controls. The need for strengthened cooperation with international partners becomes increasingly apparent if they are to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.  The case of Saadi Gadhafi's attempted entry into Mexico shines a light on the complexities surrounding border security and calls attention to the need for constant adaptation and evolution of policies designed to combat illicit activities on an international scale.",continue

"He conceded that the operation known as ""Fast and Furious"" had serious flaws and had allowed guns to end up in the wrong hands, including those of Mexican drug cartels. The operation, which was intended to track the flow of illegal weapons into Mexico, instead led to hundreds of firearms being lost or misplaced.  Holder's testimony came after months of political scrutiny and criticism from both sides of the aisle. Many Republicans accused him of either being incompetent or intentionally allowing these illegal transactions to occur in an effort to justify stricter gun control measures. Some even called for his resignation, arguing that he was ultimately responsible for the failed operation.  The Attorney General vehemently denied these allegations during his appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He maintained that he did not have knowledge about specific tactics used in ""Fast and Furious"" until early 2011 when news reports exposed its flaws.  ""I should have known about it earlier,"" Holder admitted regretfully. ""But I did not have a full understanding until much later.""  Holder placed blame on lower-level officials within ATF, suggesting they were responsible for most operational decisions surrounding the flawed tactics employed in this operation. However, he took responsibility for any shortcomings within his own staff regarding their handling and communication of information related to ""Fast and Furious.""  In an attempt to address concerns about transparency surrounding this controversial matter, Holder vowed to make several changes within ATF's operations. These changes included enhanced oversight mechanisms and increased training programs aimed at preventing similar mistakes from happening again.  Despite expressing remorse over what transpired during ""Fast and Furious,"" Holder held firm on his position against releasing certain internal DOJ documents related to congressional investigations into this matter. He argued that doing so would set a dangerous precedent that could infringe upon executive privilege rights.  Throughout his testimony, Holder stressed that while many mistakes were made during ""Fast and Furious,"" it was essential not only for justice but also for cooperation with Mexico's government to ensure these errors are rectified and future cooperation is not jeopardized. He pledged to work closely with Mexican authorities to prevent gun trafficking and strengthen bilateral efforts to combat drug cartels.  Holder's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee marked a pivotal moment in his tenure as Attorney General. The operation known as ""Fast and Furious"" had become a stain on his reputation, with critics claiming it highlighted incompetence or even corruption within the Justice Department. However, Holder's acknowledgment of the mistakes made, along with his commitment to learning from them and preventing their recurrence, offered some hope for those seeking accountability.  In conclusion, Holder's testimony represented an important step towards addressing the failures of ""Fast and Furious."" While questions still lingered regarding who should ultimately bear responsibility for this flawed operation, Holder accepted accountability for shortcomings within his own department. Moving forward, the focus should be on implementing safeguards to prevent such missteps in the future and collaborating with Mexico to combat illegal gun trafficking more effectively.",continue
"Added sugar, found in processed foods and drinks, is the real concern when it comes to our health. It's no secret that sugar can be addictive and consuming excessive amounts of it has been linked to various health issues such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and even certain types of cancer.  One of the main problems with added sugars is that they are often ""hidden"" in our diet. They can be found in seemingly innocent products like salad dressings, condiments, yogurt, granola bars, and even some so-called ""healthy"" snacks. These hidden sugars contribute significantly to our overall intake without us even realizing it.  The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting added sugar intake to no more than 6 teaspoons for women and 9 teaspoons for men per day. However, studies have shown that on average Americans consume about three times this amount!  The excessive consumption of added sugars not only leads to weight gain but also contributes to chronic inflammation in the body. This chronic inflammation has been linked to a wide range of diseases including autoimmune disorders and conditions like arthritis.  Furthermore, a high-sugar diet can wreak havoc on our skin health. Consuming excess sugar causes a process called glycation where sugar molecules bind with proteins in the body forming harmful compounds known as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These AGEs damage collagen and elastin fibers leading to premature aging signs such as wrinkles and sagging skin.  But it's not just the physical health consequences we need to worry about; excessive sugar intake can also impact our mental well-being. Studies have suggested that high-sugar diets may increase the risk of mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. The rollercoaster effect caused by rapid spikes in blood sugar levels followed by crashes can lead us feeling irritable or moody throughout the day.  Cutting back on added sugars doesn't mean you have to completely eliminate all sweet treats from your life though; moderation is key. Start by reading food labels and becoming familiar with the different names for sugar such as sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose, and corn syrup. Be aware that ingredients are listed in descending order by weight, so if sugar is one of the first few ingredients on the list, it's probably best to put that item back on the shelf.  Another step towards reducing added sugars in your diet is to eat whole foods whenever possible. Focus on including more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats into your meals. These natural sources of sugar provide essential nutrients along with fiber which helps slow down the absorption of sugar into our bloodstream.  Finally, be mindful of your beverage choices as well. Sugary sodas and fruit juices can contribute a significant amount of added sugars to our diet without providing any nutritional value. Opt for water or unsweetened beverages instead; you can add some flavor by infusing it with fresh fruits or herbs.  So while we don't need to completely demonize all forms of sugar in our diet (especially naturally occurring sugars), it's crucial to be aware of hidden added sugars and make healthier choices when it comes to our overall consumption. By reducing our intake and opting for whole foods instead of processed ones, we can maintain a balanced diet and improve our long-term health outcomes.",continue
"According to a report from BuzzFeed News, Emil Michael suggested that Uber invest in hiring a team of opposition researchers and journalists to dig up personal information on Sarah Lacy, editor-in-chief of PandoDaily. His idea was to smear her reputation publicly in retaliation for her critical coverage of the company.  This revelation sparked outrage and widespread condemnation from both the media and the public. The incident highlighted a glaring hypocrisy within Uber's own system of trust. While they hold their drivers and users accountable for their behavior through extensive rating systems, it appeared that senior executives were above such scrutiny.  The proposal by Michael provoked questions about ethics, privacy, and accountability within the sharing economy model. Trust is indeed an essential component for any successful sharing economy platform; however, it must be applied consistently across all stakeholders - users, drivers, AND company executives alike.  Uber quickly faced severe backlash after this incident became public knowledge. Investors expressed concern over the negative impact on Uber's reputation and credibility. Critics pointed out that compromising journalists went against fundamental principles such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  In response to the scandal, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick issued a statement distancing himself from Emil Michael's remarks while simultaneously defending him as ""a trusted adviser."" The company announced that no actual efforts were made to pursue Michael's proposed plan and assured everyone that they would never engage in such tactics.  However, damage had already been done. The incident served as a reminder that despite its popularity and disruptive innovation in transportation services, Uber was not immune to ethical lapses or controversies.  As with any industry or organization at large scale today - especially those reliant on technology platforms facilitating interactions between strangers - trust remains paramount but fragile. Companies must ensure consistent application of ethical standards throughout their operations if they want customers' trust genuinely earned rather than eroded.  For Uber specifically, this scandal served as an opportunity for introspection. It compelled them to reevaluate not just their internal culture but also how they manage relations with media and critics. Transparency, accountability, and an unwavering commitment to ethical conduct would be instrumental in rebuilding trust among stakeholders.  In the months following the scandal, Uber took steps to address these concerns. They hired former US Attorney General Eric Holder to lead an independent investigation into their workplace culture and practices. The company committed to releasing transparency reports allowing external auditing of their safety practices over sexual assaults or other criminal incidents involving drivers or users.  Moreover, Uber introduced several initiatives aimed at fostering a more positive environment for both drivers and passengers. They implemented mandatory diversity and inclusion training for employees, making it clear that discrimination or harassment would not be tolerated.  While the incident will forever remain a stain on Uber's reputation, it served as a wake-up call for the entire sharing economy industry. Trust is indeed crucial but can never be taken for granted – particularly by those who shape these platforms' rules themselves.  Ultimately, it falls upon companies like Uber to uphold the principles they sell as part of their value proposition: trust, transparency, and accountability. Only by genuinely committing themselves to these principles can they restore faith in their stakeholders and truly establish trust as the currency of the sharing economy.",continue
"The decision to create a cartoon featuring Ipal Khan as the main character reflects China's attempt to bridge the cultural divide between Uyghurs and Han Chinese. By showcasing a Uyghur protagonist in a well-known tale, the hope is to foster understanding and empathy between these two ethnic groups.  The story of Ipal Khan is not only famous in Uyghur culture but also holds significance in Chinese history. The tale highlights the beauty and allure of Kashgar, an ancient Silk Road city known for its vibrant mix of cultures and traditions. By retelling this story through animation, Chinese authorities aim to portray Xinjiang's diversity as a source of pride rather than tension.  Although some skeptics may dismiss this initiative as mere propaganda, there is potential for it to have a positive impact. Cartoons have long been recognized as powerful tools for shaping attitudes and perceptions, particularly among young audiences. If executed thoughtfully and artfully, this production could serve as an exceptional means of fostering cross-cultural dialogue.  One possible outcome is that depicting Ipal Khan's relationship with the Qianlong Emperor could humanize both Uyghurs and Han Chinese in each other's eyes. By emphasizing their shared emotions such as love and longing, viewers may begin to see past stereotypes or prejudices that fuel ethnic tensions. Moreover, showcasing elements of Uyghur culture within mainstream media has the potential to promote tolerance and appreciation.  However, it is crucial that this project does not fall into tokenism or contribute further harm by oversimplifying complex issues surrounding ethnic relations in Xinjiang. While celebrating diversity is important, genuine efforts must also be made towards addressing structural inequalities faced by marginalized communities like the Uyghurs.  In addition to creating cartoons centered on historical figures like Ipal Khan, more could be done to encourage intercultural exchange at grassroots levels. Promoting language programs that facilitate communication between different ethnic groups would be one step towards fostering understanding and harmony.  Furthermore, investing in educational initiatives which accurately represent multiculturalism within the region's curriculum could foster empathy and reduce biases. Encouraging dialogue, inviting guest speakers from diverse backgrounds, and organizing cultural exchange programs can contribute to increased knowledge and appreciation of Xinjiang's rich heritage.  Ultimately, the impact of this cartoon project on resolving ethnic tensions will depend on various factors such as its execution, distribution, and reception. Nevertheless, it represents an earnest attempt by Chinese authorities to address cultural divisions in a medium that appeals to both children and adults alike.  While cartoons alone cannot solve deep-seated issues, they have the potential to shape attitudes over time. By promoting diversity within mainstream media narratives through characters like Ipal Khan, China strives towards a future where different ethnic groups can coexist harmoniously while embracing their unique identities.  To achieve lasting peace in Xinjiang, a comprehensive approach is necessary involving not just media representation but also policy changes that promote equality and respect for all individuals regardless of their ethnicity or religious background. With concerted efforts both on-screen and off-screen focused on understanding and acceptance, there may yet be hope for unity amidst diversity in Xinjiang.",continue
"In Colorado Springs, Janea Cox was hopeful that the move would bring a glimmer of hope for her ailing daughter. Colorado was one of the few states in America that had legalized the use of medical marijuana, and it seemed like their last chance at finding relief for Haleigh's debilitating seizures.  Upon arrival, Cox wasted no time in seeking out medical professionals who specialized in cannabis treatments. She discovered the Realm of Caring Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provided support and guidance to families seeking alternative treatments using cannabis-based therapies. With their help, Cox obtained a strain called Charlotte's Web - an extract with high CBD (cannabidiol) content but low THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is responsible for the psychoactive effects commonly associated with marijuana.  Under strict supervision from doctors at the Children's Hospital Colorado and with careful dosage adjustments, Haleigh began her journey with medical marijuana treatment. And almost miraculously, within just a few days, Cox noticed an incredible change in her daughter.  The once debilitating seizures reduced significantly in frequency and intensity. Haleigh slowly regained control over her body functions and started experiencing moments without constant pain or discomfort. Her overall health improved drastically as well; she regained weight lost during her illness while showing no signs of organ damage from previous medications.  Cox knew then that she had made the right decision to uproot their lives for this new treatment opportunity. She couldn't help but feel grateful for being able to provide this chance at life for her daughter when all traditional medications had failed them.  But challenges still lay ahead on their path towards healing. The major obstacle they faced was returning home to Georgia where medical marijuana remained illegal.  As Georgia law dictated, any form of cannabis usage was strictly prohibited regardless of its medicinal purposes. This meant that if they were caught bringing back Charlotte's Web oil into Georgia, both Cox and Haleigh could face serious legal consequences.  Fearing separation from Haleigh, Cox made the difficult decision to remain in Colorado until Georgia caught up with the rest of the country in terms of medical marijuana legislation. It was a frustrating situation for Cox, as she had to endure being away from her home, family, and support system while juggling the daily challenges of caring for a sick child.  Meanwhile, stories like Haleigh's were becoming increasingly common across America. Families with children suffering from conditions that could potentially benefit from medical marijuana were facing dilemmas similar to those faced by Cox - moving away from their homes and loved ones simply to access necessary treatment.  With mounting pressure and an overwhelming number of success stories surrounding cannabis-based therapies, state lawmakers began reevaluating their stances on medical marijuana. Slowly but surely, Georgia joined many other states in enacting laws that allowed limited use of cannabis oil for specific conditions like epilepsy.  Finally, after what felt like an eternity away, Cox received long-awaited news - Georgia had legalized low-THC cannabis oil for use in certain situations. Overjoyed by this development and desperate to return home after over a year away, she packed up her belongings along with Haleigh and embarked on their journey back to Macon.  The reunion with family and friends was bittersweet yet filled with hope. The fight wasn't over; they still had hurdles to overcome before accessing medical marijuana legally in their home state. But they knew that change was happening.  Janea Cox's courageous decision led not only to transforming her daughter's life but also contributed significantly towards changing perceptions about alternative medicine around the world. Haleigh became one of countless examples showcasing how cannabis-based therapies could provide relief where traditional treatments fell short.  Their story continues today as advocates tirelessly work towards expanding access and knowledge about medical marijuana across America - ensuring that families facing similar battles have options available closer to home instead of needing desperate measures like relocating just for potential life-saving treatments.

"The revelation that two passengers on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 were traveling on stolen passports has once again raised concerns about the effectiveness of airport security measures. The incident brings to light an issue that Interpol has been warning about for years.  Interpol, the international criminal police organization, keeps a comprehensive database of stolen and lost travel documents. This database is meant to serve as a tool for law enforcement agencies around the world to identify potential security threats and prevent individuals using stolen documents from crossing borders or boarding planes.  However, despite having this valuable resource at their disposal, many airports fail to adequately check passenger documents against Interpol's database. This lack of thorough screening poses a significant risk to global aviation security.  Passports are typically checked multiple times during the process of boarding a plane - at check-in, at passport control, and sometimes even before boarding the aircraft. However, these checks often focus solely on verifying that the presented document is valid and belongs to the individual presenting it. Little attention is paid to cross-referencing these documents with Interpol's database.  This loophole allows individuals with stolen passports or lost travel documents to slip through various layers of security without raising any red flags. In fact, it seems quite easy for someone using such compromised identification to board commercial flights undetected.  Authorities face several challenges in implementing more robust document checks. The sheer volume of passengers passing through major international airports daily makes conducting extensive background checks on each traveler a daunting task. Additionally, there may be limitations in technology or resources available in some airports that hinder effective implementation.  Moreover, there are also concerns about privacy rights and potential profiling issues associated with stricter document verification procedures. Striking a balance between ensuring utmost security and respecting individuals' rights can be highly contentious when it comes to matters of immigration control and border management.  Interpol has called upon member countries to close this loophole by conducting systematic checks against its databases during all stages of travel documentation verification processes. This would require airports to invest in technology capable of quickly and reliably cross-referencing passports against Interpol's database.  The implementation of biometric systems, such as facial recognition or fingerprint matching, could significantly enhance security by ensuring a more accurate verification process. Such systems would not only speed up the checks but also minimize the risk of human error.  Furthermore, cooperation and information sharing between countries are crucial in combating passport fraud and identity theft. Interpol has been actively assisting member countries in developing their capabilities to detect fraudulent travel documents and providing training on best practices.  However, addressing this issue requires a holistic approach that extends beyond airport security measures. Tighter controls at borders, improved intelligence gathering and sharing, as well as greater collaboration with airlines and foreign counterparts, are all essential components in tackling this growing threat to global aviation security.  Efforts to strengthen document verification processes must go hand in hand with a comprehensive review of international protocols governing the reporting of stolen or lost passports. Improving communication channels between law enforcement agencies around the world can facilitate faster dissemination of relevant information, ensuring that compromised documents are flagged promptly.  Ultimately, preventing individuals from traveling on stolen or lost passports requires a collective effort from governments, law enforcement agencies, airport authorities, and international organizations like Interpol. Only through enhanced collaboration can we hope to close this dangerous loophole once and for all – making air travel safer for everyone involved.",continue
"The emergence of 3-D printed guns has sparked a heated debate surrounding the implications of this technology. While some argue that it promotes individual freedom and the right to self-defense, others assert that it poses a significant threat to public safety. The recent video release by Defense Distributed, a Texas-based group led by Cody Wilson, adds fuel to this contentious fire.  The Liberator, as the firearm is aptly named, showcases an unprecedented fusion of technology and weaponry. Consisting primarily of plastic parts created using a 3-D printer, its creation challenges traditional notions regarding gun manufacturing and regulation. The video offers viewers just a glimpse into its capabilities: one shot fired without any apparent damage.  However, experts have cautioned against viewing this demonstration in isolation. It remains unknown how effective or accurate The Liberator may truly be given that crucial details about its range and consistency are missing from the footage. Its effectiveness as a weapon also hinges on factors like the quality of materials used during construction and variations arising from assembling different versions.  Defense Distributed has made instructions for building The Liberator freely available online, adding another layer of complexity to an already controversial topic. Critics argue that such accessibility undermines existing gun control measures since these untraceable weapons cannot be regulated in traditional ways.  Additionally, concerns arise regarding potential misuse or nefarious applications of this technology by individuals with malicious intent. As 3-D printers become increasingly accessible to average citizens worldwide, some fear an increase in undetectable firearms slipping past security checkpoints or landing in the hands of unauthorized individuals.  On the other hand, proponents point out that restrictive gun laws could push individuals towards unregulated sources anyway; therefore making these blueprints available does not substantially change access levels but instead encourages transparency around emerging technologies like 3-D printing.  It is important to note that Defense Distributed operates within legal boundaries as they comply with current regulations surrounding firearms manufacture (at least according to their interpretation). Their actions bring attention not only to the potential implications of 3-D printed guns but also to broader discussions about freedom of information, regulation, and personal liberties.  As this complex debate continues to unfold, it is evident that new approaches are necessary to address the intersection between technology and gun control effectively. Policymakers must grapple with how best to regulate these emerging technologies while simultaneously respecting individual liberties. Some have argued for enhanced firearms regulations that encompass all aspects of production, requiring licensing or other means of oversight for the manufacturing and distribution of 3-D printed guns.  Others propose focusing on developing more sophisticated detection methods for identifying plastic firearms at security checkpoints. Collaboration between government agencies, private companies involved in 3-D printing technology, and independent research institutions will be crucial in finding effective solutions.  Ultimately, the emergence of 3-D printed guns heralds a paradigm shift in the traditional understanding of firearms production. It puts forth questions about what constitutes responsible use or misuse within a rapidly evolving technological landscape. To navigate this terrain successfully requires thoughtful consideration from all stakeholders: lawmakers, law enforcement agencies, manufacturers, advocates for individual liberty, public safety experts — indeed everyone concerned with crafting policies that balance innovation with responsible governance.",continue
"However, other scientists are not ready to declare ISON completely dead just yet. According to Carey Lisse, a senior astrophysicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, there is still a small chance that some part of the comet may have survived. The extreme heat and radiation from the sun could have caused ISON to lose its outer layers, resulting in its current faint appearance.  2. What caused ISON's demise? The exact cause of ISON's fading is still unknown. One possibility is that the intense heat caused the nucleus, or core of the comet, to completely disintegrate. Another theory suggests that a outburst of gas expelled from deep within ISON might have led to its early demise. The process of passing so close to a star can be extremely violent for comets and can result in their breakup or disintegration.  3. What did we learn from studying ISON? Despite its uncertain fate, Comet ISON has provided scientists with a valuable opportunity for studying comets up close and personal. Leading up to its encounter with the sun, telescopes around the world were focused on gathering data on this celestial object. Scientists were particularly interested in analyzing any changes in composition as it approached our star.  The information gathered from studying comets like ISON helps shed light on their formation and evolution within our solar system. Comets are believed to be remnants from the early stages of planet formation and can provide insight into conditions present during those times.  4) Will we see any remnants of ISON? There is a possibility that even if Comet ISON did not manage to survive intact, there may still be some remnants left behind for us to observe here on Earth. These remnants could include dust particles or small fragments that were once part of the original comet structure.  Additionally, as Earth continues along its orbit around the sun, it will pass through areas where debris shed by comets like ISON may be present. This could result in meteor showers or the appearance of new comets in the sky over the coming months.  5) What's next for studying comets? While ISON's fate remains uncertain, scientists are already looking ahead to future opportunities for studying comets. NASA's upcoming mission, the Comet Interceptor, is set to launch in 2028 and will flyby an as-yet-undetermined comet. The mission aims to provide detailed observations of a pristine comet from the outer edge of our solar system.  Additionally, advancements in space exploration technology will allow researchers to send spacecraft closer to cometary bodies than ever before. These missions will provide invaluable data on their composition, structure, and behavior when interacting with celestial bodies such as our sun.  In conclusion, while hopes were high that Comet ISON would put on a spectacular show after grazing the sun, it appears that it may have met its demise. However, scientists are not yet ready to declare it completely dead and continue analyzing data for any signs of its survival. Regardless of its ultimate fate, studying ISON has provided valuable insights into these enigmatic celestial objects and paves the way for future discoveries in understanding comets' role within our solar system.",continue

"Google's Gmail service burst onto the scene in 2004, revolutionizing the way people approached their email. With its generous storage space, intuitive interface, and powerful search capabilities, Gmail quickly became the go-to choice for many users. However, despite its popularity and seemingly free nature, it soon became apparent that there was a hidden cost to using this service.  While Gmail doesn't require users to pay any money upfront, it does come at a price – the privacy of its users. As a free service provided by Google, Gmail monetizes itself by leveraging the personal information of its users for targeted advertising purposes. By scanning the content of emails sent and received through its platform, Google collects valuable data about user preferences and interests.  This practice has not gone unnoticed or unchallenged. In both the United States and Europe, Gmail has faced numerous privacy lawsuits accusing the company of illegal wiretapping for intercepting and scanning emails without explicit permission from their senders or recipients.  Critics argue that Google's practices violate user privacy and infringe upon their rights to keep their personal correspondence confidential. The fact that automated algorithms scan email contents in search of keywords to tailor advertisements adds further fuel to these concerns.  As technology advances at an unprecedented pace in today's world, maintaining our digital privacy is becoming increasingly challenging. Companies like Google sit on vast amounts of personal data collected from billions of individuals worldwide. It raises questions about how this information is used beyond just targeted advertising.  One argument made in favor of Google's practices is that they allow for more relevant advertising tailored specifically to individual users' preferences rather than facing generic ads not catered directly towards them. Advertisers benefit from being able to reach consumers who are more likely to be interested in their products or services while consumers receive ads relevant to their interests instead of random promotions they may have no interest in.  Despite some potential benefits arising from this data collection approach – such as customized experiences and discovering new products – the central concern remains the potential breach of privacy. Google's powerful algorithms can collect a wealth of information from emails, including personal conversations, financial details, and even sensitive health-related discussions. Any instance of algorithmic malfunction or unauthorized access could have disastrous consequences for user privacy.  Moreover, the data collected by Google doesn't solely remain within its confines. As one of the world's largest technology companies, it partners with an extensive network of advertisers who are eager to harness this information for targeted marketing campaigns. This raises concerns about how secure and protected user data truly is within these partnerships.  In response to mounting privacy concerns, Google has made efforts to enhance transparency and control over users' personal information. They introduced features like personalized advertisement settings that allow users to manage their ad preferences and opt-out if desired.  Nevertheless, critics argue that simply providing users with options isn't enough. It is essential for companies like Google to be more proactive in protecting user privacy through stronger regulations and better disclosure practices regarding how personal data is collected, stored, and shared.  In conclusion, while Gmail remains a popular choice among millions worldwide due to its convenience and functionality as an email service provider, it does come at a cost – the erosion of individual privacy rights. The ongoing lawsuits against Google serve as a reminder that our digital footprints carry real consequences on our privacy in an increasingly interconnected world. Balancing convenience with maintaining our fundamental right to personal correspondence without unwarranted surveillance presents one of society's most pressing challenges as we navigate through the digital age.",continue
"As the news of Tourmobile's closure spread, it sent shockwaves through the tight-knit community of tour guides and employees. For over four decades, Tourmobile had been an iconic presence in Washington, offering sightseeing tours to millions of locals and tourists alike. Mel Bruce, like many others, had built a deep connection with the company and saw it not just as a job but as a part of her identity.  As she dropped off her last group of tourists at Arlington National Cemetery, emotions ran high. The quiet hum of the bus seemed ominous as it navigated through the hallowed grounds. For Bruce and her colleagues, these monuments held special meaning. They had spent years sharing stories about fallen soldiers and paying homage to their sacrifice. Now they were faced with an uncertain future.  Tourmobile's unique status was largely due to its exclusive contract for providing bus tours at Arlington National Cemetery—an honor they cherished deeply. But changes in transportation options coupled with financial difficulties led to their demise. The rise of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft meant more tourists chose alternative ways to explore the city. Additionally, maintaining a fleet of vintage-looking buses became increasingly costly over time.  For Bruce, who had worked for Tourmobile for over two decades, saying goodbye was especially difficult. ""I've seen generations grow up coming on this tour,"" she choked back tears as she reminisced about her time showing visitors around Washington's iconic sites.  The closure not only affected longtime employees like Bruce; it also sent ripples through other businesses closely tied to Tourmobile's operations—the souvenir shops that sold postcards featuring their buses or the restaurants where visitors would stop for a bite during their tour breaks.  For many former employees who depended on steady work from Tourmobile season after season—students saving up for college or retirees looking to supplement their income—this sudden loss left them in somewhat dire straits financially.  However bleak things may have seemed within this tight-knit community, they were not without hope. As news of Tourmobile's closure spread, local entrepreneurs and larger tour companies began to explore the possibility of filling the void left behind.  One such company was Capital City Tours, which had been running walking tours around D.C. for several years. Seeing an opportunity to expand their operations and help out their fellow tour guides, they quickly mobilized to develop bus tours that would rival Tourmobile's offerings.  With the backing of investors who recognized the value of maintaining top-notch sightseeing experiences in Washington, Capital City Tours swiftly secured contracts with Arlington National Cemetery and other major attractions around the city.  As word got out about these new offerings, many patrons who mourned Tourmobile's closure saw a glimmer of hope. New tour guides were hired from among former Tourmobile employees—their knowledge and expertise proving invaluable in preserving the quality experience visitors had come to expect.  And so, despite the end of an era marked by melancholy farewells at Union Station on that final day, a new chapter for Washington's tourism industry was already beginning to unfold. With renewed energy and determination from dedicated individuals like Mel Bruce and her colleagues at Tourmobile, it became clear that while one iconic company may have closed its doors forever—a part of its legacy would live on in even better ways for future generations to enjoy.",continue
"The Jafra brothers rush towards the sound, their eyes widening with anticipation. They gather around the spot where the call came from and see a small protrusion of earth. Carefully, Ram Bahadur pulls out his digging tool and starts to unearth the precious find. With each movement of his hands, he reveals more of the delicate caterpillar fungus.  The excitement in their eyes is mirrored by others in the field who have also discovered these elusive treasures. The harvesting season for Himalayan caterpillar fungus is short and intense, lasting only a few weeks in spring when the conditions are just right. This rarity and demand make it one of Nepal's most valuable natural resources.  As Ram Bahadur carefully collects each fungus, he thinks about what this means for his family back home. For generations, they have relied on this annual pilgrimage to Dolpa to earn a livelihood. The caterpillar fungus fetches high prices in international markets due to its reputed medicinal properties.  In traditional Chinese medicine, yartsa gunbu is believed to enhance vitality and treat various ailments such as impotence and respiratory problems. It has earned its nickname ""Himalayan Viagra"" due to its reputation for improving male sexual function. Demand from Chinese consumers drives up prices, creating a lucrative market that attracts collectors from all over Nepal.  However, this commercialization comes at a cost. The once tranquil fields are now bustling with activity as more and more people flock here each year to cash in on the booming trade. Traders set up makeshift tents where they weigh and pay harvesters for their bounty.  This surge in popularity has led to concerns about sustainability. Caterpillar fungus requires specific environmental conditions to thrive but years of overharvesting have taken their toll on Dolpa's fragile ecosystem.  Ram Bahadur remembers when he first started coming here with his father as a teenager; there were far fewer harvesters then compared to now. The mountainside was untouched, the caterpillar fungus abundant. But now, he can see signs of decline. The fields are being picked clean, and finding a single fungus has become increasingly difficult.  To counter this issue, local authorities have implemented regulations to protect the caterpillar fungus population. Harvesters must obtain permits and adhere to strict quotas to ensure the sustainable collection of this valuable resource.  Ram Bahadur supports these measures but worries about the future. He wonders if the demand for yartsa gunbu will continue to rise or if it will eventually dwindle as other alternatives emerge in modern medicine. He hopes that sustainable practices can be maintained so that future generations can also benefit from this unique source of income.  As Ram Bahadur continues his harvest, he reflects on how interconnected his livelihood is with nature. The mountains have provided for his family for decades, and he understands the importance of preserving their delicate balance.  As evening falls over Dolpa's majestic landscape, Ram Bahadur gathers his filled bag and joins his brothers at their campsite. They share a simple meal cooked over an open fire as they contemplate their next move.  Tomorrow they will resume their search for more Himalayan Viagra – delicate treasures hidden beneath blades of grass – knowing that their journey represents not just personal gain but also a responsibility to protect what nature has bestowed upon them.",continue
"As we set off on the Rogue River, it feels like stepping into a gentle dream. The water flows calmly and sparkles under the warm rays of the setting sun. The river is lined with lush greenery, towering trees, and vibrant wildflowers that wave at us in soft breezes. It's a picture-perfect postcard come to life.  Our guide, a knowledgeable winemaker by trade, explains that this trip is all about indulging our senses. We will be enjoying exquisite wine and gourmet meals prepared by talented chefs amidst the tranquil beauty of nature. It's an experience designed for those seeking relaxation and refined pleasures rather than adrenaline-fueled adventures.  Day 2: As we glide through the serene waters, I can't help but admire the picturesque landscape around me. The mountains rise majestically on either side of the river, their peaks catching hues of pink and gold from the fading sunset sky. It's a sight that feels both grounding and uplifting at once.  In between sips of carefully selected wines – each one perfectly complementing our culinary delights – conversation flows effortlessly among our small group. We learn about wine pairings, gastronomic techniques, and even share personal stories while lazily drifting downstream.  Day 3: Our journey takes us deeper into nature's embrace as we venture further downriver. The pace remains unhurried as we float past hidden coves teeming with wildlife - herons standing poised in solitude by the water's edge or deer delicately sipping from its cool embrace.  We stop to stretch our legs during riverside hikes where sunlight filters through forest canopies creating whimsical patterns on moss-covered trees and ferns below them. Each step taken seems to transport us back to simpler times when humans roamed less hurriedly on this earth.  On our final evening together, as twilight paints everything in shades of lavender-blue, we gather around a crackling campfire near the river's edge. It's a time for reflection and gratitude. The winemaker shares stories of his craft, the chefs reveal secrets behind their culinary creations, and we all relish the feeling of camaraderie that has blossomed between us in just a few days.  Reflecting back on this mild trip down the Rogue River, I realize it wasn't just about wine or food. It was about slowing down and reconnecting with nature, with ourselves, and with each other. It offered a soothing balm to our busy lives - a chance to appreciate the simple joys that often go unnoticed amidst our hectic routines.  As I bid farewell to my newfound friends and the river that embraced us so warmly, I can't help but carry a sense of tranquility within me. This gentle journey allowed me to rediscover the beauty in taking life at a slower pace - an art often lost in today's fast-paced world.  Whether you prefer this calm adventure or are seeking something more exhilarating is entirely up to you. But one thing is certain – no matter which trip you choose, rivers have an uncanny ability to captivate our hearts and minds as they lead us on unforgettable journeys beneath dazzling sunsets.",continue
"The case of Etan Patz, a 6-year-old boy who went missing in 1979, has haunted New York City for decades. Nearly four decades later, Pedro Hernandez emerged as the prime suspect in the case. A photograph obtained exclusively by CNN provides a glimpse into the life of Hernandez and adds to the mounting evidence against him.  The photograph, taken five years ago, portrays Hernandez dressed in a suit and tie, with glasses adorning his face. It presents an image that contrasts sharply with the horrific crime he is accused of committing. However, the picture sheds little light on what might have transpired during those fateful days in May 1979 when Etan Patz vanished without a trace.  Currently under psychiatric evaluation to determine his competency to stand trial, Hernandez remains under medical care. The examination aims to ascertain whether he possesses the mental capacity required to comprehend and participate effectively in court proceedings. As legal proceedings unfold slowly due to these evaluations, investigators are continuing their search for tangible evidence that could solidify their case against him.  Recently executed search warrants have yielded critical items from Hernandez's residence that are now being analyzed by forensic experts. Among these items were a computer drive and two satchels which may contain vital clues about Etan's disappearance. Investigators are carefully combing through these materials with hopes of uncovering any information that would help establish what happened all those years ago.  Hernandez's wife has been caught up in this investigation because her home was subject to search warrants as well. While it remains unclear if she had any knowledge or involvement in her husband's alleged crime, authorities must leave no stone unturned as they seek justice for Etan Patz.  Since his arrest last month following an alleged confession made to police detectives working on cold cases related to missing children from decades past, Pedro Hernandez has become immersed within public discourse surrounding child abductions and safety awareness campaigns throughout New York City.  Etan Patz's disappearance in 1979 had a profound impact not only on his family but also on the nation as a whole. It became one of the most high-profile missing child cases, leading to significant changes in how missing children are searched for and reported, as well as spurring legislation aimed at protecting children from harm.  Many believe that the upcoming trial of Pedro Hernandez, should he be deemed competent to stand trial, will finally bring closure to this notorious case. For Etan's family and all those affected by his disappearance, it would mean an opportunity to confront and hopefully find justice for their lost loved one.  As investigators painstakingly analyze every piece of evidence gathered during their search warrants at Hernandez's home, the fate of this troubling case hangs in the balance. With each new discovery and development, New York City inches closer toward a resolution that has eluded them for far too long.  The photograph obtained by CNN offers only a snapshot into Hernandez's life but does little to alleviate the profound grief felt by Etan Patz's loved ones. All eyes now turn toward the anticipated outcome of the psychiatric evaluation and subsequent legal proceedings—a crucial step towards uncovering what truly happened on that devastating day in 1979 when Etan Patz disappeared without a trace.",continue
"Gingrich argued that Obama should have taken a page out of George Washington's playbook and stood strong against foreign pressure. He reminded the audience of how Washington dealt with a similar incident during the American Revolution.  While it is not uncommon for politicians to invoke historical figures to bolster their arguments, using George Washington in this context seemed like a stretch. It raised eyebrows among political commentators and historians alike, who questioned the relevance of comparing the two situations.  George Washington was indeed known for his unwavering leadership during times of crisis. He faced numerous challenges as the leader of a fledgling nation, including conflicts with Native American tribes and European powers. However, making a direct comparison between those events and Obama's response to the Quran burning incident disregarded key differences in context.  The accidental burning of Qurans at a military base was an unfortunate mistake that deeply offended Muslim communities both in Afghanistan and around the world. Apologizing for such an incident is often considered necessary to repair relations and maintain diplomatic ties. While some argue that apologies can be seen as signs of weakness, they are often crucial for maintaining international cooperation and avoiding unnecessary escalation.  Gingrich's use of the ""George Washington card"" seemed more like an attempt to tap into nationalist sentiments rather than offering constructive solutions or insights on foreign policy challenges. By evoking one of America's most revered historical figures, he aimed to appeal to those who view any form of apology or concession as unpatriotic or capitulation.  However, Gingrich failed to acknowledge that leaders must adapt their approaches based on evolving circumstances. The global landscape has greatly changed since George Washington's time, with diplomacy playing an increasingly important role in international relations.  Moreover, invoking historical figures without fully understanding their actions can lead to mischaracterizations or oversimplifications of complex issues. Comparing two vastly different incidents from separate periods runs the risk of distorting history and sacrificing nuance for political gain.  This episode serves as a reminder that the ""card game"" of politics can sometimes take on dangerous dimensions. When politicians exploit historical figures, religious beliefs, or other sensitive topics solely for their personal gain, it undermines the integrity of political discourse and further divides society.  Instead of relying on these divisive tactics, it is crucial for leaders to promote a more thoughtful and nuanced approach to problem-solving. Understanding the complexities of various issues and proposing practical solutions based on empathy and cooperation should be at the forefront of political discussions.  In conclusion, Gingrich's use of the ""George Washington card"" was questionable at best. It highlighted a tendency in politics to exploit historical figures for personal gain rather than fostering productive conversations about pressing issues. Moving forward, it is essential for politicians to prioritize integrity over sensationalism and work towards creating a more united and informed electorate. It is also important for voters to be critical thinkers and not fall prey to these tactics. When politicians play the ""card game,"" it often distracts from substantive policy debates and instead focuses on emotional appeals designed to manipulate public opinion.  As citizens, we must demand more from our leaders. We should expect them to engage in meaningful discussions about complex issues, rather than resorting to simplistic comparisons or inflammatory rhetoric. By holding our elected officials accountable, we can encourage a more constructive political environment where solutions are prioritized over superficial tactics.  Furthermore, it is essential for us as individuals to educate ourselves about historical events and figures. Understanding the context in which they lived and the challenges they faced allows us to draw informed conclusions about their actions. History can provide valuable lessons for navigating contemporary problems but using it selectively or inaccurately only hinders progress.  Ultimately, politicians who rely on invented cards or manipulate historical figures undermine the democratic process itself. Rather than engaging in genuine dialogue with their constituents, they seek short-term gains by appealing to people's emotions and biases.  In order for democracy to thrive, we need integrity, transparency, and intellectual honesty from our leaders. We should demand thoughtful policies grounded in evidence-based reasoning rather than empty symbols or shallow rhetoric that serve no purpose other than dividing us further.  It is crucial that we remain vigilant against these divisive tactics and work towards building a society where political discourse encourages understanding rather than animosity. By encouraging civil dialogue based on mutual respect and empathy, we can foster a healthier political culture that serves all members of society.  In conclusion, Newt Gingrich's use of the ""George Washington card"" was an example of how politicians sometimes exploit history for personal gain. It demonstrates a concerning trend where politicians rely on emotional appeals rather than substantive policy discussions. As citizens, we must reject these divisive tactics by seeking out accurate information and engaging in thoughtful discourse ourselves. Ultimately, fostering a political environment based on integrity will lead to more informed decision-making and a healthier democracy for all.",continue
"During the Supreme Court arguments, Justice Ginsburg voiced concerns about the ambiguity surrounding what is considered indecent. In recent years, there have been numerous instances where broadcasters have been penalized for airing fleeting expletives or scenes of nudity. The FCC argues that these regulations are necessary to protect children and maintain public decency standards.  Opponents of the FCC's policies argue that the regulations infringe upon free speech rights and stifle artistic expression. They contend that with advancements in technology allowing parents to block certain content or utilize streaming services, traditional broadcast television should not be subject to such strict regulations. Some even assert that these rules are outdated in an era where explicit content is readily accessible through the internet.  Throughout the hour-long arguments, several justices seemed sympathetic towards striking down or at least limiting the FCC's authority in this area. Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned whether it was fair for broadcasters to face severe fines for something as brief as a slip of the tongue during a live broadcast. She suggested that perhaps there could be some middle ground between unfettered broadcasting and complete government censorship.  This case before the Supreme Court comes after nearly two decades of legal battles over indecency enforcement on television. The issue gained significant attention following high-profile incidents like Janet Jackson's ""wardrobe malfunction"" during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2004 and Cher's use of profanity during an awards show broadcast in 2002.  The court's decision will likely have far-reaching implications for both broadcasters and viewers across America. If they uphold the FCC's regulations, broadcasters may continue to face hefty fines if they accidentally air indecent content without time-delay mechanisms in place. This could potentially lead to self-censorship by networks fearful of violating these vague guidelines.  Conversely, if the court restricts or eliminates government regulation on indecency, it would mark a significant victory for free speech advocates but may also open up debates about what content is appropriate for public consumption. This could mean an influx of explicit material on television, which might have consequences for children and those who prefer more family-friendly programming.  The court's ruling will also test the extent to which the government can regulate different forms of media. As technology continues to evolve and viewers shift towards streaming services, the traditional broadcast medium may become less relevant in the future. This raises questions about whether government regulation in this area is becoming increasingly outdated and ineffective.  Ultimately, while the Supreme Court's decision will provide clarity on FCC regulation of indecent content, it may not completely resolve the debate surrounding profanity and sexual content on broadcast television. As society's standards and attitudes towards these issues continue to change, ongoing discussions about what is acceptable or inappropriate for public consumption are likely to persist. Public opinion on the regulation of indecency on broadcast television is divided. Some argue that these regulations are necessary to protect children and maintain societal decency standards, while others believe that they infringe upon free speech rights and stifle artistic expression.  Proponents of the FCC's policies contend that broadcast television remains a popular medium for families and children, warranting protection from indecent content. They argue that allowing explicit material on public airwaves would undermine the ability of parents to control what their children are exposed to. Moreover, they assert that these regulations help create a safer and more respectful society.  On the other hand, opponents argue that in today's digital age where explicit content is readily available online, government regulation on broadcast television seems arbitrary and unnecessary. They question whether it is fair for broadcasters to be held accountable for occasional slip-ups or brief instances of nudity when viewers have various tools at their disposal to filter or block such content.  The ongoing shift towards streaming platforms further complicates the issue. As more viewers transition away from traditional broadcasting and towards subscription-based services like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, there is a growing concern about inconsistent regulatory standards across different mediums. While broadcast television remains subject to regulatory oversight by the FCC, streaming platforms often operate beyond its purview.  With technological advancements continually reshaping how people consume media, the Supreme Court's decision will likely set an important precedent regarding government regulation in an increasingly fragmented media landscape.  It is worth noting that this case does not directly address obscenity laws; instead, it focuses specifically on fleeting expletives or brief scenes of nudity in live or scripted programming. Obscenity falls under a different legal category altogether and receives even less constitutional protection than indecent speech.  The outcome of this court case could have implications beyond just television broadcasting as well. It may influence discussions surrounding censorship in other forms of media such as radio broadcasts or even social media platforms where explicit content can also appear.  While it remains to be seen how the Supreme Court will ultimately rule, this case presents an opportunity for the court to balance the need to protect public decency standards with constitutional guarantees of free speech. The court's decision will shape not only how indecency is regulated on broadcast television, but also influence broader conversations about media regulation and the evolving boundaries of acceptable content in a rapidly changing digital landscape.",continue

"Sudanese Appeals Court Begins Deliberation on Acclaimed Humanitarian's Liberation Amidst Mounting International Pressure  Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- The Sudanese appeals court has commenced deliberations concerning the explosive case of Ahmad Mustafa, a renowned humanitarian aid worker unjustly imprisoned for his groundbreaking efforts in creating sustainable agricultural practices across war-torn regions. Mustafa, 32, was detained under suspicious circumstances earlier this year during a routine visit to provide essential aid supplies in war-ravaged South Darfur.  Mustafa's case has garnered widespread attention and sparked international outrage as he is being persecuted merely for his selfless devotion to alleviating the suffering of vulnerable communities plagued by the horrors of civil unrest and famine. Legal experts argue that the Sudanese government is utilizing baseless charges as a means to stifle activism and suppress individuals genuinely dedicated to positive change.  The tireless organizer has been accused of inciting violence against state forces by supporting rebel movements - allegations vehemently denied by his colleagues and supporters who insist on his integrity and commitment to non-violence. Despite the lack of evidence presented against him, Mustafa was subjected to an expedited trial that fell far short of internationally recognized standards.  Global human rights organizations have rallied behind Mustafa's cause, condemning Sudan's abhorrent violation of due process in handling this case. Amnesty International issued an urgent appeal in April demanding his immediate release and calling upon the Sudanese government to uphold its obligations under international law regarding fair trials.  ""Ahmad Mustafa is one among many dedicated aid workers facing harassment at the hands of repressive regimes,"" said John Allen, spokesperson for Amnesty International. ""His unwarranted detention represents nothing but an attack on freedom and a blatant disregard for human rights.""  Amidst mounting pressure from foreign governments such as Canada, where Ahmed holds dual citizenship, officials from Khartoum were compelled to offer slight concessions by agreeing to a fair and impartial hearing before the appeals court. While this move signifies a potential opening for justice, critics emphasize that it should not overshadow the broader issue of Sudan's dismal track record for stifling dissent and quashing humanitarian efforts.  Mustafa's family has been relentless in their campaign to free him from incarceration, tirelessly circulating petitions, organizing protests and engaging with influential figures within political spheres. His wife, Nadia Mustafa, expressed gratitude for the continued support received from all corners of the globe. ""We are heartened by the solidarity shown by people across nations,"" she said tearfully during an emotional interview granted exclusively to CNN.  International attention on Mustafa's case has now intensified since Mariam Yehya Ibrahim—a Sudanese Christian woman—was sentenced to death last month. Ibrahim had triggered outrage worldwide after being condemned for refusing to renounce her faith in Islam due to Sharia law's crippling limitations on religious freedom.  Human rights activists have drawn parallels between both cases as they highlight an alarming pattern of systemic oppression prevalent in Sudanese society. The trials of both Mustafa and Ibrahim underscore the urgency for widespread reforms aimed at safeguarding religious liberty and protecting basic human rights within Sudan.  As deliberations continue inside Khartoum's appeals court chambers, activists across continents anxiously await news concerning Mustafa's fate. The outcome of his trial is set to influence international perceptions of Sudan as its government grapples with multiple accusations related to suppression of dissent and infringement upon fundamental liberties.  With tensions running high over ongoing conflicts in various regions throughout Sudan, civil society organizations emphasize that securing justice for Ahmad Mustafa must be viewed as a crucial step towards building lasting peace and promoting genuine dialogue between warring factions.  The eyes of the global community remain fixed upon this pivotal moment in Sudanese legal history as it strives towards balancing internal stability while appeasing international expectations regarding human rights abuses.

"Title: Rising Tensions in Hyperconnected Globe Highlight the Need for Global Cooperation  (CNN) - In 2010, Americans were prescribed a record-breaking number of antibiotics, signaling an alarming rate of perils associated with widespread antibiotic use. While the consequences of such cumulative exposures remain largely unknown, mounting evidence suggests that our excessive reliance on antibiotics has resulted in unexpected outcomes. Today, we shed light on a new concern - the depletion of our friendly bacteria due to antibiotic use could be compromising our ability to fend off infections and creating a daunting risk for global plagues without natural boundaries.  However, as the world grapples with this persistent threat, a different crisis is unfolding in one corner of this hyperconnected globe - Bangkok. This bustling city renowned for its vibrant culture and thriving tourism industry now finds itself at the epicenter of escalating tensions between local residents and multinational corporations.  For years, Bangkok's iconic Chao Phraya River served as a lifeline connecting communities and fueling economic growth. However, recent controversial infrastructural developments initiated by foreign conglomerates have left citizens questioning their place within this fast-paced development race.  The crux of their discontent lies with three major proposed projects: an expansive luxury resort that will engulf previously untouched green spaces next to Wat Arun Temple; an industrial complex causing upheaval among local fishermen who rely on the river's resources; and plans for high-rise condominiums encroaching upon traditional neighborhoods along the riverbanks.  ""This is not just about profits anymore; it's about preserving our heritage and protecting future generations,"" asserts Saranya Sahasaksawatphorn, leader of The People's Alliance for Sustainable Development (PASD), a grassroots organization spearheading protest movements against these endeavors.  Saharnya's sentiments are echoed by many locals who fear that these developments will irreparably damage Bangkok's delicate ecological balance while eliminating affordable housing options for low-income families. The city that once basked in cultural richness and natural beauty is now facing an uncertain future.  As tensions escalate, the City Administration has called for dialogue between concerned citizens, multinational corporations, and government officials. However, mistrust runs deep as Bangkok residents feel their voices have long been overlooked in favor of foreign interests.  International human rights activists have shown solidarity with Bangkok's residents by organizing a global campaign to raise awareness about the potential ramifications of these projects. Organizations like Global Rights Watch have urged multinational corporations to consider more sustainable and socially responsible approaches that allow for both economic growth and preservation of local culture.  In an age where technology connects us all instantaneously, this standoff is emblematic of the increasing friction between globalization's promises and preserving local identities. Whether it be rampant antibiotic use stripping us of our immunity or controversial development projects threatening treasured historic sites, the need for global cooperation has never been greater.  Bangkok serves as a vivid reminder that our interconnectedness goes beyond just sharing information; it necessitates a responsibility towards one another - locally and globally. In an era plagued with uncertainties brought forth by climate change, geopolitical tensions, pandemics, and socio-economic inequality - finding common ground becomes imperative.  As discussions commence within the bustling streets of Bangkok between community leaders, environmental activists, corporate representatives, and policymakers alike – they represent a broader conversation demanding urgent attention worldwide. If we fail to address these concerns collectively while upholding respect for cultural heritage and human rights within our hyperconnected globe today- tomorrow's challenges could become insurmountable plagues affecting us all indiscriminately.",create

"(CNN) -- Tragedy struck Nigeria's bustling capital city of Abuja on Monday as a large explosion rocked the Nyanya motor park, leaving scores dead and many others injured. The blast, which occurred during morning rush hour, sent shockwaves throughout the country and raised concerns about national security.  Eyewitnesses reported a scene of chaos after the explosion, with shattered glass and debris strewn across the area. Emergency services rushed to the park to assist victims and transport them to nearby hospitals. Local hospitals quickly became overcrowded as they struggled to cope with the influx of casualties.  The Nigerian authorities swiftly condemned the attack, labeling it as an act of terrorism. No group has claimed responsibility for the blast so far, but suspicion is likely to fall on Boko Haram, an extremist Islamist organization known for its attacks on civilians in Nigeria.  President Goodluck Jonathan addressed the nation shortly after news of the tragedy broke, expressing his condolences to all those affected by ""this cowardly act."" He promised a thorough investigation into what he called ""an attack on our collective humanity"" and vowed that those responsible would be brought to justice.  Monday's incident brings back painful memories for many Nigerians who recall previous acts of violence that have targeted crowded places such as parks and markets. In April 2014, a similar bombing in Nyanya killed over 70 people and injured more than 100 others.

The international community has also voiced its solidarity with Nigeria during these difficult times.  Local security forces have heightened their presence across major cities in response to potential further attacks. Additional measures are being implemented at transport hubs such as bus parks and train stations in an effort to prevent future incidents from occurring.  Nigerian citizens are reevaluating their daily routines amid the heightened security concerns. Commuters are wary of crowded places, and many parents are keeping their children at home from school until further notice.  The explosion has also rekindled debates about national security measures and raised questions about the efficiency of intelligence gathering in the fight against terrorism. Concerns have been raised over possible lapses in security, especially considering that this attack occurred despite prior similar incidents.  In a bid to enhance their response capabilities, Nigerian authorities have called upon international partners for technical assistance and support. The United States has pledged its commitment to aiding Nigeria in its fight against terrorism and assisting with investigations into this heinous act.  As Nigerians mourn the loss of innocent lives, they remain resilient and united. The Nigerian spirit has time and again demonstrated a determination to overcome challenges posed by violent acts perpetrated by extremist groups.  This latest tragedy serves as a reminder of the ongoing battle Nigeria faces against terrorism. The government must now focus on intensifying counterterrorism efforts while also addressing broader issues such as poverty, inequality, and social infrastructure that might contribute to sentiments propelling extremist ideologies.  In these dark times, Nigerians are relying on their national identity to unite them in grief as well as resilience. ""We will not be deterred,"" President Jonathan emphasized during his address to the nation. As Abuja begins its journey towards healing after this horrific incident, the need for national unity is more crucial than ever before.",create

"Protests Erupt in Osaka as Locals React to Controversial Construction Project  OSAKA, Japan (CNN) - Strong backlash has erupted in Osaka following the announcement of a controversial construction project that has raised concerns among local residents and environmentalists alike. The proposed development, announced on Tuesday by city officials, aims to transform a pristine forested area into a massive amusement park.  The project has faced immediate criticism from activists who argue that it will irreversibly damage the unique flora and fauna of the region. The forest, located on the outskirts of Osaka, is home to several endangered species and serves as an important ecological corridor.  Mayor Toru Hashimoto's administration claims that the amusement park will boost tourism and provide much-needed economic growth for the city. However, locals have expressed frustration with what they perceive as a lack of transparency throughout the decision-making process.  Yumi Nakamura, an activist who lives near the planned construction site, voiced her concerns: ""We feel betrayed by our own government. This development goes against everything we stand for – preservation of our natural heritage.""  The controversy surrounding this construction project comes at a time when Mayor Hashimoto is already under fire for his recent remarks regarding comfort women during World War II. These comments have caused significant uproar both nationally and internationally, leading many to question his judgment on matters pertaining to sensitive issues.

"New York (CNN) -- A mysterious fire broke out in a historic building in downtown Manhattan, leaving residents and authorities baffled. The three-alarm blaze erupted late Sunday night, engulfing the old New York City courthouse in flames that quickly spread throughout the structure. Firefighters battled the inferno for several hours before finally gaining control early Monday morning.  The iconic courthouse, built in 1803 and known for its stunning neoclassical architecture, has long been a symbol of justice and legal proceedings. Over the years, it has served as a testament to New York City's rich history. Its ornate interior featured grand courtrooms meticulously adorned with opulent marble pillars and intricate woodwork.  Eyewitnesses reported seeing thick plumes of black smoke billowing from several windows as flames danced through shattered glass panes on multiple floors. Despite valiant efforts by firefighters to contain the fire's spread to nearby buildings, some neighboring structures sustained minor damage due to heat radiating from the courthouse.  Authorities swiftly evacuated surrounding residential areas as they battled both time and fierce winds trying to extinguish the raging blaze. The New York Fire Department sent over 300 firefighters equipped with aerial ladder trucks and heavy-duty hoses to combat the inferno that threatened not only property but also potential lives.  Local resident Sarah Thompson recounted her harrowing experience when she spotted smoke engulfing her apartment building across the street. ""I heard sirens blaring outside my window; it was like something out of a movie,"" Thompson said. ""We were told we had just minutes to evacuate safely."" Alongside her neighbors, Thompson gathered essential belongings before fleeing as ash rained down from above.  Although authorities were quick to respond with forceful firefighting tactics, questions lingered about how such an extensive blaze could have started spontaneously within an empty building under renovation works.  ""Not only did this incident endanger lives and wreak havoc on city infrastructure,"" stated Mayor John Anderson during an emergency press conference, ""but also, the loss of a historical landmark shatters our shared heritage and collective memory. The cause of this fire will be thoroughly investigated to hold accountable those responsible.""  The courthouse had been undergoing extensive renovations in recent months but had remained vacant during this period. Construction workers had been diligently restoring the historic building's deteriorating facade and reinforcing its delicate framework.  City officials confirmed they would appoint a team of experts to investigate the cause of the fire alongside law enforcement agencies. Speculation has already arisen regarding potential electrical faults or arson as some suspicious activity was reported late Sunday night in proximity to the courthouse.  Amidst piles of charred debris and mangled metal beams, many New Yorkers mourned the loss of an architectural gem that embodied their city's resilience and rich history. The courthouse had stood as a silent witness to countless trials, serving as a symbolic battleground for justice seekers for over two centuries.  The Mayor's Office announced plans to hold a public hearing later this week inviting community leaders, historians, architects, and concerned citizens to discuss strategies for preserving what remains of the iconic structure while deliberating on potential reconstruction efforts.  As officials begin investigating how this devastating fire unfolded inside one of Manhattan's cherished landmarks, questions abound: What caused this historical treasure to crumble into ashes? Who will bear responsibility for its destruction? And perhaps most importantly for many New Yorkers - Will justice ever be served for such an irreparable loss?  Only time will tell as authorities work tirelessly to unearth answers among smoldering ruins that now stand as evidence in what has become both an architectural tragedy and an enduring mystery in downtown Manhattan.",create

"Title: Booming Tech Start-up in Chicago Secures Billion-Dollar Investment  Chicago, IL (CNN) - In a groundbreaking development, a fast-rising tech start-up in the heart of Chicago has secured an unprecedented billion-dollar investment to fuel its further expansion. The news comes amid the ongoing Chicago teachers strike, which has captured national attention as negotiations enter their second week.  The city's bustling streets are abuzz with excitement as SpecTech Inc., an innovative technology company specializing in cutting-edge software solutions, announced today that it has received a staggering investment from global venture capital firm Stellar Ventures. This influx of funds is expected to propel SpecTech into becoming one of the leading players in the ever-evolving tech scene.  SpecTech's CEO and co-founder, Lisa Anderson, expressed her gratitude for the tremendous investment and outlined their ambitious plans for growth. ""This injection of funds will allow us to advance our research and development efforts, expand our workforce significantly, and drive innovation across various sectors,"" Anderson said during a press conference held at their state-of-the-art headquarters.  With this substantial backing, SpecTech aims to triple its talent pool by hiring hundreds of top technologists and engineers from universities nationwide over the next three years. The company's expansion plans also include opening several satellite offices across North America and establishing strategic partnerships with major industry players.  Commenting on this exciting milestone for both SpecTech and Chicago's flourishing technology sector, Mayor James Johnson hailed it as recognition of Chicago's standing as an emerging tech hub. ""SpecTech's meteoric rise epitomizes our vision for transforming Chicago into a thriving center for technological innovation,"" said Mayor Johnson. He added that he looks forward to witnessing locals benefitting from job opportunities stemming from this milestone achievement.  In recent years, Silicon Valley has predominantly dominated tech start-up investments; however, this significant financial endorsement highlights Chicago's emergence as a viable alternative destination for financiers seeking cutting-edge enterprises outside the traditional tech stronghold.  Stellar Ventures' decision to invest in SpecTech stems from their unwavering belief in the company's potential to disrupt various industries, including healthcare, logistics, and finance. Their proprietary software solutions have already garnered acclaim for streamlining processes and increasing efficiency across Chicago-based firms.  As speculation surrounds the size of Stellar Venture's investment in SpecTech, industry analysts predict that it could potentially surpass previous record-breaking investments within the Midwest. This infusion of capital is expected to fuel further innovation within the local start-up ecosystem and solidify Chicago's position as a formidable player in the global technology landscape.  While job creation and economic growth are promising outcomes of this momentous event, many locals hope it will provide a silver lining amid ongoing concerns over the Chicago teachers strike. The strike has disrupted education for over 350,000 students across the city as educators negotiate for improved working conditions and safeguards against potential job losses tied to performance evaluations.  The juxtaposition between a booming tech industry securing billion-dollar investments and ongoing labor unrest underscores Chicago's diverse socioeconomic landscape. It accentuates how multiple stories unfold simultaneously within any given city - each showcasing distinct challenges and triumphs faced by its residents, stakeholders, and businesses.  As SpecTech eagerly embraces this significant investment opportunity with open arms, attention now turns to its plans for consolidation and expansion on both national and international fronts. Moreover, with thoughtful collaborations between emerging start-ups like SpecTech alongside influential public school systems like Chicago Public Schools (CPS), there may yet be opportunities to address pressing educational concerns through innovative technological solutions beyond just fundraising efforts.  In these uncertain times when communal well-being rests on balancing progressive growth with societal demands - such as quality education - entrepreneurial vibrancy coupled with concerted efforts towards social harmony will be essential in shaping cities' future trajectories such as vibrant metropolises like Chicago aspire.

"CNN - Tragedy Strikes as Massive Earthquake Hits Israel, Raises Concerns Over Safety for Upcoming Tournament  (CNN) -- Israel's ability to host a top European age-grade soccer tournament next year has been called into question following a devastating earthquake that struck the region earlier this week. The catastrophic event has left communities in shock and raised concerns over the safety of hosting such a high-profile event in an earthquake-prone area.  The powerful quake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, struck Israel and its neighboring countries on Monday morning, causing widespread destruction and claiming numerous lives. The tremors were felt as far away as Jordan, Lebanon, and Palestine.  In response to the devastating impact of the earthquake on local communities, leading soccer stars from across Europe have voiced their concerns about holding the tournament in an area prone to seismic activity. Prominent players including Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Neymar Jr. signed a petition expressing solidarity with the affected populations.  ""We stand with those affected by this tragic natural disaster,"" said Messi. ""Our thoughts go out to all those who have lost their loved ones or suffered injuries during this difficult time.""  The petition further emphasized that prioritizing human safety should be paramount when selecting host cities for major international events.  The earthquake caused severe damage throughout several regions of Israel, with aftershocks continuing to rattle affected areas even days after initial impact. Buildings collapsed under the tremendous force of tectonic plates shifting beneath populated areas. Rescue efforts are currently underway as emergency personnel work tirelessly to save lives buried beneath debris.  As news of both casualties and structural damage emerged in wake of disaster struck cities like Jerusalem and Tel Aviv-Yafo specifically hard-hit by major quakes referred to experts at USGS (United States Geological Survey) as unnatural phenomena we here observe early warning system malfunction which escalated definitions inaccurate stating now earthquakes must not be calling 'natural'.  Critics argue that long-standing warnings of potential seismic activity in the region have been largely ignored by authorities, who opted to prioritize other factors in their bid to secure the tournament hosting rights.  However, despite these concerns, tournament organizers remain committed to holding the event in Israel next year. Speaking on behalf of the organizing committee, spokesperson Rachel Cohen stated that they are constantly monitoring and evaluating the situation.  ""Safety is our utmost priority,"" said Cohen. ""We are working closely with local authorities and experts to assess the earthquake impact and determine whether any necessary adjustments need to be made.""  Cohen further highlighted that holding a major international tournament would also provide an opportunity for Israel to rebuild and heal after this catastrophic event by showcasing unity and resilience.  The devastating earthquake has not only caused apprehension within sports circles but has also prompted residents across Israel to question their country's preparedness for such natural disasters. Many are now demanding a stronger focus on infrastructure development, including reinforced buildings capable of withstanding tremors of such magnitude.  As discussions continue in determining whether it is feasible or safe for Israel to host next year's age-grade soccer tournament amidst ongoing seismic activity, one thing remains certain: this catastrophe serves as a stark reminder that safety considerations must always remain at the forefront when selecting host cities for major events.

"(CNN) -- In a dramatic turn of events, a massive fire broke out at the Oakland port terminal earlier today, causing significant damage to several warehouses and temporarily forcing the closure of one of California's busiest shipping hubs.  The blaze, which erupted around noon local time, sent plumes of thick black smoke billowing into the sky and prompted an immediate response from local firefighters. The cause of the fire remains unknown at this time, but authorities are actively investigating.  The flames quickly engulfed multiple warehouses within the port terminal complex, posing a significant challenge for firefighters as they battled to contain and extinguish the inferno. Fire helicopters were also dispatched to assist in dousing the area with water from above.  ""The fire has caused extensive damage to some warehouses,"" said Carla Ramirez, spokesperson for the Oakland Fire Department. ""Our priority right now is ensuring everyone's safety and bringing this dangerous situation under control.""  Residents living nearby were urged to stay indoors and close their windows due to heavy smoke conditions. The toxic fumes created by burning cargo added another layer of complexity for emergency personnel working tirelessly on-site.  Authorities promptly evacuated workers from surrounding areas as a precautionary measure while firefighting operations continued. Thankfully no injuries or casualties have been reported thus far.  The shutdown caused by this incident has had severe implications for both national and international trade operations passing through Oakland's bustling port terminal. Large shipments attempting to gain entry into California have been halted indefinitely until further notice.  Albert Martinez, CEO of Pacific Shipping Industries (PSI), expressed his concern over how this unforeseen event would impact his company:  ""This unprecedented fire at our operational hub in Oakland will undoubtedly impact our business in severe ways,"" said Martinez in a statement released earlier today. ""We rely heavily on smooth operations at this port terminal to serve our customers effectively.""  Martinez added that PSI was already exploring alternative routes and transportation options amidst these challenging circumstances.  Local business owners echoed similar sentiments about their disrupted operations caused by the fire. One warehouse owner, who requested anonymity, stated, ""This fire is devastating for us. We have valuable inventory stored at our facility, and this setback will undoubtedly have long-lasting consequences.""  In a press conference held shortly after the incident, Robert Bernardo, communications manager for the port authority, expressed his concern over the event's impact on Oakland's economy.  ""The disruption caused by this fire has dealt a significant blow to our local businesses and will inevitably affect job creation in the region,"" said Bernardo. ""We must work swiftly to recover and restore confidence among our partners to bring business back here.""  Bernardo assured residents that every effort was being made to reopen unaffected areas of the port terminal as quickly as possible while simultaneously investigating the cause of this devastating blaze.  As investigations into this unexpected fire continue behind closed doors, experts predict that it may take several weeks before full operations are restored at Oakland's port terminal. In the meantime, neighboring ports are expected to witness increased traffic as shipping companies scramble to reroute their shipments.  Authorities urge anyone with information regarding this incident or potential leads related to its cause to come forward and assist in their ongoing investigation.  As firefighters battle against time and unpredictable weather conditions in their efforts to completely douse the flames within Oakland's port terminal complex today, questions about what triggered this catastrophic event remain unanswered – leaving authorities searching for answers and affected businesses grappling with an uncertain future not anticipated just hours ago.",create
"Washington (CNN) -- An extraordinary spectacle unfolded on Wednesday as Washingtonians gathered at the National Mall for a once-in-a-lifetime event. Tens of thousands of people flocked to witness the unveiling of a gigantic art installation, transforming the iconic landscape into a mesmerizing masterpiece.  ""The Reflections,"" as it is called, was conceived by renowned artist Sarah Mitchell and her team of designers. Stretching across a quarter mile, this massive installation consists of semi-transparent mirrors placed strategically around the National Mall. The artwork's purpose is to encourage visitors to reflect upon themselves, their surroundings, and their place in history.  As the sun began its descent toward the horizon, casting its soft golden light upon the capital city's landmarks, visitors marveled at their own reflections merging with those of monuments such as the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument. Families enjoyed taking selfies while appearing to touch or engage with historical figures depicted in statues throughout the area.  The event organizer described ""The Reflections"" as an interactive experience designed to evoke introspection and foster connection. ""We wanted people from all walks of life to come here and see themselves not just as individuals but as part of something greater,"" Mitchell explained during an interview with CNN.  Spectators were awestruck by how these simple mirrors could transform their perspectives and create unique visual illusions; some noted that standing next to fellow visitors suggested unity while beholding one's own reflection symbolized self-empowerment.  ""I have never seen anything like this before! It feels magical,"" exclaimed Linda Carter who had traveled from New York City just for this occasion. ""This artwork really makes you appreciate your inner strength and realize how small we are in comparison to history.""  The National Park Service worked closely with Mitchell over several months ensuring there would be no damage caused during installation or dismantling processes due to environmental concerns related to local fauna inhabiting certain areas within proximity; wildlife experts were on standby throughout working hours.  As darkness fell, the atmosphere shifted dramatically. Custom lighting fixtures were strategically placed to enhance the visuals and create an otherworldly ambiance. Colored lights reflected off the mirrors, casting a kaleidoscope of hues across the entire installation.  ""I feel like I'm in a dream,"" said John Collins, a local resident who had stumbled upon the event during his evening walk. ""The way this art plays with light is enchanting.""  ""The Reflections"" will be on display until next month as part of Washington's ongoing efforts to promote arts and culture within its community. The exhibition aims to attract tourists from around the country and even abroad, contributing significantly to local businesses impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in recent times.  Local authorities have organized additional events such as educational sessions for schoolchildren and guided tours focused on discussing concepts of self-reflection, history, and identity as related to social progress.  Governor John Andrews applauded this initiative during his speech at Wednesday's inauguration. ""Art has always been a powerful tool for conveying messages that words alone often fail to express,"" he proclaimed. ""May this extraordinary installation remind us all that we are part of a shared journey.""  As thousands continued flocking to witness this phenomenal display at Washington's heart, it became clear that ""The Reflections"" had resonated deeply with visitors from all walks of life. In today's fast-paced world filled with distractions, taking a moment to pause and reflect proved profound and impactful for many who ventured into Mitchell's visually stunning creation.  In an era where people often get caught up in their own lives without considering their place within society or broader history; it is hoped that moments spent contemplating within ""The Reflections"" will foster greater empathy, connection, and personal growth among its audience - one mirroring experience at a time.",create
"(CNN) -- As tensions continue to rise in Syria, the country's Foreign Minister, Walid Moallem, has expressed deep concern over the recent outbreak of violence in the region. In a press conference held earlier today, Moallem vowed to uphold the principles of peace and stability in order to protect Syria's reputation on the global stage.  ""We are deeply saddened by the escalation of violence between factions within our country,"" said Moallem. ""However, we remain steadfast in our commitment to preserving our nation's independence and sovereignty.""  With reports of increasing unrest and a rising death toll as a result of ongoing conflicts, concerns have been raised about Syria's stability. Clashes between opposing groups have plagued cities across the country for nearly a year now.  In response to mounting criticism over his government's handling of these internal challenges, Moallem defended his administration's efforts. He dismissed claims that Syrians were dying due to starvation or inadequate medical care and reaffirmed his government's dedication in providing essential services despite international sanctions.  ""Can we truly believe any other government cares more about Syrian people than their own government?"" questioned Moallem rhetorically during his address. ""The Syrian people are our priority; their welfare is at the forefront of our agenda.""  While acknowledging innocent lives lost during this period of civil unrest, Moallem called for unity among Syrians as they face numerous challenges together. He emphasized that only through national solidarity can they overcome these trying times.  As news continues to unfold within Syria’s borders, attention is also drawn towards other events unfolding on its outskirts. Recent reports suggest that tension has grown between neighboring countries Lebanon and Israel. The disputed Shebaa Farms area near southern Lebanon has become an area wrought with potential flashpoints.  Both nations have accused each other of encroaching upon sovereign territory near this contested border region. These allegations escalate an already volatile situation plaguing not only Lebanon but also regional geopolitics.  The United Nations and other influential countries have called for restraint and a peaceful resolution to this escalating dispute, hoping to prevent the region from descending into further chaos. As tensions rise, concerns mount about the potential impact of this bilateral standoff on regional stability.  Efforts have been made by international leaders to mediate between Lebanon and Israel. High-level diplomatic delegations have been dispatched in an attempt to ease tensions and facilitate negotiations.  In a statement issued earlier today, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his concern over the situation. ""We urge both parties involved in this dispute to exercise maximum restraint and work towards finding a peaceful solution,"" he urged.  Guterres also emphasized the importance of preserving stability within Lebanon, given its strategic location as well as its history marred by conflict. The international community remains cautiously optimistic that dialogue will prevail, allowing for a peaceful resolution to this potentially volatile situation.  Against a backdrop of rising tensions both within Syria and among neighboring countries, it is crucial that all parties involved prioritize open communication channels and diplomatic efforts. Only through dialogue can lasting peace be achieved.""  As events continue to unfold rapidly in Syria and beyond, it remains uncertain how regional dynamics will shape up in the days ahead. However, one thing is clear: national autonomy alongside cooperative diplomacy will be instrumental in resolving conflicts while maintaining stability across borders.",create
"Headline: Hong Kong Protests: Calls for Democracy and Freedom Echo in the Streets  Date: October 1, 2022  CNN - Trust needs to be rebuilt. That's what the people of Hong Kong firmly asserted on Friday as they took to the streets in massive numbers to demand democracy and freedom. This unprecedented display of unity by Hong Kong citizens has sparked a renewed debate over autonomy and government freedoms in the region, severely shaking the already fragile relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China.  Protesters flooded the streets as early as dawn, waving banners and shouting slogans advocating for universal suffrage. The movement was sparked by recent allegations of infringements upon fundamental rights in the city, which have exacerbated tensions with Beijing. Demonstrators called for a fully democratic system that allows them to elect their own leaders rather than being governed by an appointed chief executive.  ""Obviously, words will not be sufficient,"" said Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist who led one of the largest rallies on Friday morning. ""True change is necessary.""  The outpouring of public discontent and frustration echoes back to 2019 when massive protests erupted over an extradition bill proposed by Hong Kong's government leadership that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. The bill was ultimately withdrawn but since then calls for greater democratic reforms have only grown stronger.  As shouts demanding accountability reverberated through central Hong Kong today, thousands gathered outside government buildings demanding change from their political representatives who they feel are not doing enough.  Chief Executive Carrie Lam reacted cautiously initially but later expressed willingness to engage with protesters regarding their demands for electoral reform while maintaining Beijing's support is crucial.  Other global leaders are also weighing in on this important issue, with countries such as Germany offering statements of solidarity with those fighting for democracy in Hong Kong.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised concerns over human rights abuses last month during her visit to promote trade relations between Europe and Asia at a summit with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, highlighting that trust must be upheld by all nations.  Forced silence seems to have reached its boiling point as individuals who once hesitated to voice their opinions are finding the courage to demand change. It is evident now that Hong Kong's struggle for democracy and justice is far from over.  Amid global conversations surrounding human rights, the international community awaits China's response. Will Beijing embrace dialogue and address the people's legitimate demands? Or will they opt for heavy-handed tactics intended to quell dissent?  In this pivotal moment, pro-democracy activists and citizens of Hong Kong alike remain steadfast in their united pursuit of democratic freedoms. Reinforcing their commitment to peaceful demonstrations and civil discourse, protesters vow to continue occupying public spaces until their voices are heard.  As night falls on this historic day in Hong Kong, the question on many minds remains - will these calls for democracy shape the future or merely fade into memory as yet another chapter in a longstanding struggle between autonomy and control?",create
"Title: Seattle City Council Passes Groundbreaking Climate Change Legislation  Seattle, Washington - In a bold move to address the pressing issue of climate change, the Seattle City Council has voted in favor of groundbreaking legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning the city to a more sustainable future. The decision marks a significant step forward in combating climate change on a local level.  Thursday's city council meeting saw progressive members of the Democratic Party take center stage as they passionately advocated for the passage of this historic bill. The legislation, which was met with fierce opposition from some quarters, is seen as an example of Washington's continued commitment to take substantial action against climate change.  In an exclusive interview following the successful vote, Councilperson Sarah Parker emphasized that ""this momentous decision sends a clear message that Seattle is ready to lead by example when it comes to tackling one of humanity's greatest challenges. We cannot afford to delay any longer – our planet needs us now.""  The new measures outlined in the legislation go beyond traditional environmentally-friendly policies by imposing stricter regulations on carbon emissions across multiple sectors. It also includes provisions for investment in renewable energy sources and electric transportation infrastructure within city limits.  Progressive groups such as Greenpeace and Sunrise Movement have hailed this development as an important milestone in combating climate change locally while calling for similar actions across other cities nationwide.  ""The passing of this bill is only just the beginning,"" said Emily Woods, spokesperson for Greenpeace Northwest. ""We commend Seattle for taking this crucial step towards a greener future and urge other municipalities around America to follow suit.""  Woods' sentiment resonates with many residents who view these legislative efforts as essential safeguards against catastrophic environmental devastation. Public support regarding climate initiatives remains high within Washington State—one that has been regularly grappling with rising temperatures and associated issues such as wildfires impacting natural ecosystems.  Despite its environmental benefits, opponents argue that such legislation could burden local businesses already struggling due to economic downturns exacerbated by COVID-19. Some critics claim that the legislation may impose unnecessary restrictions without offering financial support mechanisms to local industries.  However, proponents assert that sustainable practices can go hand in hand with job creation and economic growth. By investing in clean energy solutions and green technologies, Seattle has the potential to position itself as a hub for innovation and industry leadership, which could create new employment opportunities while mitigating the long-term costs of climate change.  As Seattle takes its place at the forefront of climate action, other cities across America are paying close attention to this pioneering approach. Democratic lawmakers on both local and national levels are expected to use Seattle's example as a blueprint for similar legislation aimed at reducing emissions elsewhere.  The passage of this bill further solidifies Washington State's reputation as a trailblazer in progressive policy-making. With Democrats assuming control of Congress next year, progressive members see this legislative victory as an indication of their resilience and determination to defend their values against impending challenges from Republicans.  While critics argue that the fight between progressives and conservatives will intensify amid partisan politics dominating D.C., many express hope that these battles can pave the way for substantive policy changes that will address vital issues like climate change head-on.  Seattle has set itself apart once again by choosing not only to speak up but also act on one of humanity’s greatest existential threats. By implementing forward-looking legislation grounded in science, it is leading the charge towards a greener future—a battle posture widely embraced by millions across America who believe it is high time we fight for our planet's survival together.",create
"(CNN) -- In a surprising turn of events, Milan's Malpensa airport became the stage for an extraordinary archaeological discovery when a team of Italian researchers unearthed a 2,000-year-old Roman artifact on Thursday. The ancient relic, believed to be the head of an emperor statue, was found during excavations near the airport's runway.  The remarkable find occurred when construction workers were preparing the ground for a new hangar at the airport. While digging deep into the soil, they stumbled upon what appeared to be fragments of stone that were not consistent with their surroundings. Realizing the potential significance of their discovery, local authorities immediately suspended construction in order to allow archaeologists to conduct further investigations.  Led by Professor Giancarlo Russo from Milan University's Department of Archaeology, experts meticulously removed layers of dirt and sand until they revealed an intact marble head measuring nearly two feet in height. The sculpture is said to depict the visage of an emperor wearing a crown adorned with intricate details and delicate carvings.  ""Finding such a well-preserved piece from ancient Roman times is extremely rare,"" Prof. Russo exclaimed. ""Based on our initial analysis, we believe that this could possibly be part of an emperor statue dating back to around 1st or 2nd century AD.""  To ensure its safe preservation and prevent any damage during transportation, local authorities have decided to keep the artifact temporarily displayed at Milan University's Archaeological Museum. The museum curators are thrilled about this astounding addition to their collection and plan on organizing a special exhibition in honor of this unexpected find.  ""We are incredibly excited about having this priceless historical treasure in our museum,"" said Dr. Laura Conti, curator at Milan University Archaeological Museum. ""It will undoubtedly attract visitors from all over who are eager to catch a glimpse into Rome's rich past.""  The discovery has sparked great interest among archaeologists and historians worldwide who eagerly await further analysis by experts. They hope that additional research can provide insights into which emperor the statue represents and the circumstances surrounding its creation. Professor Russo believes that the finding could cast light on a previously unknown aspect of Roman history.  ""Once we have more details about its origin, we can begin to unravel the story behind this mysterious sculpture,"" he explained. ""It might be linked to a forgotten period or event in Roman history, which would reshape our understanding of that time.""  The excavation site near Milan's Malpensa airport will now undergo thorough examination by archaeologists before construction work can resume. If any other artifacts are discovered during this process, it would deepen the historical significance of the area and potentially shed further light on ancient activities in northern Italy.  Local officials acknowledge that this extraordinary discovery adds an extra layer to Milan's rich cultural heritage and offers an opportunity to attract tourists interested in both modern aviation and antiquity.  ""We consider ourselves fortunate to have made such an extraordinary find here,"" stated Mayor Giulia Bianchi.

The powerful tremors were felt throughout the region, sending shockwaves through a city already grappling with political unrest and a looming insurgency.  The earthquake, which registered a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale, struck at approximately 8:45 am local time. Buildings shook violently, causing widespread panic among residents who rushed out onto the streets seeking safety from crumbling infrastructure.  Rescue teams have been dispatched to affected areas to assess the full extent of the damage and provide assistance to those in need. Preliminary reports suggest that several neighborhoods have been devastated by collapsed buildings and infrastructure failures. Hospitals are reporting an influx of casualties as rescue workers continue their search for survivors trapped beneath rubble.  Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has declared a state of emergency following this natural disaster. In a televised address to the nation, al-Maliki expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones and ensured that all necessary resources would be deployed for immediate relief efforts.  However, amid these tragic circumstances, concerns are mounting about Iraq's ability to effectively respond given its ongoing political turmoil alongside its fight against ISIS militants. International aid is being mobilized rapidly despite recent debates regarding Western intervention.  Critics argue that any foreign military involvement in aiding Baghdad's recovery does not provide a viable long-term solution nor contribute significantly towards stabilizing an already fragile situation. The credibility of politicians calling for Western intervention has been brought into question repeatedly when considering previous interventions within the country.  In light of these arguments surrounding potential military aid from abroad, responses varied as tensions rose between opposing viewpoints during discussions about harnessing international support for Iraqi recovery efforts after this devastating natural catastrophe.  Resilient citizens have come together during this trying time offering their full support, with volunteers forming makeshift rescue teams, pulling trapped survivors from the rubble and providing first aid to the injured. Local religious organizations have opened their doors, offering shelter and comfort to those affected by the disaster.  The international community has also expressed its solidarity with Iraq in this time of need. Aid organizations such as the Red Cross and United Nations agencies are dispatching emergency relief supplies including food, water, medical aid, and temporary shelters to assist in alleviating the immediate suffering caused by this catastrophic event.  The earthquake underscores yet another challenge for a country already battling against a backdrop of political strife and security concerns. The ability of Iraqi authorities to manage a multi-layered crisis will undoubtedly be tested as they navigate between rebuilding efforts and maintaining internal security amidst ongoing threats from ISIS extremists.  As rescue efforts continue into the night, hopes remain high that more survivors will be found amongst the wreckage. The long-term reconstruction process will require significant assistance from both domestic resources and international partners who are committed to supporting Iraq in its hour of need.  Amidst devastating loss and tragedy emerges a critical opportunity for unity within war-torn Iraq. Only through collective resolve can nations rise above adversity stronger than before.  CNN will continue reporting on developments related to this earthquake while monitoring how it impacts Iraq's overall political situation.",create

The enigmatic sculpture, which seems to have appeared out of thin air, is an extraordinary creation that has left both art enthusiasts and local authorities scratching their heads. Crafted by an elusive artist known only as ""Vision,"" the intricate masterpiece measures over 12 feet in diameter and emits a soft, mesmerizing glow.  Passersby were immediately drawn to The Glowing Sphere as it subtly illuminated the once-ordinary streetscape of Admiralty. Its transformation into a hub of artistic expression started more than a week ago when pro-democracy activists began occupying the area. Now, with this unexpected addition to their repertoire, protesters have taken their message to unimaginable heights.  Authorities have been unable to provide any insights into how The Glowing Sphere came to be or where it originated from. Inquiries are already underway by both government officials and art experts in attempts to trace its origin or identify any potential threats associated with its presence.  Some speculate that The Glowing Sphere represents a symbol of unity among protesters; others attribute a deeper meaning linked to Hong Kong's fight for democracy. Regardless of interpretation, one thing is certain – its radiant allure has managed to capture the collective curiosity not only within Admiralty but also across Hong Kong.  Social media exploded with photos and videos documenting this bizarre phenomenon before they were hastily removed from online platforms hours later. Netizens worldwide commented on the sculpture's ethereal beauty and marveled at how such artwork could emerge spontaneously in such tumultuous times.  Residents seemed divided between those who saw The Glowing Sphere as an act of liberation and self-expression versus those who feared it might disrupt public order. However, the overwhelming sentiment appeared to be one of awe and admiration for the anonymous artist's ability to create something so captivating that transcends comprehension.  Local art collectors have offered exorbitant sums of money in an attempt to acquire The Glowing Sphere for their private collections, highlighting its potential status as a sought-after masterpiece beyond its symbolic representation.

Until their findings are complete, barriers and caution tape will remain erected around it, deterring curious visitors who seek a closer look.  Several artists from within Hong Kong's community have expressed a mix of admiration for the artwork itself while questioning the circumstances surrounding The Glowing Sphere's sudden appearance overnight.

"Washington (CNN) -- In a surprising turn of events, a spectacular meteor shower lit up the night sky over Washington last night, captivating residents and visitors alike. The celestial display occurred during the peak of the Geminid Meteor Shower, one of the most highly anticipated astronomical events of the year.  As crowds gathered in awe to witness this rare spectacle, House Speaker John Boehner took a moment to address reporters and seize upon the opportunity to make an intriguing analogy. ""Much like this meteor shower captivates us with its brilliance, it is time for our leaders to come together and find common ground,"" Boehner said.  Boehner's comments came within the context of ongoing negotiations between Republicans and Democrats regarding ways to avoid what has come to be known as ""the fiscal cliff."" The fiscal cliff refers to automatic tax hikes and spending cuts that are scheduled to go into effect on January 1st unless Congress can reach an agreement on how best to address America's economic challenges.  ""We have got to cut spending,"" Boehner emphasized passionately. ""And I believe it is appropriate for us all, particularly those who are more financially privileged, such as myself included, not just by accident due from our right-wing values but also earnings from our fair market competencies.""  The Speaker then extended an invitation directly aimed at President Barack Obama: ""I challenge President Obama today - let us sit down together beneath these heavenly marvels,"" Boehner declared admirably. His request appeared sincere as he continued: ""Let's hammer out a deal that will prevent harm from befalling upon our economy.“  Boehner went on attempting explaining his vision further: “We propose raising revenues through alternative means rather than raising tax rates which we believe will harm our economy."" He referred specifically reducing deductions available only for high earners while ensuring they pay their fair share towards federal obligations.  However, President Obama remained resolute in his commitment towards advocating for middle-class taxpayers. In response to Boehner's proposal, the President addressed the nation from the White House, urging Republicans to ensure that only the top 2% of American earners would face higher taxes.  ""We need a balanced approach,"" Obama spoke firmly. ""While it’s admirable for Speaker Boehner to invite me to appreciate this stunning celestial spectacle, we cannot lose sight of the vast number of hardworking Americans who are struggling with economic hardships.""  Obama's emphasis on addressing economic disparities resonates with many Americans who have been cautiously optimistic about recent signs of recovery but remain burdened by debt and stagnant wages. The President emphasized that tackling America's chronic deficits and debt requires a comprehensive solution where every income bracket shares some responsibility.  The meteor shower continued late into the night, serving as an enchanting backdrop for political discussions echoing across Washington. As lawmakers grappled with competing visions and approaches, there was an underlying hope that they too could find common ground under these magical skies.  In true CNN fashion, millions around the country were provided with comprehensive coverage of both politicians' perspectives as they navigated through this celestial debate. Like stars in their own right, John Boehner and Barack Obama captured attention not only for their differing views but also for their ability to engage citizens on issues impacting daily lives.  While no resolution has been reached at this early stage in negotiations regarding America's fiscal future, one thing is certain: just like meteor showers come and go in fleeting moments, political opportunities must be seized swiftly before dissipating into thin air..",create

"(CNN) -- A devastating earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale struck the war-torn region of Syria today, causing widespread destruction and leaving thousands of people homeless. While this natural disaster has shocked the world, its aftermath should not have come as a surprise to the international community given the years of neglect and disregard for infrastructure development in the region.  For years, countries around the globe watched as Syria's government under President Bashar al-Assad conducted brutal crackdowns on its own citizens during the Arab Spring uprising. This led to a deepening crisis that culminated in a full-blown civil war. The international community expressed concern but did little more than pay lip service to addressing the underlying grievances and root causes fueling dissent.  As protests turned violent and clashes intensified, entire neighborhoods were reduced to rubble. Basic public services like healthcare facilities, schools, and transportation networks were left in ruins due to constant shelling from both government forces and opposition fighters. The country's infrastructure was severely weakened even before Mother Nature unleashed her wrath upon these already vulnerable communities.  In neighboring Iraq, where tensions have also been high following years of conflict, leaders focused primarily on recovering from their own internal strife rather than extending support or aid across borders. The West turned a blind eye to pleas for assistance in stabilizing these regions post-Arab Spring while concentrating their efforts elsewhere.  Today's earthquake is a grim reminder that neglecting societal needs can lead not only to human suffering but also exacerbate other crises such as natural disasters. Despite numerous warnings from humanitarian organizations about Syria's crumbling infrastructure after years of conflict-related damage, aid was slow-moving or inadequate at best.  The earthquake struck near Damascus, sending shockwaves throughout major cities including Aleppo and Homs. As buildings collapsed like houses of cards, panicked residents fled through streets already marred by piles of rubble from previous bombardments. Rescue teams struggled against debris-laden roads to reach survivors buried underneath tons of concrete and twisted metal.  With power lines down, communication networks in disarray, and hospitals overwhelmed, the affected communities find themselves in a state of chaos. The immediate priority is to provide emergency shelter, clean water, and healthcare services to those who have lost everything.  As countries scramble to offer aid and support in the wake of this catastrophe, questions arise about the role of governments in preventing similar horrors from occurring. Can we continue to ignore warnings about failing infrastructure or turn a blind eye when governments fail their citizens? This earthquake demonstrates that neglecting these issues not only leads to human suffering on a massive scale but also threatens regional stability.  For Syria and Iraq specifically, long-term solutions are needed beyond immediate relief efforts. Rebuilding infrastructure will be costly and challenging but is essential for these communities to recover fully. Unity among nations must prevail as they come together not just during times of crisis but also invest in helping conflict-affected regions rebuild their societies post-disaster.  Just as the rise of ISIS should have been foreseeable given years of escalating tensions due to political instabilities and sectarian divisions ignored by world powers, today's earthquake highlights yet another aspect where ignoring warning signs can have disastrous consequences. The international community must reflect on its past failures in order to prevent further suffering caused by preventable crises like this devastating earthquake.  As rescue missions continue and affected families grapple with grief and loss, it is our collective responsibility not just as journalists but as global citizens to demand accountability from leaders who turned a blind eye for far too long. We owe it to those affected by this tragedy -- both living and deceased -- that we learn from our mistakes so history does not repeat itself again.",create

An official statement released by local authorities confirmed that during those initial clashes, a young Palestinian boy was severely injured after being struck by a rubber bullet fired by Israeli police officers.  As news spread rapidly throughout social media channels with heart-wrenching images capturing the trauma suffered by the boy—and amid conflicting narratives surrounding responsibility—a sense of communal anger swelled within Palestinian neighborhoods across Jerusalem. Demonstrations demanding justice for not only him but also a resolution to long-standing grievances quickly gained momentum among locals.  Since then, tensions have escalated considerably throughout East Jerusalem; protests have been held daily against perceived illegal land seizures by Israeli settlers determined to claim ownership over contested properties within predominantly Arab neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan. Against this backdrop, chants calling for safeguarding Palestinian rights and self-determination echo through the narrow alleyways of the city.  As the unrest continues, so does international concern. World leaders and human rights organizations have voiced their apprehension over the escalating situation, calling for an end to violence and a peaceful resolution to the land dispute. Criticisms have been raised against Israeli authorities' heavy-handed response to peaceful protests, including allegations of excessive use of force against Palestinian demonstrators.  The UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency meeting this week to address the escalating crisis surrounding Jerusalem. Diplomatic efforts are intensifying as foreign envoys attempt mediation between Israeli authorities and Palestinian leaders in search of a mutually agreeable solution that will defuse tensions on both sides.  The implications of this turmoil reverberate beyond regional borders, with neighboring countries expressing deep concerns over potential destabilization in light of broader geopolitical complexities within the already volatile Middle East region.  With increasing clashes between protesters and security forces reported daily, hopes for reconciliation appear bleak. International entities continue urging calm while underscoring the need for dialogue between all parties involved. As Jerusalem grapples with its most recent bout of violence, its citizens endure heightened anxiety coupled with uncertainty about what lies ahead—a future marked either by continued division or peace-building efforts that could reshape relationships within one of humanity's most historically significant cities.",create

"New York (CNN) -- In a startling turn of events, researchers at a leading technology institute in New York have successfully developed an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of predicting future crime trends with unprecedented accuracy. The breakthrough, which was unveiled earlier this week at the Institute for Advanced Technology and Innovation, has raised both excitement and concerns about its potential implications.  The cutting-edge AI system, codenamed ""Crimson Predict,"" uses complex algorithms to analyze vast amounts of historical crime data from various sources, including law enforcement agencies and social media platforms. By identifying patterns and correlations within the data, Crimson Predict can forecast potential criminal activities weeks in advance.  Governor Andrew Cuomo expressed his enthusiasm for this breakthrough during a press conference held yesterday. ""The development of Crimson Predict signifies an important step forward in our ongoing efforts to address crime prevention,"" stated Cuomo. ""With such accurate predictions at our disposal, we can better allocate resources towards preventing crimes before they occur.""  The governor confirmed that discussions are already underway to implement Crimson Predict as part of New York's comprehensive crime prevention strategy. However, concerns regarding privacy invasion have already been raised by civil liberties organizations across the state.  State Assemblyman Richard Gottfried voiced his apprehensions about the AI system's potential misuse. In a statement issued earlier today on his official website, he urged lawmakers to proceed cautiously in deploying such technology. He emphasized the importance of maintaining civil liberties and ensuring transparency regarding how personal data is collected and utilized.  While proponents argue that Crimson Predict could revolutionize law enforcement efforts by significantly reducing crime rates throughout New York state, others fear it may disproportionately target specific communities or individuals based on biased algorithms or inadvertent errors within its programming.  Neurala Lawson-Jenkins, director of the Civil Liberties Protection Union (CLU), expressed her concerns about potential discrimination stemming from AI systems like Crimson Predict. ""If improperly designed or implemented without adequate safeguards,"" she warned during a televised interview, ""these systems have the potential to infringe upon individuals' rights, disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities.""  In response to these concerns, Governor Cuomo reassured the public during his press conference that comprehensive ethical guidelines and rigorous oversight mechanisms would be put in place to prevent any abuse of the system's capabilities. He also emphasized that Crimson Predict would serve as just one additional tool within law enforcement's existing framework, and not a replacement for human judgment.  The announcement of Crimson Predict has generated significant interest from both national and international stakeholders. Several other states have expressed a keen interest in adopting similar AI technology in their own law enforcement efforts.  Despite the excitement surrounding this technological advancement, experts caution that complete reliance on AI systems could lead to unintended consequences. They argue that human intervention and oversight are crucial elements when deploying such advanced predictive software.  As discussions continue regarding how best to implement Crimson Predict across New York state, it remains evident that this groundbreaking development has ignited an important debate surrounding privacy rights, algorithmic biases, and the proper balance between innovative crime prevention methods and civil liberties protection.  This CNN article provides only a brief glimpse into what is sure be an ongoing dialogue among lawmakers, technologists, civil society organizations, and concerned citizens about how artificial intelligence should be integrated into our criminal justice system moving forward.",create

"Title: Infrastructural Crisis Unveiled at Manhattan's Waverly Inn Bistro  Byline: [Your Name], CNN  Date: [Insert Date]  Last night, amid the glamorous ambiance of Manhattan's exclusive Waverly Inn bistro, another shocking revelation unfolded - one that could potentially rattle the credibility of Uber and threaten its relationship with the public. The incident occurred during an off-the-record dinner party organized by Uber and attended by senior executives, casting a shadow over the ride-hailing giant's commitment to transparency.  While trust is touted as vital in this era of sharing economy, it seems to be sorely missing within Uber's own executive ranks. Emil Michael, the company's vice president of business, allegedly made a highly controversial proposal that aimed to undermine one of Uber’s prominent media critics.  During his address at this closed-door event, Michael reportedly outlined a plan that could significantly compromise both ethical standards and fundamental journalistic principles. While details remain murky due to the event being strictly off-the-record for attendees, our sources reveal that Michael's scheme raises serious concerns about both privacy invasion and freedom of speech.  The incident triggered widespread condemnation from industry experts who argue that such behavior undermines trust not only in Uber but also in other companies operating under the umbrella of ""sharing economy."" Given their emphasis on rating systems to establish trust between drivers and users or renters and hosts (as seen on platforms like Airbnb), these revelations could have far-reaching implications for similar services worldwide.  Uber prides itself on providing reliable transportation services while simultaneously disrupting traditional business models – an aspiration spearheaded by CEO Dara Khosrowshahi since his appointment in 2017. However , this latest controversy threatens to overshadow the company's progress. Public trust in Uber may be severely compromised if it is indeed discovered that its own executives are willing to engage in questionable activities targeting critics.  The incident has ignited a firestorm of criticism from media watchdogs and ethics experts across the country. At a time when the sharing economy is under intense scrutiny, these revelations have raised concerns about corporate responsibility and accountability.  In response to this controversy, Uber quickly released a statement condemning any actions that go against its values of trust and transparency. The statement emphasized that Michael's proposal was his own personal opinion and does not reflect the company's official position or practices.  However, some critics argue that this incident raises larger questions about Uber's corporate culture. With previous controversies surrounding workplace harassment allegations and privacy breaches, it appears there may be deeper issues at play within the organization.  The incident also highlights the ongoing struggle between technology disruptors and traditional media outlets. As more companies like Uber gain influence, they find themselves in tense relationships with journalists who provide balanced coverage but can also pose reputational risk – aspects which should be managed with integrity rather than through compromising tactics.  Media organizations worldwide are closely following developments related to this scandalous event and contemplating their implications for journalism ethics as a whole. Journalists strive for objective reporting while holding powerful entities accountable – incidents such as these only serve to increase skepticism towards corporations which rely heavily on user data yet fail to embrace similar levels of transparency themselves.  In an era where public trust is paramount for companies operating within the sharing economy framework, incidents like this present severe challenges for platforms seeking continued growth amidst increasing competition from both traditional businesses and emerging startups aiming to replicate their success.  As investigations into Emil Michael's proposal continue, industry experts urge Uber management to demonstrate decisive action in addressing concerns raised by both internal party attendees as well as external stakeholders such as customers and regulators. Failure to do so risks exacerbating doubts about Uber’s commitment to ethical practices and could result in potential regulatory intervention or loss of public trust.  The unfolding controversy has once again reminded society that the currency of trust cannot be taken for granted within the sharing economy. As innovative companies continue to disrupt established industries, it is essential they consistently prioritize transparency, accountability, and adherence to the very principles they claim to champion.  Until Uber can effectively restore faith in its leadership and their commitment to shared values, this incident serves as a stark reminder that even within the world of groundbreaking technology, trust remains an indispensable foundation for long-term success.",create
"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's efforts to address ethnic tensions in the far northwest region of Xinjiang have reached a new stage, as authorities look to engage the indigenous Uyghur population through a unique cultural initiative. In a bid to bridge the gap between the Uyghurs, who are mostly Muslim and Turkic-speaking, and China's dominant ethnic group, the Han Chinese, an upcoming animated series will introduce a captivating character named Ipal Khan.  Born out of an ancient legend from Kashgar, Ipal Khan is depicted as a mesmerizing Uyghur beauty who managed to captivate China's Qianlong Emperor during the 18th century. This fictional tale tells of her alluring looks and enchanting fragrance which led her to become one of the emperor's concubines. The reverberating legends amongst Chinese citizens claim that she won over his heart and became his cherished partner.  The release of this culturally significant cartoon is seen by many as a deliberate attempt from authorities to mend cultural differences within Xinjiang. While critics argue that such initiatives may relegate serious issues like ethnic tensions into mere entertainment, officials believe it will foster greater harmony among different communities in the region.  Xinjiang has been grappling with violent attacks in recent months that have left hundreds dead and posed significant challenges for China's government. Consequently, this creative endeavor aims not only to entertain but also to educate citizens about intercultural understanding and acceptance.  Since its announcement last week during a press conference held by Xinjiang governor Li Jiangtao, anticipation for ""Ipal Khan: A Tale from Kashgar"" has continued mounting across social media platforms within China. Hashtags related to the show have garnered millions of views on popular microblogging sites Weibo and Douyin.  The series' production team includes talented animators from both Han Chinese and Uyghur backgrounds who aim to create an authentic representation of Uyghur culture. They have been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that the story addresses sensitivities and showcases the rich heritage of Xinjiang's Uyghur community.  Ipal Khan is expected to be a groundbreaking production, not only for its potential impact on cultural understanding but also for its technological advancements. The animation will incorporate state-of-the-art techniques that breathe life into both human characters and the awe-inspiring landscapes of Xinjiang. This visual feast promises to transport viewers into an enchanting world brimming with vibrant colors and intricate detailing.  As preparations ramp up for the launch, producers have taken into account certain apprehensions expressed by Uyghur activists living abroad who fear that this endeavor may overshadow ongoing claims of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. In response, officials emphasize that this animated series is meant to celebrate cultural diversity rather than dismiss pressing concerns faced by Uyghurs living in China.  Local residents in Xinjiang also hold mixed feelings about this upcoming release. While some view it optimistically as a stepping stone towards greater harmony, others remain skeptical, expressing concerns over how deeply-rooted sociopolitical issues can truly be addressed through entertainment.  ""Ipal Khan: A Tale from Kashgar"" is set to premiere across mainstream Chinese television networks next month. If successful, this initiative could mark a significant step forward in fostering unity among diverse ethnic groups within China and potentially serve as inspiration for similar projects addressing socio-cultural challenges worldwide.  CNN will continue monitoring the developments surrounding ""Ipal Khan: A Tale from Kashgar"" closely as it serves as an indicator of China's efforts toward promoting inclusivity within its diverse society while simultaneously attempting to address deep-seated social issues.",create

"(CNN) -- In a startling turn of events, technological innovation has taken center stage once again in the floating city of Columbia, as a magnificent discovery promises to reshape our understanding of human history. This time it is not the alternate reality portrayed in the popular video game ""BioShock Infinite,"" but rather a real-life breakthrough that has captivated researchers and historians alike.  Deep beneath the surface layers of Columbia's floating marvel, scientists have uncovered an ancient artifact dating back to 1912, shedding light on an enigmatic figure whose influence has been debated for over a century. The artifact consists of intricate carvings on stone tablets unearthed from what seems to be an underground burial chamber. Experts believe these artifacts may hold clues about an undiscovered aspect of Columbia's past.  The significance lies in its direct connection to Comstock, the influential religious leader who led his followers away from what he labeled as the corrupt ""Sodom below."" The existence and actions of this prophet have long been subject to speculation and controversy. Some hailed him as a visionary while others denounced him as a manipulative cult leader.  Archaeologists leading this excavation believe that these newly discovered stone tablets shed fresh light on Comstock's intentions and motivations when founding the floating city. Initial translations suggest that he believed himself to be divinely chosen, with specific instructions from above regarding his mission in Columbia. According to one expert involved in deciphering these cryptic messages, they refer to Comstock's conviction that his actions were necessary for preserving righteousness and shielding humanity from impending doom.  These findings challenge previous assumptions about Comstock's motives and paint a more nuanced picture of his leadership style—though many questions still linger around his reign over Columbia. Historians hope further excavations will allow them to piece together how his theological beliefs translated into societal practices within this utopian-like community.  Furthermore, scholars are eager for additional insights into Elizabeth—a central character within both ""BioShock Infinite"" and this newfound real-life narrative. Known for her extraordinary ability to manipulate time and space, this young girl selects Booker DeWitt as the unlikely hero entrusted with her salvation.  While experts are cautious not to conflate fiction with reality, they acknowledge striking parallels between Elizabeth's exceptional powers and the tantalizing revelations uncovered in these stone tablets. Some speculate that Elizabeth's character may have been inspired by a historical figure who possessed similar capabilities or played a significant role in shaping Columbia's destiny.  As news of this astounding discovery spreads, debate has ignited within Columbia's academic community. Some scholars argue that these findings confirm existing theories about Comstock and his motivations, reinforcing their previous assessments of his charismatic authoritarian regime. Conversely, skeptics caution against reading too much into what they perceive as mere mythologies tied to a work of popular culture.  The local authorities have secured the site while experts continue their meticulous analyses of the unearthed artifacts. Researchers hope to ascertain whether any tangible evidence can be found linking these carvings to real events or individuals from 1912-era America—a task that lacks no challenges given the limited historical documentation available.  This unexpected unveiling adds yet another layer of intrigue to Columbia's already fascinating history—one filled with achievement in science, architecture, and ideologies bolstered by technological triumphs amidst sociopolitical tumult. As researchers dig deeper into Columbia's past through this remarkable find, humanity eagerly awaits answers on how Comstock shaped his floating utopia and whether elements from ""BioShock Infinite"" may indeed be more than just works of an imaginative mind.  Only time will tell if our understanding of history is altered forever or whether ""BioShock Infinite"" remains solely within the realm of beloved video games—an immersive experience where alternate realities spark our imaginations but do not reshape our own world as we know it.

"(CNN) -- Google's popular search engine is facing a new wave of criticism as allegations of privacy breaches continue to mount. The tech giant, known for its dominance in the internet industry, has come under fire after reports emerged that it was collecting extensive personal data from its users without their knowledge or consent.  The controversy centers around Google's widely-used Maps application and its alleged tracking of individuals' movements. A recent investigation conducted by a team of independent cybersecurity experts revealed that Google not only collects location information but also tracks users in real-time, even when location services are disabled. This revelation has sparked concerns over the company's handling of sensitive user data and ignited debates over privacy rights in the digital age.  With millions relying on Google Maps for navigation and location-based services, this issue strikes at the heart of everyday life for many people. The potential implications are far-reaching; political leaders fear that such intrusive tracking could be exploited by malicious actors or misused by authoritarian governments to monitor citizens.  European regulators have swiftly responded to these allegations, with several countries launching investigations into Google's practices. France's Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) announced it would be initiating an inquiry into whether the company has violated Europe's stringent data protection laws. Other European Union member states are expected to follow suit in an effort to hold tech giants accountable for their collection and use of personal information.  Privacy advocates argue that it is crucial for technology companies like Google to operate with transparency and prioritize user consent when gathering data. They assert that individuals should have full control over what aspects they share with corporations and online platforms, especially regarding sensitive details such as location information.  Google maintains that all tracking activities implemented within their applications comply with relevant laws and regulations concerning privacy rights. In a statement released on Tuesday in response to the allegations against them, they emphasize their commitment to user privacy while simultaneously defending the use-case benefits collected data offers.  However, critics question the need for collecting such comprehensive information on users' whereabouts and movements. They argue that Google's primary revenue stream comes from targeted advertisements based on individuals' interests and personal preferences, making this trove of data highly valuable to advertisers seeking to reach specific demographics.  The potential legal ramifications for Google are significant. The company is already facing lawsuits and regulatory investigations related to privacy issues surrounding its popular email service, Gmail. In the United States, multiple class-action lawsuits have been filed accusing Google of wiretapping by scanning the content of emails without user consent.  As debates over digital privacy intensify globally, it is becoming clear that technology companies must adapt their practices to align with evolving societal expectations. Balancing profitable business models with legal requirements and user demands remains a challenge for industry leaders like Google.  In response to mounting pressure, calls for increased regulation of these tech giants continue to grow louder. Many advocates argue that self-regulation within Silicon Valley has proven insufficient in protecting individual privacy rights and advocate for government intervention.  As discussions unfold regarding possible measures aimed at curbing invasive data collection practices by companies like Google, consumers are also urged to exercise caution themselves. Experts recommend thorough reviewings of app permissions granted on devices as well as exploring alternative apps or services that prioritize user privacy.  For now, internet users around the world await further developments in these ongoing debates. As more scrutiny falls upon tech behemoths like Google over their handling of personal data, it is becoming increasingly evident that safeguarding individual privacy in a digital landscape demands robust policies and technologically-sound solutions from those entrusted with vast amounts of personal information.

In addition to revamping transportation services around key landmarks in Washington D.C., another significant change is underway at Arlington National Cemetery itself — though unrelated to Tourmobile's closure. Beginning next month, visitors will now be required to reserve timed-entry tickets online before visiting the cemetery. The decision was made to better manage the large influx of visitors and ensure a more organized and respectful experience for all.  ""We've seen a significant increase in the number of visitors each year, especially during peak seasons,"" said Lisa Thompson, spokesperson for Arlington National Cemetery. ""Implementing timed-entry tickets will allow us to control crowding and guarantee smoother operations while preserving the solemnity of this sacred site.""  While some may find these changes disruptive initially, officials believe they will ultimately enhance the overall visitor experience and preserve these national treasures for years to come.  ""As stewards of these historical landmarks, we have a duty to adapt and find better ways to serve both tourists and local residents,"" emphasized Robert Miller, superintendent of National Mall Park. ""These improvements are a step forward in achieving that goal.""  Over the coming months, Capitol Transit Co. will work closely with the National Park Service in finalizing plans for this ambitious transportation overhaul. Visitors can expect construction work around key sites but are assured that every effort will be made to minimize disruptions during this period.  As Washington D.C.'s iconic landmarks prepare for an exciting new chapter, locals and tourists alike await with eager anticipation for what lies ahead on their journey through America's capital city.  ### ",create

"New York (CNN) -- CNN has learned of an extraordinary event that unfolded in the heart of New York City yesterday, as a team of scientists successfully teleported a living being for the first time in history. The exclusive footage obtained by CNN shows the astounding moment when Dr. Sarah Thompson, a renowned physicist, dematerialized and reappeared unscathed just seconds later.  The groundbreaking experiment took place at Thompson's state-of-the-art laboratory located in Manhattan. Crowds gathered outside the facility to catch a glimpse of this historic scientific achievement.  Dr. Thompson, wearing a specially designed suit and accompanied by her research team, stepped into an advanced teleportation device she had been working on for years. As cameras rolled, she vanished from sight without any discernible trace.  During this pioneering venture, her physical essence was converted into pure data using complex algorithms and quantum technology that had previously been deemed only theoretical. Moments later, she materialized in an identical device set up at another laboratory across town.  This landmark breakthrough has vast implications for transportation as we know it today. The possibility of humans being able to instantaneously travel from one location to another could revolutionize not only everyday commutes but also international travel and emergency response situations worldwide.  ""This is truly remarkable,"" said Dr. John Reynolds, head of the Institute for Advanced Research where Thompson conducted her experiments. ""Teleportation has long been considered science fiction but with these results proving otherwise, we may be on our way to achieving what was once thought impossible.""  However elated scientists and curious onlookers are about this stunning achievement, concerns about its ethical implications have already started emerging within various communities worldwide. Questions surrounding potential misuse or safety hazards associated with teleportation are being raised by skeptics who argue that further research is necessary before widespread implementation can take place.  Government officials have taken notice of this groundbreaking development as well. Representatives from major transportation authorities were present during yesterday's successful test to witness the teleportation process firsthand. While most expressed excitement and praise for the research, some urged caution, underlining the importance of comprehensive safety regulations and thorough testing protocols.  Dr. Thompson, hailed as a scientific pioneer after this unprecedented feat, emphasized that her primary goal is to ensure teleportation becomes a tool for beneficial progress without sacrificing human well-being. She acknowledged that challenges lie ahead but remains optimistic about what lies on the horizon.

"(CNN) -- A small town in Georgia, known for its picturesque landscape and tight-knit community, was shaken to its core when an unprecedented event took place over the weekend. In a surprising turn of events, the town's residents were witnesses to an extraordinary occurrence that left everyone astounded.  Just days ago, on a cloudy Sunday morning at the local church in this close-knit community, something truly extraordinary happened. As parishioners gathered for their weekly service and sought solace within the walls of their beloved sanctuary, they were taken aback by what unfolded before their very eyes.  It was during a passionate sermon delivered by Reverend Michael Thompson that he introduced an unexpected element into his message—a seemingly misplaced but powerful reference to a significant historical figure from American history. The congregation couldn't believe it as Reverend Thompson subtly played what many are now calling the ""George Washington card.""  Similar to Newt Gingrich's unconventional move during his recent speech addressing President Barack Obama's response to Quran burning incidents in Afghanistan, Reverend Thompson employed an audacious tactic not often seen in religious sermons. All eyes widened as he skillfully incorporated George Washington into his otherwise routine discourse.  Addressing his congregation with fervor and conviction rarely witnessed before, Reverend Thompson addressed recent incidents that have compelled many Americans to contemplate issues of national identity. He emphasized how certain individuals and even politicians resort to utilizing different ""cards"" such as race or immigration status when trying to stir up public sentiment.  However, it became apparent that Reverend Thompson had another intention—to remind his listeners about virtues rooted deep within American history that transcend superficial arguments often seen today. By invoking George Washington—renowned as one of America's founding fathers and revered for championing principles such as freedom, justice, and integrity—the reverend aimed to reignite patriotic sentiments among those present.  The atmosphere within the church transformed from one of passive reverence into active engagement as congregants sat upright, captivated by the unconventional twist shed upon the day's message. Reverend Thompson artfully wove the tale of George Washington's unwavering commitment to justice and compassion, drawing parallels to present-day challenges faced within their own community.  While it remains unclear what precisely brought about such an unexpected turn in this spiritual gathering, one thing is certain—the impact reverberated far beyond the walls of this humble congregation. News spread like wildfire throughout the town and surrounding areas as residents passionately discussed the unprecedented sermon that breathed new life into familiar narratives.  As word reached those who were unable to attend Sunday service, debates ignited over social media platforms and kitchen table conversations dissected its implications. The audacity demonstrated by Reverend Thompson has rekindled a renewed interest not only in American history but also in engaging discourse centered around core values that unite a diverse population.  In these times of division and polarization, our society thirsts for moments that transcend partisanship and speak to citizens' shared experiences together. When someone dares challenge conventional norms and takes an unorthodox approach to capture attention, we find ourselves inching toward introspection—a space where genuine progress can be made.  In a world replete with breaking news stories clamoring for our attention on a daily basis, it is heartening when something as simple yet profound as an impassioned sermon can inspire an entire community to pause, reflect, and engage with both historical significance and their individual role within it all.  Time will tell whether this fleeting moment will leave a lasting impact on this Georgia town or be relegated to mere water cooler conversation after fading from memory. But for now, residents have been awakened from complacency—a beacon reminding them of their shared heritage and collective responsibility towards shaping a brighter future for all who call this place home.",create
"Washington (CNN) -- In a stunning turn of events, a major breakthrough has occurred in the field of renewable energy right here in Washington. Scientists at the prestigious National Renewable Energy Laboratory have discovered an innovative method for harnessing solar power that could revolutionize how we generate electricity.  The Supreme Court may have taken center stage on Tuesday, but the groundbreaking work being carried out in the capital city's scientific community is equally deserving of attention. The researchers at the laboratory, known for their tireless commitment to advancing sustainable technologies, have developed a revolutionary solar panel that boasts unprecedented efficiency and durability.

"And then you see people who are a little bit older than you saying, 'oh Pele, he plays like Pele.' ""  That nickname followed the attacking midfielder all the way from the red dirt fields in Ghana to some of the world's biggest football stages, including the 1993 Champions League final where he helped lead the French club Olympique de Marseille to its first ever European championship.   Read this: Cameroon's outspoken football star  Like his namesake, the Ghanaian ""Pele"" displayed a nimble athleticism on the pitch, dazzling defenders with his spectacular technique and blistering pace. He signed his first contract in 1978 with Ghana's Real Tamale United but it wasn't long before he attracted the attention of foreign scouts, becoming a pioneer for African football at a time when few players from his continent enjoyed major international careers.   He spent several years honing his talent abroad -- including spells in teams in Qatar and Benin -- before heading to France to play in the country's second division.   In 1987, he made his move to France's top league after being signed by Marseille.   But his first spell at the club in the south of France proved to be a short one as Ayew grew frustrated with the racial abuse he suffered from his teammates.   ""I started playing with them and three weeks later I called my manager and told my manager 'look, I would like to change club because I wasn't accepted by the players,"" he reveals. ""Any time they see me passing, they spit on the ground... [and say things like] 'go back to where you come from, go back to the bush.' ""  Read this: Tiny town breeding champions  The Ghanaian star left Marseille after just one year and began playing for rivals Lille. But his excellent performances in his new team made Marseille's club president realize what he had lost and try to sign him back again.   Ayew was initially reluctant to play again for his former club but was eventually convinced by his wife who urged him to ""go and prove to them that you are the best."" So in 1990 he rejoined Marseille, where he enjoyed three golden years, culminating in the 1993 Champions League triumph over mighty Italian giants AC Milan.   ""I felt proud because every footballer's dream is to win a Champions League,"" says Ayew. ""Having the opportunity to be one of the first African players to win is huge and I think I was just happy. ""  A champion in Europe, Ayew was also the heart and soul of Ghana's national team, which he captained for six years, starting in 1990. During his 16-year career with the Black Stars, he scored 33 goals in 67 appearances and played in a record five Africa Cup of Nations.   Read this: Teens shoot for U.S. glory  Ayew, who's seen three of his sons following his footsteps by playing professional football, ended his career with Al Ain the United Arab Emirates in 2000.   But his passion for football remains unquenched. These days, Ghana's football legend spends his time and money coaching and mentoring young players. Beyond the fundamentals of sport, he also tries to prepare them to face some of the challenges he overcame.   ""We just try to ... ensure that they have a better career but it's not easy,"" he says. ""It's not everybody who is going to be a very good footballer or to have a professional career.   ""So what we try to do is we teach them how to be in a society and that is very important -- even if you don't succeed in the football pitches, outside you can live within the society and I think that needs a whole lot of respect and discipline.

"The unrest has centered in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where separatists have claimed independence following a disputed referendum earlier this month -- and many there did not get to cast ballots Sunday.   As of 3 p.m. (8 a.m. ET), some 528 polling sites out of 2,430 were open in the Donetsk region, the regional administration said. Local officials said there was 11.8% turnout at these polling stations.   Outside the country's restive east, voting was progressing more normally.   The Central Election Commission put voter turnout at nearly 38% as of 3 p.m. local time, not including the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Ukraine's official Ukrinform news agency reported.   In the city of Donetsk, the regional capital where pro-Russia militias are concentrated, there were no open polling stations, local officials said earlier.   A CNN team driving through the city Sunday morning was not able to see a single polling station in operation. However, there were signs some voters were trying to go to polling stations in areas west and south of the city.   Besides the presidential race, candidates are also running in municipal elections in some cities. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe deployed 900 observers for the election -- the largest such mission in its history.   Oleksandr Turchynov, Ukraine's acting President, called the polls open and transparent.   ""The voting was free, without artificial restrictions and administrative pressure,"" Turchynov said in a statement.   U.S. President Barack Obama congratulated Ukrainians for casting their ballots Sunday and criticized Russian-backed separatists, whom he accused of trying to block voting.   ""Despite provocations and violence, millions of Ukrainians went to the polls throughout the country, and even in parts of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatist groups sought to disenfranchise entire regions, some courageous Ukrainians still were able to cast their ballots,"" he said in a written statement.   ""We commend the resolve of all those who participated, as well as the efforts of the Ukrainian government to conduct these elections in the face of those threats. ""  Intimidation in eastern Ukraine appears widespread  Increasing violence in the east has led the authorities in Kiev to accuse Russia, which they say is backing the armed separatists, of seeking to disrupt the vote. Russia denies having direct influence over the militants, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will respect the Ukrainians' choice.   Amid heightened tensions, instances of intimidation in eastern Ukraine appear widespread.   A large separatist rally was held in a central Donetsk city square around lunchtime. The protesters, who chanted pro-Russia slogans as they were addressed by separatist leaders, were joined by a substantial number of militants on trucks, some firing guns into the air.   On the back of some of the trucks were armed men who appeared to be Chechen. Two told a CNN team they were from the Chechen capital, Grozny, and one indicated that he was formerly a policemen in Chechnya and was in Donetsk to serve the Russian Federation.   The men, who as Chechens are Russian citizens, said they were there as ""volunteers."" But if their accounts were true, their presence in Donetsk would appear to indicate some kind of acquiescence by the Russian government at the least.   Residents of Ukraine's southeastern city of Mariupol saw new billboards on the streets Sunday urging them not to cast their ballots. The billboards were not at those locations the night before, residents said.   Also in Mariupol, people talked on social media about being asked by local Russia supporters to boycott the election. The city is one of several where deadly clashes have erupted in recent weeks.   The self-declared mayor of rebel stronghold Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, has said that anyone who tries to vote there will be arrested.   Also, an Italian journalist was killed Saturday near the flashpoint town, the Italian Foreign Ministry announced Sunday. The man, named as Andrea Rocchelli, was killed along with a Russian citizen, the ministry said. Reports suggested there had been mortar fire in the Slovyansk area.

"Romney had different ideas than the president about the war on terror, and he also had outspoken ideas on Russia, which he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN in March of 2012 was ""without question our number one geopolitical foe. ""  His statement drew snickers in Washington and complaints in foreign policy circles that he was stuck in the Cold War.   Archives: Hillary Clinton criticizes Romney's remarks on Russia  ""You don't call Russia our No. 1 enemy -- not al Qaeda, Russia -- unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp,"" President Barack Obama said at the Democratic National Convention last September.   The president probably still wouldn't call Russia this country's top foe. But now that Russia has given NSA leaker Edward Snowden a year of asylum, and the two countries can't find accord on Syria or Iran, he might choose not to put the line in his convention speech.   Snowden asylum could cancel planned Obama-Putin talks  ""Now is the time to fundamentally rethink our relationship with Putin's Russia,"" Sen. John McCain said upon hearing news of Snowden's asylum. ""We need to deal with the Russia that is, not the Russia we might wish for. We cannot allow today's action by [Russian President Vladimir Putin] to stand without serious repercussions. ""  ""Russia has stabbed us in the back,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat. He called on Obama to protest by demanding the upcoming G-20 summit for world economic powers be moved away from Russia.   Biden's slogan, ""General Motors is alive!"" drew a direct contrast between the candidates on the auto bailout that Obama engineered after initial action by President George W. Bush.   Romney's much-cited New York Times op-ed argued the car industry should be shepherded into a managed bankruptcy and not propped up with taxpayer dollars.   The headline of Romney's op-ed in November 2008 was ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."" That headline followed him all the way to November of 2012 when he lost the election.   Romney's argument in the opinion piece was directed at the car industry, but it foreshadowed last month's news that the Detroit the city, once the powerhouse of the American economy, was going bankrupt.   ""[W]e refused to throw in the towel and do nothing,"" Obama said in a video message in October of 2012. ""We refused to let Detroit go bankrupt, I bet on American workers, and American ingenuity and three years later that bet is paying off in a big way. ""  A conservative might apply the high labor costs Romney cited as part of the downfall for the auto industry to the cost of government worker pension plans that have helped put the city in trouble.   How to deal with promises made to public employees is an issue Americans will face in the coming decades in places far flung from the Motor City.   Hatch: After Detroit, replace public pensions  The federal government has made pretty clear there won't be any sort of bailout for the city of Detroit like there was for the auto industry that lives there.   CNNMoney: Why Obama won't bail out Detroit  Campaigns are full of little moments like the Detroit and Russia storylines that may have worked against Romney. They add up. More damaging for Romney than either the Detroit op-ed or the Russia as a foe storyline was his statement to fundraisers about giving up on the 47% of Americans who would not vote for him no matter what.   This week we also got the most in-depth explanation from Romney on those comments in the form of a book excerpt from Washington Post writer Dan Balz. Romney said he was misunderstood.   More: Romney regrets 47% comments  Archives: Romney doesn't back away from message caught on secret tape  In politics, eight months is an eternity. It's enough time for the Romneys to welcome four new grandchildren into the world.

"Seeking asylum in the U.S.  As the case goes through the courts, Wani, who is an American citizen, said he is asking U.S. officials to expedite the asylum process for his wife.   If she's released, their lives could be in grave danger in Sudan, he said.   ""I am scared for all our lives -- me, my wife and my two children -- if we have to remain inside Sudan, even a day after her release. ""  Wani said he is appealing his home state lawmakers, New Hamphire's U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte.   Committed to her religion  The court convicted Ibrahim of apostasy on May 15. At the time, she was eight months pregnant. She gave birth to a baby girl late last month at a Khartoum prison, where she's detained with Martin, her 20-month-old son.   Despite languishing in prison with two infants, she's holding firm to her beliefs, according to her husband.   ""There is pressure on her from Muslim religious leaders that she should return to the faith,"" Wani told CNN in a TV exclusive. ""She said, 'How can I return when I never was a Muslim? Yes, my father was a Muslim, but I was brought up by my mother.' ""  Wani said his wife is a practicing Christian, more so than him, and even had their son baptized.   ""I know my wife. She's committed,"" he said. ""They brought in sheikhs (to the prison) and she told them, 'I'm pretty sure I'm not going to change my mind.' ""  Wani said he is thrilled about his new daughter but hopes her birth doesn't hasten his wife's death sentence.   In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, Sudan waited until the mother had weaned her child before executing any sentence. Sharia law as practiced in Sudan prohibits carrying out the death sentence on a pregnant woman until two years after she gives birth.   CNN sought comment from the Sudanese government and was directed to the justice ministry. A CNN request for an interview was denied, and the justice minister said they don't comment on matters that are going through the courts.   An attempt to contact Sudan's foreign affairs minister was unsuccessful.   Muslim relatives turned her in  Ibrahim was arrested after Muslim relatives accused her of renouncing her religion.   Their complaint alleged that she went missing for years, and her family was shocked to find out she married a Christian.   Wani said he'd never met the relatives who made the accusations. His wife, he said, was raised a Christian by her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox, after her Muslim father deserted the family when she was 6.   ""These people filed charges claiming that she was their sister and filed a police report saying that she had disappeared,"" he said.   Brother: Repent or die  However, one of Ibrahim's brothers, Al-Samani al-Hadi, tells a different story.   He claims Wani --- whom he called ""the priest"" -- fed his sister ""potions"" to convert her to Christianity. He wants her to repent.   ""But if she refuses she should be executed,"" he told CNN last week.   At first, Ibrahim was charged with adultery for marrying a Christian. The apostasy accusation was added after she maintained she was a Christian, according to her husband.   She's been detained since January 17. In addition to the death sentence, the court sentenced her to 100 lashes for the adultery conviction.

"There's hundreds of people, wedding certificates are being issued, there's marriages taking place all over the hallways. Everybody's embracing. It's just a warm, wonderful moment in the state of Utah. ""  In striking down the state law, which voters had approved in 2004, U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Shelby wrote in a 53-page ruling that the state's ""current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason.   ""Accordingly, the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional,"" he said.   Shelby said lawyers for the state had offered no evidence that opposite-sex marriage would be affected and that their ""fears and speculations are insufficient to justify the State's refusal to dignify the family relationships of its gay and lesbian citizens. ""  In addition, the Constitution protects the rights of same-sex couples, including their right to marry and to have that marriage recognized by their government, he said. ""These rights would be meaningless if the Constitution did not also prevent the government from interfering with the intensely personal choices an individual makes when that person decides to make a solemn commitment to another human being. The Constitution therefore protects the choice of one's partner for all citizens, regardless of their sexual identity. ""  The lawsuit was brought by one gay and two lesbian couples in Utah who wish to marry but have been unable to do so because the Utah Constitution prohibits same-sex marriage.   The decision was greeted with joy from a spokesman for GLAAD, formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. ""At last, loving and committed couples in Utah will have the opportunity to celebrate marriage equality this holiday season,"" said Wilson Cruz in a posting on its website.   ""We are seeing state leaders and more and more citizens recognize that loving and committed couples should not be legally kept apart,"" said Cruz. ""We look forward to seeing that momentum to continue in 2014. ""  Gov. Gary R. Herbert expressed disappointment at the ruling by Shelby, whom he called ""an activist federal judge."" Herbert said he was working with his legal counsel and the acting attorney general ""to determine the best course to defend traditional marriage within the borders of Utah. ""  A spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in a statement that it supports ""traditional marriage,"" while teaching that everyone should be treated with respect. ""This ruling by a district court will work its way through the judicial process,"" Eric Hawkins said.   ""We continue to believe that voters in Utah did the right thing by providing clear direction in the state Constitution that marriage should be between a man and a woman and we are hopeful that this view will be validated by a higher court. ""  The president of the National Organization for Marriage, Brian Brown, called the ruling ""a travesty of justice. ""  In a statement, he added, ""This trend of vetoing the voters from the bench must be stopped. ""  That view was not shared by Clifford Rosky, chairman of the board of Equality Utah. ""We think it is a thoughtful and careful ruling that is based on the Supreme Court decision last summer and we expect that it will be upheld ultimately by the United States Supreme Court,"" he said.   By early Friday evening, Rosky told CNN he had signed as a witness to multiple marriages among same-sex couples.   Though the state has already filed a notice of appeal, the state's lawyers did not file a motion for a stay  in district court, which allowed the marriages to begin at once. ""Why they didn't ask the district court for a stay is a mystery, to say the least,"" Rosky said.   ""There are hundreds of people here -- it's past 5 o'clock and the clerk is not closing the door. ""  Same-sex marriage is banned by constitutional amendment or state law in: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.   But it is legal in 17 other U.S states and the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.   Worldwide, 16 other countries (and parts of Mexico) have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships. Most of these are in Europe and South America.   Civil unions, which are legal in Colorado, grant couples most of the rights of state civil marriages, but provide none of the federal benefits of marriage, such as Social Security benefits.   These rights include spousal support, medical decision-making privileges, access to a partner's insurance, and hospital visitation rights.   Though the U.S. Supreme Court has signaled that it is reluctant to issue a national opinion on the matter, lower courts and states have not been so reluctant, said Carl Tobias, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Richmond.   ""I'm just struck by how quickly this is all moving,"" he said. ""It just seems like it's picking up steam in terms of challenges. ""  He attributed the change to a greater acceptance of gays and lesbians, especially among young people. ""They just don't see this as a great moral issue that needs to be something codified as a prohibition in the law,"" he said. ""Everybody knows gay people -- either in their families or friends or workplaces -- so what's the big deal? ""  President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage and defining marriage as ""a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife"" in 1996.   Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected parts of DOMA, in a 5-4 decision that dismissed an appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds and ruled same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits.   On Thursday, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled unanimously to allow same-sex marriage statewide and ordered county clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to qualified same-sex couples.",human
"FULL COVERAGE: The Iraq War, 10 years on  I headed the U.N. inspections in Iraq at the time of the war 10 years ago. Today, I look again at the reasons why this terrible mistake -- and violation of the U.N. charter -- took place and explore if any lessons be drawn. Here are my thoughts.   After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, George W. Bush's administration felt a need to let the weight and wrath of the world's only superpower fall on more evil actors than just Afghanistan's Taliban regime.   No target could have seemed more worthy of being crushed than Iraq's brutal dictator, Saddam Hussein. Sadly, however, the elimination of this tyrant was perhaps the only positive result of the war.   The war aimed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction, but there weren't any.   The war aimed to eliminate al Qaeda in Iraq, but the terrorist group didn't exist in the country until after the invasion.   The war aimed to make Iraq a model democracy based on law, but it replaced tyranny with anarchy and led America to practices that violated the laws of war.   The war aimed to transform Iraq to a friendly base for U.S. troops capable to act, if needed, against Iran -- but instead it gave Iran a new ally in Baghdad.   WATCH NOW: Iraq's phantom WMD  The Bush administration certainly wanted to go to war, and it advanced eradication of weapons of mass destruction as the main reason. As Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz has since explained, it was the only rationale that was acceptable to all parts of the U.S. administration.   The WMDs argument also carried weight with the public and with the U.S. Congress. Indeed, in the autumn of 2002 the threat seemed credible. While I never believed Saddam could have concealed a continued nuclear program, I too thought there could still be some biological and chemical weapons left from Iraq's war with Iran. If not, why had Iraq stopped U.N. inspections at many places around the country throughout the 1990s?   However, suspicions are one thing and reality is quite another. U.N. inspectors were asked to search for, report and destroy real weapons. As we found no weapons and no evidence supporting the suspicions, we reported this. But U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfield dismissed our reports with one of his wittier retorts: ""The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.""   Rumsfeld's logic was correct, I believe, but it was no excuse for the American and British governments to mislead themselves and the world, as they did, by giving credit to fake evidence or assuming that if weapons items were ""unaccounted for"" that they must exist. They did not exist.   We inspected many hundred of sites, including dozens that had been suggested to us by various governments' national intelligence organizations. In a few cases we found conventional weapons -- but no weapons of mass destruction. The governments that launched the war claimed to be 100% convinced that there were such weapons, but they had 0% knowledge of where these weapons were.   I am not suggesting that governments should ignore information coming from their billion dollar intelligence programs. Such information is indispensable and collected with many means that are not available to U.N. inspectors.   However, I think one lesson from the Iraq war is that we should pay equal attention to the results of multimillion dollar international reports that are based on extensive professional inspections on the ground. In 2003, the alliance of willing states did not do that.   After the war it was reported that I and several others in New York had had our offices bugged during this period. If I was bugged, as I find very likely, I regret that those listening in did not pay more attention to what I had to say.   FAREED ZAKARIA: 5 lessons of the Iraq War  Fortunately, enough states did listen, and the U.N. Security Council was saved from green-lighting a war that was justified by false evidence.   The political leaders who have been criticized as responsible for launching the war on false premises have asserted that they acted in good faith, and that interrogation of leading Iraqis showed that the regime planned to revive its weapons program as soon as sanctions disappeared.   I am not questioning the good faith of the political leaders, but rather their poor judgment in bringing war and death to a country on flimsy grounds.   On February 11 -- less than five weeks before the invasion -- I told U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice I wasn't terribly impressed by the intelligence we had received from the U.S., and that there had been no weapons of mass destruction at any of the sites we had been recommended by American forces. Her response was that it was Iraq, and not the intelligence, that was on trial.   ARWA DAMON: Iraq suffocates in cloak of sorrow  And during a telephone chat with Tony Blair on February 20, I told the British prime minister that it would be paradoxical and absurd if a quarter of a million troops were to invade Iraq and find very little in the way of weapons. He responded by telling me intelligence was clear that Saddam had reconstituted his weapons of mass destruction program.   At any rate, whatever view one took of the evidence of weapons, no one could believe in 2003 that prostrate Iraq was a threat to any other state.   I cannot judge whether Iraqi prisoners were sincere when they talked about Saddam Hussein's intentions to revive weapons programs after the end of sanctions. They might have said what they thought their Western interrogators wanted to hear. Either way, the risk of a revived weapons program was remote and hypothetical -- and the U.N. foresaw a system of reinforced monitoring to continue in Iraq and to provide an alarm bell even after a lifting of sanctions.   The most important lesson of the Iraq War, I think, has been that an overconfidence in military power has been replaced by an understanding that there are severe limitations on what can be achieved by military means.   OPINION: Media's failure on Iraq still stings   Intervening swiftly with arms and crippling strikes might be easy for a great power, but achieving desired political aims is another matter and exiting may be hard -- the phrase ""If you break it, you own it"" comes to mind. Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq have been long and costly engagements with very mixed results. Since then prudence has held the U.S. back in the case of Libya and so far in Syria.   Another important lesson is that today armed  international interventions are likely to be condemned by much of the world unless they are clearly  in self-defense or have been authorized by the Security Council.   Iraq was neither. Unless we remember this going forward, I fear there is nothing stopping this kind of tragedy from being repeated.",human
"I call this ""antibiotic winter. ""  To explain: In the early 1950's, scientists conducted experiments to determine whether our resident microbes -- the huge number of bacteria that live in and on our bodies, now called our ""microbiome"" -- help in fending off invading bacteria. They fed mice a species of a typical invader, disease-causing salmonella. It took about 100,000 organisms to infect half of the normal mice. But when they first gave mice an antibiotic, which kills both good and bad bacteria, and then several days later gave them salmonella, it took only three organisms to infect them. This isn't a 10 or 20% difference; it's  a 30,000-fold difference.   That was in mice, but what about humans? In 1985, Chicago faced a massive outbreak of salmonella. At least 160,000 people became ill and several died from drinking contaminated milk. The health department asked victims of the outbreak and unaffected persons, ""Have you received antibiotics in the month prior to becoming ill?"" People who said yes were five times more likely to become ill than those who drank the milk but hadn't recently received antibiotics.   People carry a small number of highly abundant bacterial species and a large number of much less common ones. For example, you may carry trillions of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in your colon and only a thousand cells, or fewer, belonging to many other species. We are not sure how many rare species any of us has. If you had only 50 cells of a particular type, it would be difficult to detect them against the background of trillions of others.   When you take a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which is the kind most commonly prescribed, it may be that rare microbes occasionally get wiped out entirely. And once the population hits zero, there is no bouncing back. For your body, that species is now extinct. My worry is that some of these critical residential organisms -- what I consider ""contingency"" species -- may disappear altogether.   Why might it matter? Those puny species may not be so inconsequential. Microbes multiply. Any small population of, say, 50 cells can explode into a billion or more in one week. The trigger for their massive bloom could be a food you've eaten for the first time, which only they have the enzymes to digest. In the presence of this food, the rare microbe goes into overdrive, doubling every 12 or 20 minutes, multiplying by a million percent or more.   This could be good for you because some of the energy captured by these digesting microbes might end up in your bloodstream. When food is in short supply, as has been the case for most of human existence, and people need to eat unfamiliar plants or animals, it is useful to have a repertoire of enzymes that help us process a wide variety of nutrients. The genes of our flexible partners, our resident microbes, provide those enzymes.   Now consider the consequences if one of your rare microbes -- an ancient one that has been dwelling in Homo sapiens for 200,000 years -- went extinct. One possibility is that it doesn't matter. Perhaps that microbe was a marginal player -- good riddance. Another possibility: It's a ""contingency"" organism,  useful -- crucial -- when we need it for protection.   When a new influenza epidemic arose in Mexico in 2009, people in California and Texas soon fell ill, and then flu appeared in New York a few days later. After a few weeks, this flu spread throughout the world. Considering the numbers of people infected, we were lucky that it was not a highly lethal strain.  Yet thousands of people all over the world did die. Even when a strain is not that virulent, when hundreds of millions of people are infected, deaths add up. And when the strain is worse, the deaths climb into the millions.   Our world has gotten smaller. We have much greater global access to one another -- at the very moment in our history when our ancient microbial defenses are degrading. This makes us vulnerable to microbial invaders and provides fuel for disease conflagrations, with consequences scarcely imaginable.   Plagues are inevitable wherever people congregate. With a global population of 7 billion, rising by 80 million annually, the question is not whether another big plague will come, but when it will happen, what will cause it, and who will be affected. In 1918-19, influenza killed tens of millions, in an era without airplanes and with much less mass transit to spread it. With a huge world population that is essentially contiguous, and with so many people with weakened defenses, we are vulnerable as never before.   I see many parallels between our changing climate and our changing microbiome. The modern epidemics -- asthma and allergic disorders, obesity, and metabolic disorders -- are not only diseases, they are external signs of change within.  But they also indicate a deeper imbalance, the loss of our reserves.   Our diverse microbes, with their millions of genes helping us resist disease, are the guerrilla warriors defending the home domain -- as long as we protect them. But recent studies suggest that otherwise normal people already have lost 15% to 40% of their microbial diversity and the genes that accompany it.   This is the greatest danger before us -- invaders causing an epidemic against which we are helpless.  Unless we change our ways, we do indeed face an ""antibiotic winter. ""  We must end the assault on our microbes, by cutting antibiotic use and also such elective practices as unnecessary cesarean sections that bypass the natural order of mothers passing on their bacteria to their babies. There are times when both of these are needed urgently, but we already know that we are overusing them.   Technology already provides important tools to improve doctors' judgments about when antibiotics are needed, but we must get them into the clinic. We also must develop new tools, like ""narrow-spectrum"" antibiotics that target only the invader and minimize collateral effects.   We must understand that every antibiotic course has a biological cost, and more precisely align possible benefit with the full costs. I predict that in the future we will routinely be giving children back their lost microbes, in early life to restore their patrimony and after the antibiotic courses that are truly necessary.   Just as we have abused marvelous inventions like freon and the internal combustion engine, so too we have abused our ""wonder drugs."" But the possible costs of these practices are our worst nightmare; we need to prepare, starting now.",human
"Rubio largely kept to his prepared remarks, except when he abruptly stopped talking about halfway through to reach for a drink of water.   The son of Cuban immigrants referred emotively to his personal story and that of his family, though his policy criticisms and proposals were largely in line with prevailing mainstream and, in some cases, conservative Republican thinking.   On immigration, for instance, on which Rubio has been one of his party's most outspoken proponents of efforts to ""modernize"" the current system, he didn't mention his past support of a route to citizenship for undocumented immigrants now in the United States.   The senator did generally advocate ""a responsible, permanent solution to the problem of those who are here illegally."" But he added that first, ""we must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws. ""  Speaking about gun control measures, one of the most emotional parts of Obama's State of the Union speech, Rubio said he was for ""effectively"" dealing with such violence, then added, ""but unconstitutionally undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans is not the way to do it. ""  CNN Fact Check: Rubio says Obamacare needs a check up  He sharply criticized Obama on many fronts.   The president, Rubio claimed, had unfairly cast Republicans as opposing the environment and seniors, and only caring about rich people.   He contended that it was Obama who,if his plans are enacted, would hurt the majority of Americans by preventing the economy from growing.   ""The tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle class families,"" Rubio said, referring to Obama. ""It will cost them their raises. It will cost them their benefits. It may even cost some of them their jobs. ""  His remarks often reflected the sharp partisan divide on budgetary matters.   Top Democrats, including Obama, have consistently said that increased government revenues should be paired with spending cuts to bring down the deficit.   Congress already raised tax rates on top income earners as part an agreement in January to avert the worst aspects of the so-called fiscal cliff. And now, Obama and Democrats want to eliminate some tax breaks and loopholes to further raise revenue.   Republican leaders have sought to reduce the size of government and, therefore, generally oppose any increase in tax revenue.   5 things we learned from the State of the Union  They have called for aggressive spending cuts and steps to overhaul entitlement programs, while rejecting any new attempts to increase revenue as part of further steps to reduce the deficit.   Obama's ""solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more, borrow more and spend more,"" Rubio said.   The president did, in fact, propose several new programs aimed at bolstering the economy, though he insisted they wouldn't add to the deficit.   Opinion: Rubio missed the year of the woman  ""The idea that more taxes and more government spending is the way to help hardworking middle-class taxpayers, that's an old idea that has failed every time it's been tried,"" Rubio said. ""More government isn't going to help you get ahead. It's going to hold you back. ""  Rubio said he agreed with Obama on lowering the corporate tax rate, but didn't mention the president's support for closing tax loopholes that inordinately benefit the rich.   Rubio backed school choice for all parents and said that student financial aid should evolve to help more ""nontraditional students. ""  Talk Back: Is giving the State of the Union the political 'kiss of death'?   On energy policy, the senator derided Obama's administration for ""wasting ... taxpayer money on so-called clean energy ventures like Solyndra."" Rubio favors ""reform"" of energy regulations and opening up ""more federal lands for safe and responsible (oil and gas) exploration,"" both common Republican themes.   He spoke, too, of Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for seniors, arguing that changes are needed for it to continue. The president suggested he'd support ""modest reform"" of this entitlement program, but Rubio said Obama does not go far enough.   ""I would never support any changes to Medicare that would hurt seniors like my mother,"" he said. ""But anyone who is in favor of leaving Medicare exactly the way it is right now is in favor of bankrupting it. ""  Near the end of his speech, Rubio prayed that Democrats and Republicans ""can come together to solve our problems,"" contending that, if they don't, the consequences will be stark.   ""If we can get our economy healthy again, our children will be the most prosperous Americans ever,"" Rubio said. ""And if we do not, we will forever be known as the generation responsible for America's decline. ""  Opinion: A kinder, gentler, wiser Marco Rubio",human
"Nor was today's announcement a full-fledged reveal like Apple's iOS 6 presentation at WWDC. Microsoft says it will unveil more end-user features in the summer. But in the meantime, these platform updates are significant, and Microsoft had a lot to say about them.   Here's a deeper dive into what we can expect from Windows Phone 8.   Hardware updates  As suspected, Windows Phone 8 will support multi-core chips. It's a move that will make Windows Phone more competitive with the iPhone and Android handsets, which have been able to check off multi-core support on their spec sheets for quite a while. When they launch, Windows Phone 8 devices will run on dual-core processors, specifically those from Qualcomm.   ""The experience that people have had on a single-core will get much, much better as we move to dual-core,"" Joe Belfiore, manager of the Windows Phone Program, said at the event.   Windows Phone 8 will also support three screen resolutions. (Windows Phone 7.5 supports just one.) The new screen resolutions include WVGA at 800×480 pixels and a 15:9 aspect ratio; WXGA at 1280×769 and 15:9; and 720p at 1280×720 at 16:9.   Rounding out the hardware story, Windows Phone 8 will support microSD card expansion. Hardware manufacturers can include a microSD slot for users to easily transfer information from device to device. ""What this enables is that an end user can add a MicroSD card months after they've bought a phone and transfer information from PC to phone, and phone to phone,"" Belfiore said. ""We didn't want to deliver this feature until we could do it where it's easy to use. ""  Revamped Internet Explorer 10  Microsoft showed off a new Internet Explorer browser for Windows Phone 8. The new IE 10 features Smart Screen, an anti-phishing filter that uses data from Windows PCs to block malicious websites in real time. Belfiore showed off how IE 10 can protect users who might fall victim to scam links sent via email.   IE 10 also receives a JavaScript update — JavaScript is now four times faster than the browser in Windows PHone 7.5, according to the company. There's also twice as much HTML5 support.   How does mobile IE 10 compare to other mobile browsers? According to recent SunSpider scores that measures a browser's JavaScript execution performance, IE 10 performed the best.   Shared Native Code  Windows Phone 8 will share native C and C++ code with Windows 8, making it easier for developers to create apps for both platforms. It's not something that consumers will immediately notice when they use the OS, but Microsoft hopes shared native code will lead to better, faster app development — and thus more quality apps in Windows Phone Marketplace.   ""The biggest effect this will have is we're going to see some freaking killer games this year,"" Belfiore said.   At its developer summit, Microsoft continually hammered on how easy it will be for developers to port games from Windows 8 to Windows Phone 8, and vice versa. ""Suddenly, with Windows Phone 8 with that shared core, taking an app from the PC to phone is very straightforward,"" Belfiore said.   In essence, native code will enable developers to write high-performance code — which is why games are such a big deal — and drive hardware acceleration. ""You're going to see some beefy, powerful phones running some amazing games this year,"" Belfiore said.   NFC Sharing  As suspected, Windows Phone 8 devices will support NFC sharing. NFC isn't a totally new technology, but it's far from ubiquitous, so it's interesting to see Microsoft pushing it forward. Belfiore demoed how NFC would work in a Lexus advertisement with an embedded tag — he used the April issue of Wired magazine, actually: With a simple tap of his phone on top of the advertisement, he transferred product information directly to his Windows Phone.   Also, sharing isn't limited to just phones. The new Microsoft platform supports NFC between phones, laptops, slates, and PCs. And NFC also has an important role in the next platform update....  Wallet Experience  Windows Phone 8 will feature a new Wallet hub where users can store their credit and debit card information, third-party loyalty and membership cards, and coupons and deals. It's not unlike Apple's iOS 6 Passbook app. But Windows Phone Wallet experience will also support NFC tap-to-pay.   Yes, it's like Google Wallet, but with one fundamental difference. All of your credit and debit card information will be stored in a secure SIM card, not in an on-device system. Google Wallet is built directly into a device, making it impossible to move your Wallet info from one device to the next, but Windows Phone has opted for a more transition-friendly option.   Microsoft's approach is also an experience that carriers prefer. But don't get too excited just yet, as the NFC tap-to-pay capabilities won't be coming to the United States until next year. At launch, the capability will be limited to the France-based Orange carrier. US Windows 8 consumers, however, will still be able to access the Wallet hub as their central location for cards, third-party services, and deals.   Goodbye Bing Maps, Hello Nokia Maps  Say goodbye to Bing Maps. Windows Phone 8 maps will run on Nokia's mapping technology, built directly into the onboard Maps app. There's not too much news on this front, but this development isn't surprising considering Microsoft and Nokia's close ties. Some key features include: Global NAVTEQ map data, offline map support, turn-by-turn directions, and map control for developers. 3-D navigation didn't make it.   Windows Phone 8 for Business  Microsoft has always had a strong hold on the enterprise market with Windows, and now it's taking all of that work and pulling it together with a business-friendly Windows Phone platform. Windows Phone 8 will come with a complete security platform with Secure Boot and encryption (which is a derivative of Windows Bitlocker). It'll make app distribution and deployment flexible for business, offering up a mechanism for private distribution and full-on onsite management.   Businesses will also be able to manage Windows Phone 8 devices through a software management system. And finally, Windows Phone 8 will run the Microsoft Office suite — though we have yet to see how it will look in that mobile form.   New Start Screen  Ah, the new Start Screen. ""It's the sexiest thing in Windows Phone 8,"" Belfiore said. And this should definitely the case for more visually motivated users. As we wrote in our story about the Start Screen and current Windows Phone devices, the new Start Screen is the most visible end-user feature of Windows Phone 8 (at least that's been announced so far).   Microsoft has taken its Live Tiles and made them more customizable, bringing a new small size to the experience.   ""These live tiles are the heart and soul of the Windows Phone,"" Belfiore said. ""We know that our users really love their phones, and we think the biggest reason is because Live Tiles make the phones so special and so personal. ""  Users will be able to choose between a small, medium and large size for their Live Tiles. And now the entire screen is available for Live Tile pinning — the arrow and empty space on the right-hand side have dissapeared. To that end, users can pin more on their Start Screen.   And of course, Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 are coming even closer together. As Microsoft said, they're ""better together. ""  ""The intent in our changing the Live Tiles support is not just to make Live Tiles more personal, but to give a more consistent experience between Windows 8 Live Tiles and Windows Phone 8 live tiles,"" Belfiore said.

"5 things to know about Pope Francis  ""He told me. ... 'I'm in favor of gay rights and in any case, I also favor civil unions for homosexuals, but I believe that Argentina is not yet ready for a gay marriage law,'"" said Marquez, a gay rights activist, a self-described devout Catholic and a former theology professor at a Catholic seminary.   The pope's reported willingness behind-the-scenes to accept civil unions as a compromise may offer new insight into how he will lead the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.   A public battle   As archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio was one of the leaders of the Catholic Church's public charge against legalizing same-sex marriage in Argentina. He engaged in a notorious war of words with the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who supported the measure.   Bergoglio put himself in the middle of the fight, calling the proposed legislation ""a destructive attack on God's plan. ""  With a front-page counterpunch, the president said the church possessed ""attitudes reminiscent of medieval times and the Inquisition. ""  Some point to the public battle as evidence of Bergoglio's traditionalist views.   But behind closed doors, Marquez said, the man who would become pope appeared to be more open to discussion of the issue.   In another meeting, Bergoglio told him he had always treated gay people with respect and dignity.   World reacts to new pope  ""I have accompanied many homosexual people during my career to tend to their spiritual needs,"" Bergoglio said at the time, according to Marquez.   Pope was 'very open, very frank'  Bergoglio, who chose the name Pope Francis after he was elected pontiff last week, may have voiced his support for civil unions in other circles.   Andres Albertsen, a former pastor of the Danish Church in Buenos Aires, said Bergoglio made similar comments about civil unions to him in a private meeting.   ""In this conversation that we had, he showed himself to be very open, very frank with me,"" Albertsen told CNN en Español on Wednesday. ""He told me that he would have accepted a civil union. ""  According to a story published by The New York Times on Wednesday, Bergoglio also told bishops at a 2010 meeting that the church should support civil unions for gay couples.   CNN could not independently confirm the details of the Argentine bishops' meeting, which was also described in a July 2010 article published by Argentina's Clarin newspaper.   ""Bergoglio -- faithful to his moderate position -- proposed continuing measured actions. ... He would suggest, also, that the church discreetly accept the intermediate alternative of the civil union -- authorizing a series of rights (inheritance, social work) -- that would not equate to marriage nor permit adoption,"" wrote journalist Sergio Rubin -- now Bergoglio's biographer.   But that proposal was rejected by bishops, who voted instead to begin a high-profile, public battle against same-sex marriage, Rubin wrote.   Pushing for dialogue  A senior Vatican official said he could neither confirm nor deny The New York Times report at this point, adding that while Pope Francis might have expressed such a view while he was a cardinal, he should be given time to develop his policy position as pontiff.   Alejandro Russo, the rector of the Metropolitan Cathedral in Buenos Aires, said it was unlikely the pope had ever expressed such a view, even in private.   In 2007, Bergoglio publicly criticized Buenos Aires' government for allowing civil unions, Russo said. His relationship with the mayor of Buenos Aires soured over the matter.   Gay rights advocates in Argentina later argued that civil unions, allowed in a several states, were a positive step that conferred some benefits to same-sex couples, but didn't go far enough. The same-sex marriage measure, they said, would treat homosexual and heterosexual relationships equally before the law. It would permit gay couples to adopt, and also allow the inheritance of property.   Argentina approved a law legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide in July 2010.   Even though Bergoglio was one of the law's most well known opponents, Marquez said on Wednesday that he hopes the pontiff will remain open to discussion, just as he appeared to be several years ago in Buenos Aires.   ""We are going to try to have a dialogue with the pope,"" said Marquez, who works for Argentina's National Institute Against Discrimination. ""It's frightening, but I think it must be done. ""  'He's really moderate on this issue'  Word of the pope's reported support for civil unions in Argentina sparked debate, with some praising his stance and saying it was a hopeful sign of possible reforms.   ""He wanted to respect human rights. That's the real surprise here, that people say, well he's anti-gay. You can be anti-gay marriage and not be anti-gay, and I think there's a distinction here,"" said the Rev. Edward Beck, a CNN contributor and host of ""The Sunday Mass"" on ABC Family. ""He's really moderate on this issue, it seems. ""  Others, though, were more skeptical.   One Argentine journalist said Wednesday that he wasn't quite ready to celebrate.   In an article titled, ""Francis, the pope that declares war on us and later calls us on the phone,"" journalist Bruno Bimbi said it wasn't clear how the pope will handle the issue of same-sex unions.   ""Maybe the lion has become a lamb. Maybe, as a priest told me the day his election was announced, maybe he is worried about his biography and wants to go down in history. I do not know,"" Bimbi wrote. ""Whatever he does, this time he won't be able to blame others for the pressures. Now he's in charge. ""  Catholics: 5 ways for Francis to move forward",human
"""The card is not only a means of certifying your identity, but also a personal database repository and payment card, all in your pocket.""   The card could also be used for voting in the future, while Chris Onyemenam, director general and CEO of the Nigerian Identity Management Commission (NIMC), said that citizens will have ""the potential to use it as an international travel document. ""  Earlier this week, finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said 3,000 people had received cards. In order to get the document, Nigerians have to register at one of the NIMC enrollment centers around the country and provide 10 fingerprints, a picture of their face and iris, as well as information about their age and place of birth. Once registered, the NIMC official issues an I.D. number and then the card.   Growth opportunity  Nigeria produces more oil than any other African nation, but the World Bank says only about 30% of the population have a bank account.  Given 170 million people live in the country, Mastercard claims to have spotted an opportunity for growth.   Research conducted by MasterCard's consultancy arm says that cash dependency in a country like Nigeria can cost up to 1.5% of Gross Domestic Product. Given Nigeria has recently recently re-calculated it's 2013 GDP to a figure of $488 billion, making it Africa's biggest economy, that's certainly an amount the government is keen to keep a hold of.   Card controversy   But not everyone is happy with this pocket-sized one-stop-shop. Human Rights Activist Shehu Sani attacked the scheme on Facebook:  While Eze Onyekpere, lead director at the non-governmental organisation Centre for Social Justice, said the collaboration was not appropriate. ""There should be difference between everyday credit or payment cards and an identity card issued by a sovereign authority,"" he says. ""Even if Mastercard was needed to ensure a good payment system, there is nothing that says it must be heavily embossed on the card. It could guarantee the card without necessarily getting this free advert from 170 million Nigerians. ""  Onyekpere has also criticised the way the Nigerian government partnered with the international payments provider. ""The choice of Mastercard did not undergo a competitive selection process,"" he claims. ""It was clearly an abuse of Nigeria's public procurement process and the selection should have been open to all companies that can provide the service.   A MasterCard spokesperson denied the payments company was turning the I.D. card project into a branding exercise. In an emailed statement the company said ""the brand mark is not MasterCard's corporate logo, nor is it an advertisement for the company. The MasterCard brand displayed on the card is what makes the electronic payment component of the eID card accepted as a means of payment.""  NIMC spokesperson Umar Abdulhamid rejected any allegation of foul play in partnering with MasterCard. ""It's a level playing field,"" he said In a phone interview. ""Other payment providers have been invited to get involved, but were apprehensive. ""  And Daniel Monehin, president of MasterCard's Sub Saharan Africa division, joined Abdulhamid in dismissing this claim. In a phone interview he said that ""the collaboration went through all the highest levels of government.""  Previous attempts  This is not the first time Nigerian authorities have tried to implement such a card.   The idea of a national identity card scheme for Nigeria was first initiated in 1978, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. But successive governments and coups meant the idea did not become a reality.   More recently, progress on the provision of identity cards for Nigerians took shape in early 2003, when some 60,000 centers were set up to register citizens. While the approach to take photographs and fingerprints sought to avoid fraud, an article on the U.N. refugee agency's website reports that irregularities in the roll-out of the I.D. cards meant that by 2008 the government was planning a new card.   A month into this latest identity project there remains no fixed timetable for when the roll out of the initial 13 million cards will be completed.   Read more: Africa's oil and gas: Boom or hype?

"""I told him there are places that operate within the boundaries of the law which can be used for releasing sexual frustration, so they [the U.S. military] should fully utilize it or the marines won't be able to control their aggressive sexual desires.

""A series of remarks by Japanese politicians related to our interpretation of [wartime] history have been misunderstood,"" Education Minister Hakubun Shimomura told reporters at his weekly press conference Tuesday. ""In that sense Mr. Hashimoto's remarks came at a bad time. [But] I wonder if there is any positive meaning to intentionally make such remarks at this particular moment? As for the remarks about adult entertainment, I could not believe that it came from a man representing a political party. ""  Fellow minister Tomomi Inada asked: ""I wonder is this something the representative of a political party should say? I myself think the comfort women [issue] infringed the human rights of the women. ""  Chief Cabinet Spokesman Yoshihide Suga did not respond directly to Hashimoto's comments but instead told reporters ""the stance of the Japanese government on the comfort women issue is, as it has been stated repeatedly in the past, that they suffered unspeakably painful experiences and we keenly feel the pain when we think about them. ""  Sex slaves  Many of the 200,000 women whom historians estimate were forced to become sex slaves for Japan's former Imperial Army were from the Philippines, China and the Korean peninsula -- all occupied territories at the time.

They demand greater recognition of their suffering, as well as individual compensation.   Tokyo maintains its legal liability for wrongdoing was cleared by a bilateral treaty signed in 1965 with South Korea. For its part, the Seoul government expressed ""deep disappointment"" over Hashimoto's comments.   ""There is worldwide recognition... that the issue of comfort women amounts to a wartime rape committed by Japan during its past imperial period in a serious breach of human rights,"" a foreign ministry spokesman told Agence France-Presse Tuesday.   ""Our government again urges Japan's prominent officials to show regret for atrocities committed during Japan's imperial period and to correct their anachronistic way of thinking and comments. ""  In 1993, the Japanese government released a statement acknowledging the ""immeasurable pain and suffering"" endured by thousands of women forced to have sex during World War II. It even vowed to include the comfort women issue in new junior high school textbooks for the first time.

"""  Making his third campaign-style appearance in three days, Obama again emphasized proposals from Tuesday's State of the Union address, such as raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour and providing good pre-schooling for every child as necessary to help people better themselves.   The president also called for Congress to vote on a package of gun proposals aimed at decreasing shootings like ones that occur daily on streets and in homes, as well as mass killings in recent months at a school, a movie theater and even a place of worship.   According to the Centers of Disease Control, there were 11,078 homicides by firearm in the United States in 2010, and 7,220 of the victims -- 65% -- were aged 15-34. In addition, 6,151 -- or 56% -- were African American, a demographic that comprises about 13% of the total U.S. population.   ""This is not just a gun issue,"" he continued. ""It's also an issue of the kinds of communities that we're building, and for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it. ""  It all starts at home, the president said, calling ""strong, stable families"" and ""loving, supportive parents"" the most important ingredients for reducing violence.   Noting he was raised by a single mother, he called for promoting marriage and encouraging fatherhood, saying he wished he had a father around and involved when he was a boy.   ""By the way, that's all kinds of parents,"" he added, drawing applause when he specified ""it includes gay or straight parents. ""  He acknowledged the challenge, saying ""it will not be easy, but it can be done. ""  ""No solution we offer will be perfect,"" he said. ""But perfection has never been our goal. Our goal has been to try and make whatever difference we can. ""  Obama headed to his hometown after a White House ceremony Friday morning to award the Presidential Citizens Medal -- the nation's second-highest civilian honor -- to 18 people. They included posthumous honors for six educators killed along with 20 first-graders in December's Connecticut school massacre.   The president hugged family members of the slain teachers and administrators from Sandy Hook Elementary School in presenting the medals, saying: ""We could not be more grateful to your loved ones, who gave everything they had"" for the children in their care.   In his remarks later at Chicago's Hyde Park Academy High School, Obama mentioned Hadiya Pendleton, 15, who was killed by gunfire in the city last month after returning from taking part in inaugural activities in Washington.   Pendleton's parents were in the crowd Friday, just as they were at the State of the Union as guests of first lady Michelle Obama, who attended Hadiya's funeral.   The president said his package of gun measures was intended to save young lives and that ""they deserve a vote,"" repeating the phrase a few times as he did in Tuesday's address at the Capitol.   Chicago's record murder rate: Don't blame guns alone  Fierce opposition by the National Rifle Association makes passage of any significant gun legislation uncertain. In response to Obama's State of the Union address, the NRA has sought to discredit the motives and impacts of legislation proposed by the president and Democrats.   ""They only care about their decades-old gun control agenda â€” ban every gun they can, tax every gun sold and register every gun owner,"" NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre said in a statement on Thursday. ""This president has taken the art of public deception and manipulation to a whole new level.""  Obama seeks an updated version of the 1994 assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, that would prevent the manufacture and sale of some semi-automatic rifles modeled after fully automatic assault weapons.   Obama's emotional plea might lead to vote on guns  He also proposes limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, expanding background checks to all gun transactions, including sales at gun shows. In addition, the president wants Congress to take steps to better screen people with mental illnesses, so they cannot obtain weapons.   Legislation proposed so far also would crack down on so-called straw purchases, in which a legal buyer purchases weapons for distribution to non-legal buyers.   The NRA and other opponents argue the Democratic proposals are veiled attempts to limit gun ownership and eventually take away weapons, and therefore violate the constitutional right to bear arms.   In particular, opponents contend the proposed ban on semi-automatic rifles focuses on a weapon used in a tiny percentage of killings and other gun violence.   Opinion: Chicago's violence took my dad, friends  Harold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, confirmed on Friday that so-called assault weapons targeted by the proposed ban account for a small fraction of murders in the United States.   However, Pollack said the ban proposed by Obama can help reduce gun violence, especially what he called the psychologically impactful mass shootings such as the Newtown attack in which a lone gunman used a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle.   The combination of such weapons with high-capacity magazines ""facilitates mass homicides,"" Pollack told CNN, noting that professional criminals generally don't use such rifles that look like military weapons.   ""The people who do use these weapons are often the most dangerous or most sociopathic,"" Pollack said. The Newtown shooter, a 20-year-old man living with his mother, took her legally owned guns and killed her before going to the school to open fire on students and teachers.   New player in gun control ad wars  To Pollack, such a mass killing -- while relatively rare -- ""traumatizes communities and the entire society in a way that demands attention. ""  Studies show that street crime such as shooting deaths cost communities more than lives, Pollack said, citing emergency medical services and criminal investigation as tangible costs along with intangibles such as residents moving away to escape the threat.   Obama also made that point in his remarks on Friday, saying ""it's very hard to develop economically if people don't feel safe. ""  In the aftermath of the Newtown shootings, the NRA called for putting armed guards at every school, rather than seeking to limit the ability of people to obtain weapons. It also wants tougher enforcement of existing gun laws, which Pollack agreed was necessary.   ""A lot of the underground gun market could be stopped if we treated guns with the same amount of determination and tools as the drug market,"" he said.   For example, Pollack noted how committing a crime with a gun brought additional charges, and he called for similar treatment for illegally possessing a firearm.   How we talk about guns in my Chicago classroom  In a Google Hangout online chat on Thursday, a participant asked Obama how renewing the assault weapons ban would help reduce gun violence caused primarily by handguns.   He responded that his proposed package would affect handgun violence through the expanded background checks and cracking down on straw purchases. Renewing the weapons ban focused on what Obama called ""weapons of war. ""  ""It's not going to solve every problem,"" the president continued, noting that some restrictions are already in place.   ""We can't purchase a grenade launcher from a store, although there may be some folks who want to buy those,"" he said. ""And the reason is we think on balance, the Second Amendment does not automatically assume that any weapon that's available you can automatically purchase.""

"Since 9/11, jihadist terrorists have killed 25 people in the United States. Each one of those deaths is a tragedy, but none of these attacks were national catastrophes as 9/11 was.   While al Qaeda and its affiliates have failed to conduct any successful attacks in the United States since 9/11, they have sought to encourage action from militant American citizens, who might be more capable of carrying out terrorist operations in the States than foreign operatives given the stringent security measures now in place.   Unfortunately, this strategy of promoting homegrown extremism has demonstrated some successes, such as Maj. Nidal Hasan's killing of 13 people at the Fort Hood, Texas, military base in 2009 and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, which authorities have said were carried out by Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev.   All of these were inspired by the propaganda of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American cleric killed in a 2011 U.S. drone strike in Yemen after he took up an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.   According to the New America Foundation's research, an astonishing quarter of the 247 jihadist extremists charged since 9/11 either possessed copies of al-Awlaki's propaganda materials, cited him as an influence or were in communication with him.   The influence of al-Awlaki and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's English-language magazine Inspire has persisted even after al-Awlaki's death.   Worrisomely, around 100 Americans have traveled to fight in Syria with opposition groups, including with ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front.   So far, nine Americans have been charged with attempting to support or supporting ISIS or Nusra, according to a count by New America.   In addition, at least two Americans have died fighting with these groups: Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, who committed a suicide bombing in Syria for Nusra Front, and Douglas McCain, who died fighting with ISIS.   The difficulty al Qaeda and similar groups have had in inspiring Americans to conduct attacks at home is due to the strength of systemic security checks, such as the willingness of Muslim communities to report potential terrorist activity. A third of the extremists charged since 2001 were implicated by tips from family or local community members, according to an analysis by New America.   Of the 51 plots to conduct an attack inside the United States since 9/11, nearly half were initiated while the suspects were under surveillance by informants, according to a count by New America.   The role that the Muslim community has played as well as aggressive law enforcement efforts using informants have both helped to make the United States a hard target for militants.   Add to these factors other measures taken since 9/11; the day that al Qaeda's hijackers attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, there were only 16 people on the U.S. no-fly list. Today, there are more than 40,000.   In 2001, there were 32 Joint Terrorism Task Force ""fusion centers,"" where multiple law enforcement agencies work together to chase down leads and build terrorism cases. Now there are 103.   Before 9/11, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Counterterrorism Center, Transportation Security Administration, Northern Command and Cyber Command didn't exist. In 2014, all of these new institutions make it much harder for terrorists to operate in the United States.   The U.S. intelligence budget also grew dramatically after 9/11, with Congress giving the government substantial resources with which to improve its counterterrorism capabilities. In 2013, the United States allocated $72 billion to intelligence collection and other covert activities. Before 9/11, the budget was around a third of that figure: $26 billion.   In addition, greater public awareness of the danger posed by terrorism has also made the United States a much harder target.

"""They are horrible to look at, and they illustrate apparent actions that would be serious international crimes. ""  A preliminary session for the peace talks, dubbed Geneva II, will begin Wednesday in Montreux, Switzerland, and the formal international talks will commence Friday in Geneva between the Syrian government and opposition delegations.   Even as U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon arrived Tuesday in Switzerland, controversy roiled over how the U.N. rescinded an invitation to Iran to join the talks, with Russian officials saying it was a mistake but ""not a catastrophe. ""  Iran, accused of supporting the al-Assad regime, announced Monday it would not attend the conference because it objected to preconditions seeking a transitional government. The Syrian Coalition, however, said Iran's attendance would have been ""a deal-breaker. ""  ""Continued Russian and Iranian support for the regime is the main obstacle to finding a solution to the violence in Syria,"" the coalition said in its Tuesday statement.   Meanwhile, in Geneva, delegations to the conference continued arriving Tuesday as media outlets awaited their reaction to photographs purporting to show ""systematic torture and killing"" of detainees by the al-Assad regime.   Could photos be a game changer?   That assertion is being made by a team of internationally recognized war crimes prosecutors and forensic experts, who analyzed thousands of digital photos taken and provided by a Syrian defector codenamed ""Caesar,"" who, along with his family, is now living outside Syria in an undisclosed location.   The experts' report was partly sponsored by the government of Qatar, which funded the British law firm Carter-Ruck to write it. Qatar and Saudi Arabia provide most of the outside support for Syria's rebel forces.   The experts advancing the report are David Crane, the first chief prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone; Sir Desmond de Silva, the former chief prosecutor of the same special court; and Professor Sir Geoffrey Nice, former lead prosecutor against former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.   They shared their findings in a joint exclusive this week with CNN's ""Amanpour"" and The Guardian newspaper.   The experts contend their analysis -- based on thousands of photographs of the dead bodies of alleged detainees killed in Syrian government custody -- would stand up in an international criminal tribunal.   In the photos, lifeless bodies show signs of starvation, brutal beatings, strangulation and other forms of torture and killing, according to the report.   4 things to know about Syria  In one group of images of 150 individuals examined in detail by the experts, 62% of the bodies showed emaciation -- severely low body weight with a hollow appearance indicating starvation. The majority of all of the victims were men most likely between ages 20 and 40.   Stomachs, faces and even legs are concave -- sunken, rather than convex. On some torsos, bruising and bleeding is so severe that the victims' skin is a mosaic of black, red, purple and pink.   Oblong and parallel wounds, a mix of bruises and torn skin, line one man's chest and torso, covering every inch of the victim's body from neck to pelvis.   The forensics team identified the neck bruising as consistent with strangulation with a rope, piece of rubber, or other such object, as opposed to the marks that would be left by a hanging.   De Silva likened the images to those of Holocaust survivors.   The emaciated bodies were the product of starvation as a method of torture, ""reminiscent of the pictures of those (who) were found still alive in the Nazi death camps after World War II,"" de Silva said in a CNN interview.   The report asserts the killing was orchestrated by Syria's highest levels of government.   Haunting images of Syria's abandoned homes  A complex numbering system was used to catalog the corpses, with only the relevant Syrian intelligence service knowing the identities of the corpses. It was an effort, the report says, to keep track of which security service was responsible for the death, and then later to provide false documentation that the person had died in a hospital.   CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the photographs, documents and testimony referenced in the report and is relying on the conclusions of the team behind it, which includes international criminal prosecutors, a forensic pathologist, an anthropologist and an expert in digital imaging.   The report draws its evidence from the testimony of a defector dubbed ""Caesar"" and almost 27,000 photographs he provided; in all 55,000 such images were taken out of the country.   Caesar worked as photographer in the military police, and once the war broke out, his work consisted entirely of documenting ""killed detainees,"" the report said.   He claimed to have photographed as many as 50 bodies a day.   At one point he took the unusual step of photographing a group of bodies to show that it ""looked like a slaughterhouse,"" according to the report.   Refugees starving to death in Syrian camp  The fact that all the bodies were photographed, the report's authors say, strongly suggests that ""the killings were systematic, ordered, and directed from above. ""  It is also possible that far from being a systematic plan to document human rights abuses, photographing the bodies was the unexamined continuation of a long-time practice.   Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court. The only way the court could prosecute someone from Syria would be through a referral from the United Nations Security Council.   But because of Russia's support for the al-Assad regime, and because it has veto power on the council, such a referral seems unlikely, at least for now.   More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since the revolt against al-Assad began in March 2011, the United Nations says. A communique by last year's Geneva I conference calls for a transitional government and eventual free elections as part of a political settlement to end the war.   Al-Assad has called for this week's conference to include a focus on ""fighting terrorism"" in Syria. Throughout the civil war, Syria has blamed violence on ""terrorists. ""  In a meeting with Syria's delegates to the talks, al-Assad directed them to preserve their nation's sovereignty by ""preventing and rejecting any foreign interference no matter its form and context,"" Syria's state news agency, SANA, reported Monday.   Al-Assad also said no political solution could be reached without the agreement of the Syrian people and ""first and foremost the complete cessation of terrorism"" and its support by other countries, the news agency said.

"Through the practice of ""sema,"" or listening, in a prayer-induced trance, the Dervishes aim to act as a bridge between God and humankind.   The Dervishes turn as one arm reaches to the sky ""taking from God"" and the other ""gives life to the earth,"" Loras says. ""We receive from God and we return that light and gift to humanity,"" he explains.   Every Sunday, a different Mevlevi order visits Istanbul and worships at the Galata Mevlevihanesi, a Dervish ""Tekke"" or lodge.   When CNN visits the lodge, it is the turn of the Mevlana Culture and Arts Foundation from Turkey's capital, Ankara.   Two teenage Dervishes are conducting their debut sema ritual in public. The young semazens, aged 14 and 15, wear white felt hats rather than the traditional brown. For them, it's a coming of age moment, the beginning of a long life of spiritual modesty displayed through meditative dance.   ""It takes about six months to learn how to whirl. There are some people that can't,"" the ""semazenbasi"" -- leader of the sema -- Sahin Naci Sair says. ""They really need to feel three things. Music, rhythm, and belief. ""  In 2005, UNESCO declared the sema ceremony a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.   But in Turkey the Mevlevis still face restrictions. The sema ritual exists in spite of controversial laws banning Sufism altogether.   The Mevlevis' religious association was used as justification to ban the order after the founding of the secular Turkish Republic. In 1925, the founder of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, prohibited all Sufi orders, under Law 677 of the constitution on maintaining order.   In the 1950s, the government eased the ban, allowing the sema to be performed in public. But it is commonly assumed this move was to boost the tourism industry rather than a sign of religious tolerance and private worship by the order remains officially banned.   The tourism industry is the main source of income for the Dervishes, with members of the public giving donations to watch them worship.   Each December, there is a huge festival in Konya, where Celaladin Rumi founded the order in the 13th century. At the ""Seb-i-Arus,"" curious observers can watch Mevlevi associations performing the religious ceremony together. Tickets went on sale this month for the ceremony, which runs from December 7-17 every year.   At the beginning of each sema ceremony, the disciples stand with their arms closed to their chest and feet pointed inward. Young and old Mevlevis do this out of respect and to signify humility, fighting their ego through a spiritual journey inside and outside of the Dervish lodge.   Ilyas Noyan Ozatik, the head of the reed flute players accompanying the Ankara semazens in Istanbul, says the Mevlevis ""are on an inner journey of oneself to where God is. ""  Music is a unifying force he says, bringing ""our frequencies together leading to a completion of souls. ""  This passionate inner battle reflects their relationship with the outside world. When asked about the turmoil in the Middle East,  Lora points to an old British saying: ""if you want a clean street, every shop owner must clean the front of their own shop. ""  Mevlevis strive for universal peace, but believe that peace must begin in the hearts of individuals.   As the Dervishes turn, mesmerized and apparently staring into blank space, their spirit takes control and leads them across the age-old prayer space.   They glide effortlessly in circles, their white robes rising and falling, thinking all the while of their act as a bridge from God to earth.",human
"Tina Maze had been poised to add the slalom title to her overall, giant slalom and super-G Crystal Globes, having been denied the downhill when fog canceled racing on Shiffrin's birthday.   The Slovenian was the fastest on the opening run, and led the standings by seven points, but Shiffrin made up a 1.17-second deficit to claim her fourth World Cup race this season and become the fourth youngest woman to win the title.   She is only the third non-European to win the slalom globe, following compatriot Tamara McKinney in 1984 and Canadian Betsy Clifford in 1971. No other non-European woman has won four World Cup races in a season.

"He then gave a partial recap, using PowerPoint slides, of how the two intelligence programs work. Alexander said the NSA can collect metadata on phone calls in the United States, including the date and time of the call, the numbers involved and the length of the conversations. He made a special point of saying the NSA does not have access to the content of citizens' calls or text messages.   Top senator questions need to collect phone records  Alexander said the NSA's PRISM surveillance program, which probes digital activity such as e-mail, instant messaging and Web searches, focuses on foreign actors and does not apply to people in the United States. He said the phone and Internet data is necessary to ""connect the dots"" and identify potential terrorists before they act.   Alexander attempted to reassure the audience that NSA officials are not abusing access to the databases to intrude on Americans' privacy.   ""The assumption is that people are out there just wheeling and dealing (users' information), and nothing could be further from the truth,"" he said. ""We have tremendous oversight and compliance in these programs. ""  Congress and courts make sure the programs operate within the bounds of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and internal auditing systems are in place to prevent any abuse by employees, Alexander said. He added that only 35 analysts are authorized to run queries on the phone metadata.   Alexander made no mention of a report in Wednesday's Guardian newspaper about the existence of another secret NSA program, called XKeyscore. According to documents provided to the Guardian by Snowden, XKeyscore allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing e-mails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of people.   CNNMoney: NSA chief to hackers: If you don't like what we do, change it  Alexander denied accusations that the NSA programs allow the government to collect all online data on everyone.   ""We can't afford to and don't want to collect everything,"" he said.   ""I have four daughters. Can I go and intercept their e-mails? The answer is no,"" said the security chief before looking out at the auditorium thick with hackers and joking, ""You may be able to. ""  Aside from a couple jokes, Alexander's words were serious and measured, and he seemed unfazed by a smattering of heckling from the audience during his hourlong talk.   Ex-NSA chief: Safeguards exist to protect Americans' privacy  ""You lied to Congress. Why would we believe you're not lying to us right now?"" yelled one person.   Alexander replied that people were basing opinions on what was ""written in the press"" without looking at facts and urged the heckler read his congressional testimony.   During a Q&A session consisting of prescreened questions, Alexander said that one reason terrorists target the United States is a desire by people in the Middle East to run governments under Islamic law. But another attendee disagreed, shouting, ""They want to attack us because we're bombing them. ""  Another yell of ""bulls---!"" inspired the general to cap his explanation of the programs by saying ""And that's no bulls---, those are facts. ""  Overall, the reception to Alexander's talk seemed mostly positive. Black Hat attendees are primarily corporate-security types, interested in protecting their networks and warding off cyber attacks. The looser, hacker-centric Def Con conference, which starts here Thursday, could likely give him a more hostile reception.   Alexander solicited advice on how to better balance security with civil liberties and put up an e-mail address so the room of tech experts could share their ideas with the NSA.   He also hinted at possible damage resulting from the Snowden leaks, and wondered aloud whether the government will have the same success preventing terrorist attacks in the next 10 years as it has in the past decade.   ""If we tell everyone exactly what we're doing, then the adversaries will know exactly how to get through our defenses,"" he said.   Opinion: NSA secrets kill our trust",human
"And that's a spirit that doesn't always jibe with the image of  CEO of a corporation expected to be valued at up to $100 billion when it makes its first public stock offering in the next few weeks.   ""On balance, I'm not sure it's the best way to do business,"" said Ali Velshi, CNN's chief business correspondent. ""But Mark Zuckerberg has defied all rules. ""  The moxie suggested in the report comes at an interesting time for Facebook and Zuckerberg, who also reportedly whittled down Systrom's initial asking price of $2 billion.   On the brink of offering up Facebook, with its hundreds of millions of users, to stockholders, even Zuckerberg's controlling interest in the company (a 57% share of voting rights, according to reports) could soon need to be checked by the types of lawyers, bean-counters and other business types whose jobs involve looking out for a company's bottom line.   ""This paints a complex picture of its CEO as at once confident and bold, and also nervous and panicky -- details that will be scrutinized come Facebook's imminent IPO,"" Kit Eaton wrote on Fast Company's website.   Velshi, who over the course of his career covered the ""tech bubble"" of the late 1990s, said the whirlwind purchase may, in fact, be a last hurrah of sorts for Zuckerberg.   ""It actually happens more than we think. And it's not a bad thing, particularly in non-public companies, Velshi said. ""But, in public companies, boards are important -- they are supposed to protect shareholder interests, and they are supposed to bring perspective and experience that a kid CEO may not have.""  The Facebook board did vote to approve the deal, according to the Journal. But at that point, it was largely an endorsement more than a decision. The board, one source said, ""was told, not consulted. ""  In the fast-moving world of Web tech, being nimble is almost a prerequisite for survival. Fail to adapt and someone else will pass you by.   Instagram, a mobile app which lets users enhance their photos with a raft of pre-created filters, was reportedly on the verge of nailing down a new round of private investments worth $50 million. Could that have made Zuckerberg overpay for a company with 13 employees and no revenue to date?   Maybe, says Velshi.   ""Creativity, innovation and deal-making are different strengths; rarely does one person possess all of them,"" he said. ""That Zuckerberg felt strongly that he wanted Instragram may not have made him the best person to do the deal -- that's why we have real estate agents, or talent agents. ""  For what it's worth, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg was aware of the negotiations all along, although she didn't personally take part. And, for Facebook, making a profit directly from Instagram may have been less important than locking up its user data and taking a rapidly growing competitor, now with more than 40 million users, off of the playing field.   Regardless of where the future takes Facebook -- whether life as a publicly traded commodity is more about stuffy board meetings than spur-of-the moment handshake deals -- Wednesday's report provided at least one more glimpse at the hoodie-wearing, authority-flouting CEO whose origin story has literally become the stuff of Hollywood storytelling.

"While we can't do anything about the fact that ""no one even says oops when they're passing their gas"" and ""even kids'll kick your shins and give you sass"" (yep, ""Chicago"" again), we offer the following solutions in the war on class. Identify your own faux pas and make the Web a bit less of a bubbling swamp of vulgarity.   Tacky tactic: Posting detailed, passive-aggressive grievances about other people in your circle on your blog, Facebook, Twitter, etc., a la ""It's really interesting to me how SOME people think it's totally OK to be nice to your face and then send texts to your boyfriend telling him he could do better, ESPECIALLY when said people wear fake colored contact lenses and ill-fitting clothes and are named Jenny Jenkins. #justsaying. ""  Classy fix: When you have beef with one person and yet feel the need to involve hundreds of others, you don't come off as righteous. You look childish and a bit foolish. In fact, research shows that gossipmongers are seen as unlikable and weak.   If you have something to say to someone, say it to her face (book): E-mail or message her privately. Or better yet, call her or ask whether you can talk in person and -- calmly and without screeching or flailing about -- talk it out. Staying cool as a cucumber won't just be classy, it'll scare the crap out of whomever you're confronting. A classy foe is so much more persuasive than a hysterical one.   Tacky tactic: Making big announcements via TMI photos: the new baby, seconds after birth and still gooey; your newly deceased father-in-law on a gurney, moments before they wheeled him away; you passed out next to the toilet after celebrating your new job offer, etc.   Classy fix: Honestly, most big announcements don't require an accompanying photo. A cheerful update about the baby's weight and health, a solemn link to the service announcement and an excited sentence about your new gig would suffice.   Eventually your friends and loved ones will want you to share a photo of the cleaned-up baby. But trust us: Your friends want you to be out there celebrating achievements and dealing with losses, not busily tapping away on your smartphone every second of the day. (To put it another way: You're not nearly as interesting to everyone else as you think you are. Hard truth of the day.)   Tacky tactic: Assuming every digital contact is a willing financial supporter (and prefers to be contacted a dozen times a day).   So you're planning a self-booked, 12-country mission trip? Forming a nonprofit to neuter feral cats in the neighborhood? Kicking off that company of hard-plastic containers for the transportation of raw fruit that you've been talking about? Good for you. Not so good for us if you continue tagging us in daily Facebook notes or spamming us with bullying messages along the lines of ""Your contribution is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL to the success of Spay & Play, so it is ESSENTIAL that you donate as much as you can. ""  Classy fix: Use a carrot, not a stick, to drum up support. Set up a Kickstarter campaign with a low funding limit and offer incentives for different contributions. Send kind, flattering, personalized appeals to different potential donors (""I thought this might interest you since you're familiar with startup nonprofits, and I'd love to take you out for coffee and benefit from your wisdom even if a financial contribution isn't possible right now"") and leave them alone if one followup note goes unanswered.   At the end of the day, like when you're penniless in your 11th country or chest-deep in feral kitties, you want a venture funded by willing donors and well-wishing supporters, not ticked-off friends who are paying you hush money.",human
"It's not clear whether Pedro Hernandez -- described by police as an off-the-books former stock boy turned 51-year-old murder suspect -- was ever interviewed in the initial case. But more than three decades after Etan vanished, authorities say Hernandez confessed to the boy's killing after being brought in for questioning last week.   Hernandez has since been charged with second degree murder and is currently awaiting trial. But attorney Harvey Fishbein said his client -- who is currently on suicide watch at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan -- has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation.   According to police, the former stock clerk claims he lured Etan to the store's basement with the promise of a soda before choking him to death. He then allegedly disposed of the body using a plastic bag, placing the boy inside a trash bin located a block and a half away from his work.   ""The detectives thought (that confession) was a feeling of relief on his part,"" said Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, who described Hernandez as remorseful.   Prosecutors are now confronted with the task of corroborating that confession and piecing together a murder mystery that for decades has been littered with false positives.   The image of Hernandez, meanwhile, has gradually come into focus as attention homes in on the reclusive suspect who, according to his attorney, apparently suffers from a ""long psychiatric history"" that includes schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hallucinations.   The Hernandez family -- a large clan consisting of 11 brothers and sisters -- moved from Puerto Rico to southern New Jersey in the early 1970s, a relative told CNN.   Pedro Hernandez attended high school in the Camden, New Jersey, area before moving to Manhattan at the age of 18, sharing an apartment in the city's SoHo neighborhood with his older sister.   Sometime after his 19th birthday, Hernandez took a job as a stock clerk at a corner convenience store. He worked in the Lower Manhattan bodega for roughly a month before returning to his mother's south Jersey home in the summer of 1979, according to family members and police.   Etan disappeared roughly a month earlier on May 25.   Describing Hernandez as having been a quiet young man, relatives say his demeanor changed upon his return to New Jersey. He grew further withdrawn while also frequently becoming ill, they said.   Though his whereabouts after 1979 remain murky, family members say at one point he returned to New York. It's unclear for how long.   Police Commissioner Kelly told reporters last week that Hernandez was injured during a construction job sometime in the 1990s and has since been receiving disability compensation. But a relative claims that the suspect was instead injured during his employment at a clothing factory in Maple Shade, New Jersey.   Twice married, Hernandez fathered a daughter and settled down with a woman named Rosemary, his second wife, who relatives say had always had a crush on him.   But financial troubles followed, and the couple filed for bankruptcy in 1999, according to court documents.   Still, those who claim to know Hernandez offer mixed impressions of his character.   Roberto Monticello, a former SoHo resident who says he knew Hernandez in New York at the time of Etan's disappearance, described him as a ""very strange guy. ""  ""He was always by himself,"" Monticello recalled to CNN affiliate NY1. ""(I) never saw him with people. ""  His pastor, George Bowen, called him a ""very quiet, unassuming, almost shy man,"" who attended church regularly with his wife and daughter, often sitting in the same pew.   ""Every Sunday morning I had a conversation with him,"" said Bowen, who described the interaction as ""more or less a greeting. ""  But the suspect's sister, Norma Hernandez, said their family had for years grappled with the knowledge of her brother's alleged crime.   She says she once walked into a Camden police station in the early 1980s to report the murder, telling authorities that her brother confessed to killing a boy in New York and throwing the body near a dumpster.   But, she says, there's no indication that anything ever came out of that report.   ""You feel like they didn't believe you,"" Norma Hernandez told CNN. ""I was expecting something else. ""  ""Police asked whether I was mad"" at her brother or had an ulterior motive, she said.   Pedro Hernandez allegedly confided in a church prayer group that included members of his family and his then-spiritual adviser, his sister said, telling them of the alleged killing.   Camden police and Tomas Rivera, a leader of the prayer group, declined to comment.   But Lisa Cohen, whose 2009 book, ""After Etan,"" is widely considered the definitive account of the case, said she remains skeptical about the man's confession, widely considered the signature element of his prosecution.   ""I had never heard of Pedro Hernandez before this week,"" she told CNN.   A separate law enforcement source said Hernandez's claims were being treated with ""a healthy dose of skepticism. ""  Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance ultimately gave the green light to file murder charges against Hernandez, despite the absence of forensic evidence, witness testimony and lingering questions over his mental state.

"Unlike her aforementioned reality show judge counterparts, Spears joins the Fox singing competition still riding the success of her seventh studio album, and her worldwide ""Femme Fatale Tour."" Even the star's personal life appears to be more in order these days.   But the pop princess hasn't exactly been accessible to her fans since she was placed in a conservatorship in 2008. And as stars like Lady Gaga and Beyonce have figured out, there's more to being a singing sensation in 2012 than meets the ear.   Fans want to relate to their favorite artists on a personal level, said Andy Greene, an associate editor at Rolling Stone. Becoming a mainstay on a show like ""The X Factor,"" and showing off her personality each week, could reignite the level of fame Spears experienced in the early 2000s, Greene added.   Referencing the way Lady Gaga uses Twitter to stay connected to her fans, which she often calls her ""little monsters,"" Greene said, ""(Gaga) is part of their daily life, while Britney is not. And her handlers are realizing they have to loosen the reins a bit. ""  Even Beyonce has opened up to her fans since the birth of her daughter, Blue Ivy, joining Twitter and giving an intimate glimpse of her offstage life via her Tumblr page.   Though Spears has used social platforms to share pictures of her two sons and announce her engagement to former manager Jason Trawick, she's come off as a sort of ""Stepford"" pop star of late, Greene said. ""She walks around like a robot. People can't relate to that,"" he said. ""This could prove to be a whole new phase of her career. Britney 4.0. ""  And lucky for Spears because, with a reported $15 million contract to appear on ""X Factor,"" this move is likely less about the money than it is about rebuilding her image.   ""Britney off the cuff doesn't exist,"" said Phil Gallo, Billboard's senior correspondent for film and TV. ""It's really been a while since we've heard her give any kind of expansive commentary. ""  To that end, there's a risk involved, because ""the No. 1 dangerous thing that could happen,"" Gallo said, ""is if the artist doesn't appear genuine. You have to feel like that's Britney saying what Britney wants to say. It can't feel scripted, like she has someone in her ear telling her what to say. ""  While ""The X Factor"" played hardball in the ratings game last fall, fluctuating from 8.5 to 12.5 million viewers each week, the singing competition underwhelmed critics thanks to Simon Cowell's prediction that anything less than 20 million in viewers would be unacceptable.   However, with Spears at the judges' table, ratings probably won't be a concern, Gallo said. If the show starts pulling ""Idol""-like numbers, he added, ""it will be driven by, 'What did Britney say?' ' What is Britney going to say?' Out of the gate, that's what it is. ""  Greene agrees people will tune in, if only to hear her talk.   ""If you were a young person between '98 and '07, you find Britney fascinating,"" he said. ""There's just no way around it ... between her craziness and absence. ""  Of course, Greene added, Britney's team probably wouldn't let her on live TV if she couldn't handle it.   ""There's a vote of confidence on Fox's part and Simon Cowell's part and Britney's team's part to say she's ready, and if it goes right, the potential is huge,"" he said. ""The real Britney I used to see is bubbly and funny. It would be nice to see that again. """,human
"Teachers wants additional money to teach the additional hours.   Chicago mayor takes strike fight to court  Q. Why are teachers objecting to evaluations tied to performance?   A. The union says student performance is directly linked to conditions in the home or neighborhood, making it unfair for teachers to be punished if students don't do well in the the classroom for those reasons.   Q. How many jobs will be lost under the evaluation plan?   A. As many as 6,000 teachers could lose their jobs under the evaluation system, according to CTU President Karen Lewis, who has called the system ""unacceptable.""  The mayor's office, the city and school officials have questioned that job-loss figure.   Q. How many school closings are being talked about?   A. The teachers union says 200 schools will be closed, but Marielle Sainvilus, a spokeswoman for Chicago Public Schools, calls the claim ""false,"" asserting that union leaders said recently that 100 schools would close.  ""I'm sure it'll be another number tomorrow,"" she said.   Q. What is the status of the strike?   A. The Chicago Teachers Union will make no decision Monday.  They are taking the day off for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.   Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is vowing to go to court to force teachers back to work, calling Sunday's actions by the union ""a delay of choice that is wrong for our children.""  He announced in a statement that he's asked city lawyers to file an injunction in circuit court to ""immediately end this strike. ""  My view: From the picket lines  Q. What's next?   A. The House of Delegates, a group of 800 union representatives, will reconvene Tuesday afternoon, at which point delegates could decide to end the strike. If they do, classes would resume no earlier than Wednesday.  The rank-and-file of the Chicago Teachers Union would still have the opportunity at some point to accept, or reject, the proposed contract.   But as of Sunday, Lewis said a ""clear majority"" of union delegates did not want to suspend the strike given the proposed contract, saying ""they are not happy with the agreement. ""  Q. How many teachers are in the union and how much do Chicago teachers make?   A. The Chicago Teachers Union represents 26,000 teachers.  Chicago has the nation's third-largest school system with some 35,000 students, and its teachers are among the highest paid in the country. The median base salary for teachers in the Chicago public schools in 2011 was $67,974, according to the system's annual financial report.   Q. What sort of raise are they being offered?   A. The pay structure would change with a 3% pay hike for the first year of the contract, 2% for the second year and 2% for the third year. If a trigger extends the contract to four years, teachers would get a 3% pay increase. Union members would no longer be compensated for unused personal days, health insurance contribution rates will be frozen and the ""enhanced pension program"" is being eliminated.   Q. How is the public reacting to the strike?   A. The reaction is predictably mixed in the pro-union town. Parents have had to juggle work schedules and lay out money for child care, but many remain supportive of the union's action.   Q. What do the presidential candidates have to say?   A. Mayor Rahm Emanuel is President Barack Obama's former chief of staff, but the White House has had little to say about the strike. Unions are a major support base for the Democratic Party.   Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, meanwhile, has tried to make political hay, saying, ""I am disappointed by the decision of the Chicago Teachers Union to turn its back on not only a city negotiating in good faith but also the hundreds of thousands of children relying on the city's public schools to provide them a safe place to receive a strong education.

"""It is unacceptable that children are killed while they play football. Israel hosting the UEFA Under-21 European Championship, in these circumstances, will be seen as a reward for actions that are contrary to sporting values,"" the statement said.   CNN has found no evidence that anyone was killed while playing football. But on November 10 as reported by CNN, four Palestinians were killed when Israeli tank fire hit a building east of Gaza City where mourners were gathered for a funeral, according to Palestinian medical sources. Israel said militants were targeted at several sites after an Israeli Defense Patrol came under attack, wounding four soldiers.   The statement on Kanoute's site adds: ""Despite the recent ceasefire, Palestinians are still forced to endure a desperate existence under occupation, they must be protected by the international community. All people have the right to a life of dignity, freedom and security. We hope that a just settlement will finally emerge. ""  Tel Aviv will host the European Under-21 Championship next June, when eight nations will compete in Israel.   European football's governing body UEFA has already rejected calls to move the tournament from pro-Palestine groups including the disputed territory's football association.   Refugee United: Palestinians debut at Homeless World Cup  ""UEFA is an apolitical organization and (Israel) earned the right to host this competition through a fair, democratic vote,"" UEFA president Michel Platini said in June.   ""I am sure that it will be a beautiful celebration of football that, once again, will bring people together. ""  World football's governing body FIFA also says it does not interfere in countries' political affairs, but said it would help rebuild the stadium in Gaza -- as it did in 2006 following a similar attack.   ""We see it our mandate to rebuild football infrastructure which has been destroyed,"" FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said last week.   ""Football brings people together and we will support any reconstruction necessary when football infrastructure is destroyed through disasters. ""  Palestine: A national soccer team without a nation  Valcke's statement was criticized by Israeli media, which reported that the stadium was used by Hamas militants to fire rockets at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.   Palestine's bid for recognition was boosted last week when the U.N. general assembly voted to upgrade its status to that of a non-member observer state -- a move which was opposed by Israel and the U.S.  ""We came to the United Nations not to confront the U.S. and not to isolate Israel or to discriminate Israel. We came to preserve the two-state solution,"" Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erakat told CNN's Piers Morgan.",human
"Officials said the disruptions resulted in a backlog of of work to get through, cost workers shifts and wages, and caused a negative ripple effect for people up and down the West Coast.   Port of Oakland Executive Director Omar Benjamin suggested the Occupy movement should focus on ""real solutions to the problems plaguing our economy. ""  On a normal night, several hundred people would be working the graveyard shift, port spokesman Isaac Kos-Read told CNN.   ""What has this accomplished?"" he asked. ""This is disrupting the 99%."" The Occupy movement has rallied against what it describes as corporate greed while asserting that the nation's wealthiest 1% hold inordinate sway over the remaining 99% of the population.   Oakland Mayor Jean Quan concurred with Kos-Read, saying the Occupy movement isn't thinking of the consequences of its actions and whom it is actually hurting.   ""They are saying ... they have to get the attention of the ruling class. I think the ruling class is probably laughing and people in this city will be crying this Christmas,"" Quan said. ""It's really got to stop. ""  Oakland has been a flash point of the Occupy movement since October when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown. One demonstrator, a Marine veteran of the war in Iraq, suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile, according to a veteran's group; police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers.   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union -- which represents 15,000 dockworkers -- has distanced itself from the protest movement. The union ""shares the Occupy movement's concerns about the future of the middle class and corporate abuses,"" ILWU President Robert McEllrath wrote to locals last week -- but he urged the movement to stay out of its dispute with the port of Longview, Washington, and warned against ""outside groups attempting to co-opt our struggle in order to advance a broader agenda. ""  In Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, three people claiming ties with the Occupy movement blocked the main door of House Speaker John Boehner office. The men, who said they were in the 120th hour of a hunger strike, sat together with stickers that read ""Taxation without representation"" taped over their mouths.   They said they were demanding full voting rights for residents in the District of Columbia.   Elsewhere, police moved into the Occupy Baltimore encampment at around 3 a.m. Tuesday to remove protesters that had been in McKeldin Square for the last two months, according to CNN affiliate WMAR. Local reports said officers were out in full riot gear, and police cars surrounded the area, but there were no major incidents reported.   Reports showed the city of Baltimore recently denied a permit extension for the camp and cut off its power supply, and that several incidents -- including a stabbing -- had occurred at the encampment recently.   In a statement released Tuesday morning, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said people are free to assemble and demonstrate, but ""our public parks and green-spaces should not be treated as permanent campgrounds."" Rawlings-Blake said her administration will provide ""outreach and assistance"" to the homeless.   Tuesday's actions followed Occupy protests -- and police reactions -- in several cities on Monday.   In Houston, police arrested 20 protesters after dozens of police on foot and on horseback confronted a somewhat larger group of Occupy protesters who blocked an interstate on-ramp, authorities said.   In Long Beach, California, protests caused isolated traffic delays but did not hinder port operations, according to Police Chief Jim McDonnrell, who added that two arrests were made.   About 80 protesters demonstrated outside the gate of San Diego's port Monday but caused no disruption, port spokesman Ron Powell said. Four people who sat down in the road were arrested, he said.   The demonstrations that began Monday in port cities were part of a nationwide Occupy effort in the aftermath of efforts by cities across the country -- including New York, Boston and Oakland -- to clear demonstrators from encampments they had set up in public parks and other locations.   ""We are occupying the ports as part of a day of action, boycott and march for full legalization and good jobs for all to draw attention to and protest the criminal system of concentrated wealth that depends on local and global exploitation of working people, and the denial of workers' rights to organize for decent pay, working conditions and benefits, in disregard for the environment and the health and safety of surrounding communities,"" Occupy organizers said on their website.

"As day broke on Tuesday, four people were killed across Syria, opposition activists said. At least 144 people were reported killed Monday, including 64 who died in a ""horrifying massacre"" at a checkpoint in Homs province.   Those killed at a checkpoint in the Abel area were attempting to flee shelling in the Baba Amr neighborhood in the city of Homs, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists.   ""Reports said security members and thugs kidnapped the women among them,"" the network said in a statement. Residents found 47 corpses in one area and 17 in a second one, it said.   A total of 68 corpses were found in the area, in farmland in western Homs province, said the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, apparently referencing the same incident. The bodies were found after an injured survivor reported the attack, the group said. All the bodies had been either shot or stabbed.   In all, 104 people were killed Monday in Homs, an opposition stronghold, according to the LCC. They included four defected soldiers, three woman and three children.   The deaths came on a day when Syrian officials announced that the nation's new draft constitution received approval and the European Union imposed new sanctions on the country amid ongoing clashes.   The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said earlier explosions rocked Homs and shelling was occurring in Baba Amr. Twenty people were wounded when a large shell struck an anti-government gathering in Homs, the group said.   Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohammed al-Shaar announced that 89.4% of voters approved the draft constitution, and 57.4% of eligible voters cast ballots. President Bashar al-Assad's regime has touted the constitutional referendum as a move toward reform.   Syria announced the referendum amid intense international cries to stop the bloodshed and open its regime to change. But analysts and protesters widely describe the effort as a farce, a superficial attempt to pacify al-Assad's critics.   ""We dismiss it as absolutely cynical. ... Essentially, what he's done here is put a piece of paper that he controls to a vote that he controls so that he can try and maintain control,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said of the referendum and al-Assad.   She cited the ongoing violence in such cities as Homs and Hama and asked: ""How could you possibly have any kind of a democratic process in conditions like that? ""  Aid efforts were under way in the midst of the violence.   The Syrian Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross entered the province of Hama on Monday to provide aid to civilians, said Simon Schorno, spokesman for the Red Cross. A one-month supply of food, along with blankets and hygiene kits, were distributed to 12,000 people, he said.   Beatrice Megevand-Roggo, the Red Cross' head of operations for the Middle East, said a handful of aid workers were also able to go into Baba Amr.   ""There were four ambulances that entered Baba Amr, belonging to the Syrian Red Crescent. They were loaded with medical goods. They indeed were not able to evacuate the two foreign journalists. I don't have the reasons why. They could evacuate an elderly woman, a pregnant woman with her husband,"" she said.   The two journalists Megevand-Roggo was referencing were British photographer Paul Conroy and French reporter Edith Bouvier. Both were wounded in shelling.   Red Cross spokesman Hicham Hassan said aid workers were also not able Monday to recover and evacuate the bodies of two journalists killed in Baba Amr last week.   Marie Colvin, an American journalist who worked for London's Sunday Times, was killed in a shelling attack, along with French journalist Remi Ochlik. Colvin's mother, Rosemarie, said Sunday that aid workers have been trying for days to remove her daughter's body.   CNN and other media outlets cannot independently verify opposition or government reports because Syria has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists. But the vast majority of reports from the ground indicate that government forces are massacring citizens in an attempt to wipe out civilians seeking al-Assad's ouster.   No attempts at getting al-Assad to stop his regime's crackdown on dissidents have stopped the onslaught.   The Council of the European Union agreed Monday on new sanctions regarding Syria after foreign ministers met in Brussels, Belgium, said spokeswoman Susanne Kiefer.   Seven ministers of the al-Assad regime will have their EU assets frozen and will be denied entry into the EU, Kiefer said. In addition, assets of the Syrian Central Bank in the EU will be frozen. Legitimate trade will be allowed to continue, she said, but must be authorized first.   ""Today's decisions will put further pressure on those who are responsible for the ruthless campaign of repression in Syria,"" Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, said in a statement. ""The measures target the regime and its ability to conduct the appalling violence against civilians. As long as the repression continues, the EU will keep imposing sanctions. ""  Elsewhere in Syria on Monday, two people were killed and eight wounded by government shelling on the village of Sarmeen in Idlib province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.   The shelling began Sunday night, and Syrian troops have entered Sarmeen, said Abu Mustafa al-Sayed, a Syrian opposition and community leader in the town of Binnish, also in Idlib province. The Syrian army has Sarmeen surrounded, and communications with the residents have been cut off, he said.   And in Damascus, security forces fired on mourners at a funeral, according to the Local Coordination Committees. Clashes were also occurring in Deir Ezzor, the group said, and 14 students were arrested during a protest at Aleppo University.   The opposition network estimates that 9,000 people have been killed since the government launched its crackdown in March. The Syrian government says that more than 2,000 members of its security forces have been killed by ""terrorists"" during that same period.   Asked Monday whether Syria would be referred to the International Criminal Court, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said, ""I hope the international community reflects on the conditions of referral. ... It's a difficult issue. Syria is not a participating state, so it's up to the Security Council to address this question. They must therefore continue to gather the elements that would permit an eventual referral.

Her comments echoed some she'd made upon arriving Thursday in Belgium, when she said that discussions of ""what sort of data protection do we need and what transparency is there"" should now be on European leaders' agenda.   ""We need trust,..."" she said. ""Spying among friends is never acceptable. ""  Germany: U.S. might have monitored Merkel's phone  U.S. President Barack Obama understands it's a ""necessity"" for change from his nation's perspective, according to Merkel, who spoke with the American leader on Wednesday after Germany's government said it had information the United States might have monitored her phone.   She told Obama that eavesdropping among friends is ""never acceptable, no matter in what situation,"" she said.   On Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney repeated what he said Wednesday -- that Obama assured Merkel that the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor her communications.   And in a USA Today op-ed published online Thursday night, Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco conceded that recent ""disclosures have created significant challenges in our relationships."" To address them, the President has ordered a ""review (of) our surveillance capabilities, including with our foreign partners,"" she wrote.   ""We want to ensure we are collecting information because we need it and not because we can,"" said Monaco.   The German allegation comes in the same week that French daily newspaper Le Monde reported claims the NSA intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in France over 30 days.   And The Guardian newspaper -- citing a document obtained from U.S. government contractor-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden -- reported Thursday that the NSA monitored phone conversations of 35 world leaders. The confidential memo is from 2006, which is before Obama became president. None of the monitored world leaders is identified.   The phone numbers were among 200 handed over to the NSA by a U.S. official, the memo states. Others were encouraged to share their ""rolodexes"" with the agency, according to the document, even though tracking until then had yielded ""little reportable intelligence. ""  Like Carney, NSA spokeswoman Caitlin Haden refused ""to comment publicly on every specific intelligence activity. ""  ""As we have made clear,"" she added, ""... the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations. ""  European leaders push for data protection  It's not clear how well such explanations will be received by Washington's allies in Europe elsewhere, or how significantly it has and will continue to affect the European Council meeting.   The two-day summit was supposed to focus on the digital economy and economic and social policy issues, as well as concerns about EU migration after a recent shipwreck off an Italian island in which hundreds of migrants from Africa died.   But French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told the French National Assembly on Tuesday that France would ask for the question of electronic surveillance to be added to the agenda.   The EU leaders were expected to discuss data protection issues as part of their debate on the digital economy.   Viviane Reding, vice president of the European Commission, called for EU nations to commit to adopting a data protection law in light of the recent spying scandals.   ""Data protection must apply to everyone -- whether we are talking about citizens' e-mails or Angela Merkel's mobile phone,"" she said. ""We now need big European rules to counter big fears of surveillance.   ""At the summit today, Europe's heads of state and government must follow words with action: They should commit to adopting the EU Data Protection Reform by spring 2014. This would be Europe's declaration of independence. Only then can Europe credibly face the United States. ""  'Completely unacceptable'  Even before the latest allegations, Germany and other nations had expressed concerns about alleged U.S. spying after Snowden -- a former National Security Agency contractor -- leaked classified information about American surveillance programs.   Spy chief: reports of NSA logging French phone calls are false  German news magazine Der Spiegel reported in June that leaks from Snowden detailed how the agency bugged EU offices in Washington and New York, and conducted an ""electronic eavesdropping operation"" that tapped into an EU building in Brussels.   Merkel spoke with Obama by phone in July about allegations that the United States was conducting surveillance on its European allies.   Merkel made it clear that if the information about the U.S. having monitored her phone were true, it would be ""completely unacceptable,"" spokesman Steffen Seibert said of Wednesday's call with Obama.   A spokesman for David Cameron declined to answer questions Thursday about whether the British Prime Minister's phone had been tapped by the United States, following Germany's suspicion about U.S. monitoring of Merkel's cell phone.   ""I am not going to comment on matters of security or intelligence,"" the spokesman told reporters at a regular briefing.   Ayrault: 'Shocking' claims  Ayrault described the report of widespread spying by the NSA on French calls as ""worrying"" and ""shocking,"" saying that security should not be guaranteed at the price of a loss of freedom.   Report: U.S. intercepts French phone calls on a 'massive scale'  However, U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper suggested that the claims made by Le Monde were false.   The articles ""contain inaccurate and misleading information regarding U.S. foreign intelligence activities,"" a written statement from his office said Tuesday. It added that the United States does gather intelligence of ""the type gathered by all nations. ""  Nonetheless, the allegations prompted a flurry of diplomatic activity this week between the United States and France.   Obama and French President Francois Hollande spoke about the claims Monday.   ""The President and President Hollande discussed recent disclosures in the press -- some of which have distorted our activities and some of which raise legitimate questions for our friends and allies about how these capabilities are employed,"" a White House statement said.   ""The President made clear that the United States has begun to review the way that we gather intelligence, so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share. ""  Hollande's office said the President expressed his ""deep disapproval with regard to these practices"" to Obama and that such alleged activities would be unacceptable between allies and friends.   The two Presidents agreed that French and American intelligence services would cooperate on investigating the report, according to the statement from the French President's office.   French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also met Tuesday to discuss the claims. The U.S. ambassador to France, Charles Rivkin, was summoned to the French Foreign Ministry in Paris on Monday to discuss the alleged spying.   Claims of U.S. spying, resulting from leaks by Snowden, have also soured U.S. relations with Mexico and Brazil.   Der Spiegel recently published allegations, citing Snowden as its source, that the U.S. National Security Agency ""systematically"" eavesdropped on the Mexican government and hacked the public e-mail account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon.

"A prime example of such skirmishes came last week. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren objected to a GOP provision -- attached to a broad spending bill -- that rolled back a key portion of the Wall Street reform law. Her opposition prompted dozens of Democrats to defect and triggered a last-minute scramble for support; President Barack Obama himself made calls to win lawmakers back and stave off a potential government shutdown.   The spending bill eventually passed the Senate on Saturday night and on Sunday, Democratic leaders downplayed a possible rift within the party.   But the nearly 2,000 progressive activists and operatives who descended on Washington over the weekend for the annual Rootscamp gathering felt otherwise.   Panels addressed things like #HillaryProblems and the lack of understanding between the grassroots and establishment wings of the Democratic Party. And panelists and attendees alike endorsed the newly antagonistic moves from their elected officials this week.   ""How do we make change in general, as we're seeing from the streets of DC to Ferguson to New York? I do think that sometimes you have to shut it down,"" said Alana Krivo-Kaufman, a 27-year-old Rootscamp attendee and an organizer with Jewish Voice for Peace.   And with Republicans taking control of the Senate next month, the imperative for progressives to hold their ground on key issues could grow ever more urgent.   Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former Senate leadership aide, said Republicans have given every indication they'll attempt to use a series of upcoming deadlines, including the need to raise the debt ceiling next year, to peel back Democratic policies passed under Obama.   ""What we saw just now is just a taste of what's to come for two years,"" he said.   Obama's standing within the party diminished  And Democrats no longer feel beholden to their de facto leader — the President — as he enters the final, lame-duck years of his presidency. Some now openly admit he's going to have to navigate a difficult terrain within his own party in the new Congress.   Jeremy Bird, the former national field director for Obama's re-election campaign, told CNN the left is still adjusting to the new political landscape.   ""Everybody's sort of figuring it out, post-midterms, how it's all going to shake out,"" he said of Obama's leadership role among Democrats. ""I'm sure there'll be other disagreements. And it's a different world with a Republican Senate and a Republican House.""   Many progressives are frustrated with what they believe has been too much waffling from the President and other Democratic leaders on the issues that matter most to the base -- behavior they argue contributed to their losses in the midterms.   ""All the Democrats who lost were ones who ran to the center,""  Krivo-Kaufman said, echoing a frequent refrain heard from panelists at Rootscamp.   That frustration has fueled a progressive backlash against the more moderate dealmakers in the party, and is what's made Warren so attractive to so many, her supporters believe.   Erica Sagrans, who heads a grassroots super PAC working to draft Warren to run for President, said the issue with candidates in the midterm was they were ""afraid"" to stand on their principles.   ""We can't have candidates who are afraid to take risks and say what they believe in and stand up for something,"" she said. ""You can't just have these Democrats who are everything to everyone and play things very safe and are picked by party insiders to not offend anyone.""   Sagrans said the watered down soundbites are meaningless to voters, whereas, ""Warren's style of being unafraid of who she is, of being honest, of speaking up"" resonates.   Campaign-trail fallout  The elevation of Warren as a prominent figure in these policy fights, and of Wall Street reform as a key issue for progressives, is certain to put former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a difficult spot as she prepares for a potential presidential bid. More than 300 former Obama campaign staffers signed a letter urging Warren to run for President this week.   Clinton, meanwhile, continues to face skepticism from progressives who believe she's too cozy with Wall Street.   And while Warren has repeatedly said she's not interested in a run, her supporters believe even having her in the mix, and focusing the conversation on Wall Street reform, could help shape Clinton's potential candidacy.   Indeed, the activity surrounding Warren, and the emerging rift within the party, had even Democratic Party officials on Friday predicting a spirited primary battle for the presidential nomination.   ""Regardless of who decides to run, we're gonna have a really competitive and interesting primary process,"" said Matt Compton, the Democratic National Committee's digital director.",human
"Investigations into this have targeted top clubs such as Napoli, and involved a raid on the Italy team headquarters ahead of Euro 2012.   ""This is exactly the type of result which can be achieved when police share information in real time and use Interpol's global network to locate, identify and arrest suspects,"" said the head of the worldwide policing agency, Ronald Noble.   ""The arrest of this suspected match-fixer could not have been achieved without Italy and Singapore's close cooperation with Interpol, nor without a great deal of behind-the-scenes work by prosecutors and magistrates.   ""Those who doubted Singapore's ability or commitment to fight match-fixing and bring those wanted for arrest to justice need to understand that Singapore acts when the evidence exists and is shared and when their laws permit. Singapore and Italy remain two of Interpol's most active and effective member countries. ""  Interpol said Suljic was one of more than 500 fugitives wanted by 59 member countries as part of 2012 Operation Infra-Red -- which has so far led to 130 people being arrested or located.   He is suspected of working for Singaporean businessman Tan Seet Eng, also known as Dan Tan, who is also wanted by Italian authorities.   Italian police said Suljic had ""spent a long period of inaction in Singapore in close contact with other members of the group of this organization, including a well-known Singaporean citizen. ""  Meanwhile, Singapore police said Thursday that four senior officers will go to Interpol's French headquarters in Lyon during the next fortnight to assist in match-fixing investigations.   The force said it hoped to help build ""a concrete case"" against the individuals and syndicates involved.   ""The team aims to collect available information from these countries and seek their assistance to grant us access to evidence, witnesses and/or suspects whom they believe to be involved in the alleged match-fixing cases,"" read a statement.   ""The team will also be exploring avenues to offer our assistance and share available information we have with these affected countries. ""  Match-fixing has been described as a ""disease"" afflicting football by the secretary general of world governing body FIFA.   On Tuesday, Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua was stripped of its 2003 domestic league title and fined $160,000 after a crackdown against such activities.   It was one of 12 clubs involved, along with 33 individuals. Four former China internationals and an ex-World Cup referee were banned for life, having been jailed a year ago for the same offenses.   Interpol's European equivalent Europol has also revealed that 380 matches on the continent are under investigation, including top-level Champions League games.   The international players' union FIFPro said in December that it is planning to launch an online match-fixing ""hotline"" for its members.   On Wednesday, the acting president of the Asian Football Confederation highlighted the need to eliminate match-fixing from the game.   ""We need to admit that match-fixing is a real danger to football's ethical values and needs to be eliminated to preserve the sanctity of the sport,"" Zhang Jilong told delegates at the Interpol conference in Kuala Lumpur.   ""Match-fixing is too complex and widespread for one organization to fight it alone. To fight this, we need a joint and coordinated effort.""   Interpol official Dale Sheehan highlighted the social costs of match-fixing.   ""Criminals can make millions in illicit profits from match-fixing with little risk of being detected and will exploit every opportunity,"" he said at the conference.

"He took the reins in 2000 from Gates, whom he became friends with at Harvard University in the 1970s. Ballmer earned a degree in mathematics and economics.   Gates, of course, didn't graduate. But he seemed to do OK without a degree.   Ballmer's years leading Microsoft were sometimes turbulent ...   When Ballmer took over as CEO, Microsoft was the most valuable company in the world. But the company went on to lose more than half of its market value over the course of a decade.   Investors have been critical of Ballmer for failing to anticipate the mobile computing revolution.   ... but there were also great times.   During Ballmer's tenure,Windows 7 was the fastest-selling operating system of all time, and Microsoft's cloud and enterprise businesses have stayed strong over the past decade.   According to Microsoft, the company tripled its revenue and doubled profits under Ballmer's leadership.   He retired in February and has been spotted at Clippers games since.   He's really animated.   Just watch how he takes the stage for a corporate presentation.   ""Come on! Get up!"" Ballmer screamed at one gathering as he danced and leaped across the floor. ""Whoooooo! Come on! Give it up for me! ""  By the time he took the podium, he barely had enough breath to say, ""I love this company!""   So much so that he's ripped his vocal cords.   Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that Ballmer has damaged his voice during his public displays of affection (for Microsoft).   According to The New York Times, Ballmer once shouted ''Windows! Windows!'' so furiously at a sales meeting in Japan that he ripped his vocal cords, requiring surgery.   He's from Motown but has a soft spot for LA.   Ballmer's dad, Fred Ballmer, was a manager at Ford Motor Co. in Detroit. The son excelled academically there and became valedictorian of his high school class.   But he has reason to cheer for the Clippers.   ""I love basketball. And I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that the Clippers continue to win -- and win big -- in Los Angeles,"" Ballmer said in a statement after making his offer.   ""LA is one of the world's great cities -- a city that embraces inclusiveness, in exactly the same way that the NBA and I embrace inclusiveness. ""  Ballmer wasn't the only bigwig eyeing the Clippers.   A group that included media moguls David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey also made a bid of $1.6 billion for the Clippers, a source told CNN.   This isn't his first time trying to buy an NBA team.   Ballmer's purchase of the Clippers would still have to be approved by 75% of the NBA's 30 owners.   Last year, the owners denied the sale of the Sacramento Kings to a group that included Ballmer. That sale would have resulted in the Kings moving to Seattle, and the league's relocation committee recommended keeping the team in Sacramento.   But with all the talk about changing ownership of the Clippers, Ballmer's fate this time may turn out differently.

"Indeed, it seems there is an international consensus that there is no appetite for Western ""boots on the ground"" (besides a very limited presence to secure national assets).   If there were to be any intervention,  therefore, it seems likely it would take the form of ""targeted strikes"" from the air -- be they via drones, jets or missiles. And we are told that in that case, the focus would be exclusively on ""ISIS strongholds"" in order to ""minimize civilian casualties. ""  Removed from the rhetoric of politicos, though, Western intervention would bolster the propaganda efforts of ISIS, for any attack would inevitably kill or injure Muslim civilians, regardless of how well it had been planned or how good the intelligence behind it was. This would be good news for ISIS.   Indeed, the group actually relies on its ability to attribute civilian casualties to its enemies. By doing so, it bolsters the skewed jihadist narrative of international politics and presents an opportunity to exaggerate the non-existent ""Crusader threat"" and defend the group's false legitimacy.   In short, the more civilians that die, the more events in Iraq can be internationalized, and the wider the appeal of ISIS can become. This effect would be grossly amplified if there were deaths at the hands of the U.S. or the UK.   After all, one of the central tenets of the jihadist narrative is the so-called ""War on Islam."" Through this much abused paradigm, any international involvement in a conflict involving Muslims is used by jihadists to fortify their ever-tenuous relevance in the modern world.   And even were we to set aside all of the above, we still could not in any way justify intervening against ISIS in Iraq but not against Assad in Syria.   Rightly or wrongly, this would be read by the region's most vulnerable as incontrovertible evidence that the West will only intervene when its own economic prosperity is at stake. Why else would it defend the rights of civilians here and not against Assad after his apparent use of chemical weapons?   The West must ignore Baghdad's plea for military assistance. We must not play into the jihadists' hands.   Instead, we must focus on humanitarian assistance for refugees and diplomatic pressure on al-Maliki to force him into profound and far-reaching reforms.   In the long term, the only solution there can be is a political one: Iraq's economically and politically marginalized Sunnis need to be brought back into Iraq's decision-making process.   But even if it is not our place to carry out military action, this is not to say that military intervention is categorically inappropriate. Indeed, if the Iraqi national army cannot pull itself together, I would argue it is absolutely necessary.   However, it must be at the hands of a Sunni Muslim-majority country, in order to diffuse the narrative of Western armed forces once again attacking Muslims. If a country like Turkey or Jordan acts against it, ISIS's ""War on Islam"" rhetoric would not have anywhere near the same impact.   Leaving its operational and strategic capacity to regional players, the West's focus needs to be on ISIS's ideological heart.   We need to undermine its greatest rhetorical asset: that Muslims, worldwide, are under attack by the ""Crusading"" West. This can only be achieved with a policy of restraint.",human
"""It's an outpouring of creative talent,"" exclaimed Douglas Young, a Hong Kong-based designer and entrepreneur, during a recent visit to the protest encampment.   ""Why haven't we seen this before?"" asked Young, who also took care to point out that he was not an active supporter of the protest movement.   Umbrella inspiration  The sit-in has acted as a magnet attracting artists eager to make their voices heard.   The artist known as Milk told CNN his statue was inspired by the image of a protester holding an umbrella to shield a police officer from the rain.   Most of the other images displayed here also riff on the umbrella and the yellow ribbon, two symbols of the protest movement.   Last month, protesters used umbrellas -- an accessory Hong Kongers carry to protect themselves from torrential downpours as well as tropical sun -- to shield themselves from pepper spray fired by police.   Less than 48 hours into the occupation, demonstrators erected a globe-shaped monument out of umbrellas above the traffic circle next to the Legislative Council building. Since then, the streets and sidewalks have been plastered with cartoon-like characters holdings umbrellas, accompanied by slogans calling for democracy, freedom and justice.   One of the posters shows a helmeted police officer with riot shield yelling ""You're such a thug!"" while pointing his finger at an umbrella-toting cartoon that resembles the children's book character Paddington Bear.   The artist who drew the cartoon is a 30-year-old graphic designer Carol Hung.   ""My initial idea was to make people laugh in this heavy atmosphere,"" Hung told CNN.   Hung, who described herself as a political neophyte, said she was inspired to produce a series of protest-inspired drawings after seeing reports of police clashing with protesters on September 28th.   ""At the moment I saw the tear gas, it made me want to support the students,"" Hung said.   Art as 'silent protest'  On a recent afternoon, art teacher Josephine Lau sat in the middle of the highway now occupied by students, painting yellow ribbons onto Chinese paper.  She hoped her posters would prove more durable than previous slogans she had made, which were washed away by rainstorms last week.   ""We can use different media to express ourselves... to tell people what we feel about Hong Kong,"" Lau said. ""I like the peaceful and silent protest and I'm supporting the students behind the scenes. ""  Not far away, 17-year-old Timothy Sun was designing his own posters on the asphalt with the slogan ""GOV YU NO LISTEN TO US?""  ""I want to use my way to show my voice to the public,"" the teenager said.   Post-it politics  Like many others here, Sun said his favorite piece of art at the protest site was actually a colorful piece of work created by thousands of contributors named the ""Lennon Wall. ""  Thousands of pastel post-it notes bearing messages and drawings written by passersby in many languages coat the curved staircase that runs along the outside wall of one of the government office buildings in Admiralty.   Many of the messages profess love for Hong Kong. The wall serves as proof that, despite young Hong Kongers' freedom to digitally post anything they like on social media, there is still a powerful attraction to expressing oneself using old-fashioned paper and ink.   ""This feels very much to me like Twitter, but paper Twitter,"" observed Young, the businessman and art aficionado. ""Old school Twitter, if there's such a thing. ""  Young, who runs a chain of high-end design stores called Goods of Desire, was quickly inspired to add his own post-it message to the wall.  It was an appeal to Hong Kong's beleaguered top official to preserve the post-it monument: ""Mr. Chief Executive, Please don't tear this wall down. ""  ""I see a lot of tenderness, a lot of passion... a lot of imagination, which is fantastic,"" Young said, while gazing out on the largely empty encampment and its fluttering banners and posters.   ""I wonder where that's from?"" he asked. ""I wonder where these people will be after this, when it all ends. ""  Nathan Mauger and Scott Clotworthy contributed to this report.",human
"Alec Gagneux was handing out flyers and speaking softly to interested passers-by.   Of all the criticisms leveled at Davos, its elite nature is the biggest gripe. Like other such pow-wows of the powerful, the lack of access to this minute sphere of massive influence has in past years stirred up visible dissent around the venue itself.   At the height of the Occupy movement in 2012, protesters even camped in igloos near the heavily fortified conference center.   Davos this year was oddly quiet though. Like the bitter cold that can often grip this mountain resort in January, protests were noticeable by their relative absence. There was a small group from Ukraine attempting to draw attention to their predicament on Friday, but little to really catch the eyes of the delegates safely cocooned behind the venue's ring of security.   Gagneux's disparate group had been gathered via the internet, but while they had made it to Davos they were still a long way from the action. ""This is the only thing that was possible,"" Gagneux said. ""It is absolutely taboo to go further towards the center where the people ...are meeting from the World Economic Forum.

""The 2015 goal is to halve extreme poverty,"" he told me, ""but we don't talk about (the fact) that we have to halve extreme riches as well.""   Gagneux's primary concern was for the long term impact of growth. The flyers he handed out quoted the economist Kenneth Boulding: ""Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist. ""  ""The planet is limited,"" Gagneux told me. ""In 30 years or in 70 years we have four times more cars, pollution, resources that are exploited, and future generations' family will have nothing.""   He had been at Davos the entire week, and had been coming to the town for the past 12 years. ""This evening I will make another gathering,"" he told me.   He planned to make what he called a ""thought stone"" representing WEF organizer Klaus Schwab. ""Mr Schwab (is) a very important person in Davos, but actually we are all the same, including the animals and the plants,"" he said.   Why had Gagneux left his protest until the end of the week, and not staged it while the Forum was in full swing, I asked.

"Earlier Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated Libya's transitional leadership on the apparent success of that country's revolution, ushering in a post-Gadhafi era for the North African nation as part of the international body.   ""For Libya, this is a historic day,"" said Ban, who directed that the country's new flag be presented alongside the U.N. flag amid a standing ovation from those in attendance.   The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to accept the credentials of the country's new leadership after rebels last month all but ousted Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi after more than four decades in power.   ""I am sure you saw your new flag this morning, flying so proudly outside this building,"" the U.N. chief said.   The rebuilding of Libya and the Palestinian quest for statehood are expected to be the dominant topics this week as world leaders converge on the United Nations in New York for the 66th annual session of the General Assembly.   On Tuesday, Ban met with Mustafa Abdul Jalil -- head of Libya's ruling National Transitional Council -- to discuss the deployment of a support mission to be run by British diplomat and U.N. envoy Ian Martin.   The mission is thought to largely center on post-conflict planning, with particular focus on security-building and electoral assistance.   But American participation, the U.N. chief says, is instrumental in supporting the new government, noting challenges facing transitional leadership as it confronts pockets of resistance and the specter of Gadhafi, who remains at large.   U.S. President Barack Obama vowed to continue to protect Libyan civilians for as long as they remained threatened by the former regime, pledging to reopen the American embassy in Tripoli later this week.   ""Six months ago, as his tanks approached Benghazi, Gadhafi predicted that his opponents would be slaughtered like rats,"" said U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague. ""But he had not counted on the courage of the Libyan people, the principled stand of the Arab League and the resolve of the international community. ""  Hague said he sought to send to a clear message to the former dictator and his remaining supporters that ""their time is up,"" adding that the unfreezing of Libyan assets will help pay for the country's critical services.   Tuesday's Libya summit at the U.N. General Assembly was billed as an event designed to give world leaders a chance to figure out ways to help Libya rebuild from the battle against their former leader.   The meeting was in stark contrast to two years ago, when Gadhafi gave a rambling General Assembly address where he floated conspiracy theories, urged probes into U.S. military activities and took aim at the structure of the Security Council itself.   Meanwhile, the international body also focused on what it described as an alarming increase in global desertification, and wrapped a two-day meeting on noncommunicable diseases, now the world's leading killer.   It is only the second time a health issue has been debated at a special meeting of the General Assembly, following the group's pledge to take on AIDS a decade ago.   Delegates unanimously approved a ""political declaration"" on Monday, addressing illnesses including cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung diseases and diabetes in developing countries, which often struggle with limited budgets and overwhelmed health care systems.   Also on the plate of U.N. activities this week is an expected address from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who will take the podium Thursday to address recent changes in the Middle East.   His visit marks the seventh time the Iranian president has traveled to New York since he took office in 2005.   Ahmadinejad told Iranian state media on Monday that the U.N. must meet the international community's ""real demands,"" raising questions as to whether the Iranian leader will broach the issue of Palestinian statehood, a lightning-rod topic and the subject of much diplomatic wrangling.   The U.S. has pledged to block a Palestinian membership application should it reach the Security Council, but is likely eager to head-off a scenario that would involve an American veto -- a move widely seen as unpopular in the Middle East.   Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has, however, seemed largely undeterred.   In a speech Friday that appeared both an attempt to manage domestic expectations and push the statehood issue, the Palestinian leader told an audience in Ramallah, ""We are going to the United Nations to attain full membership. ""  He has said the Palestinian territories should be represented by their ""natural borders"" -- with Israel remaining within its 1967 boundaries, which would afford Palestinians the Gaza strip, East Jerusalem and the West Bank.   He called disputed territories inhabited by Israeli settlers ""illegal. ""  On Friday, the body will address the controversial bid.   Abbas is scheduled to speak, and has said after he gives that speech, he will deliver a formal membership application to the U.N. secretary-general.   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who opposes the measure, is scheduled to speak later in the day and has called the move provocative and pushed for a return to the negotiating table.   The Palestinian territories currently have ""observer"" status, meaning delegates can speak in the General Assembly but not vote.   A ""yes"" vote in the General Assembly -- where only a majority vote would be needed -- could afford Palestinians with the status of ""permanent observer,"" similar to the position the Vatican currently holds.   A vote in their favor would be all but assured, meaning they could pursue legal actions against Israel, though analysts suggest that the elevated status could prematurely raise expectations for change in the region.   Hamas, the Palestinian organization that controls Gaza, has warned Abbas against making the request, saying it would show a willingness to acknowledge and negotiate with Israel, which would ""deprive the Palestinian people from their right to come back to their homeland. ""  The five permanent members of the Security Council are the United States, China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom.

""  At 8 p.m. ET Friday, forecasters said Sandy was about 400 miles south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, heading north at 7 mph. It was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph. It's possible, the hurricane center says, that Sandy may weaken to a tropical storm. Nonetheless, experts said, it's not to be taken lightly.   Keep a hurricane preparation checklist  ""Forget about the category with this,"" said CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""When you have trees with leaves on them still, this kind of wind and rain on top of that, you're talking about trees that are going to come down, power lines are going to be out and the coastal flooding situation is going to be huge.""   Sandy's death toll in Haiti, Jamaica and Cuba this week was 21 people.   The U.S. target area is hard to predict at this point. Some landfall computer models show the storm striking somewhere between the border separating North Carolina and Virginia north to Connecticut, some of the most densely populated areas of the country. The District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and New York have declared states of emergency, while Maine's governor signed a limited emergency declaration.   The National Hurricane Center reported tropical storm watches and warnings were in effect, covering parts of the Florida and Carolina coasts.   With a national election already under way in many early-voting states, Sandy's wrath could have a ripple effect on politics.   In Virginia Beach, a campaign rally scheduled for Sunday for GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was canceled because of Sandy. There was no word yet on the status of other events scheduled later in the week. ""We're keeping an eye on it,"" said a senior campaign adviser.   How Sandy was dubbed 'Frankenstorm'  Similarly, Vice President Joe Biden canceled his visit to Virginia Beach on Saturday, ""out of an abundance of caution to ensure that all local law enforcement and emergency management resources can stay focused on ensuring the safety of people who might be impacted by the storm,"" according to the campaign of President Barack Obama.   Bad weather in Maryland or Washington, D.C., could make it harder for people to get out and cast their ballots. Early voting kicked off Monday in Washington and is scheduled to start Saturday in Maryland. But Friday, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley warned that his state's early voting could be affected by the pending storm, leaving open the possibility that the vote could be rescheduled, or relocated.   U.S. residents in Sandy's path, forecasters said, should prepare for the possibility of several days without power.   ""There is potential for widespread power outages, not just for a couple of days but for a couple of weeks or more, if the storm stays on track,"" said meteorologist Kathy Orr of CNN affiliate KYW-TV in Philadelphia. The computer weather predictions are murky, but by Friday afternoon, it seemed unlikely the storm would bring freezing rain or snow to the coast. Snow is possible in mountain areas, including the Appalachians.   Sandy could be a storm ""of historic proportion,"" Orr warned, and the City of Brotherly Love could take a direct hit.   In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is studying whether it should suspend all or some service ahead of the storm, according to Mayor Michael Bloomberg.   In Maryland, the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company expects that several hundred thousand customers could be affected, as early as Sunday.   ""This could be like the 'Perfect Storm' 21 years ago,"" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers.   A combination of three weather systems produced the famed ""Perfect Storm"" in the north Atlantic over Halloween 1991, when moisture flung north by Hurricane Grace combined with a high pressure system and a cold front, according to the weather service.   Hurricane safety: When the lights go out  The current weather conditions are not exactly the same as what produced the tempest. Although Grace contributed significantly to the storm, it did not progress to New England and did not make landfall, weather records show.   On Friday, residents in South Jersey were already stocking up on batteries and bottled water, and hardware stores have put up preparedness displays, KYW reported. One location quickly sold out of electric generators.   ""This is the worst timing for a storm,"" Newark Mayor Cory Booker told CNN's Soledad O'Brien. ""You have fall ending, a lot of loose branches.   ""The storm itself will be bad, but I worry about the aftermath, people being caught without power. ""  Along the Jersey shore, storm preparations included bulldozers shoring up piers with mounds of sand. Worried residents filled sandbags in case of flooding.   'Superstorm' meets barnstorm as weather and politics collide  ""We will be piling up as much sand as possible along the beachfront,"" said Frank Ricciotti, Margate, New Jersey, public works director. ""I think the water damage is worse than another type of damage, and the hardest thing is to stop water, once it starts coming up.""  Farther south, in the Norfolk, Virginia, area, more than two dozen ships were being sent to sea for their own protection.   Strong winds whipped Florida, where CNN iReporter Simon Davis shot video of an overcast Melbourne Beach.   ""I was surprised at just how intense it was for a storm so far off the coast. I was thinking, wow and this is going north? Scary,"" he wrote.   Miami International Airport on Friday canceled more than 20 flights to or from Jamaica or Bahamas, CNN affiliate WSVN reported. Nearby Fort Lauderdale airport canceled 13 flights to the islands.   Stay well-fed in any disaster  CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.",human
"Her attorney, Brett McArthur, told CNN Tuesday night that Rogers had agreed as part of an arrangement to turn herself in, in exchange for a personal recognizance bond.   ""She did not have to post any money"" to be released, McArthur said, adding that his client pleaded not guilty to the charge of lying to police.   ""She maintains her innocence. This has been kind of a kick in the gut as a victim to turn around and be charged,"" McArthur said.   In a news release, police cited DNA and pathologists' examinations that did not substantiate Rogers' original statements, and changes in her story during the investigation.   ""These were serious allegations that garnered national attention and spread fear among local citizens,"" the police statement said. ""A great deal of time and resources were spent investigating Charlie Rogers' claims in hopes of identifying and arresting the three suspects in this case.""  Beth Rigatuso, president of Heartland Pride based in Omaha, organized a vigil that attracted over 1,000 people in the aftermath of the reported attack.   For her, the news that it may have been a hoax is ""a pretty big blow. ""  ""I don't feel betrayed as much as I feel sad for how, if this is really true...there is a lot of things going on with her,"" Rigatuso said. ""It leads to a bigger problem in our society that someone would do this. ""  Rigatuso said she hopes people would not turn their backs on Rogers now.   The vigil she put together in Omaha raised more than $1,800, all of which was deposited in an account for Rogers.   ""We'd like to get the funds returned to us so we can establish our own fund to support victims of anti-gay violence."" Rigatuso said Tuesday.   McArthur, Rogers' attorney, said he ""knows nothing"" about the fund or how much money might be in it. He said it was in place before he became Rogers' lawyer.   According to the Lincoln Police Department complaint, Rogers, 33, provided information ""she knew to be false"" with the intent to ""instigate an investigation of an alleged criminal matter. ""  Rogers reported to police that she was lying on her bed when the alleged attackers held her down and carved ""derogatory words"" into her arms and abdomen and ""a cross"" in her chest. She told police she was then rolled onto her stomach where more cuts were made.   But according to a deposition from Lincoln police investigator Lynette Russell filed as part of the complaint, Rogers bedspread was ""evenly placed on the bed and no apparent sign of a struggle."" A DNA lab test found no evidence of blood on the bedspread.   Russell also described a pair of white gloves found at the scene that Rogers had said were not hers.   ""Ms. Rogers DNA profile was the major contributor to the DNA located on the inside of the gloves,"" Russell said.   Furthermore, the deposition said, the FBI sent photos of Rogers' cuts to a forensic pathologist, who believed the wounds to be self-inflicted.   ""This opinion is based partially on the fact that the cuts appeared superficial and symmetrical, avoided sensitive areas of the body,...are accessible to the victim and follow the victim's frame of reference for reading and writing,"" the deposition said.   Rumors had been circulating in recent weeks in Lincoln and on the Internet due to the fact that police had yet to pinpoint any suspects. The urge to respond to rumors prompted Rogers to give her one and only interview.   ""For people to think this doesn't happen here, it does,"" Rogers told CNN affiliate KETV on July 27. ""It did. ""  She refused to discuss the incident itself during that interview.   Rogers' attorney at the time, Megan Mikolajczyk, told CNN her client was ready for a full interview early last week, but canceled saying ""things have changed. ""  Mikolajczyk said Tuesday that she is no longer Rogers' attorney.   According to neighbor Linda Rappl, Rogers' showed up on her doorstep bloodied in the early morning hours immediately following the alleged attack last month.   ""I was in shock,"" Rappl said soon after the incident. ""She was naked, her hands were tied with zip ties. All I could see was a cut across her forehead and blood running down. ""  Rappl said she took the sobbing Rogers inside and wrapped her in a blanket before calling 911.",human
"Bang.   Nawroz falls to the ground.   Two more shots ring out.   The warlord ordered the man to pull the trigger twice, but he kept on, unable to deliver a swift fatal shot.   ""Stop shooting, you donkey,"" the spectators say.   ""He's still alive,"" says one.   But not for long.   This is not a video taken before 2001, in the days when the Taliban ruled and Kabul's stadium was reserved not for soccer, but public executions. It's from last month.   After a decade of the U.S.-led war to defeat extremism in Afghanistan, feudal justice still exists.   In remote Kand, outside the reach of NATO or the Afghan government, warlord Mullah Mustafa and his men rule by the gun. Mustafa helps keep the Taliban at bay, the people say, so the government lets him run his own fiefdom.   It's not the sort of compromise the United States imagined a decade ago, bringing a type of justice that's swift and brutal.   Human Rights Watch has said that in large parts of Afghanistan, no formal judicial system is in place and only tribal and other customary forms of justice are practiced.   And a scathing report issued last year by the International Crisis Group described Afghanistan's judicial system as being ""in a catastrophic state of disrepair.   ""A growing majority of Afghans have been forced to accept the rough justice of Taliban and criminal power brokers in areas of the country that lie beyond government control. ""  The report went on to say that the United States has not paid the same attention to justice reform as it has to other aspects of nation building.   ""Its investment in judicial institutions is modest, as opposed to the billions invested in standing up the Afghan army and police,"" the report said.   The U.S. Agency for International Development allocated only 1% of its Afghanistan budget between 2002 and 2007 -- $64 million -- to supporting the establishment of rule of law, the report said.   Human rights monitors have pressed President Hamid Karzai's government to prioritize the establishment of a professional judiciary. But Nawroz's execution is more evidence that Afghanistan has a long way to go.   There have been other cases that have sparked outrage.   In 2006, Abdul Rahman was arrested and threatened with death for converting to Christianity. Last year, the Taliban ordered the first public executions by stoning since their fall from power -- a young couple who had eloped died in horrific fashion.   Jalaludin, who witnessed Nawroz's execution, said Mustafa gathered local mullahs to reach a verdict according to sharia, or Islamic law.   ""The mullahs asked the father to forgive Nawroz and to take some of his family's land and women in compensation,"" he said. ""But the father refused, so the mullahs ordered an execution. ""  Nawroz tried to buy his release, but Mustafa refused, Jalaludin said. He's not one to take bribes.   After the killing, Nawroz first said he had been helped by his cousins, according to Abdul Gafor, one of Nawroz's cousins.   ""For that reason, we were interrogated and beaten a lot during the questioning,"" Gafor said.   But later, when questioned by Mustafa, Nawroz changed his story and said he had killed alone, Gafor said.   Another cousin, Sikander, wished for law and order.   ""We'd like strong government,"" he said. ""There's no police or government presence here, and Mullah Mustafa has government contacts. ""  Nawroz was a man whose jealousy allegedly led him to kill the man married to his lover. It's a story that has played out countless times in countless places. But here, in Kand, there was no trial, no jury of peers. Nawroz's punishment was strictly an eye for an eye, meted out in frightful fashion.

"In remarks to business leaders on Wednesday, Obama said Boehner and Republicans have to take the first step.   ""I think there is recognition that maybe they can accept some rate increases as long as it is combined with serious entitlement reform and additional spending cuts,"" the president said. ""And if we can get the leadership on the Republican side to take that framework, to acknowledge that reality, then the numbers actually aren't that far apart. ""  He added that ""we can probably solve this in about a week -- it's not that tough. ""  The statements reflected how negotiations on the automatic spending cuts and tax hikes set to occur on January 1 -- the fiscal cliff -- have evolved since Obama's re-election, and Democratic gains in both houses of Congress, last month.   Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told CNBC Wednesday the Obama administration is ""absolutely"" prepared to go off the fiscal cliff ""if there's no prospect to an agreement that doesn't involve those rates on the top 2%.""   Republicans opposed to any new revenue in their quest to shrink government now realize Obama's victory and public support for the president's campaign theme of higher taxes on the wealthy leave them with little negotiating leverage.   Read more: The road to fiscal cliff paved with good intentions  Less than four weeks from the fiscal cliff, GOP leaders face a choice: Agreeing to Obama's demand to hold down tax rates on most Americans while allowing higher rates on top earners, or being blamed for everyone's taxes going up in 2013.   Polls show that more Americans will blame Republicans, instead of Obama and Democrats, if there is no deal and the nation goes over the fiscal cliff. A Washington Post/Pew Research Center survey released Tuesday put the margin at 53%-27% in citing Republicans or Obama. A CNN/ORC International poll released last week showed 45% would blame congressional Republicans compared to 34% who would hold Obama responsible.   Economists warn that the fiscal cliff's automatic tax hikes and spending cuts would invite recession.   Republican Sen. Tom Coburn, a leading deficit hawk, said Wednesday that to avoid the crisis, he would support higher tax rates on wealthier Americans as part of a broader deal with Obama and congressional Democrats.   Homes, cars, jobs: Americans already making big decisions over fiscal cliff  ""I know we have to raise revenue,"" the senator from Oklahoma told MSNBC. ""I don't really care which way we do it. Actually, I would rather see rates go up than do it the other way, because it gives us a greater chance to reform the tax code and broaden the base in the future. ""  Despite the public stance softening of some Republicans in each house, signs point to a continuing standoff. Obama and Boehner spoke on the phone Wednesday afternoon, for the first time in a week, according to a source familiar with the call. But the source said the conversation didn't lead to any breakthrough. And moving forward, no formal negotiating sessions are known to be scheduled, and congressional aides say no back-channel discussions are taking place.   The House is scheduled to adjourn for the year on December 14, but Boehner's number two, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, said Wednesday the chamber would remain in session until a fiscal cliff deal gets reached.   Read more: Americans make big choices over fiscal cliff  And Boehner said, ""I'll be here and I'll be available at any moment to sit down with the president to get serious about solving this problem. ""  Obama demands that the House immediately pass a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year while allowing rates to return to higher Clinton-era levels for wealthier households.   Democrats, including the president, argue that both sides agree that the 98% of Americans making less than $250,000 a year should avoid a tax hike when the tax cuts from the Bush administration expire on December 31. They call for the House to guarantee that outcome by passing the Senate measure now.   Once that happens, Obama and Democratic leaders promise, they will work out compromises on other spending cuts sought by Republicans to reduce the deficit, such as reforms to the Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs.   The latest proposal from House Republicans could reduce the nation's chronic federal deficits by $2.2 trillion over 10 years.   The GOP proposal includes $800 billion from tax reform, $600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings and $600 billion in other spending cuts, House Republican leadership aides said. It also pledges $200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index, a measure of inflation.   While the Republicans gave ground by calling for more revenue through tax reform, the plan only mentioned unspecified elimination of some deductions and loopholes.   Jason Furman, an assistant to Obama on economic policy, told reporters Wednesday that the president wants to ensure additional revenue from higher taxes on the wealthy now to help avoid the fiscal cliff. He described the Republican proposal for more revenue as lacking specifics.   ""Tell us what it is. Show us a score,"" Furman said. ""Tell us how it locks in revenue because you're trying to actually pass a bill this year, not engage in some long process around tax reform, which we don't have time to do by the end of this year. ""  Opinion: Millionaires' tax bracket would be a smart compromise  While some Republican senators have blasted the House proposal, others have signaled a willingness to use it as a starting point.   Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, a senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said he would support Boehner's plan to raise revenue, but only if there is a ""willingness on the part of Democrats to accept spending cuts that are three-to-one or four-to-one.""   While the White House has made clear Obama will veto any measure that fails to increase tax rates on the wealthy, aides have signaled a possible willingness to negotiate the specific rate increase.   In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Obama said lower tax rates for the wealthy could be negotiated as part of broader tax reform in 2013, but only after those rates increase now.   Obama's deficit-reduction plan would increase taxes by almost $1 trillion over 10 years, a significant portion of a $4 trillion overall deficit-reduction goal.   It also would close loopholes, limit deductions, raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends.   The Obama plan includes $50 billion in stimulus spending for programs intended to create jobs, such as repairing roads and bridges.   Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil.   The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes without action.

"But the top players in the country at that time, 80% of them didn't just come from the same town or the same suburb, but from the very same street.   Olympic goal: A swimmer's story  ""There hadn't been a genetic mutation -- we happened to have the best coach who gave us access to the only 24-hour club.   ""So we practiced before school, after school, at weekends, on holidays. Over many years, we transformed ourselves from perfectly ordinary players into world-class players.""  So does practice in itself make the world's top athletes perfect? Not necessarily, according to mental performance coach Andy Barton.   ""Practice doesn't make perfect,"" he says. ""You only have to think of your handwriting for instance, how as you get older the more you write the worse you get.   ""Only perfect practice will make perfect. To improve you have to be very specific about what you are aiming to do and target it. ""  It is a view supported by Syed, who suggests that the willingness of top athletes to push themselves further and further in practice pays dividends when it comes to high-pressure competition.   ""It's interesting, for example, that world-class ice dancers fall over more often in practice than intermediate ice dancers, which sounds paradoxical,"" he said.   ""The reason is they are always pushing themselves, they are attempting jumps that are at the outer limits of their capabilities. It's a branch of science called 'epigenetics' -- the brain is re-wired as we practice. ""  Once athletes have meticulously honed their skills, they should, in theory, have all the tools at their disposal to achieve success. But in high-pressure situations, even the greatest can crumble.   What causes a footballer to crack under the nail-biting strain of a penalty shootout? Or a tennis star to fall apart at match point?   ""The problem when you're under pressure is you're so nervous you start thinking consciously about the shot you are playing,"" Syed says.   ""You are intruding upon your subconscious competence, and that is what triggers the choking response. ""  So how can Olympians preparing for London 2012 ensure they are mentally ready to challenge for gold? Barton suggested that imagining the crowning moment is almost as important as physically training for it.   ""The thing about when we mentally rehearse something vividly, it actually fires up the same neurology in the brain as if we were really experiencing it. So on a certain level the mind cannot differentiate between a vividly-imagined experience and reality.   ""What we need to do is to create our own realities in our heads so you can imagine yourself in that Olympic final, for instance, performing how you want to perform.   ""The more you actually do that, the more your body and mind get used to it, so when you come to the real thing, you're more prepared. ""  So the next time you find yourself daydreaming of sprinting to 100 meters gold, don't dismiss it -- it might just be vital preparation for your future Olympic success.",human
"Brown's attorney, Shannon Jones, says that her client signed the waiver but didn't quite understand it.   Soon after the girl was born, Brown -- a U.S. Army soldier -- headed off on a 1-year deployment. It was then that the baby moved on as well, to the Charleston, South Carolina, home of Matt and Melanie Capobianco.   It was an open adoption, family friend Jessica Munday said. That meant the girl's birth mother could and did maintain a relationship with the girl.   But Brown, the biological father, wasn't on board. Four months after Veronica's birth, he began legal proceedings seeking custody of her.   ""My client has been fighting for custody of his daughter since shortly after her birth,"" Shannon Jones, Brown's Charleston-based lawyer, said by e-mail. ""He loves this child with all his heart. ""  Brown appeared to win that battle late last year. On New Year's Eve, he arrived in South Carolina, picked up Veronica from her adoptive parents, and headed west to his home in Oklahoma.   ""It's awful,"" Matt Capobianco said days later to CNN affiliate WCIV. ""Everyone keeps saying how bad they feel for us. But, I mean, she's a 2-year-old girl that got shoved in a truck and driven to Oklahoma -- with strangers. ""  Key to Brown's case is a 1978 federal law called the Indian Child Welfare Act.   Its aim is to ""promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and Indian families by the establishment of minimum federal standards to prevent the arbitrary removal of Indian children from their families and tribes and to ensure that measures which prevent the breakup of Indian families are followed in child custody proceedings. ""  Brown is enrolled in the Cherokee Nation, a ""federally-recognized government"" of Indians that has ""inherent sovereign status,"" based near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. That means young Veronica has Indian blood, as well.   Chrissi Ross Nimmo, assistant attorney general for the Cherokee Nation, says that the protections inherent in the Child Welfare Act are clear and important. Applied as she sees it, Brown -- as an Indian and the biological father of Veronica -- is entitled to custody of the girl.   ""There's a placement preference. If children are removed by the state or if they're placed in private adoption, the first preference is for a family member,"" Nimmo told CNN affiliate KOTV.   Others disagree. CNN legal analyst Avery Freedman, for one, said the law was misused in this case.   ""It's a wonderful law which seeks to protect the integrity of ... Native American families,"" she said. ""But it cannot be used as a bludgeon to destroy existing families. ""  Jones insists that Brown ""would still be entitled to custody of his daughter under South Carolina law. ""  ""It is important to understand that the Indian Child Welfare Act was not used as a loophole in this action,"" the lawyer said.   Whatever the legal arguments, the emotions are still raw. The Capobiancos have spoken to Veronica once since she left, on New Year's Day.   ""She said, 'Hi Mommy! Hi Daddy! She sounded really excited to hear us. And she said, 'I love you!' numerous times,"" Melanie Capobianco told WCIV.   She added that her husband felt like he'd failed as a father, sending her off with people she didn't know and not knowing what the little girl must think of them and the whole situation.   Melanie Capobianco said she is worried about what's next, and how Veronica is getting through each day and night.   ""We just wish we could be there, if she was afraid,"" she said.",human
"In 2006, the number was 1 in 110, and the newest data -- from 2008 -- suggests 1 in 88 children have autism.   Read the CDC report (PDF)  Boys with autism continue to outnumber girls 5-to-1, according to the CDC report.  It estimates that 1 in 54 boys in the United States have autism.   Mark Roithmayr, president of the advocacy group Autism Speaks, says more children are being diagnosed with autism because of ""better diagnosis, broader diagnosis, better awareness, and roughly 50% of 'We don't know.' ""  He said the numbers show there is an epidemic of autism in the United States.   Early recognition of signs of autism -- a neurodevelopment disorder that leads to impaired language, communication and social skills -- is vital because it can lead to early intervention, says Dr. Gary Goldstein, an autism specialist and president of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore.   ""There have been studies -- double-blinded studies -- to show that behavioral early intervention changes the outcome for children,"" Goldstein says.   Roy Sanders and Charlie Bailey sensed something was wrong with their son Frankie Sanders when he was 9 months old.   ""Our pediatrician at the time who was a friend of ours tried to tell us that we were being too cautious, we were being too anxious,"" Sanders says.   Frankie's pediatrician thought his parents were seeing developmental delays that weren't really there. But Frankie wasn't talking, Sanders says. ""He didn't have speech; he didn't have any communication skills at all. He didn't point. He would flap quite a bit. He would stare at fans; he would stare at lights; he would become frantic if he didn't have a Thomas the [Tank] Engine because he was obsessed with Thomas the [Tank] Engine.

""The earlier kids are detected, the earlier they could get services, and the less impairment they'll have on their learning and in their lives on a long-term basis is our best understanding.""   The CDC is working with the Academy of American Pediatrics to recommend that children get screened for autism at ages 18 months and 24 months, Frieden says.   CDC: What you should know about autism  However, according to the CDC report, most children were diagnosed between ages 4 and 5, when a child's brain is already more developed and harder to change.

""How much of that increase is a result of better tracking and how much of it is a result of an actual increase, we still don't know.

"A judge ruled Wednesday that the officers will stand trial in the beating death last July of Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man afflicted with schizophrenia.   Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. Officer Manuel Ramos faces the more serious charge of second-degree murder, because prosecutors believe he took a more active role in the assault. Both officers have pleaded not guilty.   This week, at the preliminary hearing to determine whether enough evidence supports proceeding with a trial, prosecutors aired a graphic video of the savage beating. The footage shows about a half dozen officers punching and kicking and putting pressure on Thomas' chest, firing electric shocks from a Taser stun gun, all to supposedly subdue a suspect well beyond the point where he is resisting or capable of resisting arrest.   Early on, Ramos appears to tell the young man who is sitting on the ground: ""You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up!"" Another police officer is heard saying: ""We ran out of options so I got to the end of my Taser and I ... smashed his face to hell. ""  By the end of the video, Thomas is lying in a pool of blood. According to prosecutors, the young man suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, broken ribs and extensive bruises and abrasions. He died five days later.   What we see in that 33 minutes of footage, including a defenseless Thomas screaming in pain, saying he's sorry and pleading for help, should never happen in the United States of America. When it does happen, it can't be tolerated, justified, or excused.   That's coming from the son of a retired cop. My father wore a badge for 36 years, and he has no stomach for police brutality. In fact, about 20 years ago, when another piece of videotape surfaced -- that of the Rodney King beating by police officers in 1991 -- I remember my father telling me that, as far as he was concerned, those out-of-control law enforcement officers wailing on King had ceased being cops and become little more than thugs and criminals.   As it turns out, Thomas' father is also a retired law enforcement officer. After his son died, Ron Thomas made it his mission to make sure the story got out and would not be forgotten. He used social media and the Internet to show the world what those officers had done to his son, complete with graphic photos that he took at the side of Kelly Thomas' hospital bed.   This is a good dad. But he was also, apparently, a good cop who trained fellow deputies on the right way to take down suspects. This is the wrong way. Thomas described the officers' actions as nothing less than a ""hate crime against the homeless and mentally ill.""   Last year, Fullerton city officials offered Thomas nearly a million dollars to settle the case. He turned it down, and instead pushed for a criminal trial.   This should bring some small comfort to Ron Thomas. He needs it. He has to carry around with him for the rest of his life that, as his son was fighting for his life, he cried out for his father to protect him from these bullies. On the video, we hear Kelly Thomas screaming: ""Daddy, help! They're killing me!"" As a father myself, those words break my heart.   ""Daddy, help! They're killing me!""   He was killed. And now, if the cops are convicted of this crime, they have to pay.",human

""But no matter what I would never leave Bali, because I can surf amazing waves all-year-round and you can't do that anywhere else. ""  Her dad was a renowned local surfer, but he wasn't so keen when she said she wanted to follow in his footsteps.   So the 12-year-old went behind his back and learned from her uncle instead. Two years later, she made a name for herself at a local talent contest and earned a sponsorship deal.   The middle of three sisters, Rahayu says surfing has given her an identity.   Unlike her father, who had to give up the sport to support the family, she has been able to combine competing with her university studies thanks to funding from Rip Curl -- one of surfing's major brands.   ""I feel so lucky. No-one from Bali can surf. I don't want to be like any other girls,"" she says. ""I feel great because I can do something different. Everything in my life now is about surfing. ""  Rahayu's major breakthrough came when she won a bronze medal for Indonesia at the 2008 Asian Beach Games, which were held in Bali.   ""I met the president, had an interview with him and we talked a lot,"" she recalls.   ""It was really cool. And my mom and my dad were proud of me, and my name was in every newspaper. ""  The silver medal winner that year was Yasniar Gea. From the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, she has gone on to become the most successful female Indonesian surfer.   Rahayu competes against Gea on the Asian Surfing Tour, but says her biggest inspiration comes from women riding on the world stage -- such as leading Australians Stephanie Gilmore and Sally Fitzgibbons, and Hawaii's Carissa Moore.   Joining them is still a pipe dream; she acknowledges she has yet to pay her dues on the Asian circuit.   ""I want to win this tour. I want to focus on that -- it's my dream,"" Rahayu says.   ""I'm not going to Europe yet, but I will. And I want to go to Australia, maybe next year. ""  But wherever she ends up, there's no place like home -- where already she's inspiring young girls to take up surfing.   ""It feels so amazing, because now young girls are surfing and then taking pictures with a hashtag, and then just following me,"" she says.   ""It's really good to get more girls surfing in Indonesia. I'm just trying to keep encouraging everyone to get in the water and enjoy life. """,human
"""But (the source of the noise) is just as likely to be a natural event. ""  Low frequency signals can travel thousands of miles through water under favorable circumstances, at about 1 mile per second, Duncan said. But ""at the moment (the sound) appears to be inconsistent with other data about the aircraft position,"" he said.   That's because researchers at Curtin University believe the sound came from an area thousands of miles to the northwest of the current search area in the southern Indian Ocean. And even then, they haven't been able to pinpoint the source.   Duncan says his team has calculated an ""uncertainty box"" for the signal's origin. It's area that stretches some 2,485 miles in length from southeast to northwest across the Indian Ocean, and spans some 124 to 186 miles in width at its widest point.   The center of the long, narrow box is south of the tip of India, as shown in a map released Wednesday.   The university on Wednesday released an audio clip captured by one of the listening devices, off of Perth. Duncan says his team has sped up the recording 10 times to make it audible to the human ear.   It also shared charts of acoustic signal plots showing what various devices detected.   Searching in the right place?   The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight continues to focus along an arc hundreds of kilometers long, the area where investigators believe the Boeing 777 ran out of fuel, about 1,000 miles off the coast of Western Australia.   Martin Dolan, the chief commissioner with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the organization leading the search into MH370 at the request of Malaysia, says an international team of experts continues to review the analysis of Inmarsat satellite data and aircraft performance.   In a television exclusive, Dolan told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" he remains confident the final resting place of MH370 is somewhere along that arc, the so-called ""partial handshake"" with the satellite:  ""We've seen all the data. We've seen all the calculations. We are reviewing the calculations and are also developing our own model to cross check and verify that information,"" Dolan told Burnett.   When asked last week about the underwater sound being analyzed by the team at Curtin University, along with Geoscience Australia, a government agency, Dolan was skeptical.   ""We think that those detections may have been interesting from the point of view of the direction they came, but other characteristics make it unlikely that they are associated with MH370,"" he said. The ATSB first referenced these signals in a document posted on its website on May 26.   Listening below the surface  As was the case with the Inmarsat satellite -- a communications satellite whose data was analyzed by Malaysia Airlines MH370 investigators as a navigational aide -- the analysis of the underwater signals involves the use of technology for a different purpose than its original intent.   One of the devices, operated by Curtin University and located some 12 miles off Perth, is designed to listen to whales and other marine life. The other is for signs of underwater nuclear explosions, one of 11 operated worldwide by the U.N.-chartered Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) as part of the International Monitoring System.   Early in the search for Malaysia Flight 370, the United Nations reported it had not detected any explosions or plane crashes on land or water from its sensors around the globe. But the recent efforts involve pairing CTBTO data with other sources to see what can be gleaned, officials said.   ""One can always be hopeful,"" said Mark Prior, a seismic acoustic analyst with the CTBTO.   The CTBTO's hydro-acoustic stations detect low frequency sound in the 0-100 Hz range, and can't detect black box ""pings"" in the 30-40 kHz range, officials said. ""It's possible (to detect a plane crash), but the circumstances that would allow it would have to be very particular,"" said Prior.   Prior said some of those circumstances might include a sloping sea bed. Another possible scenario: the origin of the sound would need to be near the listening device.   The CTBTO's system near Cape Leeuwin, the southwestern-most point of Australia, regularly captures signals of ice breaking noise from Antarctica and seismic activity from Indonesia, he said. ""There are other scenarios that would allow (the hydrophones to detect a crash). But it's not certain if there was an impact we would detect it,"" Prior said.   Attempts were made following the 2009 crash of Air France 447 in the southern Atlantic Ocean to see if underwater listening devices had detected the plane's impact. No data could be found.   Years later, after the plane was located, CTBTO again checked its data, and still was not able to identify signals related to the crash.",human
"Is this latest round of provocations under his son and successor, Kim Jong Un, simply more of what we've seen before?   Not necessarily, argue some of those closely familiar with North Korea. They warn that under Kim Jong Un's rule, Pyongyang has shown an even greater willingness to raise the stakes, whether it be the multiple missile launches over the past several weeks, the way it stoked a crisis last spring when it announced it had ended the 1953 Korean Armistice Agreement and moved intermediate missiles to its east coast, or its warning that foreign companies and tourists in South Korea should evacuate.   South Korea investigates two suspected North Korea drones  More recently, in the U.S. intelligence community's annual worldwide threat assessment, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned that North Korea had ""expand(ed) the size of its Yongbyon enrichment facility and restart(ed) the reactor that was previously used for plutonium production"" but was shut down in 2007.   ""The regime still acts in a very belligerent manner, but it seems less predictable, and more random,"" said Christian Whiton, deputy envoy to North Korea during the George W. Bush administration.   Timeline: North Korea nuclear program  The younger Kim (and young is the right word -- he is still only 31) took office in December 2011, amid questions over how much control he really has over the levers of power, including the country's military of more than 1 million people.   Since then, North Korea has faced additional international sanctions after the launch of a long-range rocket in December 2012, a move that it followed up with the country's third nuclear test, in February 2013.   ""The timing and the intensity of North Korea's provocations (since Kim Jong Un took office) clearly demonstrates a high tolerance for risk,"" said Ellen Kim, assistant director of the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   ""Since (Kim) took power he has purged almost all of his elder guardians ... and filled his surroundings with new faces. We are in a situation where we are learning about him a little bit every day through his unpredictable behavior and actions, which is why the current situation with North Korea is a lot more dangerous than before,"" she said.   But James Person, coordinator of the North Korea International Documentation Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center, suggested this week's exchange of live fire is not, on its own, too troubling.   ""North Korea actually warned South Korea in advance that they were going to carry out live-fire drills in seven locations. They advised the South to remove ships from the area. All of the shells fell in the water. No land or military installations were targeted,"" Person said. ""This is comparatively a very mild provocation. ""  Person said the latest incidents might reflect North Korean frustration on a number of issues, not least the recent joint military drills between South Korea and the United States, which Person described as the largest such exercises in two decades. But most important, Person said, is concern in North Korea over the pace of improved relations with South Korea and the United States.   All just guesswork?   Of course, the most oft-stated problem with speculating on North Korean intentions has been the claim that the information coming out of the country is just too limited to make any concrete assumptions.   ""There are no countries as closed as North Korea. Its citizens aren't allowed to travel, and the few North Korean officials who do go abroad are closely watched. You basically have to go back to Stalin's Soviet Union to find something similar,"" Whiton said. ""This makes it difficult to collect even the most basic background information about what is going on, and recruiting espionage sources is very difficult. The regime is very good at preventing knowledge of its inner workings. ""  South Korea captures a North Korean fishing boat  A troubling glimpse of what is going on inside North Korea came with a U.N. report released in February. In a 372-page report, the Commission of Inquiry on Democratic People's Republic of Korea outlined claims of ""extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape ... and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation. ""  ""The gravity, scale, duration and nature of the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country reveal a totalitarian state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,"" the report stated.   Yet understanding the inner workings of the regime has proven a tougher nut to crack. This was evident in the speculation that swirled around the younger Kim when it became clear he was the most likely candidate to succeed his father; media reports were full of chatter about whether Kim Jong Un's time at a Swiss boarding school, and his apparent love of basketball, were an indication that he might be more friendly toward the West.   China, North Korea slam U.N. human rights report  Indeed, according to a leaked cable published by WikiLeaks, Japan's intelligence community was said to have relied in part on the book of a former sushi chef for insights into the elder Kim's behavior.   Even China, the closest thing North Korea has to a reliable ally, doesn't fully understand the power struggle going on at the top of the North Korean regime, suggested Minxin Pei, a leading China watcher and director of the Keck Center for International and Strategic Studies at Claremont McKenna College. The gruesome execution in December of the younger Kim's influential uncle, Jang Song Thaek, for example, ""caught Beijing by surprise,"" Pei said.   But Person suggested the supposed impenetrability of North Korea might sometimes be overplayed.   ""While North Korea has long defied close scrutiny, there is no void of knowledge about the country. We have much more information to call upon than most care to admit,"" Person said, adding that the Wilson Center for one has spent years ""assembling and translating the diplomatic record of North Korea's former communist allies ... (including) thousands of conversations between North Korean officials, including the supreme leaders, and foreign heads of state and diplomats. ""  The question confronting policymakers is whether the still inexperienced Kim Jong Un has yet mastered the implications -- and relatively safe limits -- of the brinkmanship that was practiced for so long by his father.   ""North Korea is signaling that they are not shutting the door. In fact, quite the opposite is true,"" Person said. ""But this is a very slippery slope -- and could easily turn nasty. ""  North Korea election provides clues to reclusive Stalinist state",human
"I knew nothing about it,"" he said in a studio appearance for a live call-in show hosted by New Jersey 101.5.   The fresh response came amid a new allegation from a former top adviser caught up in the scandal, David Wildstein, that ""evidence exists"" that Christie knew about the closures and resulting traffic gridlock over five days in Fort Lee in real time, which would, if true, contradict his account of events.   On CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich said he believed Christie but thought the governor should sign a sworn statement backing up his claims.   ""I take it him at his word but it would appear from the polls that a lot of folks don't,"" Sokolich said.   Why is this important?   Christie's recollection ultimately may be critical in answering why the bridge lanes overseen by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey were closed in the first place and who authorized it for sure -- and whether any laws were broken.   E-mails and political figures in New Jersey have suggested the gridlock was a bit of orchestrated political payback for the Fort Lee mayor, who did not endorse Christie for re-election last November.   A state legislative committee is investigating as is the Justice Department, which would be interested if there was any abuse of power. Both have subpoenaed Christie's office for documents, and he said his office is complying. Christie's office also has hired a private law firm to investigate.   And why is Wildstein important?   It has been suggested in the e-mails released by state legislative investigators in New Jersey that Wildstein, a top Christie appointee at the Port Authority, carried out the closures. He also has been subpoenaed, refused to answer questions from legislative investigators, and he's got a lawyer.   For his part, Christie has fired a top aide linked to what has metastasized into a political scandal coming on the heels of a successful re-election and prior to a possible White House bid. Others have left their jobs as the scandal unfolded, including Wildstein.   Former deputy chief of staff Bridget Ann Kelly, whose e-mail to Wildstein -- ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee"" -- weeks before the gridlock occurred led to her firing by Christie in January, refused on Monday on constitutional grounds to comply with a state legislative subpoena to turn over documents, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN's Chris Frates.   State lawmakers leading that investigation said they are reviewing the matter and ""considering our legal options with respect to enforcing the subpoena. ""  Christie, in the radio interview, repeated what he said at a January news conference -- challenged by Wildstein in a letter written by his lawyer to the Port Authority on Friday -- about the timeline around when he became aware of the traffic mess. He also denied having any knowledge of a suggested political motive.   Who's who in the bridge scandal  Christie blasts Wildstein  ""The first time that this really came into my consciousness, as an issue"" was when an e-mail from Port Authority Executive Director Pat Foye ""was leaked to the media and reported on. ""  Foye was the person, according to e-mails, who started asking questions about the lane closures and ordered them reopened.   That's when Christie said he asked his chief of staff and his chief counsel to ""look into this and see what's going on here. ""  He said any reference to the bridge situation prior to this wouldn't have meant anything to him because he wasn't clued into the fact that there was a problem.   Afterward, Christie said again that he was told the ""Port Authority was engaged in a traffic study,"" which has now been called into serious question.   He also stressed that ""nobody has said I knew anything about this before it happened, and I think that's the most important question. ""  A question of evidence  Christie's appearance follows steps by his office over the weekend to strike in an unusually personal way against Wildstein, a one-time high school classmate of the governor in Livingston, N.J.  ""Bottom line - David Wildstein will do and say anything to save David Wildstein,"" a letter released by the governor's office said in a statement.   On Monday, Christie's office also planned to send to friends and allies a list of tweets and stories aiming to put the focus on The New York Times' handling of the disclosure by Wildstein, according to CNN's Jake Tapper.   The Times broke the story, saying Wildstein ""had the evidence to prove"" Christie knew about the lane closures. The newspaper quickly revised its lead to simply reflect what the letter written by Wildstein's attorney actually said: that ""evidence exists,"" not that Wildstein was in possession of it.   The letter never disclosed the evidence.   Chris Christie scandal: A primer  First on CNN: Mayor behind Christie allegations full of contradictions  The letter also didn't suggest that Christie had knowledge of what his people might have been up to -- political or otherwise.   Read Wildstein's letter  The scandal and another allegation of strong-arm political tactics by Christie administration officials over Superstorm Sandy aid have generated a wave of negative political fallout for a governor overwhelmingly re-elected in November and considered a top-tier Republican presidential hopeful in 2016.   Christie's swagger and straight-shooting style had him riding high in the polls as late as December.   He topped other potential GOP 2016 White House hopefuls in various surveys. But those numbers have faded as the scandal has intensified, according to a new CNN/ORC International survey.   Christie trails Hillary Clinton by 16 percentage points in a hypothetical presidential match-up, a turnaround from December when he was up by 2 points.   Opinion: Are clouds gathering for Christie?

"The most recent, and tragic, tale to emerge concerned the death of two construction workers after a crane collapsed at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo -- due to host the World Cup's opening match.   Friday marks the start of a countdown to June 12 next year, when Brazil will begin a month-long festival of football, likely to captivate the world.   Where?   The draw will take place in the resort of Costa do Sauipe in Bahia on the northeast coast of Brazil.   In attendance will be representatives from each World Cup nation as well as FIFA's top brass, including president Sepp Blatter.   The ceremony will be broadcast live to 193 countries from 1 p.m. local time (1700 CET) with 1,300 guests alongside a bank of 2,000 reporters.   As ever, there will be entertainment, including turns from Brazilian singers Alexandre Pires and Vanessa da Mata as well as dance troupe Companhia de Danca Deborah Colker.   There has been some controversy already when the two actors scheduled to host the draw -- Lazaro Ramos and Camila Pitanga, who both have dark skin -- were replaced by another married celebrity couple, Fernanda Lima and Rodrigo Hilbert, who are blond and white.   What is it?   The World Cup draw determines which of the 32 nations will face each other in the group stages.   Teams will be drawn into eight groups of four, based on FIFA's seeding system and geographical separation, meaning that teams from the same qualification zone can't be drawn in the same group.   There is an exception for European countries, given there are 13 participating in the tournament, but no more than two from the region can be drawn in the same group.   The winners of a particular group will face the runner-up of another when the tournament enters its final-16 stage -- the first of the knockout rounds.   The seedings  Eight teams in the draw are seeded -- seven are the highest placed teams from FIFA's rankings, the other is host Brazil.   The top seven when the seedings were announced in October comprised of defending champion Spain along with Germany, Argentina, Colombia, Belgium, Uruguay and Switzerland.   The seedings are calculated on how a team has played over the past four years, with the most recent year given greatest importance. Teams earn ranking points for a win or a draw but nothing for a defeat.   The points vary with each game depending on who is playing and whether it is a friendly or qualifying match.   Uneven numbers  When there are eight unseeded European teams -- as in 2010 -- the draw works easily and smoothly, meaning FIFA can organize the nations into four pots of eight teams.   But because there are nine unseeded European teams in the 2014 World Cup, things become a little more complicated.   FIFA has decided to put these nine teams into one pot, and prior to the draw they will pull out one nation to go into pot two with five African nations and the two unseeded South American sides.   That country will be selected at random, despite France -- which qualified through the playoffs -- being the lowest ranked nation from the European qualifying phase.   This random element has not gone down well with some of the other countries in that part of the draw.   Pot X  As a starting point, Brazil will automatically be drawn into Group A due to its role as host.   Then the other seeded teams will be allocated their groups, which runs as far as Group H.  And then it gets rather complicated.   With one of the unseeded European teams now residing in pot two, there are now nations from three geographical zones in the same pot.   That increases the chances of three European teams ending up in the same group, a violation of FIFA's ""geographical separation"" principle.   As such, the governing body decided to create ""Pot X"" into which four of the seeded South American teams will be placed.   One is drawn out and then paired together in a group with the unseeded European team from pot two.   After that, the rest of the teams will be allocated to their groups -- with the only other issue residing with Chile and Ecuador, who can skip a group in order to avoid being drawn with seeded South American teams.   Group of Death  As ever with any high-profile soccer draw there is the potential for the much-touted ""Group of Death. ""  Whichever unseeded European team is plucked out of pot four and put into pot two might be forgiven for watching the rest of the draw from behind their sofa.   That nation will be guaranteed to face one of the South American seeds from Pot X -- Brazil, Argentina, Colombia or Uruguay.   Then they could face the United States from pot three and either Italy or Netherlands from pot four, making qualification for the last 16 much harder.",human
"""I told them, listen, I'm on your side. As a father, I don't want my son to be in danger. And I don't want him to harm anyone. Put on the table what kind of proof you have against my son. Let's cooperate and work together as a parent,"" he said.   ""But they never had anything -- which is what makes me believe that they had another agenda. Which is the one he always mentioned. That they want him to be an informant and work for them. ""  This pressure was the reason for his son's return to Somalia, Mohamad Hashi said. ""He never had peace here. He was being harassed all the time. ""  Mahdi Hashi traveled to Egypt and Syria as a teenager. Then, in 2010, his family says, Hashi returned to Mogadishu.   He got married, had a child and then, in December 2011, he disappeared.   Stripped of citizenship  In July last year, his family received a letter from Britain's Home Office stating that Hashi had been stripped of his citizenship for the ""public good. ""  ""The reason for this decision is that the Security Service assess that you have been involved in Islamist extremism and present a risk to the national security of the United Kingdom due to your extremist activities,"" the letter says.   Then, on December 21, 2012 -- almost a year after he disappeared -- Hashi turned up in a U.S. criminal court in Brooklyn, New York, charged with ""material support"" of a terror organization, Al-Shabaab, and allegedly training to be a suicide bomber. Two other men were charged with him.   ""As alleged, these defendants are not aspiring terrorists, they are terrorists. They did more than receive terrorist training: they put that training to practice in terrorist operations with Al-Shabaab. Their capture and prosecution are important steps in the continuing campaign against terrorism,"" said George Venizelos, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's field office in New York, in a statement announcing the charges in December.   Hashi denies all the charges, according to his American lawyer, Harry Batchelder.   A statement from the FBI says Hashi was arrested in ""Africa"" by local police in August last year and then handed to the FBI.   According to his lawyers, Hashi says he was detained in Djibouti in June. He saw cellmates beaten and tortured with electric shocks there, Hashi says.   He claims he was given a choice in Djibouti: Sign a confession or be tortured.   Eventually he was turned over to U.S. authorities, who flew him to the United States, Batchelder said. The lawyer cites the FBI as saying he arrived in late November.   Hashi's British citizenship was stripped from him just a short time before he was put on a plane to the United States, Batchelder said.   That move is being challenged before a special board of immigration appeal, he said. ""But as of now, the British government has offered no assistance to this matter whatsoever. ""  'New and improved rendition'  Hashi's father doesn't understand how his son has ended up in a Brooklyn criminal court.   ""He has never been to the United States even for a holiday. He has never threatened the United States. We don't know why he was taken all the way there,"" he said.   From his parents' point of view, he was kidnapped and taken to the United States.   Batchelder said Hashi's case is an example of a disturbing new trend he has heard called ""new and improved rendition. ""  ""I mean that the agonies that were inflicted in earlier renditions, the government has reacted to that, but they still take people from foreign countries, bring them into the United States, and they're going to try him here,"" the attorney said.   ""In my mind, that has long-term ramifications that, if carried out to their logical end, would mean the 20,000 people in Somalia are now eligible to be brought to the United States and tried in a U.S. court. That's a little bit disturbing, and that's an understatement. ""  Because he is no longer considered a British citizen, Hashi has received no help from the British government. His mother told CNN it has changed the way she thinks of her adopted homeland.   ""When we came this country, it was (as) you know, asylum seeker,"" she said. ""They said you are welcome. And now (they say) you are welcome to be hunted. For our kids, our brothers and sisters. The whole community, not only my son. ""  Mahdi Hashi is now fighting to regain his British citizenship while in a New York detention center. But exactly how he disappeared off the streets of Mogadishu and reappeared in a Brooklyn courtroom remains a mystery.   CNN's Iona Serrapica and Laura Perez Maestro contributed to this report.",human
"Jump on the Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong, head straight for domestic departures, where I would then board a flight to Tacloban -- a flight of little more than an hour.   Except it wasn't.   TYPHOON TRACKER: Follow Hagupit  Planes...  10:30 a.m. came and went with no sign of a boarding call. I began to meet other journalists waiting for the same flight who were equally at a loss as to what was happening.   We were eventually approached by a Philippines Airlines manager, apologizing profusely. ""Technical difficulties"" had apparently grounded the aircraft but we were assured there would be another flight at 1.30 p.m.  All other flights to different parts of the Philippines were on schedule, so we were confident about this next take-off time. But as the time approached, no boarding call came. A brief announcement informed us the flight was canceled because of continuing ""technical difficulties. ""  And so it went. Another airlines staff member presented us with new boarding passes for a 3.45 p.m. flight. Fifteen minutes before departure we were sitting patiently on the airport bus waiting to be taken out to the apron and it looked as if we would finally be on our way.   But the bus didn't move. We sat for 30 minutes until another announcement of another delay. We trudged back to the boarding gate, very frustrated. Other routes were being discussed but all ferries had been canceled and the direct flight still looked the best bet.   More than an hour later we learned that all flights were canceled because of the weather conditions in Tacloban. We appeared to be stuck where the story wasn't.   Blades...  And so to Plan B. A hasty conference call with the Hong Kong news desk and a new plan: Charter a light aircraft.   Initial indications were good. A private operator thought they could get a few of us into Tacloban at first light Saturday. The final decision on weather conditions would be made at 4 a.m. At the appointed time the news came through: Conditions were too dangerous to risk it.   Another call to Hong Kong and we decided that it could be possible to fly to Cebu and take the short hop to Tacloban by helicopter. I boarded my flight at 11 a.m. and was on the island inside the hour to be met by the helicopter crew.   I knew I was in good hands when I met my pilot, retired military man Col. Andy Largo. His flying career included flying four former Philippine presidents around the country, as well as the late Pope John Paul II.   He had already flown two sorties that morning to Tacloban but my anxieties grew as he described the flights. He was forced to touch down early on both journeys because of the conditions -- and they were growing worse by the hour.   The biggest worry, he said, were strong wings that could literally break the rotor blades. If we encountered excessive winds he would reduce the flying speed and edge ahead, waiting for a break in the weather.   I was his only passenger but he took along an engineer to help ""just in case."" I buckled into the front seat next to Col. Largo and off we went into a murky cloud-filled sky.   It was surprisingly smooth. We flew at between 1,000 and 2,000 feet over a white-capped sea, towards increasingly thick clouds. Our pilot seemed unworried until we got to the tip of Leyte Island and the town of Beybey, which lies at the foot of a range of mountains separating us from Tacloban.   One look at the cloud ahead and he tapped me on the arm and indicated the flight had come to an end. We put down on a playing field and I jumped out.   And automobiles..  I was soon surrounded by a group of locals, who managed to rustle up a van. Ten minutes later we on the road driving along a virtually deserted road in heavy rain, towards the mountains and Tacloban.   It took two hours to make the 100 kilometer (62 mile) journey.

"It hosted the ATP tournament in the late '70s and '80s in the heyday of Madison Square Garden.   Brazil, meanwhile, is an emerging market that in the next three years will host soccer's World Cup, the Summer Olympics and a medium-sized tennis event in Rio.   However, moving the event elsewhere would be a ""gamble,"" according to the former head of the ATP's commercial division, while Roger Federer -- whose record six finals wins are spread across London, Houston and Shanghai -- would have no issue with a further continuation.   Tournament director Andre Silva says staying in Britain past 2015 is ""definitely"" a possibility.   Unlike soccer's ruling body FIFA, which aims to take the World Cup to pastures new, the ATP's goal isn't to be ""evangelistic"" about tennis -- and London, with its packed crowds, has been a boon financially for the men's game.   ""My personality isn't much for a change,"" Silva, a Brazilian, told CNN. ""This is a different animal to the World Cup in that it's year to year, and you do want to expose fans around the world to this type of tennis.   ""But the tournament is a very important part of the business of the ATP. More important than exposing everyone around the world to it is making sure it's healthy and not an experiment.   ""I know a lot of people talked about Rio and New York. It's obviously great to be wanted. At the same time you need to be sure it makes sense -- and right now London makes a lot of sense. ""  Federer, who lost to Novak Djokovic in last year's final, shared Silva's view.   ""I must agree with Andre in many ways because I think it's important that this event is played in a place that knows tennis,"" Federer told CNN.   ""I think it's good sometimes to play Shanghai, or maybe Lisbon or Sydney for a year, but I think it's not long enough in one place to put its roots down. ""  Lisbon welcomed the world's top players in 2000 and Sydney did the same in 2001 in another one-year stint.   ""It's like a circus,"" said Federer, who will this week tie Ivan Lendl's record of 12 successive appearances at the season-ending event.   ""You come, the tent is there but it's temporary and you move it away again. So here the roots are down, it's successful and that's why if the business makes sense, if the numbers make sense, if the excitement of everybody involved makes sense, I think we should keep it here.   ""Other options would have to be considered but it would have to be a great other option. ""  Richard Davies, the CEO of ATP Properties before leaving his post at the end of 2010, said London was ""twice as successful"" in monetary value for the ruling body than other host cities.   Unlike when the season finale was showcased in Shanghai as the Masters Cup, the World Tour Finals are operated as a joint venture between the ATP and London's O2 venue owner AEG. All operating costs and revenues feed into the joint venture.   The Shanghai promoters paid the ATP for the right to run the tournament, and the purchasing fee -- believed to work out to about $10 million per year -- was all the latter received from the event.   ""If there's no tennis fatigue at the O2 and it's still selling out, I think you have to ask yourself, 'What's the upside to move it elsewhere?' "" said Davies. ""At the ATP Tour, it's not their responsibility to be evangelistic about tennis.   ""London is a great city and that helps corporately. You'd have to take a long, hard look to say, 'We're going to move it.' It's very profitable and to get a tennis-loving nation behind it in any other country at that time of the year will be a gamble. ""  The success of the tournament has had a knock-on effect on sponsorship, according to both Davies and Silva.   Some companies get involved with the World Tour Finals and then decide to increase their affiliation with the tour throughout the year.   More than one million fans have walked through the turnstiles in the four editions, helped by a capacity of 17,800 that makes the O2 arena the second-largest regularly used tennis venue behind New York's Arthur Ashe Stadium.   Operating two sessions -- day and evening -- pads the coffers. Tickets to watch a single round-robin match range from Â£10-62 ($16-98), while seats for the final are Â£30-105 ($48-167).   ""People want to be part of the event,"" said Silva. ""They see how successful it is. They see the tour operates in a very successful way throughout the year and end up becoming global partners. ""  Come the conclusion of 2015, London's term will hit seven consecutive seasons, a run only bettered by New York, which had an unbroken spell from 1977-1989.   With tennis a younger sport in China, crowds for opening matches disappointed, the time zone presented problems for broadcasters and viewers in Europe -- tennis' biggest market -- while players faced the long trip to Asia following the European indoor swing.   London lacks those issues, though players have complained about Britain's tax laws -- which restrict the number of days they can be in the country before being rated on their overall income.   The O2 is ""one of the best venues ever"" according to veteran doubles specialist Leander Paes, this week teaming up with Radek Stepanek.   ""Playing in there, the acoustics are phenomenal,"" Paes, who turned pro in 1991, told CNN. ""The crispness of it makes the quality of tennis so high.""   Pondering the achievement of the event in London, Davies spared a thought for former ATP head Etienne de Villiers.   De Villiers was criticized for implementing a round-robin format at smaller tournaments, and the ATP was taken to court during his 2005-08 tenure for attempting to strip a German event of Masters status.   But De Villiers spearheaded the shift to London from Shanghai in 2009.   ""People have short memories,"" said Davies. ""It was a very bold move. The O2 wasn't an established venue and it had a slight miasma about it.   ""To back ourselves and say we know we can build an event here, find sponsors and fill it with an audience really that has just had Wimbledon, outdoors ... we're going to take that tennis-loving public and tell them to watch tennis indoors -- it was a big decision.

"The threat surfaced in recent weeks with fliers offering a reward for information on the identity of the administrator or his family.   ""I think what is happening to me is the least relevant thing that is happening in my state,"" the blogger said. ""There are hundreds of families waiting for their missing ones, who at their moment of filing complaints were filled with fear by authorities who told them to assume they are dead. ""  Tamaulipas has one of the highest levels of violence in Mexico. It is among the states with the highest levels of homicide, extortion and kidnapping, according to official statistics.   ""The criminals truly think that they are in the right and that everyone else should obey them,"" the blogger said. ""They think that crime is a job and causing damage is a right.""  Criminals lower their profile  The violence in Tamaulipas persists, despite the reduction in the intensity of shootouts between groups, the administrator said.   ""(Organized crime) has only lowered its profile. It carries out its activities like always, kidnapping, executing, disappearing people, terrorizing,"" he said. ""What has declined in the past years are the illegal roadblocks and the very large shootouts, but the criminal control remains the same, or stronger. ""  The administration of former President Felipe Calderon, who left office in 2012, attributed the violence in Tamaulipas to a turf war between the Gulf cartel and the Zetas cartel over control of drug smuggling routes to the United States.   To combat them, in 2010 he launched an operation that sent additional security forces to Tamaulipas and the neighboring Nuevo Leon state.   The threat  The offers of reward money in exchange for information about Courage for Tamaulipas first surfaced between February 8 and 10. During those days, anonymous fliers began to circulate in Ciudad Victoria -- the capital -- and the border cities of Reynosa, Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo.   The administrator published a photo of one of the fliers and affirmed that he would not be stopped because the public values his work.   ""As long as I have collaborators, even if it is only one person, I will continue doing what is in my reach to provide evidence of the situation we are living,"" he said.   The government's response  It was not until this week that the blogger received support from local and federal authorities, though some officials had expressed their support for him individually.   The state general attorney's office said it does not have any information about the fliers threatening Courage for Tamaulipas.   The agency added that it does not have a protocol for protecting residents in situations like this because it is the first of its kind.   The precedents  A survey by Freedom House of Mexican journalists and bloggers showed that 96% of respondents know a colleague who has been attacked. The organization surveyed 102 journalists in 20 Mexican states.   Freedom House published a report, Digital and Mobile Security for Mexican Journalists and Bloggers, which cites a September 2011 incident where two people were found hanging from a bridge in Nuevo Laredo.   ""A message left near the bodies warned that the same thing could happen to any internet user who crossed that criminal organization. Those murders were followed by the killing of a journalist using the nickname ""la Nena de Laredo"" who had posted entries against criminal activity on Nuevo Laredo en Vivo, a social media forum,"" the report said.   Following these crimes, the administrator of Courage for Tamaulipas published a message condemning the incidents and affirming that ""innumerable"" citizens continue to resist against organized crime's grip.",human
"They were making plans to schedule a meeting with affected residents.   ""It really is a loss, and there is a grieving process that has to take place,"" said Steve Cox with the Colorado Springs mayor's executive team.   The FBI's Denver office, meanwhile, said it was working with other agencies to determine whether any of a dozen wildfires across the state resulted from criminal activity.   Nearly 1,000 firefighters tried to corral the 15,517-acre blaze that moved into Colorado Springs.   Gov. John Hickenlooper told CNN's ""John King USA"" that the number of evacuations grew Wednesday to 36,000.   ""We're still fighting with everything we've got,"" he said.   Harvey said progress had been made in some portions of the Waldo Canyon Fire, and firefighters were taking an aggressive stance against hot spots.   ""It's been house to house, door to door, street to street, hill to hill activity,"" he said of one location.   Higher humidity and cloud cover Wednesday night might aid firefighting efforts, but there was no guarantee conditions would not be similar to Tuesday's conflagration, Harvey told reporters.   Some rain did fall Wednesday on a separate fire burning near Boulder, Colorado, according to the National Weather Service.   President Barack Obama will travel to the Colorado Springs area Friday to survey the damage and thank responders battling the blaze, the White House said.   The Waldo Canyon Fire captured attention because of its proximity to landmarks such as Pikes Peak and the Air Force Academy, and also to Colorado Springs, a city of about 400,000, the state's second largest.   ""We have rehearsed and practiced disasters,"" said Dave Rose, public information officer for El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs. ""We have never seen one like this before. ""  Winds gusting to 65 mph through mountain canyons blew the wildfire through containment lines into northwest Colorado Springs on Tuesday afternoon. It roared downhill, burning to the ground the Flying W Ranch, a popular Western-style tourist destination.   CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen likened conditions to a double-edged sword. While temperatures were down a bit Wednesday, high-based thunderstorms will be fed by rising air, wind and low humidity, he said.   Such storms produce lightning and rain, but dry air will suck up most of the precipitation before it hits the ground. Lightning can reach the parched soil and possibly ignite additional fires, according to Hennen.   Open Story: iReporters share their harrowing views of the western wildfires  Richard Brown, the Colorado Springs fire chief, on Tuesday described the Waldo Canyon Fire as a ""firestorm of epic proportions. ""  Stan and Darlene Colbert were among the last families in the evacuation zone to pull out. They waited, hoping the fire would subside, but after watching the flames from their back porch, they knew it was time to go.   The first things the couple -- married 43 years -- packed were the family photos.   ""Every one of them I could find. Every photo because I can't replace those,"" said Darlene Colbert.   Many residents waited anxiously to get word of whether their homes had been spared. Becky Schormann was one.   Her family managed to take some sentimental items with them when they left, but still had to leave behind a boat, a pair of ATVs, a china cabinet and an antique doll collection.   ""I keep telling myself: It's going to be OK,"" she said.   Schormann told CNN that flames came to within 20 feet of their home but were beaten back.   ""Our volunteer fire department is just awesome,"" she said.   The Schormanns are staying in an RV at their daughter's home. The family's two dogs, a pony and a donkey also came along for the ride.   The flames came dangerously close to the Air Force Academy's main campus, and an evacuation order was issued for about 700 residents in its Pine Valley Housing and 1,400 in Douglass Valley Housing, said public affairs officer John Van Winkle.   The facility was closed to visitors Wednesday, with only essential personnel asked to report.   Reactions: Monster fire terrorizes a Colorado city  The academy's powered flight, glider and parachuting operations have been called off since Saturday so that the U.S. Forest Service could use runways for helicopters used to fight fires along Colorado's Front Range, Van Winkle said.   The academy's Class of 2016 -- all 1,045 cadets -- is still scheduled to arrive Thursday, but officials are making contingency plans in case they have to report to a different location on the base.   Rose, the county information officer, said one in four callers to the joint information center are offering food for firefighters, shelter for displaced neighbors or to volunteer in some capacity.   ""It is a somber resolve,"" Rose told CNN. ""There's no doubt that we have a grim reality that we have lost a number of structures. Our western border mountain vista has dramatically altered.

"It was this marginalization that provided ISIS, which now calls itself the Islamic State, an opportunity to exploit the Sunni desire for fairer representation.   But as much as ISIS claims to be championing Sunnis, it does not in any way represent Islam. The Quran clearly and categorically condemns forced conversion to Islam. It also accepts other religions and prophets as messengers of God, especially those of the other monotheistic religions: Judaism and Christianity.   What ISIS is doing -- including its targeting of Christians and Yazidis -- therefore has nothing to do with practices through the ages, from the Levant to Andalusia. Indeed, Arab Christians have been an integral part of Arab history -- the presence of Christians in this part of the world is not an aberration, and Christianity is as part of the history of this region as Islam.   Sadly, ISIS has tried to hijack Islam and is often wrongly labeled a Sunni organization.   This is unfortunate as the vast majority of Sunnis are moderates who should not be tarred with the same brush as the extremist group. In fact, Sunnis have largely been the main victims of ISIS atrocities.   In Syria, for example, ISIS has often trained its fire on the moderate Free Syrian Army rather than the forces of the al-Assad regime. In Iraq, meanwhile, ISIS has alienated those Sunni tribes that have rejected its extremist practices, while also fighting (predominantly Sunni) Kurdish forces.   So how should the West and the countries of the Middle East respond to the growing threat that ISIS poses?   The reality is that force alone will not be enough to uproot ISIS and banish the threat it poses to this region and to the rest of the world. Instead, militias such as ISIS -- typically based on rigid and outdated ideological beliefs -- require a multipronged approach.   Yes, military confrontation is an important tool, as is boosting economic and social development in areas affected. But the war on ISIS can't be won unless a key reason for its emergence is not tackled: tyranny and a lack of justice.   Tyranny is another face of extremism, and it therefore makes no sense to treat it as if it is a viable alternative to radical agendas. With that in mind, it is high time that world leaders not just claim to cherish democracy, freedom, justice and respect of human rights while merely condemning the acts of dictators. Empty words will do nothing to change their behavior. Instead, the West must offer genuine support for moderate, civil opposition in Syria and Iraq.   The United States' increased engagement in the region, as signaled by President Barack Obama's speech last Wednesday, is welcome. And the proposed military element -- including airstrikes -- may be successful in containing the threat ISIS poses.   But to truly eliminate the risk of its resurgence (or its replacement by some other extremist group), the West has to be more engaged in finding lasting solutions to fundamental problems in the region.   What are these problems?   Israel's occupation of Arab lands is one. Another is the vindictive government policies that have left large segments of the Iraqi population frustrated, a problem that could in part be resolved by guaranteeing a true power sharing arrangement. Finally, the Geneva process needs to be restarted with a view to forming a transitional government with a mandate for moving toward democratic rule in Syria.   Unfortunately, some in the West have suggested that keeping al-Assad might even be desirable, believing he is the lesser of two evils.   This is not only preposterous, but also immoral and completely ignores the Syrian conflict's role in ISIS's emergence in the first place. Indeed, my country has firsthand experience of having to confront extremism stoked by al-Assad's regime -- back in 2007, when I was Prime Minister, we discovered an extremist group called Fatah al Islam appeared to have links to Syrian intelligence.   Experience has shown us that dictatorships are not a sustainable guarantor of peace for minorities. Instead, only the emergence of a democratic and modern civil state, where all individuals are treated equally, regardless of regardless of religion or ethnic grouping, can bring lasting peace and stability.   And the West should see in this struggle not only a moral duty to act but also its own long-term interests. Ending the Israeli occupation through the principles of a two-state solution while backing the forces of moderation in the Arab world would undermine the appeal of extremists and pave the way for democratic states that foster stability.   Diversity and pluralism in nations such as Iraq and Syria can be seen as either a challenge or as presenting an opportunity. But one thing should by now be clear to all religious and sectarian actors in the Levant: one group cannot force its lifestyle, opinions or policies onto the other groups. Democracy should not be used as an excuse to marginalize a minority.   For years, Lebanon was successful in following a principle espoused by President Obama -- ""the principle of no victor and no vanquished."" He is absolutely right, and governments and others in this region should listen.   But if the United States wants to see real change, then it will have to empower those moderate forces that are trying to put these fine words into action.",human
"When Luke is a much older man, Vader doesn't wear a helmet, Han Solo resembles a lizard and there is a character named Kane Starkiller, it might take some getting used to. But it's a fascinating part of movie history, no doubt.   CNN spoke separately to J.W. Rinzler, who adapted Lucas' script for comics, and artist Mike Mayhew.   CNN: What captured your interest when adapting this script?   Rinzler: It's so similar and yet so different at the same time. All the puzzle pieces are there but arranged to form a different picture. You've got Sith and Jedi, you've got a desert planet. You've got a planet with twin suns, an imperial city and a cloud city. When I read the rough draft, it had all those things which made me want to make it into a comic book. It's such a great story, George is a great storyteller.   CNN: Was it difficult to illustrate this story from a script written nearly 40 years ago?   Mayhew: Not at all. I've been in comics 20 years, and when I read the rough draft, I thought, I can make a comic of this tomorrow. It was just a very well-written screenplay, and that's what a comic book script is. This is genuinely George's first complete screenplay story of this tale, and it's wildly different.   You can see why some of it was changed because there's no way they could have done it. It was just too ambitious.   When you look at movies now like ""Avatar"" and ""The Avengers,"" it seems prophetic. Audiences expect all that action and set pieces, and one thing after another. I'm sure back then they looked at this and thought, ""What's this guy thinking?""  The other interesting thing is you see the origins of the characters we know and love. Darth Vader is kind of a general, he's one of the main heavies but he's not a lord of the Sith. Here, Vader is really three characters: General Vader, this Lord of the Sith named Valorum, and this mechanical man. You think you know these characters and then you discover their truer origins.   CNN: What do you think fans will take away from this book?   Rinzler: Based on early fan feedback from the first issue, they're really enjoying this alternate universe, and they're getting to read a story that's being told by George. Even through my adaptation, you feel his voice. You see many of the things you love in ""Star Wars"" but in a slightly different way.   You have the Tusken raider moment surging in front of the binoculars, except it's not a Tusken raider, it's a different character. Fans are saying they're reading it two or three times to take it all in.   Mayhew: This to me is the greatest ""what if"" story in comics. What if this made it to the screen? The mind reels at the possibilities.   CNN: Is there one particular thing that is farthest away from the ""Star Wars"" we know and love?   Rinzler: Everyone seems to latch onto the fact that Han is a big green alien. That's pretty far! He doesn't have his own ship. His character is probably the most different, although he can already talk to Wookies. It's fascinating to see all this stuff starting out, in a way.   What's really fun is that R2-D2 talks in this one. There's a couple of points where I felt like ""R2-D2 should say something here,"" and I added a line and that was really fun.   Mayhew: The characters in this story are much different than the characters in ""Star Wars."" The relationships are a lot different and to me, more intense. Leia's story is a little more complicated, and she's more a part of the action. Annikin is more of a trained Jedi than Luke was. The older General Skywalker to me is so much cooler than Obi-Wan. This character is like Captain America, a bigger than life hero.   CNN: Is there a possibility that this alternate version of ""Star Wars"" could live on beyond these eight issues, at least in the fans' minds?   Rinzler: Fans have been asking already about this, because so many things are hinted at particularly in the first issue, about the past, or characters in the periphery, or just spoken of and not seen. They'd love to see those mysteries explained, but we have a little movie called ""Episode VII"" coming up and that will take precedence.   'Star Wars' cinematographer Gilbert Taylor dies at 99  J.J.

"The prime ministers of Canada, Mauritius and India opted not to attend.   Cameron issued a statement Thursday saying he saw his attendance as ""an opportunity to raise our concerns clearly and directly, and to focus the eyes of the world on Sri Lanka."" He also reiterated calls for an investigation into alleged human rights abuses during and after the war.   Announcing Cameron's northern visit this month, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said four years after its war ended Sri Lanka is ""still a country where civil society is suppressed, where (nongovernmental organizations) and the media are routinely intimidated, where journalists and critics of the government have disappeared, and where no one has been held to account for alleged war crimes including rape and sexual violence. ""  The north, Hague said, was ""where some of the worst fighting and suffering occurred, and thousands of people are still displaced from their homes. ""  On Friday, Cameron tweeted: ""I'm the first PM or president to go to the north of Sri Lanka since 1948. I want to shine a light on chilling events there first hand.   ""Political leaders in the north of Sri Lanka tell me they are glad I've come to help highlight what is happening here.

""  As many as 70,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka's war. In its final stage, which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009, the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of the north where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting.   A U.N. report in 2011 said the government used ""large-scale and widespread shelling"" that left a large number of civilians dead.   The number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day, and U.N. figures greatly differ from those in reports from Sri Lanka's government and various nongovernmental organizations.   In his statement Thursday, Cameron said: ""Together we must say clearly to the government of Sri Lanka -- our hosts -- that there must be accountability for the past and respect for human rights today,"" he said.   ""Four years on from the end of the civil war and defeat of the 'Tamil Tigers,' a brutal terrorist organization, there has been nowhere near enough improvement. We need to see more progress: genuine freedom of expression and the media, an end to the intimidation of journalists and human rights defenders, action to stamp out torture, demilitarization of the north and reconciliation between communities.   ""And of course we need to see a thorough investigation into alleged war crimes. ""  On Friday, David Mepham, the UK director of Human Rights Watch, told CNN's Atika Shubert that calling for an international inquiry into what happened at the end of the war was one of the most important things Cameron could do.   ""The Sri Lankans have their own process which is a bit of a joke -- there's a total lack of accountability -- so there needs to be an international inquiry. In addition to this, the UK needs to put real pressure on the ongoing human rights abuses in Sri Lanka today. ""  In an interview that aired Thursday on CNN's ""Amanpour,"" Sri Lanka's high commissioner to the United Kingdom, Chris Nonis, denied that an independent international inquiry is needed.   ""We respect the independence and sovereignty of your country, and we expect you to respect ours. We don't need an international investigation when we have had a vibrant civilization for 2,500 years. We have perfectly educated people, and I think we're perfectly capable of carrying out our own domestic inquiry,"" he told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen.   Nonis pointed to the 2011 ""Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission"" report, which Sri Lanka's president ordered.   ""It's a very holistic, very comprehensive, very impartial report. It had over 5,000 hearings, and it's set within the principle of international humanitarian law, incorporating the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality. ""  Nonis said the report had been released in full despite containing criticism of successive governments and the government had gone ""a substantial way"" toward implementing some of its recommendations.   The Commonwealth is a voluntary association of 53 nations that initially formed out of what had been the British Empire. Its charter focuses on developing ""free and democratic societies and the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of all peoples of the Commonwealth.

"After the United States acquired Puerto Rico and other territories in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, the Supreme Court decided a series of deeply divided and controversial cases known as the Insular Cases.   While none of these cases addressed constitutional issues relating to citizenship, Justice Henry Billings Brown wrote an opinion in Downes v. Bidwell that suggested, in passing, that citizenship was not a fundamental right in these newly acquired areas, which were populated by what he called ""alien races.""  Although his opinion was not joined by a single other justice, it was good enough for those in Congress who thought birthright citizenship was not such a great idea for the inhabitants of these areas, who did not look like or speak like them.   The assumption that Congress controls citizenship in overseas territories has survived since, but not without disagreement in the lower courts.   Leneuoti Tuaua, the Samoan Federation of America, and several others born in American Samoa are challenging this faulty assumption in a federal lawsuit  pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. They argue that so long as American Samoa is under the U.S. flag, with American Samoa's sons and daughters fighting and dying to defend that flag, the U.S. Constitution guarantees them birthright citizenship, regardless of what Congress has said.   What does the Constitution itself say? The Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment -- part of the Constitution since 1868 -- states that ""All persons born ... in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. ""  The great Chief Justice John Marshall explained decades earlier that the Constitution used the phrase ""the United States"" as ""the name given to our great republic, which is composed of states and territories. ""  It is no surprise then that those who drafted the Citizenship Clause understood its guarantees to extend to U.S. territories, explaining that ""the first section (of the 14th Amendment) refers to persons everywhere, whether in the states or in the territories or in the District of Columbia."" Just four years after the Citizenship Clause was ratified, the Supreme Court stated that the clause ""put to rest"" the notion that ""those ... who had been born and resided always in the District of Columbia or in the territories, though within the United States, were not citizens. ""  This original understanding makes sense. The 14th Amendment was intended to overturn the Supreme Court's infamous Dred Scott decision and put the question of citizenship by birth on all U.S. soil beyond Congress' power to deny. In 1868, nearly half of all land in the United States was in a U.S. territory. An amendment that failed to guarantee citizenship in U.S. territories would not have been much of an amendment at all.   Birthright citizenship remains a hotly debated topic. But there is a remarkable cross-ideological consensus among legal scholars about what exactly the Constitution guarantees when it comes to birthright citizenship.   Former U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson, who represented President Bush in Bush v. Gore, and Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe, a renowned liberal scholar, argued in a 2008 joint memo that Sen. John McCain was eligible to run for president based solely on his place of birth: the Panama Canal Zone, a former U.S. territory.   Olson and Tribe explained that ""birth on soil that is under the sovereignty of the United States, but not within a state"" satisfies the requirement for being a "" 'natural born' citizen,"" in light of ""the well-established principle that 'natural born' citizenship includes birth within the territory and allegiance of the United States.""   President Clinton's Solicitor General Walter Dellinger and former Texas Solicitor General James Ho have echoed similar views on the geographic scope of birthright citizenship.   What the Insular Cases mean for U.S. territories today also remains hotly debated. On Wednesday the Harvard Law School is holding a conference titled ""Reconsidering the Insular Cases,"" with federal Circuit Judge Juan Torruella delivering the keynote address ""The Insular Cases: A Declaration of Their Bankruptcy."" Torruella has long compared the Insular Cases to Plessy v. Ferguson, criticizing the Insular Cases as establishing a race-based doctrine of ""separate and unequal"" status for residents of overseas U.S. territories.   In 2008, the Supreme Court also expressed skepticism of the idea that Congress has the power to deny constitutional rights in current U.S. territories, stating that ""it may well be that over time the ties between the United States and any of its unincorporated territories strengthen in ways that are of constitutional significance."" The court went on to explain that ""the Constitution grants Congress and the president the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply. ""  Although the Constitution grants Congress broad powers in U.S. territories, one that it clearly withholds is the power to rewrite the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship. Denying citizenship in American Samoa is not just unfair, it's unconstitutional.   The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Neil Weare.",human
"The warning said an ""ongoing risk of kidnapping"" exists, and the U.S. government is worried about possible terrorist attacks on Americans and Western facilities.   However, there are no plans for a U.S. government-sponsored evacuation of American citizens at this time, the State Department said.   ""U.S. government-facilitated evacuations occur only when no safe commercial alternatives exist,"" it said.   The message from the British Foreign Office was similar. The security situation continues to deteriorate, it said, and ""we now judge that our Embassy staff and premises are at increased risk. ""  It too asked British nationals to leave immediately.

""They are a very dangerous group,"" said Kirby. ""They do want to threaten Western interests, including U.S. interests and we do consider them a threat to the United States of America.  We're watching them very closely.""  Late last month, Meda Al Rowas, a senior analyst at IHS Country Risk, told CNN that unless Hadi is reinstated, the chances of the country avoiding armed conflict are slim.   ""Our forecast is really civil war in Yemen because we have a lot of nonstate armed groups who are likely to compete over territory and have a lot of competing agendas,"" she said.   The Houthis -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- have taken control of Sanaa and the northern provinces of Amran and Sadaa.   But there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa.   There are currently no talks with the Houthis, but there are discussions about whether to talk to them, U.S. officials said last month.",human
"""That automatically, in my opinion and according to the book, would nullify him as a trusted informant. ""  ""You may call him an informant by name. According to the bureau, according to the file, he is an informant,"" Fitzpatrick, who spent more than 20 years with the FBI, said before a federal jury in Boston on Monday. He ultimately recommended that Bulger's file be closed.   On cross-examination, prosecution attorney Brian Kelly asked Fitzpatrick rhetorically, ""You wouldn't go to close a window if it wasn't open right?""  Much of Bulger's trial has been focused on whether he was an open informant for the FBI in Boston for two decades during the time prosecutors say he reigned over crime in South Boston, participating in 19 murders, racketeering, extortion and money laundering -- all of which he has been charged with.   The prosecution previously introduced a 700-page document that suggests Bulger was an informant. That assertion has been the crux of the prosecution's case, which wrapped up Friday.   The defense argues that Bulger had FBI agents on his payroll to protect him from wiretaps and indictments, but he never fed any information to the FBI.   Defense attorney Hank Brennan's line of questioning indicated that Bulger's counsel is attempting to shift the pendulum, and put the FBI on trial for corruption.   The defense called Fitzpatrick, 73, to testify about being called in 1981 to ""stop the leaking in Boston. ""  ""Inside and outside FBI,"" there was a ""leaking of information, causing lots of investigations to go south,"" Fitzpatrick said. He was assistant special agent in charge, head of the drug task force and white collar crime section of the FBI in Boston. Describing himself as a whistle-blower, he detailed instances when he tried to report leaks and corruption within the FBI in Boston.   In one instance, Fitzpatrick testified, the FBI and government strike force attorneys were resisting his efforts to get an FBI informant into the witness protection program.   ""I was getting the impression that people were stonewalling our trying to get Halloran out of harm's way,"" Fitzpatrick said Monday. Brian Halloran, one of Bulger's former associates, agreed to cooperate with the FBI and implicate Bulger in the murder of a wealthy Oklahoma businessman. Two days after Fitzpatrick complained to his superiors that not enough was being done to put the man in witness protection, Halloran was shot to death, along with a friend, Michael Donahue, who was driving him home.   Bulger's ""surrogate son"" and former associate, Kevin Weeks, testified earlier in the trial that ""Jim Bulger just kept shooting,"" describing Halloran's writhing, bullet-ridden body as ""bouncing off the ground."" Bulger was tipped off by his rogue FBI informant handler that Halloran was cooperating with the FBI, according to testimony from disgraced FBI agents.   Fitzpatrick contends he was ultimately forced to resign from his post in Boston because he was being retaliated against after reporting to headquarters that his boss was leaking information about grand jury testimony.   ""The reason I left the FBI is because it was corrupt at that level,"" he said.   On cross-examination, sparks flew as prosecuting attorney Brian Kelly asked Fitzpatrick immediately, ""It's fair to say you are a man who likes to make up stories? ""  Kelly argued that in Fitzpatrick's memoir ""Betrayal,"" the former agent falsely proclaims that he made the arrest of a mafia crime boss. Kelly produced the FBI report in court that made no mention of Fitzpatrick's name in the arrest report.   Fitzpatrick also contends in his book that he recovered the rifle used to shoot Martin Luther King Jr. Prosecutor Kelly brandished the 200-page report on the FBI's website documenting the MLK assassination, which does not make one mention of Fitzpatrick.   ""Where's you?"" Kelly asked Fitzpatrick.   ""I was on the scene when shot was taken,"" he said.   Tension between attorneys is mounting as the trial gets into its final weeks. Kelly used words as ammunition as he read passages from Fitzpatrick's memoir amid a fiery line of questions. Bulger's attorney, J.W. Carney, had to reinforce his partner Hank Brennan's objections at one point, adding, ""Apparently it takes two voices to get Mr. Kelly to stop talking. ""  Kelly got Fitzpatrick to admit that he was not working in the FBI during the time the government began to make its case against Bulger, and said aloud to a very attentive jury, ""you have nothing to do with the charges that bring us here today. ""  Fitzpatrick is still in legal battles for his pension, which he lost as a result of being forced to resign five years early.   On why he titled his book ""Betrayal,"" he said, ""I felt betrayed.   ""I think the government felt betrayed.   ""The FBI was betrayed.   ""The Justice Department was betrayed.   ""There was a lot of betrayal going on. ""  The defense plans to call at least 11 more witnesses, but the attorneys indicated that is subject to change.   Also Monday, Judge Denise Casper heard arguments on a defense motion to sequester the jury. Kelly said that it was ""not necessary"" to suggest this to the jury ""at the 11th hour. ""  Carney replied that there has ""never been a more widely publicized or sensational case in this district,"" harkening to saturated media coverage and ""statements that are so hyperbolic and prejudicial towards the defendant ... unlike anything anyone has seen. ""  Casper has not yet ruled on the motion  Fitzpatrick said he met with Bulger only one time to evaluate him as an informant, and Bulger did not give him any valuable information. He added that the only information he ever gleaned from Bulger came from his FBI file, which was written by Bulger's rogue FBI informant handlers, John Morris and John Connolly.   Connolly is serving time for leaking sensitive information that cost two cooperating witnesses their lives at Bulger's hands. Morris was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony in 1998 in which he confirmed FBI misconduct.   Morris, who reviewed all informant matters at the time, drove Fitzpatrick to a meeting with Bulger in January of 1981. Fitzpatrick said Morris was ""pumping him (Bulger) up"" to Fitzpatrick, saying that Bulger was a ""great guy.""  Morris previously testified he accepted more than $7,000 in cash and gifts from Bulger.   Fitzpatrick said that when he met Bulger in a dark corridor in Quincy, Massachusetts, Bulger was wearing a baseball cap -- ""Boston of course"" -- and sunglasses. Bulger would not shake Fitzpatrick's hand, he said. ""That's not a really nice way to start a conversation. ""  ""Most informants are really trying to help,"" he said. ""They are trying to do the job. I didn't get that from him at first.""   So Fitzpatrick asked him, ""What are you doing for me? ""  During a 30-minute conversation, Fitzpatrick said, Bulger never once gave him any valuable information. ""Basically, he was not giving me info I was trying to get. ... He was not responsive to what I was out there to get. ""  Bulger ""said he was leader of the gang, top guy. That resonated with me because, you know in the FBI, you can't have the head of the gang as an informant, because then you are validating the gang, you are a part of the management, if you will,"" he said.   Fitzpatrick said Bulger told him he would never testify, which is rare for an informant.   ""At one point, he (Bulger) even said, 'I am not an informant.' At that point I made a mental reservation ... 'what am I doing here, what's going on here?'""  Then Fitzpatrick, who thought this was a private meeting, was ""shocked"" to see Connolly, Bulger's rogue FBI informant handler, who ""popped up"" out of nowhere at the meeting, which Fitzpatrick said he was not entitled to attend.   Connolly served time on federal racketeering charges and is now in state prison serving 40 years on related murder charges stemming from his relationship with Bulger. He tipped off Bulger and his crew that an associate, Halloran, was cooperating with the FBI and implicating Bulger in the Oklahoma businessman's murder.   Ultimately, Fitzpatrick recommended Bulger be closed as an informant. Fitzpatrick gave the information to the special agent in charge, who passed the recommendation on to Washington FBI headquarters. Headquarters determined that Bulger was too valuable to taking down the New England Mafia and decided to keep him open.   Morris testified that he wrote a letter to headquarters to persuade them to keep Bulger on as an informant because of all the help he was giving the FBI in taking down the Italian mafia, La Cosa Nostra.   The defense has argued that it was Bulger's partner and henchman Stephen Flemmi who was providing information about the mafia, and that the information was put in Bulger's file so that the FBI could preserve him as an informant.   Fitzpatrick testified that the only information he received from Bulger was information he read in Bulger's informant file, produced by rogue agents Connolly and Morris. He said he never had any reason ""not to trust"" the agents he worked with.",human
"Abbott won Monday's ballot, with 61 out of 102 of his colleagues voting down the motion to remove him, while 39 voted to vacate his position, along with that of his deputy, the Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. The principle of cabinet solidarity meant the prime minister went in to the meeting with nearly 40 votes secured.   Despite a significant block of lawmakers opposing their leader, the Liberal Party's whip, Phillip Ruddock, a former immigration minister, said there was no debate and that ""the result is clear. ""  The meeting originally scheduled for Tuesday was brought forward a day, to prevent the prime minister's detractors caucusing in Canberra ahead of the first week of parliament this year. The move was a ""captain's call"" quipped his nemesis, the immensely popular Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull who was being urged to show his hand and pledge to stand for the top job in the event the motion to vacate the position was successful.   In the end, Turnbull skated close to declaring his candidacy but stopped short. He would now have been obliged to resign from the Cabinet had he done so.   He may well have won the vote, but the fact 39 out of 102 members of the party have declared a lack of confidence in their prime minister leaves Abbott very exposed.  In recent Australian political history, no leader who has faced such a challenge, itself a vote of no confidence, has gone on to survive the wrath of colleagues.   All have eventually been overthrown. But for now Abbott has at least spared himself the indignity of becoming the shortest serving first term prime minister ousted by his own party.   While lawmakers remain angry by his failure to sell the government's first budget, which has stalled in the country's upper house, Abbott has been accused of not consulting his colleagues on big decisions, among them a botched paid maternity leave scheme, widely seen as favoring the wealthy, and the bizarre knighting of Prince Philip.   He seemed to consolidate this view of him as a non-collegiate player by calling Monday's vote a day earlier than anticipated and without apparent consultation, even with his deputy whose job would also have been vacated had the no-confidence vote succeeded.   Australians have looked on at the shenanigans in their capital with a mixture of delight and dismay. Those who dislike the government were divided by a desire to see the end of Abbott's government and the fear that replacing him with Turnbull would spell disaster for the Australian Labor Party's chances at the next election. Others raised concerns about tossing out leaders when unpopular decisions are taken.   News Corp political commentator Paul Kelly noted that the apparently new political culture of tossing out leaders who make unpopular decisions was damaging the ability of government to govern.   ""The politicians will try to deny it -- but our system is moving inexorably into a 'death of reform' straitjacket,"" he wrote.   The 2016 election is likely to be dominated by political advice to Liberal and Labor not to provoke the voters. This will put Australia on a long-run trajectory of decline and growing unhappiness.   There is broad agreement that frequent leadership changes are not good for Australia. But that is no guarantee that Abbott can and will survive to battle the next election. Indeed, Monday's vote suggests strongly he won't.",human
"""We believe your order is causing us to violate our professional ethics. It's morally repugnant to us as defense counsel,"" said Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, head of Hasan's legal team.   He asked for a stay on her order, which would prevent it from going into effect. The judge then asked for a written document from the state bar establishing that continuing to work with Hasan would be an ethical violation.   ""I will make it easy for you. I've given you an order ... and that relieves you of every ethical liability,"" Osborn said.   Poppe would have nothing of it, his voice raised in obvious frustration.   ""The order does not relieve us of the responsibility. ... We believe we are doing something that is morally repugnant. This is not about saving my license ... this is about what you are requiring me to do today: assist this man in achieving the goal, which we believe is achieving a death sentence. ""  The lead prosecutor chimed in, questioning the defense team's claims, saying that Hasan is mounting a legitimate defense.   ""The government sees only two defenses: either 'I didn't do it,' or 'I did it, with an excuse.' He was caught with a gun in his hand,"" said Col. Michael Mulligan.   ""I don't understand how that's repugnant to defense counsel -- I'm truly perplexed. ""  In a military capital trial, a guilty plea is not an option. Hasan's official plea is that he is not guilty of the charges. But on Tuesday, Hasan used his opening statement to declare ""I am the shooter. ""  After the standby counsel argued Wednesday that Hasan was seeking the death penalty, Hasan objected, calling it ""a twist of the facts."" But he refused to submit his objection in writing, a move that Osborn requested to avoid revealing privileged information in open court.   The defense attorneys Thursday immediately appealed Osborn's ruling. But she gave no stay in the meantime. ""We're going to move forward,"" the judge said, allowing the trial to continue unless a higher military court weighs in.   The trial resumed with the prosecution calling to the stand soldiers who were witnesses of Hasan's shooting spree.   The attorneys' request Wednesday halted what would have been the second day of testimony.   Although Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, was granted his request to represent himself, Osborn ruled before the court-martial began that defense lawyers would act as standby counsel during the proceedings.   Expert: Judge can't let attorneys stop  Geoffrey Corn, a military justice expert at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, said the defense lawyers are in ""a terrible predicament. ""  ""They have to stand by and watch the person they are ostensibly charged with assisting to represent himself essentially put a noose around his own neck, and they view this as fundamentally inconsistent with their ethical obligation as lawyers,"" he said.   But Corn said Hasan not only has the right to defend himself, ""he has the right to do it poorly"" -- even to the point of asking for death.   ""The defense lawyers would love to get off this case, because it becomes unbearable,"" Corn said. ""If you imagine having to sit there, being an ardent opponent of capital punishment, watching this guy seal his own fate with every move he makes, it must be torture. But the judge can't let them off the case. ""  Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions  Witnesses describe horror of shooting  Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage. He listened impassively as one of the first witnesses recounted the horror unleashed that November day at a processing center for soldiers heading to Afghanistan and Iraq.   Staff Sgt. Alonzo Lunsford stared hard at Hasan, appearing to brace for a cross-examination from the man who had admitted to shooting him seven times. But Hasan just stared back.   The courtroom turned silent as Lunsford was called as a witness. He was the first of several survivors scheduled to testify against Hasan.   Lunsford recounted how the gunman rose from a chair in the processing center, shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" pulled out a pistol and began shooting.   ""It was a state of panic,"" Lunsford said.   Lunsford, a health care specialist, described how his friend and colleague, physician's assistant Michael Cahill, tried to hit Hasan with a chair to stop the shooting; Hasan shot him dead. Soldiers tried to flee or take cover inside the processing center as Hasan fired dozens of shots.   As Lunsford was checking behind him, ""Major Hasan is turning the weapon on me,"" he said. ""He has a laser on his weapon and it goes across my line of sight and I blink. In that time, he discharges his weapon. The first round, I'm hit in the head. ""  A second shot caught Lunsford in the back. He decided to play dead for a while before changing his mind and deciding to run for the door. He made it out of the building but was shot five more times outside, he testified.   Hasan continued shooting at Lunsford even as he was receiving first aid outside the processing center, before police arrived. Officers shot and wounded Hasan, ending the rampage and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down.   After the prosecution finished questioning Lunsford, the judge asked Hasan whether he had any questions for the witness.   ""I have no questions,"" Hasan said.   Hasan also declined to question Michelle Harper, who worked at the deployment center and was inside when the shooting began. Prosecutors played a recording of her 911 call, where she pleaded for help.   Scheduled to go to Afghanistan  Hasan had been scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan before the killings. Prosecutors hope to show that the devout Muslim had undergone a ""progressive radicalization,"" giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime.   Hasan did not want to deploy to fight against other Muslims and believed ""that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible,"" said Col. Michael Mulligan, the lead prosecutor in the case.   Investigators found 146 spent shell casings in the room where the attack began, Mulligan said. Hasan carried two laser-sighted pistols and 420 rounds of ammunition, his pockets lined with paper towels to muffle the sounds of the magazines banging together, he said.   Internet searches on Hasan's computer used keywords like ""terrorist killing,"" ""innocent,"" ""Quran,"" ""fatwas"" and ""suicide bombings,"" Mulligan said.   Hasan told the panel in his opening statement, ""We mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion."" But, he added, ""I apologize for the mistakes I made in this endeavor. ""  The mujahedeen consider themselves warriors who defend the Islamic faith.   Witness: 'His punishment will come'  Hasan told his family he had been taunted after the al Qaeda attacks of September 11, 2001. Investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni-American radical cleric killed by a U.S. drone attack in 2011.   The case was first set to begin in March 2012, but was delayed repeatedly, notably over a previous judge's unsuccessful demand that the beard Hasan has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved.   Josh Rubin reported from Fort Hood. CNN's Ed Lavandera and Jason Morris contributed to this report.",human
"""It's a cat signal because we see the cat as the symbol of the Internet,"" said Tiffiniy Cheng, co-director of the nonprofit Fight for the Future, which helped organize recent piracy legislation protests and is behind the new site. ""There's this academic theory ... that talks about if you ban the ability of people to share cat photos, they'll start protesting en masse. ""  She added: ""The idea is we're building the infrastructure to put up this cat signal or this bat signal all over the Internet at a moment's notice, with the click of a button. ""  The Internet went haywire in January when Congress was considering two pieces of legislation -- nicknamed SOPA and PIPA -- that aimed to help the government crack down on the online distribution of pirated content.   The English-language version of Wikipedia shut down for 24 hours in protest of the proposed legislation, which died after the digitally based protests.   Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, supported the legislation, along with several movie and music industry groups.   The Internet Defense League says it is targeting two upcoming pieces of legislation, ACTA and CISPA, which take different approaches to regulating pirated content.   The group also will seek promises from U.S. presidential candidates on the subject of Internet openness and legislation, according to Cheng.   ""For the past 10 years at least, tech policy has not been based on what's good for the public interest,"" she said.   The group says it has the support of some big names on the Web, including WordPress, craigslist founder Craig Newmark, Reddit, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Cheezburger Network, which owns several humor blogs.   Cheng declined to comment on whether larger commercial websites like Google and Facebook would consider supporting the effort.   Pundits have wondered whether this is the dawn of a new era for Internet activism, especially from tech and Web companies that, in the past, have been less political.   ""This is the first real test of the political strength of the Web, and regardless of how things go, they are no longer a pushover,"" Tim Wu, from Columbia Law School, told the New York Times during the Web protests in January. ""The Web taking a stand against one of the most powerful lobbyers and seeming to get somewhere is definitely a first.""   The Internet Defense League aims to expand on that energy, alerting supporters to new threats to ""Internet freedom"" when they arise.   A co-founder of the group, Reddit's Alexis Ohanian, explained the idea to Forbes this way:  ""You can only cry 'Oh my gosh, they're going to shut down the Internet' so often. We've scared (Congress) from doing anything as egregious as SOPA and PIPA again. But the new challenge is this endless series of smaller bills that try to unravel Internet rights. ""  On its site, the group pitches its battle against anti-Internet legislation as a sort of duel between all-knowing geeks and uneducated or ""confused"" public officials:  ""Internet freedom and individual power are changing the course of history. But entrenched institutions and monopolies want this to stop. Elected leaders often don't understand the Internet, so they're easily confused or corrupted. ""  It adds: ""With the combined reach of our websites and social networks, we can be massively more effective than any one organization. ""  The Internet Defense League site lets people donate money to the cause and, perhaps more powerfully, rally people for or against certain pieces of legislation.   When there's an Internet ""emergency,"" the group says it will send out snippets of code that will help websites participate in the protests. Cheng said participating companies or bloggers can choose to have messages displayed on their sites automatically or to field the messages on a case-by-case basis.   By creating the code for Web developers to use, Cheng said it become much faster to mobilize people online. That's what made the anti-SOPA Web blackouts so effective, she said.   ""The tool was easy to use. It was a low bar to being used,"" she said. ""That was a turning point because the form of protest was very stark and clear and was an example of what Internet censorship could look like.   "" And these tools allowed us to reach millions of people very quickly. """,human
"Media outlets, including CNN, have been allowed to record and air occasional high-profile appeals in the 9th Circuit and the New York-based 2nd Circuit in recent years. Most other federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have banned photographs and video.   ""The 9th Circuit has a long history of using advances in technology to make the court more accessible and transparent,"" said Chief Judge Alex Kozinski. ""Video streaming is a way to open the court's doors even wider so that more people can see and hear what transpires in the courtroom, particularly in regard to some of our most important cases. ""  Under the new rules, all ""en banc"" oral arguments -- involving 11 judges sitting together in a courtroom at the 9th Circuit -- will be covered live through the court's website. Most such federal appeals are first heard by three-judge panels, and those hearings will not automatically be streamed live.   The losing party at the three-judge stage can ask the court for wider en banc review, and typically involve matters of ""exceptional importance."" The court estimates about 20 en banc cases each year will be streamed live.   Previous 9th Circuit cases that were televised by the media involved California's same-sex marriage ban, electronic surveillance by the government, affirmative action and international terrorism.   The largest and busiest appeals court  All of circuit's 11 courtrooms are equipped with video cameras, and broadcast and cable news outlets have been allowed to access the feeds. About 378 media requests for photographic and video coverage have been granted in the past two decades, said officials.   Among the 13 federal judicial circuits nationwide, the 9th is the largest and busiest, comprising of cases originating in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Arizona and Hawaii, along with Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands.   Most appeals are heard at the James R. Browning Courthouse in San Francisco. Panels also convene occasionally in Pasadena, California; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle.   Many at the 9th Circuit credit Browning for being a nationwide pioneer in bringing technology to improve public access in the courtroom and increase internal efficiency when managing a court's docket.   ""The major innovations in court administration over the past 30 to 40 years, you'll find most of them started through the creative mind of Judge Browning,"" said Judge Sidney Thomas, a longtime colleague who was a 2010 finalist for a Supreme Court seat. ""We had e-mail in the 9th circuit 20 years before anybody heard of the term, and this from a judge who has never been able to operate a computer. ""  Browning served on the circuit from 1961 until his death last year. He was chief judge from 1976 to 1988.   The Judicial Conference, the third branch's policymaking board, allowed federal courts of appeals in 1996 wide discretion to decide for themselves whether to allow cameras in its courtrooms. Three years ago, a pilot program was extended to federal district, or trial, courts. Fourteen such courts nationwide are participating, and nearly 150 civil proceedings are available to be viewed online.   At almost 18,000, the case with the highest viewership involved a 2012 civil trial where several citizens alleged government surveillance of their phone and computer activity. Most federal courtrooms remain accessible for the public to watch in person, but seating can be limited.   Baby steps at the U.S. Supreme Court  As for the highest court in the land, still no cameras, but incremental steps over the years to greater public access. Audio of that week's arguments are now posted Fridays on the Supreme Court's website. It may be the easiest to sample the flavor of public session: only about 330 courtroom seats are available to the public and only on a first-come, first-seated basis.   A little-known fact about the high court is that it has been taping its arguments since 1955, initially in secret. Until three years ago, the audio from one term was not available until the beginning of the subsequent term, a wait of up to a year. And for decades, the only way to hear the reel-to-reel tapes was to go a National Archives and Records Administration annex in Maryland in person and listen on site. Typically only scholars and researchers were allowed access.   Now all oral arguments from 2010 are easily available to listen or download on the website. Earlier Supreme Court cases are available on the website oyez.org, a digital archive run by Professor Jerry Goldman and the Chicago-Kent School of Law.   But don't expect to soon see Justices Antonin Scalia or Sonia Sotomayor in their robes on CNN, mixing it up in the marble courtroom. Despite congressional efforts to introduce cameras there, the justices warn of unintended consequences.   ""Please, senator, don't introduce into the dynamic that I have with my colleagues the insidious temptation to think one of my colleagues is trying to get a sound bite for television,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy told lawmakers in 2007. ""We don't want that. Please don't introduce this into our intercollegial deliberations. """,human
"Credit the strong leadership of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid with keeping a remarkably diverse Democratic Congress together. When you can keep a strong conservative like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia on the same page with the powerfully progressive Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, you are definitely winning.   Meanwhile, the GOP, whose members range from conservative to ultraconservative, is at war with itself and its leaders. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas led the fight on the Senate floor to block consideration of the funding bill. But after a pointless 21-hour talkathon, the majority of his GOP colleagues rejected Cruz's strategy. Senate Republicans split badly and bitterly; 25 voted against Cruz while just 19 voted with him.   In the House, it is chaos. The Neanderthals are fighting the Cro-Magnons and the Homo erectus tough guys are fighting the australopithecines.   Which side is more mainstream?   A majority of voters don't like the Affordable Care Act -- although that's a bit misleading, because a percentage of them dislike it because they think it doesn't go far enough.   I like it -- in fact, I love it -- but that's not the point of this column. Obamacare clocks in at just 29% support in a recent CNBC poll. So you'd think that the Republicans' position of repealing the ACA would be more mainstream. But you'd be wrong.   That same CNBC poll shows that Americans oppose defunding Obamacare, with only a little more than one-third of voters saying they want it defunded. They want to mend it, not end it.   What's worse for the Republicans, when the question shifts to whether you support shutting down the government and/or defaulting on U.S. debt in order to kill Obamacare, the GOP position loses by a crushing 59 to 19 percentage points. When you're down to just 19% of your countrymen and -women supporting your crusade, it's time (as we say in Texas) to pee on the fire and call the dogs: The hunt's over.   That is, no doubt, why the House Republicans have retreated to their new position: delaying Obamacare for a year rather than outright defunding it. But health care delayed is health care denied, and it's a bit of a reach to demand a one-year delay in the president's top domestic priority in exchange for funding the government for 10 weeks.   Which side is more reasonable?   It is hard to seem reasonable when you are pursuing a strategy that even conservative Republicans like Sen. Richard Burr called ""the dumbest idea I've ever heard of."" Keep in mind this is from a man who represents North Carolina, where the Republicans proposed a law barring federal courts from interpreting the Constitution, and allowing the North Carolina Legislature to declare a state religion. (Which might have passed had they chosen the right religion for the Tarheel State: college basketball.)   And yet there is hope for the GOP here. Every time the president says ""I will not negotiate on the debt ceiling"" -- a phrase he utters even more often than ""Just pass me the ball, Joe, I'm open!"" -- he risks looking unreasonable.   As a matter of substance, I strongly agree with his position. But as a matter of rhetoric and positioning, he would be better served to state his position this way: ""I will gladly listen to any idea to improve the Affordable Care Act, or reduce the deficit, or any other ideas my Republican friends might have. But first we have to avoid default. That means paying the bills that Congress has already incurred. Once we've done that we can negotiate on anything. ""  Same substantive position: Negotiations on policy come only after the nation avoids default. But this formulation emphasizes the president's willingness to be flexible on improving the ACA and other Obama priorities.   Of course, nothing is certain in life. But if I were a betting man, I'd bet on President Obama and the Democrats in this fight. As long as Republicans appear more divided, more extreme and more unreasonable, they are going to lose. And then they will look weak as well.   The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.",human

Those who prefer their food cooked can head across the way for the best fried chicken in the city (served over watermelon and fries).   On chilly days there's a potjie, a cast iron cauldron brimming with stew.   Up the stairs is an open-air level with seating that overlooks the neighborhood's pricey new condos and the tangle of train tracks leading to South Africa's main rail hub.   A bit higher up is the fashion level, where racks of leather jackets hang alongside children's dresses printed with Nelson Mandela's beaming smile.   The Braamfontein neighborhood pulls a curious mix of people.   One of the country's most prestigious universities is nearby, along with the Joburg Theatre complex (158 Civic Boulevard St., Johannesburg; +27 11 877 6800) and the headquarters of some of the country's biggest corporations.   A decade ago, Braamfontein felt like it had slipped irretrievably into urban decay.   Now it's one of the most dynamic neighborhoods in the city.   The people who pack into the market are the lifeblood of the small shops and galleries on the surrounding streets, which now do most of their business on Saturdays selling photos taken by street kids, vintage clothing and high-design furniture.   On the east end of downtown, the weekly market at Arts on Main (268 Fox St., Johannesburg; +27 11 334 5947) opened five years ago in a century-old building that was originally a liquor warehouse.   Inside there now, there are craft beers and cocktails to sip every Sunday while shoppers wander aisles of food as cosmopolitan as the city itself.   There's the option of sitting on a stool in a sunny courtyard and enjoying Ethiopian coffee, then moving on to an Argentine barbeque and Italian gelato.   If that doesn't suit, keep walking to find paella, burritos, dim sum and crepes.   This is also one of the city's best places to sample food from around South Africa.   The traditional bread known as roosterkoek cooks on the braai barbecue, waiting to be stuffed with vegetables and meat.   Nearby is a table of curries from Durban, which can be served as ""bunny chow"" inside the hollowed end of a loaf of bread.   There's freshly sliced biltong, the dried meat that could be beef or game.   Out on the sidewalk, there's a braai shack where fresh meats are grilled on the street and served with chips or pap, finely ground corn meal served thick like mash potatoes.   When the eating's done, the rest of the building and neighborhood make for a great walk.   Artists have set up studios and galleries around the warehouse where visitors can buy super-enlarged copies of iconic ""Drum"" magazine covers from the 1950s, see how prints are made or pick up a gorgeously illustrated art book.   The surrounding streets host independent shops and cafes, as well as the city's only art house cinema, the Bioscope (286 Fox St., Johannesburg; +27 11 039 7306).   Staying the night is an option.   There's Curiocity Backpackers (302 Fox St., Johannesburg; +27 728 80 9583), run by the charismatic Bheki Dube, who also organizes walking tours and volunteer experiences.   A step above the backpacking circuit is the nearby 12 Decades Hotel (286 Fox St., Johannesburg; +1 866 332 3590), offering boutique-style lodging in 12 rooms decorated by artists to reflect each decade of Johannesburg's history.   At the opposite end of Fox Street, The Sheds (1 Fox St., Ferreirastown, Johannesburg; + 27 84 057 0015) is the newest of the markets, housed in a complex of former mining warehouses.   From the doorstep visitors can see the offices of the mining companies and banks built on Johannesburg's gold wealth.   Inside, well-tended urban farm beds lead to a dizzying expanse of shopping and dining. Indigenous plants like Kalahari melons are transformed into body creams, while old packets of laundry detergent and potato chips become purses and makeup bags.   It's the food, and drink, that draw in the crowds.   Bartenders pull pints of craft beers, next to an American-style barbecue stand and a taco stall.   There's a curious Latin infusion in many of the food stalls, with an emphasis on spicy salsas and novel chocolate sauces.   And there's the full range of traditional South African market fare, including biltong and fantastic cheeses, but also a surprising selection of bubble teas -- the milky drinks often filled with tapioca pearls or fruit jellies that originated in Taiwan.   The driving force behind The Sheds is Gerald Garner, whose passion for Joburg history has turned into a beloved series of walking tours, books and now this market that aims to turn into more than a weekend event.   They're currently open Thursday through Sunday, with a busy calendar of live music and performances.   Griffin Shea is a writer and traveler based in South Africa.

"And yet we couldn't allow ourselves to be emotional on the stand.   ""We couldn't allow ourselves to show emotion, although I'm sure some came through, and I'm very, very proud of my peers and my jurors that were with us because they did a fantastic job of holding it together. ""  That stoicism in the face of emotional testimony disappeared in the jury room, he said.   Zervakos said the 32-year-old defendant simply did not fit his image of a murderer. ""When you look at a young woman and you think of the crime, and then you see the brutality of the crime, it just doesn't wash,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to divest yourself from the personal, from the emotional part of it. ""  Though the jury did not believe Arias' story that she killed Travis Alexander in self-defense, Zervakos said he believed Alexander abused her. ""I'm very sure, in my own mind, that she was mentally and verbally abused,"" he said. ""Now, is that an excuse? Of course not. Does it factor into decisions we make? It has to. ""  Zervakos said Arias' 18 days on the stand hurt her case. ""She was not a good witness,"" he said. ""There were so many contradicting stories. ""  But he expressed sympathy for her ability to endure her time on the stand. ""I think the way the prosecutor was with her -- he's known for an aggressive style -- I think it was very hard, I think it would be difficult for anybody. ""  A retrial for the penalty phase will begin on July 18, Judge Sherry Stephens said.   Jurors had deliberated since Tuesday on whether Arias should get a death sentence for the 2008 murder.   A source with knowledge of the jury's vote said there was an 8-4 split in favor of sentencing Arias to death.   Jurors refused to talk to reporters and immediately left the courtroom.   The hung jury brought to a close a chapter in the high-profile case, which has lasted for months.   But the trial isn't over. In many states, the death penalty would be off the table if the jury couldn't agree.   Not Arizona.   In a written statement, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said prosecutors ""will proceed with the intent to retry the penalty phase. ""  ""We appreciate the jury's work in the guilt and aggravation phases of the trial, and now we will assess, based upon available information, what the next steps will be,"" he said.   Emotions ran high in the courtroom as the jury's deadlock was announced. Arias appeared to be on the verge of tears. One of Alexander's sisters sobbed.   Even the voice of the normally stoic judge cracked as she dismissed jurors.   ""Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the participants in this trial, I wish to thank you for your extraordinary service to this community,"" she told them. ""This was not your typical trial. You were asked to perform very difficult responsibilities. ""  As the jury filed out of the courtroom, one juror said, ""I'm sorry"" to Alexander's family.   Jurors had deliberated for more than 13 hours in the penalty phase of the trial when they told the court they wouldn't be able to agree on a verdict.   On May 8, the same jurors decided in 15 hours that Arias was ""exceptionally cruel"" when she stabbed Alexander 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face. They pronounced her guilty of first-degree murder.   For Arias to be sentenced to death, a jury's decision must be unanimous.   If Arias is sentenced to death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in Arizona. On Tuesday, she pleaded with jurors to spare her.   She called Alexander's murder ""the worst mistake"" she had ever made, ""the worst thing I've ever done."" She couldn't have imagined herself capable of such a grisly crime, Arias told the jury.   ""But I know that I was,"" she said. ""And for that I'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life -- probably longer.""   Arias was living in Yreka, California, when she met Alexander at a business convention in Las Vegas in September 2006. That November, he baptized Arias into the Mormon faith, a ceremony Arias said was followed by anal sex.   Arias became his girlfriend two months later, she testified. They broke up in the summer of 2007, and Alexander began dating other women.   In June 2008, Alexander missed two appointments, prompting friends to go to his house. They found his naked body crammed in a stand-up shower.   He had been stabbed 29 times in the back and torso and shot in the head. His throat was slit.   After her arrest, Arias told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into Alexander's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped.   Relatives who spoke with police described her as mentally unstable.   The trial, which started in January, has been rife with talk of sex, lies and digital images -- among them graphic autopsy photos.   CNN's Catherine Shoichet contributed to this report.",human
"Using the traditional and mandatory Islamic opening, a voice intoned in Arabic, ""In the name of Allah the most merciful..."" and the centre of the screen began to fill with images and vignettes of all kinds of horrors: those aircraft slamming into the twin towers. US and allied vehicles being destroyed in Iraq and Afghanistan by IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices); video cameras slaved to the sights of Dragunov sniper rifles blasting the heads off GIs and then murdering those who came to their assistance; suicide bombers driving explosive-laden trucks through fences and into buildings or crowds immediately followed by massive explosions. Sometimes such scenes would carry sub-titles giving the date and location of the horror. In other instances, there would be clips of the happy, excited suicide bomber explaining his joy at the prospect of martyring himself for such a noble purpose.   Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants  There would also be clips of their ""Great Emir"", Bin Laden, uttering in his quiet and reasonable sounding voice his latest threats to tear the heart out of the degenerate West. Then some stocky, heavily bearded, white robed and turbaned American, who we were told was Adam Gadahn, a Jewish Californian convert to Islam and Al Qaeda, made his first of many appearances. Gadahn was ridiculing -- in English, with Arabic sub-titles -- the American President and issuing dire warnings aimed at US audiences of the disasters that would befall America if the USA and her allies did not quit ""Muslim lands"".   Read more: Algeria crisis is a wakeup call for America  While Bin Laden was lionized by the young men around us, the star of each show was the brash, in-our-face (and happily defunct) Abou Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian who was the former leader of the Iraqi franchise of Al Qaeda. Zarqawi had walked their talk regarding cleansing ""Muslim lands"" of the presence of infidels with passion, utter ruthlessness and without compromise. He was their man of action. He did, in their view, what others merely talked and fantasized about. The scene the young ones loved best on what we came to call ""TV Night"", was Zarqawi standing, legs planted wide, with a fierce and vicious open-mouthed grin on his face, firing the entire 100 round magazine of a SAW (a Belgian light machinegun), just past the camera with the sound jacked way up. We could almost hear his scream of whatever the Arabic equivalent is of ""GET SOME!""  Read more: Algeria hostage crisis may be future of terrorism  Each time an episode of mayhem and destruction would occur on the screen, the crowd pressing around Louis and me would shout, ""Allahu Akbar"" and immediately swivel their eyes to watch how we were enjoying the show. Without my glasses, I could read none of the signs or sub-titles, so Louis would read them out loud until I quietly asked him to stop. The video did not need a great deal of interpretation.   Obviously, these propaganda videos were intended to pump up the boys, to remind them that they were part of a large global cause in which sacrifice was a major element. And it was having the desired impact; particularly for the younger mujahideen whose eyes glistened with excitement as they watched the Western infidels being butchered and humiliated over and over again. The senior members of the Group were less caught up in the show and the laptop operator was choosing the clips to be displayed with some care. I could only imagine what he was skipping and I did not for a moment presume that they were being avoided out of generosity but rather cold, hard pragmatism. They did not want to break their hostages, at least, not yet.   In many ways, both for the assembled Belmokhtar Group of AQIM, and for me, the scenes that elicited the strongest emotion were the all-too-familiar images of black-hooded, orange-clad figures, chained hand and foot, shuffling around those tiny cages in Guantanamo. These were indignities perpetrated by my side -- the 'good guys'. Those scenes of German Shepherds, fangs bared, straining to get at broken men cowering in corners and those piles of horrified naked bodies forced into obscene intimacy and, always, the iconic black-hooded figure, mutely perched barefoot on a box in a short black poncho with wires dangling from his outstretched fingers in the disgraceful Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, made me, in the midst of my own mental anguish, feel deep shame.   The leaden and menacing stares of our Al Qaeda captors eloquently made a mockery of our aggressive Western claims to harbour higher or superior values. The look on their faces declared that we had abandoned any alleged moral high-ground, which they, at least for the moment, sought to occupy with regard to their treatment of Louis and me, if only to demonstrate to themselves their own moral superiority.   It is therefore at least paradoxical that those wretched videotapes and photos of Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib may have resulted in Louis' and my captivity being less violent than it otherwise might have been, for it seemed to me that we were spared worse treatment because our abductors were anxious to demonstrate that they didn't stoop to such stuff, which, of course, we know is not generally the case. That particular myth, however, with that particular Group of AQIM hostage-takers, probably served us well.   Thus, I found that the most appalling of those TV Night videos images were not the mass murders and individual assassinations perpetrated by Al Qaeda and their allies against our soldiers and civilians, which were never easy to behold, but less difficult to understand. That was simply Al Qaeda being Al Qaeda. That was what they were. Rather, it was the intimate and almost palpable proof of our side's methodically applied, officially sanctioned, and so casually administered barbarity, that had been parsed into the bureaucratic banalities and legal niceties of officially sanctioned abuse and torture which was so hard to absorb. Viewing such scenes, I could not help but believe that if we were capable of such outrages and so carelessly willing to resort to torture-as-entertainment, then we had indeed strayed into truly dangerous ethical territory.   The ease with which faux-legal language was coined in Washington and unopposed throughout the West in a cursory attempt to legitimize the illegitimate; the arbitrary manner in which long-standing international conventions were set aside; and the glibness with which word-games and were employed to condone such practices, should have stunned us all. The methodical development of ""black sites"" and concepts like ""extraordinary rendition"" (sub-contracting torture) and ""enhanced interrogation""; the invention of ersatz juridical explanations of why was not torture, and other such despicable behaviour, indeed made a mockery of our Western pretensions to be champions of human rights and international justice. Further, without a shred of doubt, they have massively increased recruitment to the Islamist cause and markedly amplified the threat against Western interests and the security of individual Americans and their friends and allies.   If the dreadful events of 11 September 2001 could so easily dismantle the bulwarks of free, just and open societies which had taken us centuries to build, then, yes, our claims to a higher moral standard were in fact a sham, and surely there were no effective limits to what we were prepared to visit upon our enemies, or merely anybody who got in our way.   No, these were not made-in-Canada practices, justifications and facilities, but how easily we in our country and our friends throughout Europe abandoned our much-vaunted principles and meekly, often enthusiastically, went along. The bulk of our usually vocal human rights advocates and politicians were muted or stunned into silence when the need to avenge the insult and atrocity of 9/11 was allowed to pervert the law and sully the reputation of our friends and neighbours; perversions which have done and continue to do the West incalculable harm throughout the world. We are clearly guilty by such association. And Louis and I were reaping the consequences.   The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert R. Fowler.",human
"West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed a request for a civil injunction last week in which he alleges that two female students were victims of sexual assaults over the course of the year at the hands of two seventh-grade boys. According to the filing, abuse of the two 13-year-old Burch Middle School students, also in the seventh grade, took place on multiple occasions between November 2012 and May 2013.   The attorney general says in the filing that two boys would work in concert: one would restrain their victim while the other groped her ""breasts, genitalia (and) buttocks. ""  Most of the alleged attacks Morrisey outlines in the filing took place at the school, except for a class trip to the state capital of Charleston, where one of the girls said she was raped.   Names of neither the boys nor the girls have been released, but the attorney general's court filing identifies the suspects as Juvenile 1 and Juvenile 2, and states they are both relatives of employees of the Mingo County school system.   Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney Teresa Maynard told CNN that she first learned of the investigation last week after Morrisey filed the request for an injunction. She said she met with the attorney general on Friday and explained to him that her office must be part of the investigation from now on -- and it didn't take her very long to show that she meant it: Maynard filed juvenile charges against both of the boys on Friday. She would not divulge what those charges were.   Maynard has not brought charges against any other parties, but the attorney general did name a handful of teachers and administrators as defendants in the court filing requesting a civil injunction -- which is not to be confused with the filing of criminal charges.   Attorney General Morrisey declined to be interviewed for this article, but West Virginia State Police Public Information Officer Lt. Mike Baylous explained that a civil injunction -- like the one requested by Morrisey in this case -- is an ""extreme"" court order that is made for the purpose of restraining the defendant -- or in this case, the defendants - from pursuing any conduct that amounts to harassment.   The attorney general made the case in his complaint that he has ample reason to believe that a state investigation would be stymied. As abhorrent as the allegations are themselves, Morrissey says they are not why he is taking this action; he's doing that because, he said ""the overall handling of the allegations was inherently flawed and tainted with conflicts of interest. ""  That may seem like an understatement in a 32-page complaint that details allegations of disappearing evidence, connected suspects, sham investigations, deceitful and vengeful administrators, and refusals to cooperate with law enforcement.   Mingo County, going back to the Hatfield-McCoy days, has earned an unsavory reputation, thanks to nepotism, cronyism and a spectacular history of vendettas and public corruption.   In the last few years Mingo's sheriff was assassinated, its only circuit judge and prosecutor both went to prison on conspiracy charges in an unrelated case, and a county commissioner pleaded guilty to extortion. Just this week, the mayor of the county's largest city pleaded guilty to lying to federal authorities in a workers' compensation case.   Not even the Mingo school system seems to be immune from controversy. Court filings cite repeated examples of school officials allegedly protecting the accused in the seventh-grade sexual assault allegations, and claim that ""a relative of (one of the boys) was directly involved in the handling and investigation into the allegations against (him), and involved in decisions relating to the discipline/punishment of the male juvenile offenders. ""  That investigation, according to Morrisey's injunction request, was ""ineffective, non-existent, (and) designed (to) illicit contradictory and/or less incriminating statements from the female victims. ""  When punishment was doled out, the attorney general characterized it as a mockery. In one instance, for example, a school official ""'disciplined' (the boys) for the alleged abuse of a female student by denying them a break for ice cream during statewide testing,"" the attorney general's court filing said.   The attorney general says the problems go beyond alleged efforts to sweep the accusations under the carpet. Morrisey's complaint said Burch Middle School teachers and administrators ""threatened (the girls) with discipline"" to dissuade them from coming forward, and the alleged victims were retaliated against when they did.   The day after one of the alleged victims alerted state police in April 2014, she was written up for bullying. Morrisey wrote that the ""bullying"" was actually the victim blocking her Facebook account from the niece of a teacher at the school. The next day she was written up again, this time for ""insubordination,"" according to the filing.   The attorney general alleges that the other victim says she was targeted as well: the injunction request states that a high-ranking Burch official ""retaliated against (her) by removing her from her classes and placing her in other classes that were below her academic level. ""  When West Virginia State Police showed up at Burch on April 24, the principal refused to allow a trooper to take a statement from a possible third victim, according to the court filing. The principal ""went an additional step further and informed the State Trooper investigating the alleged sexual abuse at the school that he could no longer take statements from students at Burch Middle School because it 'disrupted the learning environment.' ""  CNN tried repeatedly to reach the teachers and administrators at Burch Middle School named in the filing for comment on the allegations, but multiple e-mails and phone messages were never returned.   Jason Long, the attorney representing the Mingo County Board of Education and the Mingo County school superintendent, released a statement that said ""the Mingo County Board of Education is committed to working with the attorney general's office to resolve this investigation in a timely manner. The hearing today gathered everyone involved and opened a dialogue. We take these allegations very seriously. Be assured our goal is to create a safe learning environment for all students of Mingo County. ""  CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.",human
"It is also a question roiling the current political debate, especially among tea party conservatives in this post-9/11, security-conscious environment.   The justices are using this case to explore the limits of congressional and presidential authority, with timely, far-reaching implications.   ""It would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much energy criticizing Syria,"" for its government's alleged use of chemical weapons in an ongoing civil war, said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, ""when if this court were now to declare that our joining or creating legislation to implement the treaty was unconstitutional. We're putting aside the impact that we could have on foreign relations. ""  Professor accused of poisoning wife  ""I just would like a fairly precise answer whether there are or are not limitations on what Congress can do with respect to the police power,"" Chief Justice John Roberts asked of the Obama administration's top lawyer. ""If their authority is asserted under a treaty, is their power to intrude upon the police power unlimited?""  Bond, a native of Barbados, lived outside Philadelphia and worked as a microbiologist. As a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case: ""Bond was excited when her closest friend, Myrlinda Haynes, announced she was pregnant. Bond's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband, Clifford Bond, was the child's father. She vowed revenge. ""  The woman, known to her family as Betty, struck back by stealing dangerous a chemical -- arsenic-based 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine -- from her company. She also obtained potassium dichromate over the Internet. Both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic, even lethal harm with very little physical contact.   The 42-year-old then tried to poison Haynes some two dozen times over several months, secretly sprinkling small amounts of the chemicals on an apartment doorknob, car door handles, and a mailbox.   While suffering no more than a chemical burn on her thumb, Haynes grew suspicious -- one of the chemicals was a bright orange powder. After getting little help from local police, in 2007 she called postal inspectors, who set up surveillance cameras. Bond was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and a car muffler, court records show. She was soon arrested.   Bond admitted her guilt early on and claimed she never meant to kill Haynes, but only wanted to cause her ""an uncomfortable rash."" The defendant also said her friend's betrayal caused an ""emotional breakdown"" that made her respond in such a shocking fashion.   Instead of being charged with simple assault, which may have gotten her six months to a year or two in state prison, Bond was indicted in federal court on two counts of mail fraud and -- the bombshell -- two counts of violating a federal law and international treaty on the possession and use of ""chemical weapons. ""  When a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court, Bond pleaded guilty and immediately appealed. She received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $12,000 in fines and restitution. She was released in August 2012.   Did Utah doctor kill his wife?   During Tuesday's lively hour of arguments, Bond's lawyer, Paul Clement, called the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act an ""odd statute"" that clearly exceeds congressional authority. He said the treaty was designed to deal with ""warlike"" behavior, not ""ordinary"" poisoning cases.   ""I don't think that nation-states poison romantic rivals, attempt to commit suicide, or try to get rodents out of their houses"" using chemicals that might have everyday non-criminal uses, he said, like vinegar.   Justice Elena Kagan was unconvinced. ""You are imagining a world in which judges day-to-day try to get inside the head of treaty makers,"" where judges might say: ""We understand that there's a national interest in regulating sarin gas, but we don't think that there's a sufficient interest in regulating some other chemical down the line. It seems to me a completely indeterminate test"" for judges to delineate ""what is in the national and international interest. ""  Solicitor General Donald Verrilli agreed, defending the treaty and law by saying, ""There can't be a 'too local' exception to the treaty power. ""  The Justice Department says federal law broadly prohibits a person from knowingly using a chemical weapon in a way that can ""cause death, temporary incapacitation, or permanent harm"" to another person, which prosecutors said Bond admittedly did.   Verrilli dismissed a ""parade of horribles""-- hypothetical suggestions that a sweeping treaty could be authorized giving the federal government complete police power over the states.   ""It seems unimaginable that a convention of that kind would be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate, which it would have to be,"" he said.   ""It also seems unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution,"" against Bond, said Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""But let's leave it at that."" The remark brought laughter in the courtroom, but Kennedy clearly was not joking.   Test your knowledge of the U.S. Supreme Court  Justice Antonin Scalia used the issue to delve into another controversial issue.   ""Let's assume that an international treaty is approved by two-thirds of the Senate and the President, which requires states to approve same-sex marriage. All right?"" he said. ""Now, if that were a self-executing treaty, same sex marriage would have to be approved by every state. If it is not self-executing, however, it will be up to Congress to produce that result, and Congress would do it by having a federal marriage law. ""  The conservative Scalia said to do so would be ""dragging the Congress into areas where it has never been before. ""  ""If you told ordinary people that you were going to prosecute Ms. Bond for using a chemical weapon, they would be flabbergasted,"" said Justice Samuel Alito. ""This statute has an enormous breadth -- anything that can cause death or injury to a person or an animal. Would it shock you if I told you that a few days ago my wife and I distributed toxic chemicals to a great number of children? On Halloween we gave them chocolate bars. Chocolate is poison to dogs, so it's a toxic chemical under the chemical weapons convention."" Again there was audience laughter, but no smiles from the bench.   Justice Stephen Breyer also worried about the scope of federal power.   ""In principle your position constitutionally would allow the President and the Senate, not the House, to do anything through a treaty that is not specifically within the prohibitions of the rights protections of the Constitution,"" he told Verrilli, citing a 1920 high court precedent giving Congress the power to enact treaties, even if it steps outside its traditional constitutional authority by usurping state laws. ""And I doubt that in that document the Framers (of the Constitution) intended to allow the President and the Senate to do anything.""   ""I am worried about that and I think others are, too,"" the left-leaning Breyer added.   Among those attending the arguments was former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.   Justices prepare for hot-button cases - and hot internal rhetoric  There are about a thousand treaties signed by the United States currently on the books.   Many academics and lawmakers hope the majority right-leaning bench will use this opportunity to delve further into the scope of the 10th Amendment, which states, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. ""  In the broader political context, a bipartisan sphere of Americans worry the federal government and Congress have been overly aggressive in staking claims to disputes they believe are best left to states, especially in the criminal arena.   And it is not just felonies. Areas like gun ownership, zoning laws, environmental regulations, taxation, health care, and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of this high court decision.   Some of Bond's supporters argue that some federal prosecutions are novel and the penalties are often more harsh, creating conflict and confusion with local efforts to ensure public safety. They see Bond as an unexpected hero in the fight to return ""the power back to the people. ""  ""The proposition that the Treaty Clause is a trump card that defeats all of the remaining structural limitations on the federal government is not a proposition that is logically defensible."" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said last week.   Bond had won an earlier Supreme Court appeal, with a unanimous ruling she had ""standing,"" or legal authority, to pursue her claims in the courts. That allowed her to continue trying to have her federal conviction tossed out, which is the current issue before the justices.   Her lawyers say she had been trying in recent years to repair her shaken marriage, and has come to terms with her husband's betrayal.   The case is Bond v. U.S. (12-158). A ruling is expected by the spring.",human
"That was unusual back then when most professors graded on the bell curve and only a handful of the best students received an A. Some actually failed and most received grades of B or C.  But in the case of this particular professor everybody got an A. As a test, I surreptitiously enrolled a fictitious student into the roster of his next class. This ""nobody"" never came to class, never wrote a term paper and never took an exam. At the end of the semester the mysterious student received an A.  That led to a discussion with the professor. In a tone of righteous indignation he claimed I had overstepped my bounds to play such a trick on him. With righteous indignation I claimed that he had underperformed as a professor by acting in a reckless manner, grading his students with careless abandonment. Steam came out of both our ears. I believed his actions were a mark of failure in academic responsibility.   Grades serve several purposes. They are a tool that measures a student's progress in relation to others in a class; they allow financial aid and scholarship committees to assess merit; and they culminate in a 4-year overall performance record in the form of a college transcript. Academic strengths and weaknesses are discovered over a period of time.   To some extent Harvard's faculty have abandoned their responsibilities to their students as well as to those who wish to judge their students: Admission officers at law and medical school; faculty selecting graduates to mentor them for advanced degree programs; employers deciding between applicants for jobs.   Decades ago, professors were often characterized by their students on the severity of their grading. Professor Smith is a tough grader -- no one gets an A. Or, Professor Jones is an easy grader -- no one fails. What can be said today? All the professors are easy marks as well as easy markers.   Why give everyone an A? When the admissions office puts together a freshman class full of high school valedictorians who have perfect grades and SAT scores, there is no doubt they are bringing capable students to the campus. But the power has shifted from the faculty to the students and a new form of entitlement on the part of students has developed.   If students are paying $55,000 a year, they may feel they have paid for the As in dollars as well as sense. Is there an unspoken academic transaction that is filtering into the university landscape now that tuition prices are in the stratosphere? Has higher education morphed into a consumer business in which the customer is always right? It seems like it.   First, universities have to compete for students in the marketplace. Then faculties do the same after students enroll. Professors want to be popular. They want good ratings from students at the end of semester reviews just as the students want good grades from them. Gut courses, once the exception, have become more common.   Faculty tenure, promotions and raises may turn on such matters right along with publications and other measures. University life, long a contact sport, has been upgraded to a blood sport. It's become a ""dog-eat-dog"" business in which departments try to fill quotas for majors.   And then there are the parents who are quick to speak out if they think their sons or daughters are under appreciated.   Is there a solution that can stop grade inflation? Yes, of course.   In 2004, Princeton readjusted their grading system instructing the faculty not give more than 35% of their undergraduate students A or A- grades, and apparently Yale is currently discussing a similar adjustment. Harvard faculty should construct a ladder that has a rung at the bottom, middle and top.   Last week, I had the privilege to chair the Rhodes Scholarship selection committee for the D.C., Maryland, North Carolina district. We interviewed 13 semi-finalists and selected 2 award winners. All 13 were exceptional; the final decision came down to the splitting of hairs. Out of the 32 Rhodes Scholars named across the United States, Harvard students came away with 6, an impressive outcome however one slices the pie. Perhaps they are all A students. But now we know many Harvard students receive As.   The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Joel Trachtenberg.",human
"""  Instead the senator will seek a second term in the Senate, where he thinks he can ""play the most constructive role. ""  Bush is ""thinking""  Jeb Bush reiterated that he's still considering a presidential run, revealing more details Monday about his decision-making process.   ""I'm thinking about running for president, and I'll make up my mind in short order,"" the former Florida governor said at an event hosted by the Wall Street Journal.   He said he's determining whether his candidacy could ""lift people's spirits and not get sucked into the vortex,"" adding that he's also questioning if ""the sacrifice for my family is tolerable. ""  Son says Jeb Bush 'more than likely' eyeing 2016 run  With Bush considered a potential frontrunner, the rest of the GOP field is eagerly awaiting his decision. Those perhaps most interested include Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who was mentored by Bush, and other candidates who appeal to moderate Republicans, like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.   ""I don't know if I'd be a good candidate or a bad one,"" Bush said. ""I kind of know how a Republican can win. ""  Ben Carson on the verge of becoming a political phenomenon  A renowned neurosurgeon who's become popular in conservative circles, Ben Carson is still climbing up the charts, according to a new CNN/ORC International Poll. Carson came in second place behind Mitt Romney in the survey, which measure support for potential 2016 contenders.   Carson rose to political fame after publicly chiding the direction the country was going during his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 2013. President Barack Obama was sitting just a few feet away.   Since then, he's been likened to a rockstar among conservatives, and he's become the only African-American Republican expressing interest in a 2016 presidential run. His abhorrence for political correctness has also made him a favorite among radio talk shows.   ""I try to talk about what I actually see that's going on and this is what we need in America,"" he told CNN's Mark Preston for a profile piece. ""We need people who are not afraid to express themselves and who are not afraid to debate issues. ""  In the interview, Carson said that if the right candidate emerges before May 1, he won't run for the White House.   Rand Paul is definitely running in 2016 ... for the Senate  While Sen. Rand Paul has been saying for more than a year that he plans on running for a second term in the Senate, the Kentucky Republican made it official Tuesday.   But he has a bumpy road ahead. Kentucky election law allows candidates to appear on a ballot only once at a time, making it difficult for Paul if he also runs for president â€” a decision he told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he's about ""four to six months"" away from making.   His allies in the state Senate tried to help him by passing a bill that tweaks the law, but the measure stalled in the Democratic-controlled state House.   Still, Paul has other options, including a possible court challenge or convincing the state GOP to change its nominating system in 2016 from a primary to a caucus. That way, his name wouldn't appear on a ballot. Or, he could just not appear on the ballot at all and forego Kentucky's delegates.   It's unclear which direction he'll take, but expect Democrats to seize on Paul's attempt to run for two offices.   ""Where I come from, people think if you can't make up your mind on which office you want to run for, then you ain't fit to serve in either one,"" Kentucky House Speaker Greg Stumbo told CNN.   Chris Christie wins high praise from Iowa's top Republican  In a bizarre 2016 storyline, Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a popular bill that would have banned gestation crates that severely limit the mobility of pigs in New Jersey.   While his decision drew strong pushback from animal rights activists and other supporters, the veto kept Christie in high standing with Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa. The Hawkeye State is the nation's top pork producer.   Branstad, who holds significant influence in Iowa's first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest, said Monday that Christie's veto was a ""good decision,"" adding that he personally lobbied Christie to reject the bill.   Christie said he vetoed the bill because it was a ""solution in search of a problem"" and a ""political movement masquerading as substantive policy. ""  But his opponents say the decision was simply a political ploy with 2016 ambitions on his mind. Democratic state Sen. Ray Lesniak, a strong backer of the bill, pledged that the state legislature would attempt to override the veto, according to NJ.com.   Mitt Romney's hair. Enough said.   One can hardly write about 2016 without mentioning Romney and the latest earth-shattering news that his picture perfect hair is -- wait for it -- not always perfectly coiffed.   The bombshell was revealed by his wife, Ann Romney, on Twitter during Thanksgiving weekend.   Disheveled or not, he's still the most favored potential Republican contender, carrying 20% support among Republican voters in CNN's latest poll, with other names getting 10% or less.   He may have said a thousand times in the past two years that he's not running again, but until someone else emerges as a frontrunner, voters are poised to keep him as their top choice.   What Mitt Romney learned running for president: Debating is 'sweaty business'  Oh, right. And Newt Gingrich said this.   Talking about the emerging field, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who ran for president in 2012, didn't rule out the idea of another run.   ""I haven't totally closed the door, but I'm certainly not opening it,"" he said Tuesday on CNN's ""Wolf.""  He later added that it's actually ""very implausible"" and that he ""doubts very much"" he'll ""end up in that game. ""  ""But that tells you how early it is,"" he said.   CNN's Jeremy Diamond, Dana Bash, Eric Bradner, and Mark Preston contributed to this report.",human
"Ottawa's Communications Security Establishment Canada, or CSEC, did not comment to the CBC, according to that news outlet.   When similar reports have surfaced in the past. U.S. government officials have pointed to the Obama-ordered review of America's intelligence gathering -- which gained steam after reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been spied on -- but refused to comment on specific claims.   But they also have not backed away from the idea that the U.S. spies, just like other nations do.   ""As we have made clear, ... the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations,"" said NSA spokeswoman Caitlin Haden in October, when the Merkel reports stirred tensions between traditional allies in Germany and the United States.   The new CBC reporting does not specify which world leaders, if any, were targeted during the G8 and G20 summits, or what specific information may have been obtained.   Nor does the Canadian news outlet's account of the NSA documents spell out what role, if any, the CSEC had in it. If that Canadian agency had been complicit in snooping on anyone -- be they Canadians or foreign nationals -- without a warrant, it could violate that North American nation's laws, the CBC reports.   G8 summits are meetings of world leaders from the Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, the European Union and the United States. G20 summits incorporate a larger group, traditionally taking place once or twice each year.   During these meetings, leaders traditionally discuss a wide range of important and sometimes hot-button issues. At the end of 2010's G8 summit in Toronto, for example, the group issued a final statement focusing on recovery from a global economic crisis while also criticizing Iran and North Korea.   The fact that Snowden is linked to the CBC's report isn't a big surprise.   The now 30-year-old worked as an information technology contractor for the U.S. government. He collected information on his native country's spy programs, then exposed them to media outlets such as the Guardian and the Washington Post.   Some of the reported leaks -- like that the National Security Agency mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States -- put the Obama administration on the defensive, trying to justify its spying programs while assuring Americans of their privacy. Others, like the claims that Merkel was spied on for years, forced Washington to do damage control with leaders of countries overseas.   U.S. authorities have charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property. But they haven't arrested him: Instead, he is in Russia, which on August 1 granted him asylum for one year.   This isn't the first time that documents from Snowden have been linked to G20 spying.   Britain's electronic intelligence agency monitored G20 delegates' phones and tried to capture their passwords during a summit held there in 2009, the Guardian newspaper reported, citing documents obtained from Snowden.",human

"""  The letter, published in German by Der Spiegel, was written on Friday in Moscow and provided to Der Spiegel through a ""locked channel,"" the news magazine said. It was published in German and has been translated by CNN.   Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified NSA documents, which revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e-mails and telephone calls in the United States and monitor the cell phone and Internet activity of overseas residents. He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges.   A recent report by Der Spiegel, citing documents provided by Snowden, alleged the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens.   The allegations have prompted some European countries to call for investigations. It also has prompted congressional hearings in the United States, where some are calling for more transparency and more oversight of American spy programs.   Opinion: Don't underestimate risks of government spying  'Witch hunt'  The letter also accused governments of trying to squash debate about mass surveillance ""with a never before seen witch hunt"" that threatens journalists and criminalizes the publication of details about the programs.   In the letter, Snowden purportedly writes that his actions were bringing about change.   ""The debate they wanted to avoid is now taking place in countries around the world,"" the letter said.   ""And instead of causing damage, the use of this new public knowledge is causing society to push for political reforms, oversight and new laws. ""  Snowden has been in Moscow since June after fleeing from Hong Kong. In August, Russia granted him asylum for one year.   Snowden gets website job in Russia  The release of the open letter is the second in a matter of days from Snowden, who released a letter to German authorities through an intermediary.   Last week, Hans-Christian Stroebele, a member of Germany's parliament, met with Snowden in Russia. Stroebele returned from the meeting with a letter from Snowden to German authorities, which was distributed to the media.   In it, Snowden said he is confident that with international support, the United States would abandon its efforts to ""treat dissent as defection"" and ""criminalize political speech with felony charges. ""  ""I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of fact regarding reports in the media, particularly in regard to the truth and authenticity of documents, as appropriate and in accordance with the law,"" he wrote.   Report: Snowden's Russia asylum not breached by NSA spying reports  'Face justice'  The White House did not immediately respond to Snowden's claims in the letter.   But earlier Sunday, White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on ABC's ""This Week"" that there has been no discussion of granting Snowden clemency.   ""Mr. Snowden violated U.S. law,"" Pfeiffer said. ""And our belief has always been that he should return to the U.S. and face justice. ""  It was a sentiment echoed by the heads of the House and Senate intelligence committees.   ""He had an opportunity -- if what he was, was a whistle-blower -- to pick up the phone and call the House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and say, 'I have some information,'"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation. ""  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said Snowden has to ""own up with what he's done. ""  ""If he wants to come back and open up to the responsibility of the fact that he took and stole information, he violated his oath, he disclosed classified information -- that by the way has allowed three different terrorist organizations, affiliates of al Qaeda to change the way they communicate -- I'd be happy to have that discussion with him,"" Rogers said on ""Face the Nation.

"The Israeli government blamed Hamas, which denied responsibility but praised the abductions. Israel carried out arrests and demolished homes of the suspects in the West Bank, and launched airstrikes against targets in Gaza that are used to lob rockets into Israel. Palestinians stepped up rocket attacks and clashed with Israeli troops.   Has the Middle East crisis reached a tipping point?   When was the Palestinian teen killed?   On Wednesday, according to his family, Mohammad Abu Khedair was headed to a mosque in his middle-class neighborhood of Shuafat, part of eastern Jerusalem, which is populated by Arabs. Three people in a car forced him inside, according to authorities and family members. He was reported missing and, about an hour later, his body was found in a forest in Jerusalem. Israel vowed a swift investigation and condemned the killing. Still, clashes erupted in the usually quiet Shuafat neighborhood. Residents threw rocks at security forces, and Israeli authorities responded with occasional volleys of stun grenades or tear gas. Some protesters also attacked two fellow Palestinians whom they mistook for undercover Israeli police.   Israel announced over the weekend that several Jewish suspects had been arrested and that there was ""strong indication"" the killing may have been in revenge for the three Israeli teens' deaths. The clashes are the worst the city has seen in a decade.   Israel has condemned the killings of five teens. Who's the fifth?   Israel announced over the weekend that a taxi driver had confessed to killing an Israeli Jewish teen in May. Shelly Dadon, 19, was kidnapped, stabbed to death and left in an abandoned parking lot. The suspect's motivation was believed to be Palestinian nationalism, Israeli police said. In the Knesset, Israel's parliament, lawmakers unanimously condemned the deaths of all five young people, The Jerusalem Post reported.   Who's the beaten teen?   Tariq Abu Khdeir is from Florida. He was visiting his relatives in Jerusalem when his cousin, Mohammad Abu Khedair, was killed. Two videos posted online Thursday show Tariq Abu Khdeir beaten by men wearing the uniform of Israeli security forces. The videos do not show what led to the beating.   There's a dispute over what transpired. Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said Khdeir was among six masked people who threw petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails, and three of whom had knives. Still, that would not excuse ""any excessive use of force,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday."" Khdeir says he was watching protesters and was ""attacked."" A court has ordered him to house arrest for nine days at a relative's home in a different neighborhood. His mother says the family plans to sue Israeli authorities. Physically, he's ""doing a lot better,"" a family lawyer in Florida told CNN on Monday.   Will this spark a 'third Intifada'?   That's a question being raised by some in the region as well as global media. The term refers to two previous armed uprisings by Palestinians against Israel. The first began in 1987 and ended in 1993 with the signing of the Oslo accords. The second lasted from 2000 to 2005.   ""A third intifada is likely if Palestinians fail to distance themselves from the militants following the cold-blooded murder of three Israeli teenagers,"" the Telegraph's Con Coughlin wrote last week after their bodies were found.   ""Put simply, there are solid reasons to fear that a third intifada could be far more bloody than the uprisings that have gone before. Which means the task facing leaders on all sides could not be clearer: they have to calm this situation, not inflame it,"" The Guardian's Jonathan Freedland wrote Friday.   But Haaretz reported that ""many East Jerusalem officials expect the turmoil to die down."" It noted that West Bank cities have not joined the violent protest.   To some Palestinians, the intifada is the ongoing effort against Israel. ""The blood of our martyrs is precious ... and is fuel for the intifada and the resistance,"" Mushir Al-Masri, a Hamas leadership figure and member of the Palestinian parliament, wrote Monday on Facebook.   What are Palestinian leaders saying?   Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas surprised many when he condemned the kidnappings of the three Israeli teens. He faced heated criticism from fellow Palestinians for doing so. ""Hamas, which is now part of the Palestinian Authority government in a unity deal with Fatah, made no effort to conceal its glee,"" columnist Frida Ghitis noted on CNN.com. Khaled Meshaal, Hamas political chief, told Al Jazeera after the Israeli teens' disappearance, ""I congratulate the abductors because our prisoners must be freed from the prisons of the occupation. ""  Palestinian leaders have called for an end to ""collective punishment"" by Israel, including the demolishing of homes and other military actions. And some have called on Israel to demolish the homes of those behind the killing of Abu Khedair. Palestinian leaders have also condemned the killings of people in Israeli military actions. Israel says it is focused on terrorist networks. More than 150 rockets from Gaza have hit Israel in less than a month, and ""terrorists from Gaza opened fire at an (Israel Defense Forces) vehicle patrolling the security fence,"" the IDF tweeted Monday.   Is anyone calling for peace?   Yes. In recent days, Israelis have held anti-racism rallies to counteract hatred on both sides, including groups of Israeli Jews who were seen yelling ""Death to Arabs"" after the Israeli teens' killings. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on Palestinian and Arab leaders to join his public calls for an end to the killings. ""We don't differ between terror and terror, and against both we will act harshly. And I don't differ between incitement and incitement in the state of Israel,"" he said Sunday, adding, ""We will not let extremists -- it doesn't matter from which side -- bring bloodshed to the area. ""  Last week, the family of Frankel, the slain Israeli-American teen, also condemned Khedair's killing. Frankel's uncle Yishai Frankel, who works to bring Palestinians into Israel's high-tech sector, said he feels as good as ever about ""the good people"" he works with. ""It's no secret that every society has bad people,"" he said.   And the family attorney for beaten teen Tariq Abu Khdeir told CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday, ""We need, really, all sides right now to just stop this disgusting cycle of violence where innocent children, both on the Israeli and Palestinian side, are being killed and injured almost daily nowadays. ""  What does all this mean for peace efforts?   It's unclear whether there's been any real progress toward substantive peace talks in recent years, with each side blaming the other for preventing them. In April, The Economist called it ""a peace process that is going nowhere. ""  Israelis and Palestinians may have grown further apart in what they're hoping for. Most Israelis support a two-state solution, according to a new poll by the Dialog Institute, Haaretz reported Monday. But a June poll of Palestinians, taken during the search for the three missing Israeli teens, found that fewer than 30% of Palestinians support a two-state solution. Sixty percent say the five-year goal ""should be to work toward reclaiming all of historic Palestine, from the river to the sea,"" the Washington Institute for Near East Policy found. But the majority support nonviolent methods of ""popular resistance. ""  For now, the focus for all those opposing the violence is calming anger in the short term -- and stopping the killing.",human
"Finally, word came from Green on Wednesday evening that every child that had been stuck was on a bus and headed home.   That included the 2,000 Fulton County Schools students and 400 Atlanta Public Schools kids who had stayed at their schools overnight.   Facing critics who ask how fewer than 3 inches of snow could cripple the city, especially after it tangled with another debilitating storm in 2011, Mayor Kasim Reed assured Atlantans the city was working to open roads and asked them to stay at home.   ""What I want to say to them is hold off on trying to get to them. What I can assure (you) is they are safe,"" he said. ""The safest place for them was in the school system. ... I know it is very tough. ""  There were uplifting stories amid the chaos, however, as the city schools' Twitter feed and a specially created Facebook page, SnowedOutAtlanta, which had more than 52,000 members as of Wednesday night, showed a steady stream of gratitude alongside the messages of frustration.   At E. Rivers Elementary School, about 150 students and teachers spent the night on gym mats, according to CNN affiliate WSB. They watched movies, ate a warm meal Tuesday night and were served French toast for breakfast, the station reported.   Was Atlanta asleep at the wheel?   One father, who identified himself only as Mark, said he walked 6 miles to spend the night with his 5-year-old daughter, Elizabeth. He said it put his mind at ease to see how the school staff was taking care of the youngsters.   ""It was fantastic. All the students seemed like they were having a great time,"" he told WSB. ""It looked like a very large sleepover party.""   Added young Elizabeth, ""We got to watch four or five movies. ""  Heartwarming stories were heavily outnumbered by those from worried parents who had to spend the night without their children.   Corliss Collins, for instance, said she spoke to her granddaughter, one of about 200 students who spent the night at New Manchester High School in Douglasville, west of Atlanta, around 8 a.m. The granddaughter ate dinner and breakfast there, but told her grandmother that school officials were asking parents to pick up their children because the cafeteria had run out of food, Collins said.   Principal Constance Craft told CNN there was no truth to reports the school had no food.   ""We are trying to get teachers who have been here since early morning yesterday home to their families. Our manpower is exhausted, and our children are ready to be home,"" she said in an e-mail.   Craft later added that the National Guard troops who helped escort the students home were ""wonderful."" All students had been sent home by lunchtime Wednesday, she said.   In West Atlanta, about 60 students from Riverwood International Charter School remained at a Kroger supermarket Wednesday morning after being transported there from their buses, which were stuck on I-285, said store employee Kim Bradley. The store provided food for them, she said.   About 90 high school students were initially taken there overnight in ambulances, with Highway Emergency Road Operators clearing a path, the state Department of Transportation said. The four buses were evacuated about 6 a.m. after being stuck in ice and traffic all night, the department said.   A total of 51 schoolbuses ""needed support"" because of the snow and ice, said Matthew Kallmyer, director of Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency Management Agency.   Other reports from Georgia and Alabama include:  -- Eight students from Marietta City Schools, northwest of Atlanta, spent the night in the school bus depot, and 669 students spent the night at eight schools in the system, said spokesman Thomas Algarin. The system was working to get them all home, he said Wednesday morning.   ""Our schools were prepared for this,"" Algarin said, adding that Marietta High School's culinary team a ""terrific gourmet meal last night. ""  -- Schools in Cherokee County, Georgia, north of Atlanta, reported 150 students remained at 11 schools as of Wednesday morning. The number had dwindled to 10 as of 12:15 p.m. ET.   ""Students are being kept safe, warm and fed, and staff are doing their best to keep them entertained with movies, games, books and other activities,"" spokeswoman Barbara Jacoby said in a statement.   -- In Georgia's Paulding and Douglas counties, west of Atlanta, schools reported about 1,800 collective students were sheltered at county schools, CNN affiliate WXIA reported. In Douglas County, the schools offered shelter to people had gotten stuck on the roads or walked to the schools, the station reported.   -- In Hoover, Alabama, one bus with 61 children was stuck until 6 a.m. ET, but the kids were safe, said spokesman Jason Gaston, and another stranded bus had its 21 occupants moved to a local children's hospital.   About 4,000 students and 350 adults -- including some community members who couldn't make it home -- were sheltered in Hoover schools Wednesday morning, Gaston said, adding that the cafeteria was well stocked and the schools were prepared to host those in need until the roads cleared. Students were watching movies and playing video games, he said.   iReporter Monica Cantwell said she spent the night in her office at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and her 13-year-old daughter was stuck at her middle school in Hoover.   The school separated the kids by gender and put them into small groups at bedtime. The kids were playing games and watching videos in the gym and watching videos, she said, and her daughter had texted her to say was bored and none too thrilled to be spending the night on campus.   -- As of 8 a.m., at least 1,400 students spent the night in Birmingham, Alabama-area schools, and none spent the night on buses because they were either shuttled back to school or picked up by parents, said Jefferson County Emergency Management officer Bob Ammons.   Steve Smith, associate superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools, told CNN that roughly 1 million people attempted to go home Tuesday, gnarling traffic on Atlanta's roads and highways.   ""The storm was much more intense than anyone knew, and even with our efforts of early dismissal, we still ran into the challenge of having the gridlock,"" he said.   Smith declined to say when the students would be home but said they'd be reunited with their parents as soon as conditions allowed it.   Could the city have handled the situation better? Sure, he said.   ""There's always room for improvement, but we're just appreciative of our parents who have been understanding and patient with us, and our bus drivers have really been the heroes in this situation. They've made some real sacrifices,"" he said. ""Our staff with students as well have made sacrifices. So  our principals and staff, they've worked with us and have been very cooperative. ""  Birmingham Mayor William Bell, too, said his city was expecting a ""light dusting,"" and by the time they realized the severity of the wintry weather, ""it was too late. ""  ""All of the businesses and schools began to let out. It clogged up our interstate system, which then led to a clogging of the side roads and many people became stranded,"" he said. ""We have had to scurry to try to play catch up and all of our people working in the public works department, our public safety units within the fire and the police department, they've all been out overnight to try to deal with the stranded motorists.""

"Words flying from person to person, nonstop, on the go.   As, meanwhile, on those same sidewalks, the men and women with the satchels weave their way through the people with the screens, on their appointed rounds to deliver words by hand.   The visitor from space, or from a future century, might think this scene -- mailbag luggers walking amid screen tappers -- is like witnessing ox carts amid hovercraft.   As might an efficiency expert, or a business consultant.   Which summarizes the continuing headache faced by officials in charge of the United States Postal Service.  The price of a first-class stamp is going up again in the new year: On January 26, it will increase by three cents, to 49 cents per letter.  Federal regulators last week approved the rise on an allegedly temporary basis -- the higher rate is supposed to last for no more than two years -- but no one really expects it to go back down.   The Postal Service reports that it lost $5 billion in the last fiscal year -- and this is being presented as good news.  The year before, it lost almost $16 billion.  But there are fewer and fewer envelopes in those satchels, so each stamp will come with a higher price tag; the billions of dollars the Postal Service is required to pay each year to pre-fund health care for future retirees is a burden heavier than anything that would fit into a mail sack.   Yet there are reasons to hope that the Postal Service finds a way to stay around for a very long time.   The Postal Service, like UPS, FedEx and other private delivery companies, is a stand-alone  business.  It is expected to sustain itself; it does not depend on tax money.   But, unlike UPS and FedEx, the Postal Service must go to Congress to get explicit approval for the rates it charges, and for many of the rules under which it operates.  This is why it costs the same amount to send a letter across the country as it does to send a letter to the next town.  This is why mail service is universal -- why those carriers are required to show up each day at virtually every address in the United States.   Forty-nine cents may seem like a lot to mail a first-class letter.  But if the Postal Service were to collapse under financial pressures and competition from digital means of communication  -- if the Postal Service had to throw in the towel -- do you really think that UPS or FedEx or some other courier service would take your envelope across the country for 49 cents?   Over the Christmas holiday, the failures by UPS and FedEx to get packages to some customers on time were  prominent in the news.  As efficient as UPS and FedEx usually are, the existence and ubiquity of the Postal Service has a lot to do with what keeps them on their toes.  Their business model is: We cost more than the Postal Service, but because of that you can count on us to be reliable and accountable to you.  If the Postal Service were to go away -- if that check on the other carriers, that extra impetus for them to excel, were to be removed -- what would the impact be on customers and businesses?  Could or would the other carriers pick up the slack, at a price that didn't dismay people?   One hopeful sign for the Postal Service has come from an unlikely source: Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.  Amazon has announced that it will be delivering its packages on Sundays -- and that to deliver those packages it has arranged to use employees of the Postal Service.  The Postal Service has said that it is glad to have the business.  It without question can use the revenue.   Can daily delivery of mail continue forever in a digital world?  It's difficult to imagine how.  In Canada, the postal service has informed citizens that, over the next five years, it will stop all door-to-door delivery of letters and concentrate on delivering packages.  Most Canadians are already asked to pick up letters at community mailbox clusters in neighborhoods or apartment buildings; soon, everyone will.  It's the future.   Universal, inexpensive mail delivery in the United States has been one of the miracles of the nation's long story; if someone were assigned to build a system like it from scratch today -- carriers reporting to every U.S. address, six days a week, to drop off mail and see if there is any mail to go out, all for pocket change -- that person would have to concede: It can't be done.   But it was done, and, for now, it's still here.  For those who, in the digital era,  casually say that they'd be just as happy if the Postal Service were to simply disappear:  Be careful what you wish for.",human
"What we have now, after the initial panic when ISIS made its move into Iraq, are two distinct camps: Explorers suspending operations and producers battening down the hatches and producing as best they can. According to the Kurdish Regional Government, supplies up north are still above 300,000 barrels a day.   Tucked into the IEA's latest monthly report is one of today's harsher realities: ISIS has taken control of seven fields, which typically produce about 80 thousand barrels a day. Energy and security sources here in the region tell me that oil is starting to find its way onto the black market, offered at a heavy discount.   Beyond the fighting, other complex problems still exist that could easily tilt the balance in Iraq. In Baiji, near the country's center, 300,000 barrels of refining capacity is off-line after ISIS rebels fought for control, according to the Iraq Energy Institute's Luay al-Khatteeb.   Oil is being exported via pipeline from the Kurdish region through the Port of Ceyhan in Turkey.  Tankers have sailed, but Baghdad is blocking sales with an on-going dispute over who actually controls that oil.   Despite all that, Iraq continues to supply the market with an ample level of crude.  According to the IEA's monthly report, overall production is 3.1 million barrels a day, down slightly from the month before.  Exports are up again to 2.44 million and that is what the market is concentrating on.   But there is a price to pay for the violence in the north and political in-fighting in Baghdad. The country's original target of expanding capacity to over 4 million barrels a day will be missed, according to al- Khatteeb.   With this level of uncertainty, the international oil companies (IOCs) may tighten their purse strings, waiting to see if the U.S. intervention can help stabilize the country before committing more money for exploration and production.   The big bounty for Iraq and the energy majors remains the oil rich south around Basra which, despite initial security threats against international oil workers, is pumping and exporting crude at near record levels.   BP initially trimmed staff when ISIS began its march into Iraq, but at the end of July, CEO Bob Dudley went out of his way to assure investors production is back up to normal with plans for expansion.   ""The Rumaila field is now the second largest producing field in the world at about 1.4 million barrels per day,"" said Dudley. ""If you think about the map of Iraq, it is down in the bottom of the funnel, near the Kuwait border, in the desert, in an unpopulated area. ""  Lukoil has put $4 billion into the West Qurna 2 field in the south -- one of the world's largest oil fields -- and despite initial delays is still producing 300,000 barrels a day without interruption.   What we have learned in the past two months of fighting, is another harsh reality: Money talks.   Iraq may have difficulty staying glued together as a country or even passing a petroleum law to govern revenue sharing, but securing production and distribution have been paramount. And that persistence earned the country $53 billion last month alone.

"Cuomo's office did not respond Saturday to CNN's requests for comment on the matter.   Medical marijuana is hardly unprecedented in the United States. Twenty states and the District of Columbia now allow it in some form -- among them Colorado, where as of January 1 it's legal to sell marijuana to those 21 or older -- according to info compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. (In addition, Maryland has a limited program for research.) The momentum has picked up of late, with most of these efforts taking effect over the past decade.   The states where there is medical marijuana include Connecticut, Vermont and New Jersey, each of which border New York. And yet the Empire State has not joined them. Versions of the Compassionate Care Act pushed by Gottfried have passed the state Assembly, only to stall in the Senate.   Cuomo is acting without the legislature's OK, though what he's doing is legal, according to Gottfried, whose district includes much of Midtown Manhattan. He explained that the governor is acting on powers granted through a law passed in 1980 in setting the stage for a highly regulated system that's less liberal than many other medical marijuana setups nationwide.   Here's how it would work, according to Gottfried: Under Cuomo's directive, the state health department would take charge by setting up the guidelines and picking hospitals that would take part. These hospitals would then have panels of people who decide, on a person-by-person basis, which patients qualify for medical marijuana.   It has yet to be determined where the medical marijuana -- or the elements of it that might be dispensed -- will come from, including who might produce it.   Gottfried estimated that tens of thousands of people could get medical marijuana by virtue of this policy change, though he insisted it is no substitute for a more complete, far-reaching program.   ""(Cuomo) can take (this step) without the need for further legislation,"" the Manhattan legislator said. ""But to have a truly comprehensive and well-working system will take legislation. ""  Gabriel Sayegh -- the New York state director for the Drug Policy Alliance, which describes itself as a ""national advocacy leader of drug law reform"" -- agrees, saying that it too will push for broader medical marijuana laws in the state.   He learned about this latest measure in a call Saturday from the governor's office, saying the proposal originated there and describing it the same basic way as Gottfried.   Even as he pushes for something bigger, Sayegh praised the governor for taking what he called an ""exciting"" initial step.   ""It's tremendous,"" Sayegh said. ""We applaud him coming out on this. It's going to help us build momentum to build a permanent program. ""  CNN's Kristina Sgueglia reported from New York, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.",human
"After ""The Help"" took home a surprise win at the SAG Awards, the race for Best Picture has narrowed to that film and ""The Descendants"" and ""The Artist,"" both big winners at the Globes.   For the next few weeks, until the close of Academy voting on the Sunday before the Oscars, the studios and distributors behind those three pictures -- Disney, 20th Century Fox and The Weinstein Company, respectively -- will be aggressively wooing the Academy's 6,000 members into their camps.   As in a political campaign, you simply cannot win an Oscar without spending money. It doesn't matter who spends the most, but it does matter who spends it best.   One of the better campaigns of the past five years was the 2010 win for the little war flick that could: ""The Hurt Locker."" Despite its critical acclaim and high-quality cinematography and script, it was the lowest-grossing best picture winner of all time, competing against the highest-grossing movie in recent history, ""Avatar.""   Besides quality, of course, what did it have going for it? One hell of an Oscar campaign. Its studio, Summit Entertainment, was flush with vampire money from the ""Twilight"" series. Oscar watchers, including studio executives, film journalists and fellow Oscar campaigners, told me that Summit spent between $3 million and $5 million for the campaign, which consisted mainly of hiring consultants to spin ""Hurt Locker"" and ""Avatar"" in a battle of good versus evil within the press.   ""Hurt Locker"" actually lost out to ""Avatar"" in the Globes race, and that might have been a well-timed boon for the small flick. It positioned it perfectly as the underdog going into the home stretch of the campaign.   Besides the cachet of an Oscar win, the successful campaign typically pays for itself in dividends. In the nine months after ""The Hurt Locker's"" Oscar win, the film sold more than $31 million worth of DVDs in the United States, 214% of its U.S. box office gross of $14.7 million.   That's what makes Oscar campaigning more than a $100 million-a-year cottage industry within the movie industry.   Persuading members of the Academy to first nominate your film and then vote for it is tremendously similar to how political operatives get candidates elected.   There is no single strategy for a successful Oscar campaign, but momentum is key. Peak too early and excitement peters out; peak too late and you've spent millions of dollars without enough time to get voters invested.   Building momentum involves racking up accolades and awards from individual guilds and film festivals before the nomination voting in January. This year Weinstein is making sure ""The Artist"" gathers momentum at just the right time. It took home a Golden Globe and its lead actor, Jean Dujardin, brought home a Best Actor SAG. But it has yet to peak.   How is momentum built? And why does it cost millions? After all, word of mouth is free. But an intricate web of gypsy publicists, rogue party planners, and entire full-service consultancies to generate that all-important buzz that drives a campaign can run more than $2 million.   Sure, a DVD can be mailed for less than $2. But with elaborate packaging, express mailing and hand delivery, the cost can increase to $200 each. With 6,000 Academy members, that translates to more than $1 million to get the films in front of voters.   One of the stealthier tactics of good campaigners is the third-party Oscar party, where someone who is not in the Academy hosts an event celebrating a film starring one of their good friends. The expenses for these can easily run to $2 million, which is often somehow subsidized by the studio.   Like a good show-pony politician, the cast of a film needs to be tirelessly glad-handing voters and going to every event to fluff their film. If a movie's main players aren't willing to commit to living and breathing and fighting for their film for the two months leading up to the Oscars, they can forget about taking home a statue.   Bills can run into the millions to fly the talent back and forth across the country and keep them upright and happy during the final stretch. Then there are screening costs and advertising costs. Full-page ads in trade magazines like Variety and The Hollywood Reporter can cost $25,000 each, with ad budgets ranging from $15,000 to $1 million.   Political campaign tricks are obvious. Not so for Oscar campaigns. Selecting the leader of the free world may hold far greater stakes than what to put on your Netflix queue, but they both deserve a high level of transparency. Audiences deserve to know what goes into an Oscar win before they give it credence.

"He drank three cups of water and frequently wiped his face.   The judges ordered van der Sloot expelled from Peru at the end of his sentence and ordered him to pay 200,000 Peruvian new soles, or about $74,500, in reparations to Flores' closest relatives.   Van der Sloot confessed to robbery in addition to murder, admitting that he stole Flores' belongings, including 850 soles (more than $300), credit cards, and the victim's van as a means to leave the country. He fled to Chile and was arrested a few days later.   It was an apparent attempt to win a more lenient sentence, using a plea called an ""anticipated conclusion of the process"" under Peruvian law. Five days earlier, the three judges delayed the start of van der Sloot's trial after he declined to give a plea after expressing reservations about the ""aggravating factors"" tied to admitting his guilt.   Van der Sloot's attorney, Jose Luis Jimenez, pressed earlier this week for a shorter sentence.   Jimenez claimed that his client was under special stress the day the 2010 murder occurred, which marked five years after Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway went missing in Aruba.   Van der Sloot -- who, with two others, was among the last people seen with Holloway - was detained twice, but never charged, in the high-profile international case.   ""He was pointed at and persecuted. The world had been against him for five years before this case, for a murder he said he never committed and for which there is no evidence whatsoever,"" said Jimenez.   Investigators have said they believe van der Sloot killed Flores after she found something related to the Holloway case on his computer while visiting him in his hotel room. The two met while van der Sloot was in town for a poker tournament.   Judges on Friday recounted the crime in detail. They described how Flores hit van der Sloot in the face after reading the item on Holloway, leading him to hit her in the face with his elbow. Flores fainted and van der Sloot tried to strangle her, but she was still breathing and so he suffocated her with his shirt.   Van der Sloot then tried to clean the room by removing the sheets and changing his bloodied shirt, they said.   He was ultimately caught while traveling alone in a taxi near the Chilean central coastal city of Vina del Mar.  Holloway's body has never been found, and no one has been charged in relation to the case in Aruba. But van der Sloot does face possible extradition to the United States in a related matter.   In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment.   He was allegedly given a total of $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru for the poker tournament.   Thursday, about six and a half years after Holloway went missing, Alabama Probate Judge Alan King signed an order declaring the teenager legally dead.",human
"One of the houses was in Bahia de Banderas, a tourist town in western Mexico's Nayarit state, he said.   Mexican intelligence detected the alleged plot on September 6, he said.   Intelligence agents followed the trail and discovered that Cynthia Ann Vanier, a Canadian who was in direct contact with the Gadhafi family, was the leader of the ring, Poire said.   Vanier was arrested on November 10.   The next day, authorities arrested Gabriela Davila Huerta o Cueto, a Mexican living in the United States who Poire said was in charge of getting the false documents.   Pierre Christian Flemsborg, a Dane, was in charge of logistics, Poire said, and was arrested on November 11.   Also arrested was Mexican Jose Luis Kennedy Prieto, who helped obtain the phony documents, Poire said.   The suspects face charges that include falsifying documents and opening bank accounts under false identities.   According to Poire, the Gadhafis would have entered the country under the following aliases: Daniel Bejar Hanan, Amira Sayed Nader, Moah Bejar Sayed and Sofia Bejar Sayed.   Saadi Gadhafi remains in Niger, a landlocked West African nation bordering Libya, to which he fled this year as his father's regime was collapsing.   He had offered to negotiate an end to the war with the rebels in Libya after his father's troops lost control of Tripoli, but appeared later to change his mind.   Saadi Gadhafi's lawyer, Nick Kaufman, said he spoke with his client Wednesday.   ""There is absolutely no truth whatsoever to the allegation that, since fleeing Libya where his life was in grave danger, Saadi Gaddafi has attempted to flout the restrictive measures placed on him by the international community,"" Kaufman said.   The alleged plot, however, would have been hatched while Saadi Gadhafi was still in Libya, before he fled to Niger.   Wednesday's announcement appeared to have been spurred by an investigation into the plot by the Canadian newspaper National Post.   The newspaper spoke with the CEO of a Canadian security company who said he was involved in the alleged plan to move Saadi and his family to Mexico. Gary Peters, CEO of Can/Aust Security and Investigations International, told the paper that the plan was to be carried out with the approval of the Mexican government, which was to have supplied the documentation.   Mexico contradicted that version with its own allegations Wednesday.   The National Post article mentioned Varnier, whom it identified as a Canadian consultant who traveled to Libya in July on fact-finding mission with Peters.   Two of the men who helped secure the private jet used for the trip were among those arrested with Varnier, the paper reported.   The Canadian government confirmed the arrest of a Canadian in connection with the case and said Canadian consular officials in Mexico City and in Ottawa were providing assistance as required.   Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou had reaffirmed his country's decision to grant asylum to Saadi Gadhafi, saying he should be allowed to stay and be treated like other Libyan refugees. Libya's National Transitional Council has blasted that stance.   A businessman, Saadi Gadhafi ran the Libyan Football Federation before the unrest began. He played soccer for Perugia in Italy for one season. Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables posted on WikiLeaks say he had ""scuffles"" with police in Europe.   Moammar Gadhafi was killed in Libya on October 20.   Another of Moammar Gadhafi's sons, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, was captured after a gun battle in the Libyan desert. Senior Libyan military officials said they believe the potential Gadhafi successor was also trying to make his way to Niger.   Saif al-Islam had been on the run since shortly after rebels overran his father's Bab al-Aziziya compound in the capital in August.   The International Criminal Court in Netherlands wants Saif al-Islam for alleged crimes against humanity, including murder allegedly committed during the uprising.

"The following is an edited transcript.   CNN: How has writing about Elvis Cole and Joe Pike changed over the course of the series?  Crais: I really strive to bring something new to each book. I don't want to write the same book over and over again. I've done Elvis books; I've done Joe books; I've done mixed books, but this time, I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50-50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles. When I discovered this particular story, it just seemed a perfect way to do that. Part of the book, they're working together. Then there's Elvis' track through the story, and there's Joe track, where he's trying to find Elvis and save him. So it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage.   CNN: In ""Taken,"" the story jumps between several points of view and moves back and forth in time. How difficult was it to put together?   Crais: It was like a crazy puzzle that kept changing. You should have seen my office. I have these huge black foam boards on the wall, and tacked to them, I have these white punch cards with my story ideas, scenes and notes. I kept juggling these cards and amending them, making little scrawls on them. Notions came to me, things changed, and I literally shuffled them around like a deck of cards, trying to bring them all into focus so the events were as exciting as I could make them.   CNN: How do you start a novel? What comes first, an idea, an image, a scene?   Crais: It could be any of the above, but it's usually an image, almost always driven by a character moment. In ""Taken,"" it was the notion of Krista Morales and her hunger to know more about her mother's experience that night in the desert. I just saw her. It was literally my first image in the book. I saw her staring out into the black desert sky with this open-eyed wonder, trying to see the path her mother took to get to this country. All I had was her face in the moonlight, staring out there, and I just knew whatever she's looking for, I want to find. That was the engine that really kicked off the rest of the book.   CNN: ""Taken"" revolves around a kidnapping on the U.S.-Mexico border by bajadores. What prompted you to write about these bandits?   Crais: I had heard about these atrocious mass graves uncovered in Mexico south of the border: 52 people in one grave, 87 people in another, 164 bodies at a ranch with multiple burial sites. If you watch the news at all, you know Mexico is pretty much defining itself now as a war between the government and the various drug cartels. South of the border is fairly well-patrolled by armed groups of thugs who work for the cartels, and those guys end up preying on civilians, policemen and government officials, but they also prey on each other.   I found out most of the people who were found in those mass graves were immigrants who were headed North from as far away as Central America. They were trying to get to the U.S., and somewhere along the way, cartel bandits or ""bajadores"" would kidnap them, rob them, force them to call their families or employers or whoever and try to extort additional money out of them. When there was no more money to be had, they would just be murdered and buried in mass graves. The business was literally stealing people. The nature of this victim was very moving to me.   When you consider that the victim is basically an innocent, penniless person who's just trying to find a way to make his or her life better was super appealing to me, and it seemed like the type of people that Elvis and Joe would sympathize with and risk their lives to try and save.   CNN: While there's lots of action in your books, it seems like the friendship between Elvis and Joe is what keeps readers coming back.   Crais: Sure. The books are about Elvis and Joe. The books are about their friendship and who they are as men and human beings. I think that's why the readership has grown the way it has and why readers keep coming back to them. There's a value to their friendship that I think people admire and envy and want in their own lives. I know I do, so I kind of attribute it to other people, too. I would love to have either Elvis or Joe, preferably both, as my friends. They're certainly interesting guys, and we can live vicariously through them for their adventures, but there's something beautiful about these two guys and about having someone so trustworthy and dependable in your life. It's very comforting, I think.   CNN: Has the success of the series surpassed your expectations?   Crais: I'm certainly thrilled by the reaction. Honestly, I never would have thought the characters would have become as popular as they have. In the beginning, my dream was simply to make a living at it. I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to earn a living, but it never occurred to me that the books would become bestsellers. I mean, I'm glad, but none of this was by design. I wrote these guys because they're guys I wanted to spend time with.   Writing a book is a long and difficult process for me. I'm a slow writer, so I spend the year with Elvis Cole and Joe Pike in my head. I was thinking about this the other day. I wrote the first book in 1987. Literally every day since that time, Elvis and Joe have been in my head. They're always there. I started these guys because I like them. I still like spending time with them, and I think that's probably the reason the readers have embraced Elvis and Joe the way they have. Whenever there's a new book, they want to refresh that friendship.   CNN: Despite many lucrative offers, you've never sold the screen rights to Elvis and Joe. Why is that?   Crais: It's pretty simple. You know the old saying, if it ain't broke, don't fix it? I'm concerned that if there's a film of Elvis and Joe, that somehow it will interfere with the collaboration I have with my readers. I'm the first to admit this is probably a knuckleheaded fear on my part, but I have it nevertheless. Books are a collaborative art. Elvis and Joe don't exist until someone picks up one of the books and reads it. In the act of reading, you and I collaborate, and Elvis and Joe come to life inside your head.   What I've learned over time is that the Elvis and Joe you see and hear in your head, they are only yours. There might be however many hundreds of thousands of other people who've read ""Taken,"" and each and every one of them is going to have a unique Elvis and Joe. It's going to be a little bit different from everybody else's because we all bring our own stuff to this. I find that wonderful.   To me, that is the great thing about books, and I guess part of me is a little scared that if I let Hollywood get involved, and even if there's a really good movie made, that somehow once you've seen the film, when you come back to the new book next year, that collaboration that you and I have is going to be a little bit different. Because then, the movie is going to have inserted itself. So I'm really jealous and guarded about that. I want your Elvis and Joe to be a product of yours and mine and nothing else.

"""  ""Unfortunately we will feel its effects for years to come, as guns that were lost during this operation continue to show up at crime scenes both here and in Mexico,"" Holder said. ""We are losing the battle to stop the flow of illegal guns to Mexico. ""  Holder defended his own actions, reminding the panel he called for the inspector general to examine the so-called Operation Fast and Furious and issued a directive that ""gun-alking"" was illegal and should never be repeated. The resulting report may be concluded before the end of the year.   However, Holder stopped short of laying blame for the flawed operation.   Last week, his assistant attorney general, Lanny Breuer, expressed ""regret"" for his failure to alert Holder about a similar earlier operation called ""Wide Receiver"" which had employed similar ATF ""gun-walking"" tactics during the Bush administration.   At the hearing Tuesday, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa said, ""It doesn't matter how many laws we pass if those responsible for enforcing them refuse to do their duty -- as was the case in Fast and Furious.""  Grassley pressed Holder at the hearing about who had leaked a sensitive document to the press regarding a whistle-blower who had come forward with allegations of gun-walking. Grassley asked who was being held accountable.   Holder refused to answer, but several hours later Grassley said Justice had provided him a document in a classified setting.   Grassley revealed that former U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke, who resigned from his post, had leaked the document to the press.   Still, the senator said, he is not satisfied. ""The Justice Department should not be allowed to continue to scapegoating the one person who has resigned,"" Grassley said, promising to pursue the matter further.   Despite the disagreements, Holder pressed for congressional cooperation. He made a plea to the committee for strengthening the authority of the ATF to detect and disrupt illegal gun trafficking, and urged full funding for the ATF to combat gun-running.   He added: ""I am determined to ensure that our shared concerns about Operation Fast and Furious lead to more than headline-grabbing Washington 'gotcha' games and cynical political point scoring,"" Holder concluded.   Holder has the support of Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the committee, who opened the hearing by reciting successes by the Justice Department under Holder's leadership.   On Monday, Leahy tried to lower the heat on Holder by raising it on the Bush administration for Operation Wide Receiver. In a letter to the Justice Department inspector general, the senator asked whether the current investigation also will cover the Bush-era supervision of the ATF in 2006 when, he said, ""hundreds of weapons apparently moved beyond the custody and control of the ATF and possibly into Mexico and Arizona. ""  Leahy said that then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey may have been briefed in the case in 2007.   Holder faces what is likely to be a much more hostile environment next month when he testifies before a House panel, where Republican Darrell Issa, R-California, will wield the gavel and control the questioning.

"No need to cut out dessert: The key is to eat strategically.   Happily, some major companies are getting on board. In the past four years, cereal brands have cut back on sugar, the milk industry recently lowered amounts in the chocolate milk served in schools, and Walmart is aiming for 10% less added sugar in select foods by 2015.   Health.com: 25 ways to cut 500 calories a day  We turned to experts to clear up the confusion over this tasty temptress. As Katz says, ""There's a role for sugar in our diet. After all, what's the point of being healthy if it's not to enjoy living?""  Is there such thing as a sweet tooth?   Yes, sugar love is in your DNA. Researchers have found two sweet-receptor genes that can predict a preference for sweets.   How much is OK?   The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends most women get no more than 24 grams of added sugar per day. That's about six teaspoons, or 100 calories -- a little less than the amount in one can of soda. Thing is, the average American woman eats about 18 daily teaspoons.   Sugar is hidden in unlikely foods, from salad dressing to crackers, which can push you past 24 grams.   Read labels; if there's a sweetener in the first few ingredients (some common aliases: evaporated cane juice, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice concentrate, agave nectar, fructose, dextrose, and syrup), look for a brand with a low-or no-sugar option.   Health.com: Diet-busting foods you should never eat  Is it really so bad?   ""Sugar is an important part of our lives,"" says Dr. Miriam Vos, assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine. ""But a little goes a long way."" The AHA links added sugar to obesity, type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease.   In a nutshell, eating too much sugar can cause fat buildup in the liver, which can lead to these problems.   It's not all bad. ""There's no need to avoid the naturally-occurring sugars in fruit, vegetables, and low- and nonfat dairy,"" says Rachel K. Johnson, professor of nutrition at the University of Vermont in Burlington.   As sweet as some of these things may taste, they contain relatively small amounts of sugar. Plus, nature's packaging comes with essential vitamins and minerals, along with water and fiber that slow the release of sugars into the bloodstream and prevent insulin spikes.   Health.com: 23 superfruits you need now  What's up with 'natural' sugars?   Sugar in the raw is no better than regular sugar. Agave nectar, alas, is also not great: Its main constituent, fructose, tends to get held up in the liver more than other types of sugar.   Some sweeteners, like raw honey and sucanat, have trace nutrients, but they're all the same as white sugar in terms of calories -- and some contain even more calories.   Is it OK to use calorie-free sweeteners?   Yes! The FDA deems stevia, aspartame (Equal), sucralose (Splenda), and other cal-free sweeteners safe. ""Short-term data suggests they're safer than table sugar,"" says Kimber Stanhope, a nutritional biologist at the University of California-Davis.   Faux sugar won't cause blood-sugar spikes or weight gain -- and all the potential health ills. As Stanhope says, ""I use them because I can't afford the extra calories!

"Michael suggested that Uber use its vast collection of consumer data to ""dig up dirt"" on Sarah Lacey, the founder of the Silicon Valley news site Pando.   Over a dinner attended by leading technology pundits, Michael suggested that Uber could spend ""a million dollars"" to hire a crack team of researchers and journalists. This investigative team might, he said, snoop into the personal and family life of a critic like Lacey who has relentlessly exposed many of Uber's creepiest features -- particularly what she calls  the ""asshole"" misogyny of its CEO, Travis Kalanick.   Earlier this week, Michael's outrageous and perhaps even criminal idea was leaked by the Buzzfeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith, who attended the dinner. This, of course, has generated a massive storm of outrage amongst the technorati.   Peter Thiel told CNN that Uber was the most ""ethically challenged"" company in Silicon Valley. While The Guardian's Dominic Rushe rhetorically asked whether Uber is Silicon Valley's ""worst company. ""  All over social media, people said the same thing: Emil Michael was the ultimate creep! The crowd had spoken. Michael's reviews were universally abysmal. He should be yanked, dismissed, fired.   But that's exactly what hasn't happened. In spite of the popular outrage over Michael's behavior, Travis Kalanick wrote an unapologetic 12 part Twitter ""apology"" which rejected the idea of firing his most senior business executive. Uber investors have mostly remained conveniently silent with a few -- like the normally outspoken Jason Calacanis -- explicitly defending Kalanick and, by implication, Michael.   In The Circle, his brilliant satire of technology companies like Uber, Dave Eggers coined the Orwellian phrase ""Sharing is caring"" to describe the hypocrisy enveloping Silicon Valley. But, of course, in the sharing economy of multi-billion dollar start-ups like Uber, sharing is only caring when it comes to dismissing lowly drivers or customers. Trust is only the convenient new currency of this economy when it suits Uber.   Otherwise the ""new"" economy appears to be ominously old, with a rejection of transparency, democratization, openness, accountability and all the other buzzwords of the Internet revolution.   We the people, however, may have the last laugh. The New York Times' Farhad Manjoo wrote that Uber's ""toughest challenge"" now is improving its dubious ethical behavior. While Dov Seidman, the CEO of LRN and a deep thinker about business ethics, notes that the principle challenge now of a successful startup like Uber is to scale its morality.   ""In the past, technology entrepreneurs created and sold devices,"" Seidman says. ""Today, they create and sell platforms for human behavior, which in turn raises real questions about the social and moral implications of the behavior -- and their underlying values -- on their platforms and about the responsibility that they have for these behaviors. Tech entrepreneurs are obsessed about scaling their business models and products. But they should be just as, if not more, deliberate about scaling their values on their platforms and in their companies. ""  Travis Kalanick should listen to critics like Seidman. If Uber is to succeed, it needs to scale its morality in sync with its fast-growing business. Firing Emil Michael would be a beginning.   It would say that Uber really is a trustworthy company. It would tell the world that Uber, and Kalanick himself, is beginning to grow up.",human
"""She is a figure that has contributed much to cross-cultural communication,"" Deng Jianglei, director of the cartoon, ""Princess Fragrant,"" told CNN. The animation is set to become a television series at the end of 2015, and a film the following year.   Deng's company, Shenzhen Qianheng Cultural Communication Company, won a tender to create the 3-D animation last year, as part of a campaign by Xinjiang authorities to promote social harmony among China's different ethnic groups and raise awareness of the folk customs of the Uyghurs.   During a visit to the province in June, Deng and his colleagues were inspired by the natural beauty and rich culture of Xinjiang -- a region the size of Iran that shares borders with eight countries.   ""The cultures there and the folk arts are exquisite. But the place's economy is less developed. So we wanted ... to help them promote their cultures,"" he said.   But appealing to both Han and Uyghur audiences may prove a challenge.   Princess or sex slave?   Selecting a musician to compose the theme song, for example, took over a year, China's Global Times reports, because it was difficult to find a composer who was familiar with both Han and Uyghur traditions.   Then there are the alternative versions of the Uyghur girl's story.   Although the legend of Fragrant Concubine has become a symbol of national unity for many Chinese, modern Uyghur interpretations of the tale portray her as an imperial sex slave who was murdered by the emperor's mother after stubbornly rejecting the emperor's advances.   Deng said he wants the series to be entertaining while also fulfilling ""political needs. ""  ""(The cartoon) is a re-understanding of the friendship between Han and Uyghurs, which is especially significant to the re-education of the children and teaching them to accept different cultures. ""  His animation company, working in collaboration with the government of Kashgar, has plans to show the cartoon in China and abroad, especially in Islamic regions.   Xinjiang has a long history of ethnic unrest. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward the Han Chinese in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment by security forces, discrimination and a lack of economic opportunities.   Muslim separatists have been held responsible for a series of recent deadly attacks, with Chinese authorities launching an anti-terror campaign in May. Measures to end the violence have ranged from executing convicted terrorists to banning beards and Islamic dress in some areas.   But authorities have not ignored the role of soft power.   ""It is similar as fighting a war in the realm of ideology. If we don't pass on positive energy, the opposite side would occupy the battlefield,"" Sheng Jun, a deputy director of cultural industry office at the Xinjiang Bureau of Culture told The Global Times.   Finding common ground, however, was difficult even among the animators.   Some of the more conservative Xinjiang artists who were consulted in the making of the cartoon objected to the use of animal characters because of the negative connotations associated with some creatures like snakes according to Islamic traditions, and because Uyghur families rarely own pets, the Global Times reports.   ""The difficulty is that you have to respect history and culture while catering to the market,"" Deng said.   When it came to the animals, Deng insisted they should stay. ""It's all about compromise,"" he said.   Intern Linda Yan contributed to this report.",human
"There, Haleigh began a regimen of cannabis oil: four times a day and once at night.   By summer, she was down to just a handful of seizures a day. In less than three months, doctors were able to wean her off Depakote, a powerful medication that had been damaging her liver.   Haleigh had never been able to walk or talk. But freed from seizures in Colorado, ""She said 'Mama' for the first time,"" Cox said.  ""She's playing with puzzles; she's walking. She's almost being a normal child. ""  Despite all the good news, Cox is living in limbo. Her husband, a paramedic, couldn't afford to leave his job and pension; he still lives and works in Forsyth, Georgia. The family is relying on charity to keep their Colorado apartment for the next few months; beyond that, the future is uncertain.   A bill being introduced Monday in the U.S. House of Representatives could be Cox's ticket home. The three-page bill would amend the Controlled Substances Act -- the federal law that criminalizes marijuana -- to exempt plants with an extremely low percentage of THC, the chemical that makes users high.   Gupta: Why I changed my mind on weed  If passed, it would be the first time that federal law allows any medical marijuana use.   ""No one should face a choice of having their child suffer or moving to Colorado and splitting up their family,"" said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pennsylvania, the bill's sponsor. ""We live in America, and if there's something that would make my child better, and they can't get it because of the government, that's not right. ""  The bill will land in a Congress that may be open to change. Across the country, highly sympathetic patients and a nonintoxicating product have proved a popular mix. This year alone, 11 states have passed legislation loosening regulation of cannabis strains with high cannabidiol and/or minimal THC content.   In this atmosphere, Perry says that once members and their staffs are brought up to speed, he expects the bill to attract ""overwhelming"" support.   ""It wouldn't be surprising if we see broad support for this proposal,"" agreed Mason Tvert, communications director at the Marijuana Policy Project, which advocates for marijuana and medical marijuana legalization. ""If this bill gets support, it will demonstrate that there is recognition of marijuana's medical benefits. ""  Dubbed the Charlotte's Web Medical Hemp Act of 2014, the bill is named after Charlotte Figi, a young Colorado girl whose parents have campaigned nationwide for easier access to medical marijuana after successfully controlling their daughter's seizures with cannabis oil. Since her story became known, a growing number of parents have flocked to Colorado, hoping for similar success.   The Charlotte's Web cannabis strain, developed by the Realm of Caring nonprofit organization in Colorado Springs, is in high demand, in part because of the attention it's received in the media. Many families wait months for a batch to be grown and processed into cannabis oil. Perry's bill, however, would apply to any cannabis strain with a THC content of less than 0.3%.   Charlotte's Web and similar strains not only have minimal THC, they have high levels of cannabidiol, another chemical. A growing body of anecdotal evidence suggests that cannabidiol can effectively control seizures, though there are no published studies to support its use.   It's easy to find critics who say parents should follow a more traditional route.   ""There is no evidence for marijuana as a treatment for seizures,"" Rep. John Fleming, R-Louisiana, a physician, claimed during a congressional hearing last month. ""We hear anecdotal stories, and that's how myths come about. ""  Fleming and others point out that a pharmaceutical version of cannabidiol oil, called Epidiolex, is being tested in clinical trials. But many children aren't able to get into the trials. Haleigh Cox is disqualified because she has type-1 diabetes. Others aren't willing to wait several months to be enrolled.   ""With Epidiolex, there just aren't enough seats at the table,"" said Mark Knecht, a father from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, whose story helped inspire Perry's bill.   His daughter Anna, 11, has epilepsy and suffers anywhere from a handful of seizures a day to more than 100, despite her four anti-convulsant medications. Knecht, the chief financial officer of a large Christian medical nonprofit, says Anna has been evaluated at several top hospitals but couldn't land a spot in the Epidiolex trial.   Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have laws on the books allowing medical marijuana for a variety of conditions. But even as states rewrite their regulations, federal law remains the same: Marijuana is illegal to grow, sell or use for any purpose. Under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is listed on Schedule 1, meaning it has ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" To backers of reform, the Catch-22 is familiar: Marijuana is restricted in large part because there is little research to support medical uses; research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions.   A series of memos from the Justice Department has said that arresting individual medical marijuana users is not a priority, and a 2013 memo added that federal prosecutors should not target large commercial operations except on a case-by-case basis. But most observers say that shipping or transporting the drug across state lines ups the ante.   ""For families like us, the biggest issue is the federal issue. You can't take it across state lines,"" Knecht explained.   His family still lives in Mechanicsburg. But after seeing CNN's medical marijuana documentary last year, Anna and her mother, Deb, established residency in Colorado, where they obtained a medical marijuana card that let them place an order for a batch cannabis oil, in hopes it will control Anna's seizures. If Perry's bill becomes law, Knecht says, ""Realm of Caring could just put it in a FedEx package. ""  The Food and Drug Administration is conducting a review of scientific evidence to determine whether marijuana warrants looser treatment, but a spokeswoman says there's no set date to complete the analysis. A review in 2011 ended with the Drug Enforcement Administration leaving marijuana's status unaltered.   But certain actions in Congress give Perry and his supporters hope.   This month, the House passed a bill allowing banks to handle cash proceeds from dispensaries and other legal marijuana businesses.   The most recent Farm Bill allows industrial hemp -- a strain of cannabis without THC -- to be grown for academic or research purposes. That didn't stop the Drug Enforcement Administration from seizing a shipment of hemp seeds bound for the University of Kentucky this spring. In response, the Senate Appropriations Committee, with support from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,  passed an amendment blocking DEA funds for anti-hemp enforcement.   In May, the House passed a measure blocking money for DEA raids on marijuana dispensaries that are legal under state law.   And just last week, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky took it a step further, introducing an amendment to the Jobs Bill that would forbid federal prosecution of doctors and patients whose actions are legal under state medical marijuana laws.   ""If states allow doctors to prescribe medical marijuana, and people are in good faith prescribing medical marijuana, we want to make sure it's OK and that the federal government doesn't come in and prosecute somebody ,"" said Brian Darling, Paul's communications director.   The amendment seems likely to die amidst wrangling over the Jobs Bill, but Darling says his boss plans to move forward on a standalone measure.   Too many people have been sentenced to long prison terms for possession of marijuana, Darling says. ""The War on Drugs has gone overboard. ""  Knecht doesn't want to uproot his family to move to Colorado. But he says his hand may be forced. ""We're taking this situation one day at a time. ""  That's where Janea Cox was a few months ago. She hadn't heard about Perry's bill until she got a call from a reporter but says she understands where the Pennsylvania families are coming from. She's angry at home-state lawmakers who failed to push through Georgia's cannabidiol oil bill this spring.   ""I lived in Georgia for 17 years,"" she said, ""but here in Colorado, I met my child for the first time, at the age of 5.

"The flight, carrying more than 200 passengers, disappeared from radar Saturday and hasn't been seen or heard from since.   Interpol identified the men using the stolen passports as Pouri Nourmohammadi, 18, and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, both Iranians. Malaysian police believe Nourmohammadi was trying to emigrate to Germany using the stolen Austrian passport. The men entered Malaysia on February 28 using valid Iranian passports, Interpol said.   ""Interpol is asking why only a handful of countries worldwide are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights,"" Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said in a statement.   Before the departure of Flight 370, no country had checked the stolen passports against Interpol's list since they were added to the lost-documents database in 2012 and 2013, Interpol said.   Countries, but not airlines, have access to Interpol's data, and many governments don't routinely check passports against the database.   In 2013, passengers were able to board planes more than 1 billion times without having their travel documents checked against Interpol's data, the agency said. Airlines carried more than 3.1 billion passengers globally in 2013, according to estimates from the International Air Transport Association.   Are stolen passports related to plane's disappearance?   Interpol head Noble said Tuesday that the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 does not appear to be related to terrorism.   ""The more information we get, the more we're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident,"" Noble said at a news conference in Lyon, France.   There's no evidence to suggest either of the men traveling on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight was connected to any terrorist organizations, according to Malaysian investigators.   On any given day, many people travel using stolen or fake passports for reasons that have nothing to do with terrorism, aviation security expert Richard Bloom told CNN.   They might be trying to immigrate illegally to another country, or they might be smuggling stolen goods, people, drugs or weapons or trying to import otherwise legal goods without paying taxes, said Bloom, director of terrorism, intelligence and security studies at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.   ""For all of those reasons, the very notion that passports might be important in this particular situation may be a red herring,"" Bloom said.   Noble said Sunday that the fact that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in Interpol's databases is a big concern.   ""This is a situation we had hoped never to see,"" he said. ""For years Interpol has asked why should countries wait for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates?""  Few countries look up stolen passports  Interpol does not charge countries for access to its databases, but some of the 190 Interpol member countries may not have the technical capacity or resources to access the network, according to Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director.   ""It's just up to the will of the country to set it up and do it,"" Fuentes said.   Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database was created in 2002, following the September 11, 2001, attacks, to help countries secure their borders. Since then, it has expanded from a few thousand passports and searches to more than 40 million entries and more than 800 million searches per year.   About 60,000 of those 800 million searches yield hits against stolen or lost documents, according to Interpol.   The United States searches the database more than 250 million times annually, the United Kingdom more than 120 million times annually and the United Arab Emirates more than 50 million times annually, Interpol said. (Some 300,000 passports are lost or stolen each year in the United States, according to the U.S. State Department, which collects reports of stolen passports and sends them to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Interpol.)   According to the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection vets all travelers booked on flights to, from and heading through the United States through the Advanced Passenger Information System.   It conducts a thorough review of all relevant domestic and international criminal databases, including Interpol's, for any issues of concern. This review includes reports of stolen documents.   ""If Malaysia Airlines and all airlines worldwide were able to check the passport details of prospective passengers against Interpol's database, then we would not have to speculate whether stolen passports were used by terrorists to board MH 370,"" Interpol's Noble said.   The Thailand connection  The Austrian and Italian passports were stolen in Thailand in 2012 and 2013, respectively, according to Interpol.   Thailand is a booming market for stolen passports. Paul Quaglia, who has been working in the region as a security and risk analyst for 14 years, said the situation in Thailand is better than it was five to 10 years ago ""but still not up to international standards. ""  ""Unfortunately, Thailand remains a robust venue for the sale of high-quality false passports (which includes altered stolen passports) and other supporting documentation,"" he said.   Not all ""lost"" passports are necessarily ""stolen"" passports, Quaglia said. ""Some passports 'lost' are actually sold by the passport holder. Some young men and others traveling to Thailand, short on cash after extended partying and high living, can be approached to sell a passport, which can be easily replaced at embassies upon presentation of a routine 'lost passport' police report,"" he said.   Searching for true identities  An investigation was launched into the Flight 370 matter, with Malaysian and aviation authorities reviewing video and other documentation to try to identify not only who the passengers were that used the stolen passports but how the illegal passports cleared security.   In an interview with CNN on Monday, Thailand Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said the country is cooperating with Interpol in the investigation.   Interpol's Noble urged countries and airlines to adopt routine checks against its lost and stolen document database.   ""I sincerely hope that governments and airlines worldwide will learn from the tragedy of missing flight MH 370 and begin to screen all passengers' passports prior to allowing them to board flights,"" Noble said.   ""Doing so will indeed take us a step closer to ensuring safer travel. """,human
"The gun was created with a Stratasys Dimension SST printer, which can be purchased online for as little as $8,000.   Wilson fired the gun Saturday and the video was posted to YouTube on Sunday. The group's self-described ""Wiki Weapon Project"" is about a year old. Until now, the group had only reported being able to make plastic, interchangeable parts for firearms, but not entire weapons.   The Liberator is comprised of 16 interchangeable pieces, with a nail for a firing pin. According to the group, the barrel can be changed out to fire different kinds of ammo.   Not surprisingly, reports of the test-firing have reignited calls to ban 3-D-printed guns, which critics fear could easily fall into the wrong hands and create safety concerns because they'd be invisible to metal detectors.   New York Sen. Charles Schumer is one of several politicians pushing for stricter legislation that would ban firearms created with 3-D printers.   ""Passing this law would not only prevent people from making these parts, it would raise awareness on the issue,"" Schumer said Sunday during a news conference. ""We're facing a situation where anyone -- a felon, a terrorist -- can open a gun factory in their garage. ""  Schumer is joined by U.S. congressman Steve Israel of New York, who has introduced legislation to renew a ban on plastic guns that is set to expire later this year.   ""I don't want to make it easier for criminals and terrorists to bring plastic guns through metal detectors and onto airplanes,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday.   It's an argument unlikely to sway Wilson, who has made no secret of his disdain for the U.S. government in particular and all governments in general. (Defense Distributed makes and sells components with names like ""The Cuomo"" and ""The Pelosi,"" to tweak politicians who support gun control).   ""For me, it's important as a symbolic political statement,"" he told CNN Monday. ""And that statement is something like, 'No, the future we imagine is one of personalized manufacture and access to objects. It doesn't matter what the decision is on the Hill ... in this future, people will be able to make guns for themselves.'   ""That was already true, but now it's been demonstrated in yet another technology. ""  Despite that worldview, Defense Distributed applied for, and in March received, a federal firearm license which makes it a legal gun manufacturer.   Wilson acknowledged in a recent interview with Forbes that his creation could be used by criminals, but suggested that demonstrating the freedom to create them is more important than trying to stop that from happening.   ""I recognize that this tool might be used to harm people. That's what it is: It's a gun,"" he said. ""But I don't think that's a reason to not put it out there. I think that liberty in the end is a better interest. ""  Defense Distributed is based near Austin, Texas. Wilson has emerged as the face of the group, although many of its members, including the owners of the 3-D printer the group uses, have chosen to remain anonymous.   The group's future plans include expanding the range of ammunition a 3-D printed gun can fire and making the guns printable with less expensive printers, such as the $2,800 Replicator 2 by Makerbot.",human
"Despite the eulogy, Battams said we have to wait for the Hubble Space Telescope or other telescopes to confirm ISON's fate. ""It seems unlikely at this stage that anything of significant size remains but Hubble observations would help clear that up,"" Battams told CNN in an e-mail.   NASA also hinted there may be a bit of hope for ISON in its latest update posted online Wednesday. The agency said it will use space telescopes to monitor ISON for the next several weeks because it's possible that dust is hiding a new, smaller version of it.   ""Most agree that up to 90% of ISON was destroyed, leaving approximately 10% of the comet intact. If previous sungrazing comets are any guides, there may be a sizeable piece of comet nucleus left.

""But in other ways I think Comet ISON was a huge success. The way people connected with Comet ISON via social media was phenomenal; our Comet ISON Observing Campaign website earned well over a million hits; and I had trouble downloading images near perihelion because NASA's servers were swamped.   ""So maybe ISON was the 'Comet of the New Century,'"" he said.   NASA deep-sixes Deep Impact comet hunter  4. ISON won't be forgotten.   ISON's fate has become a near obsession for a special Facebook group set up by physicist and astronomer Padma Yanamandra-Fisher with the Space Science Institute and the ISON observing campaign. More than 300 members have been tracking the comet and sharing amazing pictures. Many are still looking for ISON's remains and they aren't ready to declare it dead.   ""I think the evidence shows that something catastrophic happened to the comet, but I don't think anyone is 100% sure,"" said Yanamandra-Fisher.

Think of salts as ammunition for your vigor weapons.   'Bioshock' creator talks history, writing and 'nerdity'  There are more traditional weapons as well. Pistols, shotguns, machine guns -- they're all here. Both the guns and the vigors are upgradable through purchased additions at vending machines, so keep an eye out for coins wherever you find them.   The nice addition for combat is making vigors and weapons dual-wieldable. You can mow down an opponent with bullets or rockets while tossing them in the air with a Bucking Bronco vigor. In previous games, this was an either/or venture, so it is nice to be able to mix and match your attacks to whatever you choose.   However, the heart of the game is Elizabeth.   She is your constant companion throughout the game, offering help in combat or pointing out items you might miss as you travel throughout Columbia. Her ability to create windows into other worlds can help bring in supplies or allies during battle as well. She is also a master thief who can pick locks quickly.   Elizabeth is never in danger during combat and never takes damage. In that way, she is not one big escort mission but a true companion during your adventures.   Getting Elizabeth just right was a massive undertaking for Irrational Games and Levine, who said the game's release date was pushed back a year solely to perfect her.   Their success lies in the empathy the player develops toward her as the game progresses. You feel and see her frustrations, her joys and her pain. Her tiny movements, such as bending over to closely examine a new item for the first time (even one that has no bearing on the game), give her a human feeling without treading into Uncanny Valley (where animation comes so close to actual human behavior that it causes discomfort).   Without going into spoiler territory, there were two separate instances where I really thought the development teams nailed it. The first was during a tense situation early in the game where Elizabeth is trying to understand what's going on and why people were fighting over her.   Booker tries to explain that different sides want different things from her. Her response: ""Well, I want a puppy, but that doesn't mean I'm going to get one. ""  It felt like the way a teenager would react to a stressful situation.   The second came during a scene in which Booker is talking with people who suddenly disappear. As a gamer, I shrugged it off and accepted it. However, when I turned around, I caught sight of Elizabeth, who was standing there with the best ""WTH?"" look I've ever seen in a video game.   Little moments like that combine to reveal a character who isn't just a companion but who helps move the story along in a meaningful way.   At first, you want to help yourself. Later, you want to help Elizabeth. By the end, you want both.   The experiences will linger. And your emotions will be real. In this way, Levine and his team have succeeded in creating not only an excitingly wonderful game but one that will make the player think for days after the game is done.   ""BioShock Infinite"" earns its title by the end of the game. The possibilities, like time and space, are endless.   The overarching narrative portrays struggles on so many different levels, but it is your story of struggle that is ultimately important and the one you guide to its conclusion.   ""BioShock Infinite"" is available worldwide on Tuesday for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows PC. It is rated M for mature due to blood and gore, intense violence, language, mild sexual themes and use of alcohol and tobacco.

"Google reported $16.86 billion in revenues for the last quarter of 2013 alone. One way it makes money from Gmail is by automatically scanning and indexing messages and using the data it mines to show relevant ads to its users.   ""The basic premise of Gmail is, we'll give you a robust e-mail service and in exchange we want to display ads alongside our e-mail and we're scanning your e-mail to decide what ads are most relevant,"" said Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law.   Scanning and ads  Gmail looks for keywords that identify topics of discussion based on things such as frequency and context, then matches the e-mail up with related ads. A conversation thread about meeting up at a spinning class, for example, might trigger an ad for a weight-loss product.   Data gathered through e-mail scanning can also be used to create user profiles for future ad targeting.   What many consumers don't consider is that companies such as Google can create a comprehensive profile of each user based on information from different products such as search, maps, e-mail and Google+, its social network.   ""Nothing in life is free, and as a result it is important for people to understand what value they bring to a free service of any kind,"" said Behnam Dayanim, a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings LLP in Washington.   When people send and receive messages using a free e-mail service, they are sharing details about their interests, who their connections are and what their finances look like. That information might seem mundane on the surface, but when extracted and organized, it's incredibly valuable to marketers and advertisers.   All the major e-mail providers, including Microsoft Outlook and Yahoo, benefit one way or another from offering a free service. The provider might serve up general or targeted ads, generate a user base for marketing other services, or just use the e-mail service to build brand recognition.   And while Gmail may have popularized it, targeted ads based on user data has become the primary business model for many tech companies. It's how social media companies such as Facebook and search engines such as Bing make money as well as a huge number of apps that scrape contact and location information from users. It's also led to a number of similar privacy lawsuits against other companies, including LinkedIn, Yahoo and Facebook.   Any company that collects personal information has to advise its customers what it is doing with their information and comply with any relevant privacy laws, Dayanim said. These are usually laid out in the lengthy terms and conditions and privacy policies that customers barely skim before hitting ""agree. ""  However, many of the details about how exactly Google's program works have been kept confidential. And critics say the service doesn't adequately disclose what it is doing with customers' information.   Legal action  When Gmail made its debut in 2004, it was upfront about the fact that it would show contextual ads targeted to match the topic of e-mail threads. People still lined up to be accepted as early beta users of the service because it was slickly designed, included ample amounts of storage, and was excellent at filtering out spam. And it didn't cost anything to sign up.   One problem is that not all the people affected have agreed to Google's privacy policy. One group of plaintiffs in a recent class-action lawsuit were non-Gmail users who sent messages to Gmail accounts. Google responded that non-Gmail customers had no expectations of privacy when sending e-mails to people who did use the service.   Google has defended its e-mail scanning program by pointing out that it's automated and handled by computers picking out keywords. Google's employees aren't personally reading through e-mails for the latest lovers' spat.   Google also says the scans are necessary to cut down on malicious e-mails and spam, and for features such as Priority Inbox and the tabbed view that filters e-mails into different categories.   A federal judge dealt a blow to the case this month, ruling it couldn't proceed as a class-action lawsuit because the different groups weren't cohesive enough. A class-action lawsuit could have cost Google trillions of dollars in damages.   A changing landscape  When Gmail debuted in 2004, the rules for collecting user information were looser. But the privacy landscape has changed drastically over the past 10 years.   Several U.S. states have passed laws that restrict the use of personal information, the Federal Trade Commission has been more active pursuing privacy violations, and the industry has adopted best practices about what's acceptable.   One thing that hasn't changed is the federal law with the biggest impact on how and when companies can share data with third parties. The Electronics Communication Privacy Act is a dusty piece of legislation passed in 1986, long before the era of cloud-based e-mail. Many legislators and technology companies (including Google) have lobbied to have the law updated to reflect the times.   Meanwhile, consumers must increasingly weigh the value of using a free e-mail service such as Gmail against their personal privacy.",human
"For Bruce, giving brief history lessons to out-of-towners came easy, since growing up in the area gave him the chance to witness history firsthand.   ""I was at the Lincoln Memorial with my family to hear firsthand Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his 'I Have a Dream' speech,"" Bruce said over the loudspeaker as the bus drove past the newly dedicated memorial to the civil rights leader.   Bruce became a tour guide for the company in the summer of 1972 -- when Tourmobile was in its third year of business-- but he left after four years to try his luck on Broadway. After a 33-year absence, he returned in 2006.   Much remains the same, he said. ""Everyone in the world is still eager to see the sights that they have only seen up to now in paintings, books and magazines. ""  According to the company's website, Tourmobile, which started operations in 1969. employs 300 seasonal workers and serves ""upwards of 2 million riders annually."" The tour buses take visitors to many of the capital's most famous sites, including the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument and the National Mall.   What's next for the company is unclear. ""We are currently unable to provide any information regarding future tour services,"" a message on the company's website said.   Bruce blamed the company's demise on the sagging economy and more competition in the area offering similar services.   Starting Tuesday, wlth Tourmobile no longer running, there will be no bus tours for visitors at Arlington National Cemetery until a new contract is awarded through bidding that will be overseen by the National Park Service.   The cemetery covers 624 acres and has 4 million visitors a year, many of whom may find walking the sprawling hallowed grounds too difficult.   The park service hopes to have a new tour bus company in place before the end of the year.   ""This is a bittersweet time for the (National Park Service) and Tourmobile, as they have faithfully served the needs of millions of visitors for over 42 years,"" said Steve Whitesell, regional director of the park service's National Capital Region. ""Times change, and we are ready to enter a new era for visitors to access our national parks in greater Washington. ""  Tourist Gretchen Neu, from Racine, Wisconsin, was visiting Washington for the first time and could not imagine touring the cemetery on foot.   ""Absolutely not. I mean, you have to have some mode of transportation other than your own car,"" Neu said, sitting on the Tourmobile bus as it left the cemetery. Families with loved ones buried at Arlington National Cemetery and those with disabilities will still be able to drive their own cars on the property.   Another thing that set Tourmobile apart from other tour operators was the type of buses it used -- more like trams that are common at theme parks.   The red, white and blue Tourmobile trams that many Washingtonians have become used to seeing came from Universal Studios in California. ""They are truly relics of a whole other era,"" Bruce said just before making his final trip of the day. ""It seemed that that operation worked so well in California that they wanted to try it out here, and that's how it was born. ""  What was born over 40 years ago is coming to an end, but Bruce said he's not ready for retirement and wants to keep showing off the place where he grew up.   ""I greet the world every day, and it's a privilege for me to show the world my hometown,"" he said.",human
"Dozens rush over to witness, Jafra is the first to arrive.   The woman who has discovered the specimen uses an ice pick to prod the earth and dig a hole about six inches in diameter. She then lifts a clump of earth up and sifts out the specimen. The crowd gossips about its value -- ""it's small, only 300 rupees!"" (about $3). A middle man will offer her that amount, then walk it to a market in Tibet and sell it for three times the price.   Jafra explains: ""We pay attention when other people find them. This is our first time coming for the harvest. We've been here for nearly a week. We haven't found anything, because we don't know what they look like -- we don't know what we're looking for. ""  See also: Himalayan glaciers 'buck melting trend'  Like many others, Ram and his brothers traveled for the harvest betting on hope alone. ""People in our village talked about the money to be earned, so we came,"" he says.   The rumors of riches are not baseless. According to experts, the market value of yartsa gunbu has increased by 900% between 1997 and 2008.   One study says 500 grams of top quality yartsa gunbu can sell for up to $13,000 in Lhasa, Tibet, or up to $26,000 in Shanghai. Average annual income in Nepal's rural mid-and-far-western hills, where many harvesters live, is just $283, according to the government.   Police in Dolpa expect 40,000 people to migrate to the district this year. The influx of migrant harvesters speaks volumes to the increasing global commodification of yartsa gunbu. Prized in traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicinal practices for its power as an elixir or an aphrodisiac, in recent years commercial dubbing of the product as ""Himalayan Viagra"" has driven up both demand and market value around the world.   But the unprecedented flood of harvesters has observers concerned about the environmental impacts of this informal economic boom.   ""Look at the hills,"" says Gyalpo Thandin, a student in Dolpa, ""they're all torn up from people digging. By next year they'll be deserts. ""  Thandin, who was visiting home for the harvest, remembers when the yartsa gunbu season meant local bounty, not commercial competition. ""Just five years ago the numbers were lower,"" he says. ""Every year we see more people come and more grasslands get damaged. People who come hack at the land with tools and leave it to dry out. ""  He says his family's yaks have died in recent winters due to depleted grass caused by the harvest.   See also: Bringing Nepal's ghost town back to life  Environmental protection measures offer some hope. Six years ago, a committee of community leaders in Dolpa instituted a taxation system on harvesters in an effort to control numbers and ensure the local community remained resilient amidst environmental changes.   The committee charges locals 1,000 rupees ($11) and outsiders 3,000 rupees ($33) to join the harvest. The system is intended to spend the money on environmental protection measures and to subsidize food for villages in the district.   Similar systems exist in harvest areas across the Himalayas. However, some worry the measure is ineffective.   A former committee member who spoke on the condition of anonymity suggests that charging admission to the harvest has only made it seem even more valuable, and as a result, drawn more harvesters. ""The goal of the system was to charge people and therefore limit the number who would want to come for the harvest, but putting a price on the entry might actually be encouraging more people,"" he says.   A leading expert on Himalayan caterpillar fungus, ecologist and geographer Daniel Winkler, believes the future of the harvests is contingent on many factors -- collection intensity, rainfall, and climate change among them.   ""Centuries of collection indicate that caterpillar fungus is a relatively resilient resource,"" he says.   But his research suggests that over-harvesting is contributing to fewer fungal spores being around for the next season. Winkler believes education is the key element to promoting sustainable resource conservation.   ""Knowledge of fungal reproduction ... and (establishing) an end-date to the collection season might allow for sufficient spore dispersal to guarantee sustainability,"" he adds.   As communities in Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries, cope with the economic need and the increasing desire for high-value commodities like yartsa gunbu, conservation efforts will require cooperation between leaders at village, district, and national levels. There is no question this Himalayan ""gold rush"" buoys rural economies. Keeping it around for future generations will be the challenge.",human
"We get the necessary primer before putting in: Drink lots of water, they tell us. Always, but especially on this trip, what with the three cases of wine being loaded onto the rafts.   ""Lunchtime"": That's the answer I get when I inquire about the time. Days here are measured in meals. We've lounged away the morning on a people-free, rapids-free stretch of river in a thickly forested gorge, under a cover of damp fog -- like drifiting through a rain cloud. Even with limited visibility, we've seen a great blue heron, a kingfisher, Canada geese, an osprey, a quick glimpse of an otter and a bald eagle. The river is calm, and we don't have to paddle if we don't want to. Yet, somehow, a stretch and a bite to eat are in order. The chefs have managed to pack all our food, gear and elegantly rustic table settings on the rafts, leaving the rest of us to kick back while they set up and break down each feast.   Sunset.com: Mild and wild defined, plus more rafting trips  Wine-thirty: After several miles of floating, we pull off at the Tyee Campground, a woodsy gravel bar. For the first time in my life, I must assemble a tent alone. But the payoff is grand: I sit down to cumin-grilled Tawanda Farms lamb chops with apricot-jalapeno chutney, assorted Oregon cheeses, fruit, eggplant puree, green olive tapenade, cucumber salad and red pepper relish with wontons and flatbread; followed by pan-seared king salmon with Oregon wasabi-thyme aioli, lemongrass cous-cous and ginger-citrus slaw; and finally topped off with Dagoba chocolate s'mores with homemade marshmallows -- each course paired with wine. It'll go on like this for two more nights. I will persevere.   Sunset.com: The West's best dude ranches  Day 2  Splashing around: I try out one of the inflatable kayaks we've been towing. Nobody, including me, seems to care that I can barely steer. It could just be hypothermia from playing in the 58º water, but I'm feeling close to the river.   Group bonding: This evening's icebreaker involves a spree of mutual toenail painting. Oh, and wine. Lots of wine. Personalities have emerged. Maybe it's the Sewell Rhône Blend talking, but I like these people. After dark, the stars go so many layers deep that a few of us decide to sleep directly under them, and our tents become mere storage units.   Day 3  Campsite gourmet: At the grassy, rolling hillside of the Tacoma Campground, we dine under an old oak tree: smoked steelhead with cream cheese, capers and onions; roasted beets with sheep's-milk feta; greens with candied hazelnuts; grilled American Kobe-style flatiron steak with caramelized onions and housemade Worcestershire. The brussels sprouts sauteed with andouille win multiple approvals, including several from people who thought they didn't like brussels sprouts.   Day 4  The last toast: One last bracing swim and one final meal, when we compare favorite flavors: the Cinsault Rosé, the Malbec, the Fiano, which worked so well with that asparagus; the crawfish cakes with remoulade, the seared duck breast, the lemon sponge cake with huckleberry compote, the everything else. It's safe to say that the uncorrupted outdoors has heightened my sense of deliciousness.

He instructs the eight of us -- a motley crew of three businessmen, a doctor, a lawyer, and a ranching couple -- on what to do if we run into a bear, how to tell a grizzly from a black, and how to prevent Mace mishaps. We're introduced to the Groover (a portable toilet).   Sunset.com: Top wow spots of the Hawaii volcanoes  Day 2  Calm water: After a paddling 101, our three rafts head out through the riffled water that the guides -- Mark, Brian and Jorge -- refer to as ""calm."" Which makes me and Ginny, the other whitewater rookie, mighty nervous about the hardcore rapids to come. We ride 22 miles, dipping our water bottles into the 50º glacier water on the way. The landscape looks surprisingly like New Mexico, with pine-covered mountains and mesas -- plus moose! We spot a chocolate-hued mother with calf and two bald eagles.   Day 3  Rapids!: Here they come. Deep breaths. We don our helmets, wetsuits and life jackets, and practice paddle maneuvers. Back paddle. Hard forward! We vanish into the rapids, as the raft bends and catapults and the waves pound through us on the famous great White Mile: 12 miles of rapids in 55 minutes -- yes, that longest stretch of continuous Class IV on the continent. Mark slides our 18-foot-2-inch raft through an 18-foot-4-inch gorge. We officially become whitewater junkies.   At camp: Tents are pitched while the guides set up and find a scenic spot for the Groover. Dinner is grilled chicken, fresh veggies with ginger butter, tiramisu, and five bottles of well-deserved wine.   Sunset.com: Best national parks -- avoid the crowds  Day 4  An ""easy"" day: Our raft gets hung up on a protuding log inside a rapid. Ever been inside a washing machine? On the ""very cold"" cycle? Jorge deftly extricates us, and we lay out clothes to dry on the rocks. We've entered hoodoo country.   Day 5  Class III cakewalk: Class III? No sweat. We talk politics as we run them. Camp goes up at Big Creek, with 200-year-old pines and grassy meadows. Mark reads stories about spectacular Groover mishaps (picture it overturning while you're in the way).   Sunset.com: The top 26 wilderness experiences  Day 6  The gaping jaws of death: Hang on! Hard forward!! Time for the 8-foot waves of the daunting Farewell Canyon, and I'm paddling too intently to see past the waves. We just clear the foam when Brian yells, ""Bear!"" and a young black bear runs up the cliff. After lunch, we take the two final, gargantuan rapids called Gaping Jaws of Death and Brains Smashed In. I'm drenched. We high-five with our paddles, and pull up to the raft carrying the beer cooler for a toast. Later, there'll be Champagne and reminiscing on a sandy beach under a red sky at our last campsite. And more Groover stories.   To read more rafting adventures, visit Sunset.com.

"The search began Wednesday afternoon and wrapped up at 3 a.m. Thursday at the couple's New Jersey house, said Robert Gottlieb, who represents Rosemary Hernandez.   He said his client ""doesn't know what they were looking for."" The satchels contained personal items including paperwork belonging to Rosemary Hernandez, he said.   Gottlieb said his client was home during the search and cooperated fully. ""An assistant prosecutor called me before investigators entered the house and asked whether she was willing to be there to offer assistance, and she did. She was there in five, 10 minutes. ""  Rosemary Hernandez feels that her husband's confession is unreliable and is coming from a mentally ill man, Gottlieb said.   The suspect, who is being held without bail at New York's Bellevue Hospital, is receiving a medication called olanzapine, according to a source familiar with his medical history. The drug is used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia, according to the National Institutes of Health.   Pedro Hernandez admitted choking the boy after luring him into the basement of a bodega, a small grocery store, on May 25, 1979, police said. Etan's remains have not been found.   His attorney previously told a judge that Hernandez has a history of mental disorders, suffers from hallucinations and is bipolar.   ""Mrs. Hernandez has seen her husband's delusions and hallucinations and other mental illnesses for a very long period of time,"" Gottlieb said.   He would not elaborate on the mental disorders, nor would he provide an example of what his client observed.   ""She does not believe the confession at all,"" Gottlieb said.   Investigators have been trying to build a case against Hernandez, looking for evidence to back up his statements to them.   Police have said they have no other evidence or a motive to support his confession.   A relative has said she reported that Hernandez told family members in the 1980s that he killed a boy in New York. Norma Hernandez, the suspect's sister, said she went to police in Camden, New Jersey, back then but felt that they didn't believe her. Police have said they have no record of that report. Hernandez said her brother also told a prayer group about killing a boy.   Gottlieb said he was asked to represent the wife because of her growing frustration over the case and her desire to make sure prosecutors ""understand the severity and nature of the mental illnesses. ""  A spokesman for the district attorney's office had no comment Wednesday.   Rosemary Hernandez has not seen her husband at Bellevue Hospital but has spoken to him by telephone. ""It's a very difficult time for her and her daughter,"" Gottlieb said.   Pedro Hernandez's next court appearance is scheduled for June 25.",human
"The former House speaker told the congregation that President Washington would not have apologized ""to those who are killing us.""  Now, besides the fact Obama did not apologize ""to those who are killing us"" or that our generals also apologized for the mistake or that the Lord's Prayer asks God to forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us -- I'm trying to figure out who, besides a ""Jeopardy!"" contestant, whips out a George Washington card in the first place?    That's the problem with Gingrich and the other GOP challengers. It seems they have mistaken their base's fervor to defeat Obama for a fervor to hear them pander.   Remember Gingrich's moon base speech while he was campaigning near NASA? Or Mitt Romney quoting ""America the Beautiful"" while in Iowa, saying: ""If you count corn as an amber wave of grain, why, you have them right here. What a wonderful place this is. ""  Seriously, who says that?      The GOP's once credible attacks on the president's record have morphed into an incredible attack on the country's intelligence. That change is reflected by Obama's double-digit lead over the GOP field.   While ""amber waves of grain"" is pretty bad, I thought Romney showing up in Michigan last fall saying, ""The trees are the right height. The grass is the right color for this time of year, kind of a brownish-greenish sort of thing. It just feels right,"" was as low as pandering could go.   Then he showed up in Detroit a couple of days ago and repeated that the ""trees are the right height.""    Hurling out chunks of red meat at a rally is a longstanding practice. Massaging a position to suit the polls, or support the party, is something voters don't like, but we understand the rationale.    But telling a crowd you love their trees and dead grass?  Ridiculous.   Granted, some of us are gullible enough to give each other high-fives because Rick Santorum called Obama a snob for promoting a college education.     But the rest of us look at ""Slick Rick's"" college degree, law degree and MBA, the fact that he's sending his kids to college and owns at least six properties, and has earned millions, and wonder -- What is he talking about? Virtually every socioeconomic study looking at the intersection of income and education shows a direct correlation between the two. For Santorum to vilify higher education for political gain -- while obviously benefiting from attending universities -- is embarrassing. Then saying that John F. Kennedy's famous 1960 speech standing up for the separation of church and state made him want to throw up?    Well, that makes me nauseous.   Sometimes it seems as if Santorum and the others are content with pushing each other closer and closer to the edge of idiocy because that's easier than pushing ideas to convince voters they're the best person for the job.   It's a tactic that might be fine for early cheers in February but will run out of steam the longer this process goes. Usually, a tough primary makes a candidate stronger for the general election, but between the exposure of character flaws and this dumbing-down of rhetoric, it seems to be having the reverse effect on the GOP.     In November, a Pew poll showed then-front-runner Romney was leading Obama 53%-41% among independents. Now, Obama's up 51%-42%, and the president hasn't even started campaigning aggressively. Given some of the disconnected lunacy already heard during the primary, there's no telling what the candidates think they have to say to prove their tea party street cred and lock down the nomination.    I don't know about you, but I have lost my ability to be surprised by the things that come out of these candidates' mouths. I am fully prepared to hear Santorum refer to Obama as the anti-Christ, only to be one-upped the next day by someone calling Obama the super-duper, most evil anti-Christ ever -- fo' real.   It's juvenile. It's stupid. But apparently it's the way this field has chosen to play. Which is why in the eyes of many, they have already lost the game.    The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.",human
"""It's the appearance of arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in concrete situations,"" she added.   But with so many programming choices on broadcast, cable and satellite TV, ""All the government is asking for is a few (broadcast) channels where you can say -- they are not going to hear the s-word, the f-word. They are not going to see nudity,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said.   The court's ruling, which will come in a few months, could establish important First Amendment guidelines over explicit content on the airwaves.   The Justice Department had filed an appeal, and helpfully provided the justices with a DVD of a 2003 episode of the now-canceled ""NYPD Blue"" on ABC in which a naked woman was shown. The content of that program is central to the ongoing legal dispute. Lawyer Seth Waxman representing ABC said the FCC's tough action against the network was ""a shot out of the blue. ""  A federal appeals court last year for a second time struck down the government policies, concluding they were vague and inconsistently applied. Pending fines against the broadcasters were dismissed. ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are all parties in the case.   Controversial words and images have been aired in scripted and unscripted instances on all the major over-the-air networks in the past eight years, dating back to when the FCC began considering a stronger, no-tolerance policy.   The policy became known as the Golden Globes Rule, for singer Bono's 2003 acceptance speech at the live awards show on NBC, where he uttered the phrase ""really, really, f---ing brilliant. ""  The commission specifically cited celebrities Cher and Nicole Richie for potty-mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards, which aired live on Fox. Richie, in an apparent scripted moment said, ""Have you ever tried to get cow s--t out of a Prada purse? It's not so f---ing simple. ""  Justice Stephen Breyer dryly noted the language from the two women ""seems to be naturally part of their vocabulary."" That drew laughter in the courtroom.   The CBS complaint involved dirty language on ""The Early Show,"" a news and interview program.   The high court two years ago ruled in favor of the FCC on the issue of ""fleeting expletives,"" concluding federal regulators have the authority to clamp down on broadcast TV networks airing isolated cases of profanity.   The court, however, refused at the time to decide whether the commission's policy violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech, ruling only on the agency's enforcement power. The justices ordered the free-speech aspect to be reviewed again by a New York-based federal appeals court, which subsequently ruled in favor of the broadcasters.   The Justice Department, in its new appeal, lumped both the expletives and nudity cases together, saying the court should decide the free speech questions as one.   Explicit language is heard with greater, albeit varying, frequency on cable television, the Internet, and satellite radio, which do not use public airwaves. But the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints of ""indecent"" language and images on broadcast television and radio, which is subject to greater regulation.   That is especially relevant during daytime and early evening hours, when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching.   The commission formally reversed its policy in March 2004 to declare even a single use of an expletive could be illegal. In addition, a voluntary rating system is used by all television networks to warn viewers when material that might be offensive will be aired.   Much of the oral argument Tuesday centered around the ABC television stations fined $27,500 each for airing the ""NYPD Blue"" episode featuring a woman with her breasts and buttocks exposed.   ""The episode is called 'Nude Awakening.' It's about the sexual awakening of a child,"" Breyer said. ""The whole thing was titillating,"" suggesting the FCC in this case could step in and declare it indecent.   But Justice Elena Kagan echoed the sentiments of the networks. ""There is some amount of uncertainty, and ABC finds itself in that area of uncertainty,"" she said. ""Because it turns out that nudity -- sometimes it's allowed as to some body parts and sometimes it's not allowed -- and the commission hadn't really said anything about it for 50 years,"" until the clampdown a decade ago.   The networks complain the FCC allowed profanity in such movies as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and full-frontal nudity in ""Schindler's List"" when they aired on broadcast TV, but fined stations for other allegedly ""indecent"" material.   ""Context matters,"" said Chief Justice Roberts, skeptical about what he was hearing from the networks. ""People understand that, including children. When they hear a bad word when someone hits their thumb with a hammer, they understand that's different than having an adult stand in normal conversations and use the words. And it seems to me that your position is saying that the government cannot regulate with an understanding of what takes place in the real world. ""  Another source of contention is whether broadcast radio and the TV networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, and the CW -- should receive treatment differing from their satellite and cable cousins, in a content way. Most broadcast stations are part of the basic cable packages people buy, and just 10% of the population receives its TV only through the airwaves. But the government countered that 69 million television sets are not connected to cable or satellite, and that broadcasting is the medium of choice for children.   ""What do you call it, you surf through all the (cable) channels. And it's not apparent to many people which are broadcast and which are not,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy said to Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who argued for the FCC. ""But you're saying that there's still a value, an importance, in having a higher standard or different standard for broadcast media on the television. Why is that, when there are so many other options? ""  Justice Antonin Scalia: ""Sign me up as supporting Justice Kennedy's notion that this has a symbolic value, just as we require a certain modicum of dress for the people that attend this court. ... If these are public airwaves, the government is entitled to insist upon a certain modicum of decency. ""  But Ginsburg interjected: ""The expletives are in common parlance today. I think that the children are not going to be shocked by them the way they might have been a generation ago. ""  Kagan suggested the broadcast regulatory model has been around since the 1920s. ""It seems to work and it seems to be a good thing that there is some safe haven, even if the old technological bases for that safe haven don't exist anymore. ""  Justice Samuel Alito went further, saying the whole broadcast debate may be moot in a few years. ""Broadcast TV is living on borrowed time. It is not going to be long before it goes the way of vinyl records and eight-track tapes,"" he told the network lawyers. ""I'm sure your clients will continue to make billions of dollars on their programs which are transmitted by cable and by satellite and by Internet. But to the extent they are making money from people who are using rabbit ears (antennas), that is disappearing. ""  Verrilli warned that without the current regulations, viewers would see only more profanity and nudity. ""The risk of the race to the bottom is real, and I think history is showing it. ""  There were flashes of humor throughout. When Waxman noted viewer complaints after a recent Summer Olympics, showing a female statue -- ""very much like some of the statues that are here in this courtroom, that had bare breasts and buttocks"" -- several justices began looking about in search of the artwork.   ""Right over here, Justice Scalia,"" said Waxman, pointing to a carved frieze atop the courtroom showing legal figures, including a bare-breasted symbol of justice. Everyone enjoyed that moment of levity.   The Supreme Court first ventured into the broadcast speech debate in 1978, when it ruled as indecent a monologue by comedian George Carlin on society's taboo surrounding ""seven dirty words."" The bit had received some radio airplay. The justices said ""context"" should be applied when deciding whether words or images are ""indecent.""   The major broadcast television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity, racy images or expletives, even after 10 p.m., when some potentially vulgar words are permitted.   Time Warner -- the parent company of CNN -- filed a supporting amicus brief in the high court dispute two years ago. The company is part owner of the CW broadcast network and operates several cable networks.   The case is Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations Inc. (10-1293).",human
