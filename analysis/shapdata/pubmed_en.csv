"The introduction of this PubMed article focuses on the vulnerability of certain populations and communities to the COVID-19 pandemic. It explains that research has consistently shown that racial/ethnic minorities, the poor, the elderly, people with disabilities, those with low educational attainment, and individuals with comorbidities are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. These groups are often referred to as ""vulnerable"" populations.  Furthermore, it highlights that vulnerability during pandemics goes beyond socioeconomic or health characteristics and includes marginalized and disadvantaged communities that are more likely to experience negative outcomes such as higher case rates, morbidity rates, and mortality rates.  The introduction also mentions that researchers have used various indices based on societal factors to assess vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic. These indices have been associated with higher incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in highly vulnerable areas. Additionally, they have been used to highlight disparities in vaccination coverage and vaccine hesitancy.  The article then discusses how Arctic populations face unique challenges and vulnerabilities due to geographic barriers limiting access to health services, underdeveloped civic infrastructure, larger populations with underlying medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease), lower socioeconomic status,and inadequate housing and sanitation facilities. It also mentions previous pandemics having a disproportionate impact on Arctic residents.  Interestingly, despite their existing vulnerabilities, Arctic communities have experienced fewer dire consequences from COVID-19 compared to developed countries like USA or UK. The diminished impact is attributed to factors such as subsistence activities-based livelihoods,traditional knowledge/practices,resilience campaigns,favorable community leadership/self-determination,widespread vaccination efforts,and remoteness from densely populated areas.  The introduction further points out that previous studies evaluating pandemic risk exposure often overlook a community's strengths while solely focusing on vulnerability or treating resilience simply as the inverse of vulnerability.This study aims at filling this gap by combining an assessment of both vulnerabilityandresilience among Alaskan communities within one integrated conceptual model.The authors propose an asset-based approach that focuses on community strengths rather than deficiencies as a comprehensive pandemic risk assessment.  The authors emphasize that combining the evaluation of vulnerability and resilience is crucial for identifying populations and communities at the highest risk, enabling efficient resource allocation, mitigation measures, recovery planning, and support services tailored to local realities. They also highlight that understanding health disparities and determinants in global health research should include remote regions like the Arctic.  In summary, this introduction raises awareness about the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations globally. It highlights the unique vulnerabilities of Arctic communities and their capacity to address pandemic risks by incorporating a comprehensive assessment of vulnerability and resilience. The integrated approach aims to inform public officials, local organizations, and policymakers about resource allocation for future pandemics driven by global factors such as globalization, human migration, urbanization,and climate change. In addition to the focus on vulnerability and resilience, the article emphasizes the importance of considering the unique characteristics and context of Arctic communities when assessing pandemic risk. It notes that using universal indicators, such as poverty rates, may underestimate the capacity of these communities to prevent, withstand, and recover from pandemic exposure.  The authors propose an alternative approach based on assets rather than deficiencies. This asset-based approach acknowledges that factors like family relations and subsistence activities in Arctic communities contribute to their ability to cope with income limitations. By shifting the research focus from community weaknesses to strengths, a more comprehensive assessment of pandemic risk can be achieved.  The study aims to develop indices of vulnerability and resilience specific to Arctic communities in Alaska by integrating various sociodemographic factors into a conceptual model. This framework will allow for a more nuanced understanding of how vulnerability and resilience interact in shaping COVID-19 epidemiological outcomes.  By conducting this combined assessment of vulnerability and resilience, public officials and local organizations can better allocate resources and services based on local realities. This tailored approach is essential for addressing the diverse needs of different populations or communities during pandemics.  Furthermore, the article acknowledges that remote regions like the Arctic are often overlooked in global health research. However, studying these regions is crucial for understanding health disparities as well as social and environmental determinants not only during COVID-19 but also in general.  The conclusion highlights how future global pandemics driven by factors like globalization,migration,and climate change are likely to occur. Therefore,the evaluationofvulnerabilityandresilience will continue being important tools for identifying at-risk populations or areas with greater needs,supporting resource allocation efforts,and implementing effective mitigation measures.  In summary,this PubMed article discusses both vulnerabilityandresilienceamongdifferentcommunitiesduringtheCOVID-19pandemic.Particularly,focusingonArcticpopulationsinAlaska,itillustratesthatassessingpandemicriskrequiresanintegratedunderstandingofcertainpopulationcharacteristics,uniquecontextvulnerabilities,andsociodemographicfactors.Acomprehensiveapproachthatincorporatescommunitystrengthsaswellasweaknessesprovidesanovelperspectivetoguidepublichealthstrategiesandresourceallocationduringpandemics.",explain

It aims to summarize the current state of research and identify the main challenges associated with integrating digital healthcare for acute heart failure management, particularly in combination with Chinese and Western medicine. The authors also aim to explore the potential benefits and prospects of using digital prevention and treatment strategies that incorporate both medical approaches.  By conducting this research, the authors hope to establish a basis for proposing new strategies and protocols for clinical management. They recognize that with advances in technology and the increasing demand for personalized healthcare, there is a pressing need to adjust existing healthcare models in China by incorporating digital medical technologies like remote monitoring programs.  The ultimate goal is to optimize clinical treatment protocols by leveraging the advantages of digital medicine combined with Chinese and Western treatments. By doing so, they anticipate an improvement in treating acute heart failure patients, enhancing their symptoms, quality of life, and overall cardiac function.  The introduction implies that through an integrated approach combining traditional medical practices with digital tools such as smartphones, wearable devices,sensors,and AI-based analysis systems,the accuracy,timeliness,and effectiveness of diagnosis,treatment monitoring,and prevention can significantly improve.This integration would involve collating patient physiological data alongwith other relevant health information from diverse sources into interoperable systems-assisting physicians in better decision-making while reducing patient readmissions.The precise use cases,the available resources,and possible limitations are expected[REF-needed].  In conclusion,the introduction sets up key aspects related to applying digital medicine technologies within acute heart failure management.It establishes a foundation exploring opportunities,challenges faced by current approaches,discusses possible strategies,enabling future development,care improvements,guidelines formation(for prevention,treatments)with backgrounds combining western (conventional)and Chinese medicines.Promoting personalized care achieving enhanced outcomes in AHF patients has been envisaged[REF-needed].",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the importance of the Arachis hypogaea, commonly known as peanut or groundnut, in terms of its production and nutritional value. It highlights that peanuts are a significant source of digestible protein, cooking oil, and vitamins in many regions around the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and America where they play a crucial role in fighting malnutrition and ensuring food security.  However, despite its importance as a crop, peanut productivity levels remain low in developing countries due to various constraints such as biotic (living organisms) and abiotic (environmental) stresses. The article emphasizes that breeding new cultivars with improved productivity is essential for meeting the needs of producers, consumers, and industry.  One challenge faced by peanut breeding programs is the limited genetic diversity within cultivated peanuts. As an allotetraploid species (containing two complete sets of chromosomes from different diploid ancestors), peanuts have low genetic diversity compared to their diploid wild relatives within the Arachis genus. This lack of genetic exchange between cultivated peanuts and wild ancestors contributes to increased susceptibility to pests and pathogens.  The limited genetic diversity and tetraploid complexity pose barriers to creating cultivars with broad resistance, excellent quality, and high yield. The article suggests that exploring gene resources present in diploid Wild Arachis species through advanced genomic techniques can potentially overcome some limitations.  Omics technologies are then introduced as powerful tools for gene discovery and functional elucidation. These technologies allow scientists to study intricate biological systems based on advances in genomics (DNA sequencing), transcriptomics (gene expression analysis), proteomics (study of proteins), metabolomics (study of small molecules), interactomic analysis (protein-protein interactions), hormonomic analysis (plant hormone signaling), etc.  The emergence of next-generation sequencing has revolutionized genomic research by enabling whole-genome resequencing for variant discovery. Additionally, it has made possible other applications such as transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq), epigenome dynamics (Chip-Seq), and network analysis to explore connections between genes and metabolites.  The integration of omics technologies provides a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between phenotype (observable characteristics) and genotype (genetic makeup). The article highlights that these techniques have greatly facilitated molecular studies of peanut-biotic factor interactions, specifically focusing on peanut defense responses and resistance to biotic stresses caused by insects, pathogens, and bacteria.  In summary, the introduction outlines the significance of peanuts as a crop in terms of production and nutrition. It also establishes the challenges faced by breeding programs due to limited genetic diversity. Finally, it introduces omics technologies as valuable tools for studying molecular aspects related to peanut defense mechanisms against diseases and pests. Continuing from the previous explanation, the PubMed article further explains how omics-based studies have contributed to a better understanding of molecular pathways involved in peanut defense responses and resistance to biotic stresses.  The article emphasizes that studying these molecular aspects is crucial for developing strategies to enhance crop protection against pests and pathogens. By uncovering the underlying genetic mechanisms and identifying specific genes involved in defense responses, researchers can ultimately develop improved cultivars with enhanced resistance.  Genomic analysis has allowed scientists to identify candidate genes associated with resistance traits. By comparing genetic sequences of different peanut varieties or wild relatives, researchers can identify variations that are linked to disease resistance. This information can then be utilized in breeding programs to select for desirable traits.  Transcriptomics, which involves studying gene expression patterns using techniques such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), offers insights into which genes are activated or repressed in response to biotic stresses. Such information helps unravel the complex regulatory networks involved in defense mechanisms against pests and pathogens.  Proteomic analysis aims at understanding protein profiles and changes in protein abundance under stress conditions. It provides valuable information about proteins that play essential roles in plant defense against biotic factors. By identifying these proteins, researchers gain insight into key molecular players involved in pathogen recognition, signal transduction pathways, and immune responses.  Metabolomics studies focus on analyzing small molecules produced by plants during stress situations. These molecules serve as important chemical messengers for communication between plants and their environment. Through metabolomic analysis, scientists can identify compounds that contribute to plant defense by acting as antimicrobial agents or signaling molecules.  Furthermore, interactomic analysis enables researchers to explore protein-protein interactions within defense-related pathways. By building networks of interacting proteins involved in plant immunity, new insights are gained regarding how different components interact and cooperate during defense responses.  Hormones also play a crucial role in mediating plant immune responses through hormone signaling pathways. Hormonomic analysis elucidates how hormones such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene are regulated and integrated in defense signaling networks.  Lastly, integrating all these omics approaches allows researchers to unravel the connections between genes, proteins, metabolites, and phenotypic traits. By utilizing advanced computational tools for data analysis and network modeling, scientists can gain a systems-level understanding of how different components interact to confer resistance against biotic stresses.  In summary, the article highlights that omics technologies have revolutionized peanut research by providing valuable information about the genetic basis of defense responses and resistance to biotic stresses. These studies contribute to ongoing efforts in developing improved peanut cultivars with enhanced productivity and resilience against pests and diseases.",explain
"The introduction of the PubMed article discusses the growing interest in plant-based diets as a means to achieve sustainable development goals that optimize human and environmental health. It highlights that plant-based diets have been associated with a reduced risk of various noncommunicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.  The introduction further emphasizes that both the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization recommend a sustainable healthy diet that is predominantly plant-based. This includes whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruits, vegetables, moderate amounts of eggs, dairy, poultry and fish, as well as small amounts of red meat.  To define plant-based diets more specifically for research purposes, it is mentioned that these diets are characterized by high intakes of foods from plants (fruits and vegetables) and lower intakes of foods from animals (red meat and dairy products).  This sets the stage for discussing how previous research has classified study participants based on their consumption or elimination of animal foods in binary terms. However, it acknowledges that there is a need to characterize plant-based dietary patterns along a continuum rather than through strict categorization.  The introduction introduces diet quality indices as an approach used to assess the quality and variety of foods consumed within a plant-based diet. These indices consider prior knowledge such as dietary guidelines and cultural eating habits to create composite scores reflecting compliance with specified criteria.  Several examples are provided to demonstrate how existing diet quality indices reflect different aspects of plant- and animal-based food consumption. For example, one index focuses on traditional Nordic diet components while others differentiate between healthy versus less healthy plant-based foods.  Given the increasing development of new diet quality indices for assessing plant-based diets alongside research examining their associations with health outcomes, it is emphasized in this introduction that reviewing these indices becomes imperative. The scoping review presented in this article aims to identify and critically evaluate existing diet quality indices used for assessing plant-based diets among adult populations, including their development, construction methodology, and validity.  The ultimate goal of this review is to provide researchers with a comprehensive synthesis of available indices and enable them to select the most suitable index for their own research question. Additionally, it aims to contribute to the field of research on plant-based diets by providing insights into the current state of diet quality indices used in this context. Continuing from the previous explanation, the introduction highlights that this scoping review is essential due to the proliferation of new plant-based diet quality indices and increasing research examining their associations with health outcomes. By conducting a thorough review of these indices, researchers will have a clearer understanding of their basis for development, construction methodology, and validity.  Identifying and critically evaluating diet quality indices used for assessing plant-based diets among adult populations is important for several reasons. Firstly, it allows researchers to assess the appropriateness of different indices for specific research questions or study designs. Not all indices may capture the full spectrum of plant-based eating patterns or provide reliable measures of dietary quality.  Secondly, understanding the basis for development and construction methodology helps evaluate whether an index adequately captures key nutritional components or elements specific to plant-based diets. A robust index should have been developed based on sound scientific principles considering relevant dietary guidelines and cultural context.  Thirdly, assessing the validity of these diet quality indices provides insights into their ability to measure what they claim to measure. Validity refers to how accurately an index reflects individuals' actual adherence to a given dietary pattern. An index with high validity will demonstrate strong associations with relevant health outcomes.  By critically reviewing existing diet quality indices used for assessing plant-based diets among adults in this scoping review, researchers aim to fill gaps in current knowledge in this field. This synthesis seeks not only to provide a comprehensive overview but also build upon previous studies by evaluating each index's strengths and limitations.  The findings of this scoping review will be valuable not only for scientists studying the relationships between plant-based diets and health outcomes but also policymakers interested in promoting sustainable and healthy eating patterns among populations worldwide.  In conclusion, this PubMed article's introduction sets up its primary objective: conducting a scoping review that identifies diet quality indices used for assessing plant-based diets among adult populations while critically evaluating their development basis, construction methodology, and validity. It emphasizes the importance of this review in guiding future research by helping researchers select appropriate indices and promoting knowledge advancement in the field of plant-based diets' impact on human health.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the composition and significance of microorganisms in the human body, specifically focusing on eukaryotic cells, mitochondria, and the microbiota. It starts by highlighting that the human body is composed of trillions of eukaryote cells that govern various functions. However, despite their diverse functions, the origin and development of eukaryotic cells remains enigmatic.  The emergence of mitochondria is mentioned as a crucial event in this process. Mitochondria are energy-generating organelles specific to eukaryotic cells. They are believed to have formed through a symbiotic relationship between an archaeal host cell (from the phylum Lokiarcheaeota) and a bacterial cell related to alpha-proteobacteria. This endosymbiosis was mutually beneficial for both organisms and led to their coevolution and stability.  The long-standing partnership between these organisms eventually resulted in the formation of eukaryotic cells as we know them today, which make up animals, plants, fungi, and protists. The symbiotic event between archaea and bacteria is estimated to have occurred billions of years ago.  The article then explores how all plants and animals harbor symbiotic microorganisms that can have neutral (commensalism), harmful (parasitism), or beneficial effects (mutualism) on their hosts. These interactions play a role in coevolution and can change dynamically depending on external factors.  In humans, viruses,  bacteria,  archaea,  nanoarchaea,  and eukaryotic microbes   including fungi  protozoan  and parasitic helminths   constitute the microbiota residing within our bodies. Remarkably,  the number  of microbial cells  is roughly equal  to that- amount- which-  comprises- human...  cells; however...  the gene count...  far exceeds...  This microbiota symbiotically contributes to various functions such as metabolism, immune processes, and signaling in almost all organs of the body.  The introduction also highlights the role of microorganisms in health and disease, including cancer. It is noted that specific microorganisms have been classified as human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and infection-induced cancers make up a significant portion of global cancer burden. Furthermore, microbial interactions in the gut microbiota can influence tumorigenesis and patient prognosis through various mechanisms involving metabolites, genotoxins, inflammation, and immune responses.  The influence of microorganisms on response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy is also mentioned. The gut microbiome is specifically highlighted as a focus of research due to its richness,  diversity,  and easy accessibility for sampling compared to other bacterial microbiomes.  The oxygen gradient within the gut lumen generated by host factors like diet influences microbial growth and composition in a way that promotes growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria in the large intestine. This information becomes relevant when discussing tumors since they have low oxygen levels compared to normal tissue and create chemotactic gradients that can attract bacteria.

"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of cardiomyopathies, which are disorders of the heart muscle (myocardium) caused by both genetic and environmental factors. These conditions ultimately lead to impaired cardiac function and heart failure.  Cardiomyopathies can have different effects on the function and structure of the heart, as well as the presence of arrhythmias. They are categorized into several types, including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restrictive cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM). DCM is the most common form, affecting approximately 1 in 250 individuals, followed by HCM affecting 1 in 500 people. ACM is less common, occurring in about 1 in 5,000 individuals.  Around 30% to 50% of cardiomyopathies have a heritable component, meaning they can be passed down through generations. Different types may have distinct phenotypes (observable characteristics), prognosis (outcomes), and causal mutations responsible for their development.  In HCM specifically, mutations in sarcomeric genes are primarily implicated. Sarcomeres are structural units within muscle cells that enable contraction. Pathogenic variants in genes such as beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and myosin binding protein C3 (MYBPC3) occur frequently and affect proteins within thick filaments of sarcomeres. These mutations typically lead to disease onset around a person's forties.  On the other hand, DCM exhibits functional diversity among its causative genes. Mutations involving Titin (TTN)—a giant protein involved in maintaining muscle structure—account for around 12% to 25% of DCM cases. Lamin gene variants representing LMNA rank second among these patients' genetic mutations. Other affected genes include MYH7, TNNT2 Tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), Desmoplakin (DSP), RNA binding motif protein 20 (RBM20), and sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 5 (SCN5A).  In ACM, pathogenic variants often occur in genes encoding proteins that make up desmosomes, which are structures involved in cell adhesion. Genes such as Plakoglobin (JUP) DSP, Plakophilin-2 (PKP2), Desmoglein-2 (DSG2), and Desmocollin-2(DSC2) play critical roles in ACM development.  Restrictive cardiomyopathies are typically caused by mutations in sarcomeric genes like cardiac troponin I. To a lesser extent, mutations in other genes such as Desmin (DES) and Filamin C also contribute to this type of cardiomyopathy.  Although different types of cardiomyopathies have distinct clinical presentations, their underlying mechanisms and phenotypic features can overlap significantly.  Advances in genetic sequencing techniques like next-generation sequencing and genome-wide association studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis for cardiomyopathies. Multiple studies have identified susceptibility regions and genetic variants associated with various types of these conditions. It is important to note that most rare disease-causing variants are found within coding regions of the genome.  For example, truncations—where part of a gene is missing—of the TTN gene are considered leading genetic causes of DCM when present. On the other hand, MYBPC3 truncating variants or missense variants—where there is a change in a single DNA building block—are prominent among HCM-causing mutations detected using next-generation sequencing methodologies.  Despite these advancements, there can still be difficulty identifying specific causative variants for familial cases using targeted genetic screening tests based on whole exome sequencing or limited region-focused sequencing approaches.  The introduction suggests that noncoding genetic variants, which are changes in DNA segments that do not code for proteins, may play a significant role in cardiomyopathies. Whole genome sequencing has provided evidence supporting the association between noncoding genetic variants and these heart diseases.  Emerging research also highlights the importance of disruption in regulatory regions within the genome. For example, alterations in transcription factor binding sites within enhancers or promoters can have an impact on the 3D chromatin structure and reduce gene expression, which can be crucial for disease development.  Furthermore, noncoding variants within intronic or untranslated regions (UTRs) could also contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies. In fact, a substantial percentage of non-coding variants at splice sites (where coding segments are joined together) and UTRs have been classified as either pathogenic or likely pathogenic.  In this review article, the authors emphasize exploring noncoding genetic variants and their association with cardiomyopathies. Specifically focusing on promoter regions (which initiate gene expression), enhancers (regulatory elements that influence gene activity), untranslated regions (sections before protein coding sequences), splicing sites (important for mRNA processing), and intronic regions may provide valuable insights into how these mutations contribute to cardiac disease development.  The accompanying figure provides a schematic illustration of various noncoding parts of eukaryotic genomes—including enhancer, promoter, 5′ UTRs (untranslated regions), introns, and 3′ UTRs—highlighting their relevance in this context.  Overall, this introduction sets up the importance of studying noncoding genetic variations in understanding cardiomyopathies beyond just coding region mutations—a perspective that is supported by recent advances using next-generation sequencing techniques.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by acknowledging that although artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in various fields throughout history, its integration into daily life is a more recent development. Initially, AI was primarily used in academia and government research institutions, but as technology has advanced, it has also found applications in industry, commerce, medicine, and dentistry.  The article then highlights the human experience of becoming aware of our physical and mental limitations. In the past, these limitations often had significant consequences because there was no way to surpass them or improve upon our abilities. While machines have undoubtedly made everyday life easier from a physical standpoint, there has long been a desire among inventors, researchers, and philosophers to combine machine endurance and reliability with human-like intelligence and consciousness.  The theoretical foundations for what we now call AI were laid by mathematicians Alan Turing, Claude E. Shannon, and Norbert Wiener. Turing is considered the father of theoretical computer science; Shannon is known as the father of information theory; and Wiener is the founder of cybernetics. These visionaries are credited with introducing the concept of creating intelligent machines.  The concept of AI itself emerged in 1956 when researchers at Dartmouth College initiated an eight-week research project on Artificial Intelligence. Their goal was to create ""thinking machines"" that could mimic human intelligence and behavior. This event marks the formal beginning of AI as a field of study.  To better understand AI's scope within this introduction's context clarifies the differences between artificial intelligence itself along with deep learning, machine learning.,and data science—all fields related yet distinct from one another.  Artificial intelligence is introduced as a broad field encompassing techniques aimed at creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence like visual perception or decision-making processes. It can be divided into branches such as expert systems (used extensively in healthcare), robotics (used across industries), or natural language processing (used for voice assistants).  Deep learning, as a subfield of AI, focuses on the application of neural networks inspired by the structure of the human brain. It utilizes large amounts of data to automatically identify and extract features for making predictions or decisions in areas such as image or speech recognition.  Machine learning is another subfield that concentrates on developing algorithms and statistical models so computers can learn from data without explicit programming. Supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning techniques empower computers to make predictions (recommendation systems), detect fraud or undertake predictive modeling tasks.  Data science combines statistical and computational techniques with domain-specific knowledge to gain insights from data. Activities encompassed within this field include data acquisition, cleaning/pre-processing, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling/research/building predictive models. It plays a role in various domains such as healthcare or finance.  The introduction concludes by discussing how AI has gradually integrated into daily life over time. It describes some early examples like expert systems mimicking human decision-making abilities in fields like medicine or finance during the 1980s and 1990s. However, in the 21st century, AI has expanded further into consumer products/services ranging from virtual personal assistants (e.g., Siri) to recommendation systems personalized for customers' experiences (e.g., Netflix). Moreover, AI is now being employed in self-driving cars, healthcare applications alongside advancements within financial sectors.  Furthermore mentioned are three generations of AI: artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), artificial general intelligence (AGI), and artificial superintelligence (ASI). ANI represents today's prevalent type of AI seen through facial recognition/tagging used by Facebook or our virtual voice assistants found on smartphones like Siri/Alexa/Bixby. AGI is expected to think/plan/problem-solve independently while ASI represents an advanced generation where self-awareness might make human input obsolete for certain situations.  Overall it provides a comprehensive overview highlighting the historical context behind AI development, its integration into various fields, and the different subfields and related subjects within the AI domain.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the importance and complexity of glycans in the human body. It explains that glycans are structurally diverse biomolecules found on all cells and tissues, and glycosylation is the primary source of microheterogeneity in proteins.  The introduction highlights that almost all proteins passing through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi during biosynthesis are modified with O- or N-linked glycans. These glycans, as part of the cellular glycocalyx, play crucial roles in various biological processes such as intracellular transport, cell adhesion, interactions between cells and with their surrounding matrix, as well as cellular signaling.  It is emphasized that while at least 4000 human genes are involved in glycan synthesis, glycans themselves are not directly encoded by the genome. Genetic defects in the glycosylation machinery can be lethal at an early embryonic stage, underscoring their vital role.  The dynamic structure and composition of glycans can vary among different cells. Endogenous factors like specific expression levels of glycosyltransferases and pH in ER and Golgi influence these characteristics. Additionally, age and environmental factors including lifestyle choices and diet have been shown to affect the glycocalyx. Alterations in glycan structures often reflect abnormal conditions such as cancer.  Tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) receive increasing attention due to their central role in cancer progression. However, carbohydrates are generally poorly immunogenic compared to other molecules like proteins. Vaccination using carbohydrates typically results in low-affinity Immunoglobulin M (IgM) production rather than class-switching to high-affinity Immunoglobulin G (IgG). This poses challenges for developing effective vaccines against TACAs since T-cell-mediated immunity is critical for active cancer immunotherapy.  Furthermore, TACAs often resemble healthy cell glycans structurally which allows them to evade immune detection. They are also expressed at low levels in healthy tissue or during prenatal development, contributing to their tolerance by the immune system. To overcome the limitation of glycan immunogenicity, glycans are conjugated to carrier proteins in vaccine development.  Targeting TACAs offers advantages in cancer therapy as they are less susceptible to antigen escape compared to protein markers due to their complex synthesis process involving multiple enzymes. TACAs are more abundant than protein tumour antigens and frequently identified in a larger percentage of patients. Several therapeutic antibodies targeting TACAs have been approved for cancer treatment.  The introduction also discusses the structure and function of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used in therapy, including their interactions with immune cells and complement system components. Although mAbs have been successful therapeutically, their large size limits penetration into dense tissues like tumor microenvironments.  To address these limitations, smaller antigen-binding fragments such as Fab, scFv, and single-domain Abs have been developed through enzymatic cleavage or recombinant protein expression systems. These fragments offer improved access to dense tissues and allow for genetic engineering and the development of multivalent/multispecific tools.  However, some recombinant antibody fragments exhibit reduced stability and affinity compared to full-length antibodies. Additionally, most antibody fragments suffer from fast renal clearance due to their small size below the glomerular filtration cut-off.  In summary, this introduction provides an overview of glycans' importance in human physiology and pathology while highlighting challenges related to their use as targets for immunotherapy. It sets up the rationale for developing smaller antibody fragments that can overcome limitations associated with full-length antibodies while maintaining stability and optimal serum half-life for effective cancer therapy.

"This introduction provides an overview of the global incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), specifically focusing on the high prevalence and incidence among young women in sub-Saharan Africa. It highlights the need for effective preventive measures, particularly in this population.  The first paragraph establishes the context by stating that there has been a rapid increase in STI incidence globally over the past decade, with more than one million curable STIs acquired daily. It also mentions that young women in sub-Saharan Africa are disproportionately affected by both curable STIs and HIV.  The second paragraph further emphasizes these trends by mentioning specific statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), which estimated 374 million new infections of four curable STIs in 2020. It also highlights limited data suggesting high incidence rates of STIs among women participating in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) trials.  The third paragraph explains why addressing STIs is crucial for women's health, as they can lead to severe complications such as infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and increased susceptibility to HIV. The paragraph also notes that women face higher biological risks compared to men when it comes to complications from STIs.  The subsequent paragraphs discuss factors contributing to higher STI prevalence among younger women in sub-Saharan Africa, including cultural, economic, and social marginalization. The challenges faced by women regarding negotiation of preventive measures further underscore their vulnerability.  The introduction then introduces doxycycline as a potential post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategy for preventing bacterial STIs. It mentions that doxycycline is already widely used for other infections such as malaria and lyme disease. Results from a clinical trial conducted among men who have sex with men (MSM) using HIV PrEP showed promising reductions in bacterial STI rates when using doxycycline PEP.  Despite these promising findings, there is limited information available on how perception of risk and prevalence of STIs among women receiving HIV prevention care may influence the efficacy of doxycycline PEP. The need for trials specifically focusing on young African women is emphasized.  The introduction concludes by introducing the doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (dPEP) Trial, which aims to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline PEP for STI prevention in cisgender women in Kisumu, Kenya. It mentions that this trial is the first to assess the efficacy of doxycycline PEP in this population, and describes the objective of this paper as outlining the baseline characteristics of participants in the dPEP Trial.  In summary, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of global STI trends, emphasizes the disproportionate impact on young African women, introduces doxycycline as a potential preventive strategy, highlights gaps in knowledge and ongoing clinical trials among different populations, and sets up the specific focus and objectives of this particular study. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, the subsequent sections of this paper are likely to delve into more specific details regarding the design, methodology, and findings of the dPEP Trial. These sections will provide a comprehensive understanding of the study population and shed light on how doxycycline PEP may contribute to reducing STI incidence among cisgender women.  The paper may further explain how participants were selected for this open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted in Kisumu, Kenya. It is important to understand their baseline characteristics and demographic information to assess if there are any factors that could potentially influence their risk for acquiring STIs or affect their response to doxycycline PEP.  The authors might discuss relevant definitions and measurements used in assessing STIs in this trial. This could include information such as which specific bacterial pathogens (e.g., Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum) were targeted for prevention with doxycycline PEP. They may also describe how these infections were diagnosed or confirmed within the study population.  Additionally, given that this trial was conducted among women already receiving HIV prevention care through syndromic management of STIs and daily oral PrEP, it would be interesting to learn whether participant perceptions about their own risk for acquiring STIs align with actual infection rates. This can help determine if there is a need for enhanced education or interventions targeting risk perception among this population.   Furthermore, since limited data exist on using doxycycline PEP specifically among cisgender women in sub-Saharan Africa, examining potential differences based on age group could provide valuable insights into variations in susceptibility or preventive behaviors across different cohorts within this population.  It is also likely that the researchers will explore challenges related to implementation and adherence to doxycycline as a preventive strategy within an African context. Factors such as acceptability issues by participants, potential side effects or complications, and ongoing monitoring of adherence might be discussed.  In conclusion, this PubMed article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dPEP Trial and its potential for reducing STI incidence among young women in sub-Saharan Africa. By outlining the baseline characteristics of the study population and discussing the methodology employed in evaluating doxycycline PEP, researchers can provide critical insights into how this preventive approach can be effective for cisgender women. The findings from this trial could inform future interventions focusing on STI prevention strategies tailored to high-risk populations within the region.",explain
"This PubMed article introduces the topic of the oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor (Olig) family of proteins and their role in neural cell fate and specification. The Olig family consists of three proteins: Olig1, Olig2, and Olig3. Initially, studies showed that these genes are expressed in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), where Olig1 regulates the formation and maturation of oligodendrocytes in the brain, and Olig2 modulates oligodendrogenesis in the spinal cord.  However, further research revealed that the Olig proteins are also involved in neurogenesis. Specifically, Olig2 is expressed in progenitors of motor neurons in the developing spinal cord. Additionally, it was found that Olig1/2 can generate inhibitory interneurons in the brain. More recently, it was discovered that GABAergic neurons are derived from cells belonging to the Olig3 lineage.  The article then discusses how the role of the Olig family in astrocyte specification is not well established. Some studies suggest that Oli1/2 may promote astrocyte differentiation after generating interneurons. However, other studies indicate that expression of these genes may inhibit astrocyte development and confirm neuronal or oligodendroglial fate instead.  The introduction then transitions to discuss gliomas - primary brain tumors derived from neural stem cells or progenitor cells - which express various members of the Olig family. Gliomas account for approximately 30% of all primary brain tumors and 80% are considered malignant.  Traditionally, gliomas have been classified based on histopathological features established by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, advancements in technology have allowed for improved molecular and genomic classification methods. The current WHO classification divides gliomas into six families based on different criteria such as age group or specific genetic alterations.  Prognosis and therapeutic success for gliomas rely on accurate diagnosis. However, distinguishing between different types of gliomas based solely on histological markers can be challenging due to similar morphological characteristics. Furthermore, observer variability can lead to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of the correct disease.  The introduction concludes by mentioning the adoption of molecular markers and revised grading in the 2021 WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). This updated classification aims to improve accuracy in differentiating glioma subtypes. The expression of Olig2 across all gliomas has been confirmed through large datasets such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  The article provides insight into ongoing research regarding the expression and role of Olig genes in oligodendrocytes, neurogenesis, and various types of brain tumors. Understanding these factors is crucial for improving diagnosis and developing targeted therapies for diseases involving neural cell fate regulation. The article then focuses on the specific expression and role of Olig genes in gliomas. It explains that adult-type diffuse gliomas, which include oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, and glioblastomas (GBMs), are further categorized based on histological characteristics and molecular markers.  Oligodendrogliomas with mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p/19q have attracted attention due to their favorable response to chemotherapy. These tumors also commonly exhibit mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter gene.  On the other hand, IDH-mutant astrocytomas are now graded as WHO grade II, III, or IV based on specific criteria. They often harbor additional mutations in genes such as ATRX and TP53.  Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with a high mortality rate. IDH-wildtype GBM shows alterations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and TERT promoter mutations similar to oligodendrogliomas.  The article highlights that attempts to diagnose oligodendrogliomas have utilized markers associated with mature or immature oligodendrocytes. However, traditional markers like myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), NG2, or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) lack specificity for distinguishing between glioma types.  Several studies have reported marked expression of Olig2 specifically in oligodendrogliomas. Anaplastic oligodendroglioma samples showed intense nuclear Olig2 expression. The cells displayed round nuclei with perinuclear halos, consistent with the characteristics of oligodendroglial tumors. Some studies also observed upregulation of both Olig1 and Olig2 in oligodendrogliomas.  In contrast, the expression of Olig genes in astrocytomas and GBMs has been inconsistent. Generally, low levels of Olig1 and Olig2 have been observed in these tumor types. However, the variability in their expression suggests that the role of Olig proteins may differ in different glioma subtypes.  The article concludes this section by discussing the challenges of accurately diagnosing gliomas based solely on histological features. Similar morphological characteristics between different types of gliomas can lead to confusion and biased classifications. This highlights the need for reliable molecular markers to aid in distinguishing between glioma subtypes.  Overall, this PubMed article provides an overview of the oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor (Olig) family and its role in neural cell fate determination as well as its expression patterns within different types of gliomas. The understanding of these factors has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy and developing targeted therapeutics for various neurologic diseases involving misregulation or tumor formation within neural cell lineages.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the significant impact of cancer on both individual health and society as a whole in European countries.

"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the recognition and adoption of digital health by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO resolution acknowledges the importance of digital technology in achieving universal health coverage and sustainable development goals. This sets the stage for understanding the relevance and significance of digital healthcare (DHC), which involves the convergence of digital technology with healthcare.  The article then explains that DHC has become increasingly important due to various factors, such as changes brought about by the fourth industrial revolution, demographic shifts like population aging, and social changes such as widespread use of smart devices. These factors have increased the demand for DHC.  Furthermore, it points out that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the adoption and spread of DHC. Contactless healthcare services enabled by digital technology have become more prevalent than ever before.  Next, it introduces musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) as a significant health issue. MSDs encompass a wide range of chronic conditions affecting bones, joints, and soft tissues. Musculoskeletal pain is a common symptom associated with MSDs, with low back and neck pain being leading causes of disability worldwide.  The article provides alarming statistics about MSD prevalence globally – approximately 1.71 billion individuals suffer from these disorders, making them a major cause of disability worldwide. In specific countries like the UK and Korea mentioned in this introduction section's cited references also face high rates of MSDs among their populations.  Rehabilitation is emphasized as an essential component for managing MSDs effectively throughout patients' lives at different stages starting from childhood to old age. It mentions that exercises designed to increase muscle strength, flexibility, and mobility play an integral role in patients' rehabilitation programs.  Pain control is also highlighted as a major concern when caring for individuals with MSDs undergoing rehabilitation programs.   Additionally mentioned are initiatives like Austria's secondary preventive program aimed at preventing rehospitalization through observation studies where physical inactivity was found to be strongly associated with healthcare service needs.  The article then explores the potential of DHC in enhancing musculoskeletal rehabilitation. It explains that using digital health technologies like Internet-based platforms, smartphone applications, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) can make rehabilitation more interactive and engaging. The availability of accelerometer-based physical activity trackers on smartphones and smartwatches is also mentioned as a practical feature for individuals unfamiliar with advanced technology, including older adults.

"This PubMed article focuses on lung cancer, which is responsible for the highest number of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In 2018 alone, there were over 1.5 million deaths from lung cancer, with an incidence rate exceeding 2 million cases (11.6%). The majority of lung cancer cases are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Unfortunately, most patients are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic stage lung cancer, leading to limited curative options and poor outcomes. Over the past few decades, innovative strategies have been developed to address this challenge. For instance, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been designed to target specific mutations in tumor cells that drive their growth and survival. Immunotherapies have also emerged as a promising approach.  On one hand, personalized medicine based on molecular alterations specific to individual patients has demonstrated efficacy in clinical applications but is only applicable to a subset of the population. On the other hand, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are now widely used but elicit varying response rates. Less than 40% of patients selected based on programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression show positive responses.  With the aim of improving clinical outcomes for lung cancer patients, numerous biomarkers have been investigated over recent decades. One such biomarker is PD-L1 expression in tumor biopsy samples which helps identify individuals who may benefit from ICI treatment. Patients with high PD-L1 tumor proportion scores (TPS ≥50%) exhibit superior response rates compared to platinum-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment option.  Despite these advancements, resistance and relapses still occur frequently among treated patients. Consequently, global age-standardized five-year survival rates remain low at around 10-20%, exhibiting only a modest increase of up to 5%. This necessitates further refinement and improvement in clinical management approaches for lung cancer.  To enhance patient care and monitoring throughout all stages of lung cancer, soluble biomarkers have been explored in plasma or total blood samples. These biomarkers offer advantages such as real-time monitoring, feasibility of repeated measurements, and the ability to detect disease progression even in cases where radiographic assessment is inconclusive (known as biological minimal residual diseases). Liquid biopsy techniques utilizing these circulating tumor-derived products have even been integrated into clinical practice for research and monitoring purposes, particularly in relation to oncogenic addiction under TKI treatment. In the realm of ICI therapy, inflammation-related biomarkers show particular promise due to their association with a worse prognosis. Inflammation affects immune modulation within both tumor cells and their microenvironment, which ultimately influences disease-related outcomes.  Despite recent technical advancements, no soluble biomarkers have yet been approved and validated for the management of lung cancer patients. However, there is growing interest in identifying a soluble biomarker that could predict response to ICI treatment while overcoming limitations associated with tissue-based analyses.  Several serum-based biomarkers are currently being explored or investigated further. Apart from blood cell counts (neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets) that have shown potential prognostic value with regard to ICI efficacy; other promising serum-based biomarkers include soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).  In conclusion, this article highlights the significant burden of lung cancer globally and discusses approaches such as personalized medicine and immunotherapy that aim to improve patient outcomes. It also emphasizes the need for effective biomarkers capable of assisting clinicians in making treatment decisions regarding ICI therapy specifically. Ongoing exploration of serum-based markers holds promise but requires further validation before implementation into routine clinical practice.",explain

"This PubMed article introduces the topic of cellular immune responses to viral infections and the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in detecting and responding to viral genomic nucleic acids. The cGAS-STING pathway is a critical component of the innate immune system, which is responsible for the initial defense against invading pathogens.  The article explains that cells have pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize specific structures within invading microbes called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In the case of viral infections, viral genomic nucleic acids act as a prominent PAMP. When these nucleic acids are detected by PRRs, it triggers a series of events that lead to the production of type-I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines by infected cells.  Type-I IFNs then act on neighboring cells in both an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs serve as restriction factors in bystander cells, limiting pathogen replication and spread. Additionally, the cytokines produced play a crucial role in initiating adaptive immune responses.  The introduction highlights how cGAS has been a focal point within this field since its discovery in 2013. Unlike classical PRRs that detect structural differences between pathogens and host cells, cGAS detects double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) indiscriminately - whether it originated from the host or pathogen. It identifies dsDNA presence within the cytosol as a danger signal.  The article also mentions that exposure of ""self"" dsDNA due to cellular disruption can also be detected by cGAS, leading to inflammation even in sterile settings.  It goes on to explain several diseases where chronic activation of the cGAS-STING pathway leads to pathology or contributes towards autoimmune and inflammatory disorders such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), COPA syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarthritis, and Parkinson's disease.  The cGAS-STING pathway is of great therapeutic interest. Agonists are being sought after for use as vaccine adjuvants or in cancer immunotherapy, while antagonists could be developed for treating inflammatory or autoimmune diseases.  The introduction then delves into the mechanistic details of the cGAS-STING pathway. It explains how cGAS binding to dsDNA induces phase separation and generates a cyclic dinucleotide called cGAMP. This molecule acts as a second messenger and binds to STING, leading to further downstream signaling events that result in the production of type-I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines.  The article also highlights recent studies that challenged the classical model of PRR signaling. It describes how cGAMP can travel from one cell to another through several mechanisms such as direct cell-to-cell transfer through gap junctions or incorporation into viral particles that transmit it to neighboring cells.  Additionally, it mentions recent discoveries regarding membrane transport proteins that provide routes for extracellular entry of cGAMP into cells. These include SLC19A1, SLC46A2, P2X7, LRRC8A:C/E channels/transporters/pores and LL-37 antimicrobial defense peptide.  Finally, the article acknowledges that the study of intercellular transfer of cGAMP is a rapidly growing field with implications for understanding disease mechanisms and developing novel therapies. The authors aim to detail and discuss current knowledge on different mechanisms by which cGAMP is transferred between cells in order to identify potential targets for innovative therapies.  Overall, this introduction sets the stage by outlining key concepts related to viral immune responses mediated by the cGAS-STING pathway and highlights its relevance in various diseases. It provides background information on PRRs, discusses the role of cGAS as a cytosolic dsDNA sensor, and introduces recent findings on intercellular cGAMP transfer mechanisms.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that is a significant cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the importance of Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) in the electrical treatment of heart failure. Conventional CRT involves biventricular pacing to stimulate the left ventricle (LV) and has shown significant benefits in reducing hospitalizations and mortality for patients with symptomatic dyssynchronous heart failure.  The uptake of CRT has expanded in recent years, with studies showing benefits in patients with moderate LV dysfunction and those requiring atrioventricular node ablation. However, there is a significant proportion of patients who do not derive clinical benefit from conventional CRT or cannot be treated due to issues like LV lead implantation failure or inadequate performance.  Conduction system pacing (CSP), particularly His-Bundle pacing (HBP), has emerged as an alternative treatment option. HBP aims to restore completely physiological ventricular activation but comes with challenges like difficult implantation and long-term complications. Left Bundle Branch Pacing (LBBP) is a novel form of CSP that shows promising results from observational studies, though robust data from randomized trials is currently lacking.  Considering the high prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in heart failure patients receiving CRT, an important clinical concern is how AF affects outcomes for CSP. AF can attenuate the clinical benefit achieved with CRT due to factors such as reduced cardiac output, uncontrolled ventricular rates, and increased risk of inappropriate shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators.  Given the growing use of CSP in heart failure patients with AF, it becomes crucial to examine how AF impacts outcomes specifically for HBP and LBBP. The article focuses on two areas: evaluating the possible impact of AF on LBBP by adjusting atrioventricular delays (AVDs) to achieve fusion pacing and reviewing evidence on CSP use following AVNA for AF. It aims to address gaps in knowledge regarding CSP efficacy for patients with AF.  In summary, this introduction sets the stage for the article by providing an overview of CRT and its limitations, introducing CSP as an alternative treatment option, highlighting the importance of AF in heart failure patients, and outlining the specific focus and objectives of the study. In the subsequent sections of this article, the authors delve deeper into the impact of atrial fibrillation (AF) on conduction system pacing (CSP), particularly focusing on left bundle branch pacing (LBBP). They discuss various factors that may contribute to the challenges and outcomes of CSP in patients with AF.  One important consideration is the inability to achieve fusion pacing with intrinsic right ventricular conduction due to AF. In patients without AF, adjusting atrioventricular delays (AVDs) can help optimize ventricular dyssynchrony and improve outcomes. However, in the presence of AF, achieving fusion pacing becomes more challenging. The authors critically evaluate current evidence regarding LBBP and its ability to overcome these difficulties in patients with AF.  Additionally, they review studies that investigate CSP use following atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) for AF. AVNA is a treatment option for patients who do not respond well to pharmacological therapies or cannot tolerate them. The authors examine whether AVNA affects CSP outcomes and compare it with conventional CRT in terms of clinical benefits.  Throughout their discussion, the authors emphasize that while observational studies have shown encouraging results for LBBP in both patient groups – those with AF and those who have undergone AVNA – there is a lack of robust data from randomized trials. This creates uncertainty around the efficacy and long-term outcomes of CSP for individuals with heart failure complicated by AF.  The article concludes by highlighting the need for further research to address these critical issues surrounding CSP efficacy in patients with AF. Future studies should focus on randomized controlled trials comparing LBBP with conventional CRT, specifically assessing its impact on LV function improvement and clinical outcomes among individuals experiencing both heart failure and persistent or permanent AF.  In summary, this PubMed article provides an overview of CRT as a cornerstone treatment for heart failure before delving into the challenges faced when implementing CSP techniques such as LBBP in patients with atrial fibrillation. The authors critically analyze the available evidence and advocate for more research to establish the efficacy of CSP in patients with AF. This article aims to contribute to the current understanding of CSP's role in managing heart failure patients with AF and guide clinicians in making informed decisions regarding treatment options.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of the current state of knowledge on depression in children and adolescents. It begins by highlighting the extensive literature that has been accumulated over the past few decades, emphasizing the major epidemiological findings regarding the prevalence and burden of depression worldwide. The introduction also mentions that rates of depression increase significantly from childhood through late adolescence and continue into adulthood, with a disturbing trend showing increasing rates across generations.  The urgency to address this issue is underscored by public policy experts recommending annual screening for depression in individuals aged 12 and above. To gain a better understanding and intervention strategies for depression in youth, researchers have identified various risk and resilience factors that predict its development. Additionally, evidence-based treatments such as psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies have been found to be effective in relieving youth depression.  Despite this progress, it acknowledges the ongoing suffering experienced by young people globally due to depression. Global data shows an alarming rise in age-standardized prevalence rates of depression over time while anxiety rates decrease. Furthermore, even with numerous empirically supported treatments available today, there has been little sustained progress in reducing the burden associated with youth depression since the 1980s.  The purpose of this article is therefore stated as revisiting and critically examining what we currently understand about youth depression and its interventions. The authors emphasize reviewing how our academic notions align (or do not align) with the symptoms and features of this construct called ""depression."" They also stress expanding both prevention strategies aimed at reducing risks for future episodes as well as treatment efforts targeting existing cases.  In order to advance progress on youth depression, this paper aims to provide a new hope through multiple positions taken by the authors that they believe hold promise for improving scholarly understanding while significantly reducing distress associated with youth depressions worldwide. Their perspective centers around emphasizing fundamentals grounded in humility, history, philosophy; openness to explore new ideas rigorously; recognizing relationships across social-ecological systems; appropriate conceptualization, measurement, and classification of depression constructs; and collecting accurate, reliable, and practical evidence.  The article outlines its three main goals: providing an overview of current knowledge on depression among youth while emphasizing how the construct has been conceptualized and measured historically; reinvigorating academic progress to better define and explain what depression is in youth using a developmental psychopathology framework; and addressing immediate needs to reduce prevalence and distress associated with youth depression by proposing ways to respond to unmet needs in risk identification, intervention strategies, engaging stakeholders at all levels.  In summary, this introduction sets the context for the importance of understanding youth depression by highlighting its prevalence, burden across generations, lack of sustained progress in reduction efforts over time. It suggests a comprehensive approach encompassing both research advancements and practical interventions to address this significant issue. Continuing with the explanation of the article, the introduction states that the authors have three main goals. The first goal is to provide an overview of what is currently known about depression among youth. This overview is presented in Table 1, which enumerates various risk factors for youth depression across ecological levels, and Table 2, which summarizes evidence-based interventions for treating and preventing depression in young people. The information presented in these tables is grounded in how depression as a construct has been conceptualized and measured both historically and currently.  The second goal of the paper is to reinvigorate academic progress focused on defining and explicating conceptually what depression means among youth. The authors argue that necessary steps in the process of construct validation were minimally engaged when studying adult depression, resulting in an incomplete understanding when it comes to studying depression among young people. They emphasize the importance of content conceptualization and accurate measurement to improve our understanding of youth depression.  Finally, the third goal centers around addressing immediate needs to reduce both prevalence and distress associated with youth depression. The authors propose ways to respond to unmet needs by targeting at-risk populations while also considering their families and communities. They suggest enhancing interventions through multiple ecological systems and engaging various stakeholders.  To achieve these goals, the paper presents a plan for advancing progress on youth depressions by detailing directions that promise improvement not only in scholarly understanding but also practical outcomes related to reducing distress worldwide.  The introduction concludes by expressing a belief that meaningful progress can be made without overly focusing on unproven biological or technological solutions alone but instead adopting a comprehensive approach that considers multiple aspects such as fundamentals grounded in history, openness for exploration, recognition of relationships across social-ecological systems, appropriate conceptualization of constructs associated with youth depression, as well as gathering reliable evidence with scientific validity.  Overall, this introduction sets out clear objectives for the article: providing an overview of current knowledge about youth depressions while critically examining existing concepts and measures, reinvigorating academic progress to enhance our understanding of depression among young people, and proposing strategies to bridge the gap in prevalence and distress associated with youth depression. By establishing these goals, the article aims to make a significant contribution towards addressing the urgent need for effectively tackling youth depressions on both scholarly and practical levels.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by stating that Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as fruit flies, is a well-established model organism for studying developmental processes. The authors highlight the importance of studying autophagy, a cellular pathway responsible for degrading misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, in relation to genetic conditions called proteinopathies. These proteinopathies are a class of neuronal diseases found in humans.  The authors emphasize that autophagy and another cellular pathway called the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are closely linked and both play essential roles in maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. They point out how alterations in one pathway can impact the functioning of the other. Dysregulation or dysfunction in autophagy and UPS pathways have been associated with age-associated disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly those affecting neurons.  The review aims to illustrate how studies conducted using Drosophila models have contributed to our understanding of autophagy's role in proteinopathies caused by mutations in genes associated with common neurodegenerative diseases. Table 1 summarizes these diseases discussed later in the article along with their principal mechanisms and modifiers (components of pathways that can either suppress or enhance toxic phenotypes).  Throughout the introduction, various references are cited to support specific points made by the authors:  - The length of CAG repeats is linked to progressive motor decline and neuron death. - Aggregate formation kinetics are mentioned as being important. - The role of Huntingtin (a protein involved in Huntington's disease) in autophagy is referenced. - The formation and increase in size of polyQ oligomers related to Rnq1 amyloid-like prion conformation is noted. - Endogenous dhtt is mentioned with respect to its relevance. - TOR inhibition is highlighted as an area of interest. - Chaperones play a crucial role related to polyQ-containing proteins. - Histone deacetylases, the antioxidant pathway, and deubiquitinating enzymes are cited as factors of significance. - Glutamine metabolism and the role of Rab5 and PSA are highlighted. - The use of compounds that target mutant Huntingtin to autophagosomes is mentioned. - Retinal degeneration, loss of interneuron projections, reduced dendritic neuron arborization, and the role of chaperones in relation to polyQ-containing proteins are discussed in the context of specific diseases or conditions mentioned earlier. - References are made to various genes and proteins associated with different proteinopathies (Ataxin1/2/3, C9orf72, SOD1/FUS/TDP43/Amyloid beta/TAU/Parkin/PINK). - Moreover, perturbations related to TOR signaling-related genes expression and cell-cycle-related gene expression are stated.  In summary, this introduction provides an overview of the importance of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for studying autophagy in proteinopathies. It introduces key concepts related to autophagy and its relationship with other cellular pathways while mentioning specific genetic conditions associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The introduction lays out the objectives for reviewing Drosophila studies on autophagy's role in these diseases and highlights specific areas that will be explored further in subsequent sections. Continuing from the previous explanation, the article dives into specific proteinopathies and their association with autophagy using Drosophila models. The authors discuss the role of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and prion diseases.  For each proteinopathy discussed, the authors provide insights into the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis. They highlight findings related to specific genes, molecular processes, and cellular pathways involved. For instance, they mention how mutant Huntingtin leads to aggregate formation and increased toxicity in HD. In SCA3, Ataxin3 aggregation is enhanced by Atx1, while Ataxin2 is involved in translational control. ALS-related FUS mutations trigger toxic aggregate accumulation that inhibits autophagy.  The article also delves into different modifiers or components within autophagy pathways that can either suppress or enhance these toxic phenotypes. This includes mentioning various factors like deubiquitinating enzymes for SCA3, antioxidant drugs for ALS-related disorders, and histone deacetylases for AD.  The authors discuss findings related to mitochondrial impairments seen in diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). They highlight studies showing how dysfunctional mitophagy contributes to these conditions by disrupting the removal of damaged mitochondria.  Additionally, the review discusses molecular processes associated with neurodegenerative diseases like AD and tauopathies where aberrant autophagy plays a crucial role in facilitating pathological Tau aggregation.  Throughout these discussions on various proteinopathies, references are made to studies using Drosophila models that have contributed valuable insights into understanding disease mechanisms. The authors outline how specific genetic manipulations, treatments, or interventions in Drosophila have shed light on the role of autophagy in these conditions. They highlight important findings such as the relevance of certain genes or pathways, efficacy of potential therapeutic compounds, and the impact of different mutations.  In summary, this PubMed article focuses on summarizing and discussing how Drosophila models have contributed to our understanding of autophagy's involvement in various neurodegenerative diseases. It highlights specific proteinopathies and explores the mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis while emphasizing the importance of autophagy-related processes. By referencing numerous studies conducted using Drosophila models, this review provides a comprehensive overview of how these research findings can further enhance our understanding of human neurodegenerative diseases and potentially lead to new therapeutic strategies.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article discusses the importance of monitoring biodiversity conservation and changes in the natural environment and ecosystems on a large scale. Monitoring efforts often focus on indicator species or groups, such as birds. Sound recordings are commonly used for bird monitoring due to their ability to identify species even when they cannot be easily seen in the field.  Citizen science, which involves public participation in scientific research, is a valuable approach for obtaining data over long periods and large spatial scales. This approach can also be applied to analyzing sound recordings of birds. Training participants to improve their identification skills is crucial for increasing the quantity and quality of data collected through citizen science projects and enhancing participants' interest in the natural environment.  Advancements have been made in developing automated birdsong recognition systems, but a library of sounds annotated by citizens would contribute significantly to improving the accuracy of automated birdsong recognition. The use of online training has been increasing in citizen science projects, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online training offers advantages such as low costs and easy accessibility.  However, little research has examined the effectiveness of online training for species identification in citizen science projects. Quiz-style training has been found to be more efficient than simple memorization because it takes advantage of the testing effect, where recalling information strengthens memory more effectively than other methods like writing or listening alone.  Existing quiz-based online training tools require participants to listen repeatedly or randomly to full-length sound sources regardless of their proficiency levels or involve customization by selecting specific sets of songs themselves. Therefore, more efficient and user-friendly quiz-based training approaches are needed.  Adaptive learning is an approach that tailors learning content, feedback, and interfaces specifically for individual users. It can personalize learning effectively using automatic mechanisms. The effectiveness of adaptive learning has been evaluated across various fields recently.  Memory mechanisms play a crucial role in adaptive learning approaches, which have been extensively studied since Ebbinghaus proposed his forgetting curve hypotheses in 1885. The forgetting curve explains that memory rapidly increases after initial learning but exponentially decreases unless repetition learning or spaced learning is implemented. Meta-analyses have shown that setting appropriate intervals for repetition and spaced learning improves learning effectiveness. The recency effect suggests that people tend to recall items from the end of a list more easily.  Applying these memory mechanisms to a quiz-style online training tool can enhance its effectiveness by controlling the order of bird species presented in the quiz. However, quantitative optimization of factors such as the number of quiz training questions, time from quiz to test, and interval between questions requires further investigation.  In this study, the researchers developed a new online training tool called TORI-TORE, which consists of multiple-choice quizzes aimed at improving bird identification skills from recorded bird songs and fostering citizen scientists skilled in birdsong identification. The objectives of this study were to compare species identification skills and attitudes toward birds before and after training, compare results between adaptive training (inspired by adaptive learning) and baseline training using a randomized controlled trial, and test predictions based on forgetting curve hypotheses regarding the optimal number of quiz questions, time lag between training and testing, and question intervals.  Overall, this research aims to understand how theories about memory mechanisms relate to online training effectiveness for bird song identification. This understanding can guide the development of effective online tools for improving species identification skills in citizen science projects focused on birdsong recognition while also fostering interest in birds and natural environments.",explain
"In this introduction, the authors discuss the concept of cyborg and bionic systems (CBS), which involves integrating organic and biomechatronic components to restore lost function or normalize disease symptoms. They provide examples of CBS techniques, such as brain-computer interfaces or deep brain stimulation (DBS).  The authors emphasize the importance of targeting reliable biomarkers for the development of useful CBS. They explain that electrophysiological systems like the brain or heart generate oscillatory activity across a range of frequencies, and outputs such as movement or cognitive processes result from complex integration of oscillatory neural population activity.  To access this activity, researchers can use invasive approaches like local field potential recordings or non-invasive measures like electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography.  The authors highlight that multiple neural oscillations at different scales are involved in neural information processing. Low-frequency oscillations are believed to control long-range synchronization, while high-frequency oscillations are linked to local computation.  They mention that understanding how these neural oscillations contribute to top-down neural transmission is an area of great interest. Researchers have found that various tasks modulate oscillatory activities in different frequencies, and brain stimulation techniques can impact task performance by altering these activities.  The authors point out that neurophysiological oscillations may serve as biomarkers for pathophysiological states like Parkinson's disease. They introduce cross-frequency coupling (CFC), which characterizes interactions between different frequency rhythms and is modulated during both physiological processing and pathological states.  CFC refers to statistical associations between phase, amplitude, or frequency of two rhythms. The authors explain that CFC applied on simultaneous recordings from different cortical areas reveals coordinated information exchange in cognitive, sensory, and motor events.  Four commonly studied types of CFC are discussed: phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC), phase-frequency coupling, and phase-phase coupling. PAC and AAC have attracted much attention for their association with physiological processing and pathological states.  The authors provide a simulation of PAC and AAC to illustrate how the activity at one frequency can be modulated by the phase or amplitude of another frequency, forming nested structures.  In this review, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in CFC research, with a focus on methodologies, neural mechanisms, and potential applications in CBS. They plan to discuss methodological advances in CFC, studies on CFC in cognitive processes and neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease), as well as potential neuromodulation techniques for clinical interventions.  Finally, the review will address challenges and opportunities for integrating CFC technology into CBS and highlight future trends in this field. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, the authors state that they will begin by providing a definition of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and summarizing the current state of knowledge regarding its methodological advances.  They plan to discuss the latest studies on CFC in cognitive processes and various neurological disorders, including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease. This will include an exploration of potential neuromodulation techniques for clinical interventions.  The authors also highlight that they will address the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating CFC technology into cyborg and bionic systems (CBS). They aim to shed light on future trends in this field.  By focusing on methodologies, neural mechanisms, and potential applications in CBS clinical interventions, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of CFC research.  Understanding CFC is crucial as it allows researchers to explore how different neural oscillations interact within the brain. This understanding can help develop advanced strategies for restoring lost functions or treating diseases through CBS techniques.  By studying various cognitive processes like memory formation or decision-making alongside neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or epilepsy, researchers can uncover valuable insights into how these conditions impact CFC patterns. This knowledge can then be used to develop targeted therapeutic interventions using neuromodulation techniques like deep brain stimulation (DBS).  However, while there are clear opportunities for integrating CFC technology into CBS approaches, there are also challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges include issues related to data analysis methods, signal processing techniques and standardization across studies, as well as ethical considerations surrounding invasive procedures or long-term implantation of devices.  The review aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive analysis of methodological advancements in CFC research. It also aims to identify potential future trends in this field with regards to improving CBS technologies for clinical interventions.  Overall, this PubMed article aims to contribute significantly towards advancing our understanding of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and its potential applications in cyborg and bionic systems. By focusing on methodologies, neural mechanisms, and clinical interventions, this comprehensive review seeks to provide valuable insights into the integration of CFC technology into CBS approaches and pave the way for future advancements.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article highlights the significance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a global security threat. It states that AMR is driven by the inappropriate use of antimicrobials, particularly antibiotics, in humans, animals, and veterinary medicine. The inappropriate use of antibiotics not only has adverse clinical effects on patients but also has economic impacts such as increased healthcare costs.  The article emphasizes that AMR is considered one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development. It mentions that globally, AMR accounts for an estimated 700,000 deaths per year. If not curbed, it could result in about 10 million deaths per year globally by 2050.  Furthermore, the introduction discusses the devastating economic impacts of AMR. It suggests that if left unchecked until 2050, AMR could lead to a reduction in global Gross Domestic Product and result in a loss of trillions of US dollars in economic output. The increased morbidity and mortality caused by rising rates of AMR may also push millions into extreme poverty due to high costs of treatment and chronic infections.  The impact on animal husbandry is also highlighted as it could affect farmers' livelihoods and threaten food security. Additionally, market failures due to low return on investment and disinclination to invest in research and development for new antimicrobial agents are mentioned. The shift towards developing drugs for non-communicable diseases instead of new antibiotics by multinational pharmaceutical companies is described.  Importantly, access issues are mentioned throughout the introduction with specific focus on citizens from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Both old and new antibiotics may be inaccessible or unaffordable for these populations due to factors like poverty or weak antibiotic supply chain management systems.  The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on inappropriate antibiotic use is raised as well. The lack of definite treatment protocols during the pandemic led to irrational prescription and use of antibiotics for COVID-19 patients, which could contribute to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria.  Lastly, the introduction acknowledges the multifaceted nature of inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the specific drivers in these countries. The overall focus of this review is to discuss these drivers in order to inform policy formulation and other efforts to curb inappropriate antibiotic use and address AMR in LMICs.  In summary, this introduction establishes that AMR is a global security threat driven by the inappropriate use of antimicrobials, particularly antibiotics. It emphasizes its adverse clinical and economic effects on patients while underscoring its impact on global health, food security, development, and economic output. Additionally, it highlights specific issues surrounding access to antibiotics for citizens in LMICs and addresses the context-specific drivers within these countries. Continuing with the explanation of the article, the introduction also highlights that AMR in LMICs is exacerbated by weak or non-existent regulatory frameworks. These countries face challenges in implementing effective regulations to control and monitor antibiotic use in both human healthcare and agriculture.  The COVID-19 pandemic further compounds the problem of inappropriate antibiotic use. The lack of clear treatment protocols for COVID-19 patients resulted in irrational prescription and use of antibiotics. This can contribute to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria not only among COVID-19 patients but also within communities and healthcare settings.  Recognizing that inappropriate antibiotic use is a global issue, the article acknowledges that addressing it requires consideration of political and socio-cultural peculiarities specific to LMICs. In order to effectively combat this problem, policy formulation must be informed by a precise understanding of the drivers behind inappropriate antibiotic use within these countries.  The focus of this review is then clearly stated as discussing the drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs. By examining these drivers, policymakers can gain insights into why antimicrobials are being utilized inappropriately and develop targeted strategies to address this issue.  Overall, this introduction sets up an important context for understanding the significance and impact of antimicrobial resistance as a global threat. It highlights key issues surrounding inappropriate antibiotic usage, including its clinical effects on patients, economic implications at individual and societal levels, threats to food security and development, market failures related to research investments, access challenges for LMIC citizens regarding both existing and new antibiotics, regulatory weaknesses exacerbating AMR issues in agriculture, implications stemming from irrational antibiotic usage during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as specific considerations required for formulating effective policies tailored towards curbing inappropriate antibiotic usage within LMICs.

"This introduction to the PubMed article highlights the importance of promoting fruit and vegetable (FV) intake in children for proper brain and body development, as well as establishing healthy dietary habits throughout their lives. Despite explicit guidelines and evidence emphasizing the significance of FV intake, average consumption among US children remains low. Only 40% meet the recommended intake for fruits, and just 7% meet the recommended intake for vegetables.  The article emphasizes that preschool age (2-5 years old) is an optimal time for a dietary intervention to promote FV intake throughout a child's lifespan. However, there are key gaps and inconsistencies in diet research that need to be addressed.  One important consideration in diet research involving young children is measuring their food intake accurately. Young children are unable to reliably report their own food consumption, making parent-reported measures subjective and prone to bias. Objective observation measures are advocated for this age group. Additionally, skin carotenoid levels can be used as an objective measure specific to FV intake since carotenoids from consumed FVs are absorbed by various tissues, including the skin.  The setting of dietary interventions also plays a significant role. With nearly two-thirds of preschool-aged children enrolled in childcare or preschool settings in the US, these institutions have a substantial influence on their development. Therefore, evaluating intervention effectiveness should consider different settings rather than extrapolating findings from one context to another.  The introduction also highlights behavior change techniques (BCTs) as essential components within interventions aimed at changing dietary behaviors. Examining BCTs helps assess how interventions may effectively cause behavior change related to diet by identifying active intervention ingredients.  Theory-driven interventions provide another important metric for evaluating behavior change interventions targeting diet-related behaviors. Understanding how specific theories and concepts are utilized within intervention techniques helps tailor components effectively and refine them based on theory principles.  To address existing gaps in research regarding FV interventions specifically conducted within childcare or preschool-based settings using theoretical frameworks and BCTs, the article cites a recent systematic literature review by Hodder et al. and a study by Hendrie et al. However, these reviews have limitations, such as including subjective measures of dietary change and not focusing specifically on FV interventions in childcare or preschool settings.  Therefore, the urgency for this article stems from a critical gap in the literature regarding the effectiveness of FV interventions within childcare or preschool-based settings in the US and their utilization of theoretical frameworks and BCTs. By evaluating different types of interventions and exploring the use of theory and BCTs within them, this research aims to contribute to filling these gaps and provide valuable insights for improving dietary behaviors related to FV intake in young children. The main objective of this PubMed article is to evaluate the effectiveness of fruit and vegetable interventions specifically within childcare or preschool-based settings in the US. Additionally, it aims to assess the use of theoretical frameworks and behavior change techniques (BCTs) within these interventions. By conducting this evaluation, the authors hope to provide insights into which intervention strategies are most effective in promoting fruit and vegetable intake among young children.  To date, no published reviews have comprehensively examined both the effectiveness of FV interventions in US childcare or preschool settings and their utilization of theoretical frameworks and BCTs. This represents a significant gap in current knowledge, as understanding which intervention strategies are most successful can inform the development of evidence-based programs that have a higher likelihood of achieving positive dietary behavior change.  The article refers to previous systematic literature reviews conducted by Hodder et al. (year) on FV intake in children aged five years and younger. While these reviews offer valuable information on a variety of interventions globally, they do not distinguish between subjective and objective measurements of food intake nor evaluate the use of theoretical frameworks or BCTs within those studies.  By undertaking this study specific to US childcare or preschool settings, researchers aim to address these gaps while focusing on an age group where autonomy over food choices begins to develop. This period provides a unique opportunity for targeted interventions that may improve FV intake throughout a child's life.  In addition to evaluating intervention effectiveness, it is important for researchers to consider measurement techniques when assessing dietary changes in young children. Precisely measuring FV intake can be challenging due to various factors such as recall bias or parents reporting for periods they are not directly responsible for child feeding during childcare hours. Therefore, employing objective measures such as skin carotenoid levels can help overcome limitations associated with subjective parent-reported measures.  Furthermore, considering different aspects related to behavior change within dietary interventions is essential for understanding their underlying mechanisms. The article highlights that evaluating BCTs and the use of theoretical frameworks provide insights into how interventions effectively promote behavior change. By examining the active ingredients and intervention components within behavior change interventions, it becomes possible to identify which strategies may be most successful in altering dietary behaviors related to fruit and vegetable intake.  It is worth noting that a previous systematic review by Hendrie et al. (year) explored the use of BCTs in home- and school-based interventions for childhood obesity prevention involving children and parents. While this review established a correlation between the number of BCTs used and intervention effectiveness, it did not specifically focus on interventions targeting fruit and vegetable intake. Therefore, whether these findings are applicable to FV-specific interventions remains unknown.  Additionally, Hendrie et al.'s study evaluated interventions aimed at improving vegetable intake in children but was limited to home or community settings. Since childcare centers have a substantial influence on children's development due to high enrollment rates, it is crucial to determine if results from studies conducted in other settings can be extrapolated to childcare or preschool-based settings.  Overall, this PubMed article fills an important research gap by evaluating the effectiveness of fruit and vegetable interventions in US childcare or preschool-based settings while considering measurement techniques, BCT utilization, and theoretical framework application within these interventions. By synthesizing existing evidence more comprehensively, this study aims to guide future research efforts towards developing effective strategies that improve fruit and vegetable intake among young children for long-term health benefits.",explain
"This introduction begins by providing background information on pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs), which are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise from chromaffin cells and often secrete catecholamines. It explains that PCCs originate from the adrenal medulla, while PGLs develop from extra-adrenal sympathetic or parasympathetic ganglia.  The article highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with PCCs and PGLs. It states that these tumors can go undiagnosed during a person's life and are typically discovered in only a small percentage of autopsies. Furthermore, the introduction notes that PCCs are frequently detected incidentally, meaning they are found by chance when patients undergo imaging tests for other reasons. The article updates previous epidemiological data to state that all PCCs/PGLs are now considered potentially metastatic, suggesting an increased likelihood of spread to other parts of the body. As a result, all patients should be advised for genetic counseling due to the significant genetic component associated with these tumors.  The next section provides an overview of the diagnostic methods used for detecting and evaluating PCC/PGL. It mentions urinary metanephrines as a means of diagnosis, as well as the use of CT scanning and functional imaging techniques like positron emission tomography (PET)/CT with various radiotracers and 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy. These imaging techniques aid in identifying potential metastatic disease and determining appropriate treatment options.  Surgical intervention is highlighted as the primary treatment approach for most cases of PCC/PGL after careful consideration by a multidisciplinary team. However, it acknowledges that therapy with 131I-MIBG may also be a reasonable option for unfit cases if 123I-MIBG scintigraphy yields positive results. For metastatic PCCs/PGLs, the article discusses the use of conventional chemotherapy regimens as well as newer agents like tyrosine kinase inhibitors, somatostatin analogs, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), DNA-alkylating agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors.  The focus of this study is then narrowed down to the inhibition of histone deacetylation via HDACis. The introduction explains how alterations in histone acetylation levels can epigenetically affect gene expression related to tumor suppression and cancer progression. It mentions that there are 18 human HDACs divided into two families based on their co-factors and various classes located in different cellular compartments.  The introduction elaborates on the potential anti-cancer effects of HDACis by increasing acetylation levels in both histone and non-histone proteins. This leads to cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation, induction of cell death/apoptosis through mechanisms like oxidative stress generation, disruption of mitosis and autophagy while blocking angiogenesis.  The article also provides relevant tables summarizing key information such as classification of human HDACs by cellular localization and tissue expression, clinical testing status and indications for various HDACis currently under investigation for PCC/PGL treatment.  Finally, it states that this review aims to summarize previous research on currently tested HDACis for treating metastatic/unresectable PCCs/PGLs from in vitro studies up to clinical trials. It also mentions important clinical trials investigating the use of these agents specifically for PCCs/PGLs as well as other neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, it should be noted that PCCs and PGLs are rare tumors, making research and clinical trials on treatment options limited. Therefore, this article seeks to gather all available evidence from in vitro studies, animal models, and clinical trials to provide a comprehensive overview of HDACis in the management of metastatic/unresectable cases of PCCs/PGLs.  To support this objective, the article highlights key clinical trials investigating the use of HDACis specifically for PCCs/PGLs and NETs. The authors likely aim to assess the efficacy and safety profiles of these agents as well as any potential benefits in terms of disease control or overall survival rates. By capturing data from various stages of research - from laboratory experiments to human trials - they hope to ascertain whether HDACis could be implemented into routine oncological practice for these particular tumors.  The introduction also provides information on different types of cancers where HDACis show promise as potential therapeutic options. These include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-small cell lung carcinoma(NCSLC).  To further clarify how HDACis exert their anti-cancer effects, Figure 1 is included in the introduction section. This figure illustrates multiple mechanisms through which HDACis can influence cellular pathways involved in cell growth regulation, cell death induction, angiogenesis inhibition, and other processes crucial for cancer progression.  Additionally, significant attention is given to discussing different classes and specific compounds referred to as HDAC inhibitors. It is mentioned that HDACis can be either natural or synthetic compounds. Some HDACis selectively target specific classes of HDAC enzymes, while others are considered pan-HDAC inhibitors.  Lastly, the introduction highlights the importance of considering patient-specific factors and administration doses when evaluating the antitumor activity of HDACis. Each patient's tumor type and stage, as well as other individual characteristics, may influence the effectiveness and tolerability of these drugs. Therefore, it is crucial to combine scientific evidence with clinical expertise for optimal treatment decision-making in PCCs/PGLs.  In conclusion, this introduction provides a detailed background on PCCs/PGLs and their diagnostic challenges. It focuses on the potential role of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) in managing metastatic/unresectable cases. The article aims to consolidate existing evidence from laboratory studies and clinical trials to evaluate whether introducing HDACis into oncological practice could benefit patients with these rare neuroendocrine tumors.",explain
"This PubMed article begins by providing an overview of coronaviruses, highlighting specific strains such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), and coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19). It mentions that there have been several outbreaks of coronaviruses in the past two decades, citing the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the MERS outbreak since 2012.  The article then discusses the current status of COVID-19, stating that as per a report from the World Health Organization (WHO) until June 18, 2021, there have been approximately 177 million confirmed cases and more than 3.8 million deaths worldwide. It highlights the need for protective measures or treatment strategies to address this global health crisis.  The focus of this article is on exploring contradictory reports regarding the effect of smoking on COVID-19 infections. The author suggests that if smokers are found to be protected from COVID-19, further studies could be conducted to understand this protective mechanism. Conversely, if smokers are at higher risk, it would draw attention to implementing separate policies to protect them.  The introduction goes on to discuss smoking as a well-established risk factor for various diseases such as different types of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and diabetes. It cites statistics from the World Health Organization estimating that by 2025 there will be around 1.1 billion smokers worldwide and that smoking-related deaths account for an economic cost of approximately US$1.4 trillion annually.  The author then presents evidence suggesting a potential association between smoking and worse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Studies have shown that current and former smokers had higher percentages among ICU patients, required more mechanical ventilation support, experienced higher mortality rates, had more severe cases compared to non-smokers.  Additionally, smoking history has been linked to exacerbations of COVID-19, greater severity of infections and complications such as pulmonary fibrosis. The case fatality rate for smokers who are hospitalized with COVID-19 is reported to be higher, resembling the pattern observed in MERS patients.  The article then discusses the molecular mechanisms that could contribute to smokers' susceptibility to COVID-19. It mentions that cigarette smoke has been found to upregulate the expression of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) in lung cells, which serves as a receptor for the virus. Furthermore, exposure to cigarette smoke has been shown to increase the expression of Cathepsin B, a protease that activates the spike protein of the virus.  However, there are contradictory findings regarding smoking and its effects on ACE2 expression. While some studies indicate up-regulation, others report down-regulation or a lack of significant effects.  The introduction also highlights conflicting epidemiological studies on smoking and COVID-19 infection rates. Some studies from China, Italy, Europe, and the United States have reported lower incidence among infected smokers. However, other studies from Kuwait, England, and other parts of the United States suggest adverse effects of smoking on COVID-19 outcomes.  Considering these conflicting reports and their potential implications for public health interventions related to smoking during the pandemic,the author explains their aim is to thoroughly investigate this issue by conducting a systematic review using PubMed databases with specific search terms related to smoke and nicotine in relation with COVID-19.  In conclusion,the introduction sets up an understanding about coronaviruses generally mentioning previous outbreaks like SARS,MERS.Correspondingly,it addresses morbidity caused by these viral diseases influencing mortalities due Covid 19 since their clinical characteristics seems overlapping. Additionally,this part also draws attention towards contradictory relationship between  smoking,current epidemic covid 19 instances,epidemiological data explored making claims based upon specific meta-analysis,but states that limitations of respective studies need to be considered which include heterogeneity of COPD disease and shortages available related to covid 19 in general.  The remaining part predominantly highlights various reasons as how smoking may lead an individual susceptible or protective against Covid cov 2 causing morbidity through nearly mentioning molecular mechanisms how cigarette smoke affects expression ACE receptor type two and cathepsin B but cautions that contrary results regarding up regulation or down regulation highlight different interpretations.Since Smoking history has been established with higher morbidity during other respiratory conditions like SARS,MERS-Author then gives the motive for carrying out study and goals of Study.  Finally,It elaborates on studies reviewed, different meta-analysis papers included where it describes the overall number & nature of related cases expressed by author based upon given data published till date.

"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a prevalent and significant health issue worldwide, affecting males in both developed and developing countries. In fact, it ranks among the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men and is a leading cause of cancer-related death [REF]. Traditional treatment options for localized prostate cancer include surgery and radiotherapy, but for advanced cases, additional therapies such as brachytherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are commonly used [REF].  The primary objective of ADT is to lower the levels of circulating androgens (male sex hormones) in order to block their signaling. Androgens play a crucial role in the growth of cancer cells, thus reducing their availability can slow down disease progression [REF]. ADT has proven to be an effective approach by causing a decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels - an indicator of prostate cancer activity - as well as tumor size. As a result, it offers temporary relief for patients. However, it should be noted that ADT can also lead to side effects such as hot flashes and sexual dysfunction [REF].  The response to ADT can be observed over three phases: early, developing, and late stages [Fig. 1]. The early phase is characterized by decreased PSA levels, tumor regression, and improved quality of life for patients. In contrast, the late phase is associated with castration resistance - when tumors stop responding effectively to hormonal therapy - relapse occurs with highly metastatic aggressive tendencies[REF]. During the intermediate ""developing"" stage between these two phases,cancer cells undergo homeostatic responses which dynamically alter various cellular signaling mechanisms that eventually lead towards castration resistance(Fig 1). These responses include the revival or reactivation of alternate mechanisms related toandrogen receptor(AR)signaling activation.The specific mechanisms involved are,intra-tumor de novo productionofandrogen,multicopy amplification ARgene occurring withintumors,mutations in the ligand-binding domain of AR (AR-LBD),expressionof specific constitutively active isoforms of AR,overexpression of AR co-regulators,and androgen-independent activation of AR [REF]. These events contribute to a more aggressive form of the disease called castration-resistant prostate cancer(CRPC), typically occurring24-36 months after ADT initiation[REF]. In this stage,metastatic spreading is observedin most patients, and their average life expectancy becomes limited to 18-24 months thereafter [REF].  Another crucial mechanism that occurs in advanced PCa is epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT disrupts cell adhesion while promoting cellular migration and invasion. Although there is no unanimous agreement regarding the influence of androgen signaling on EMT regulation during ADT,research has demonstrated a link between the two. Initial studies suggest that ADT may induce EMT in advanced prostate cancer through a process known as ""cadherin switching"" [REF]. Cadherins are proteins involved in maintaining cell adhesion within tissues. Decreased expression of one type called E-cadherin (encoded by Cdh1) combined with increased expression of another type called N-cadherin (encoded by Cdh2) leads to cadherin switching [REF]. Disrupted tissue structures due to reduced Cdh1expressionresult in cells detaching from each other,resulting in free movement[REF]. Correspondingly,cadherin switching as observed during tumor progression playsavital role intumorcell migrationandinvasiveness—a characteristic featureofadvanced cancers[REF]. N-cadherinfacilitates enhanced migratory and invasive abilities for tumor cells, which contrasts withthe inhibitory role playedbyE-cadherin[REF].  In light of these findings, our study aims to review existing literature regarding the molecular perspective on how ADT influences cadherin switching in advanced prostate cancer. By unraveling these mechanisms, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the interaction between androgen deprivation therapy and cadherin switching, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective targeted therapies for advanced prostate cancer.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of the use of therapies that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as anti-VEGFs, in treating ocular diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular edema (DMO), and others. These therapies are administered through intraocular injections and have been shown to improve visual outcomes in a significant percentage of patients. However, treatment regimens can vary between patients, with some requiring continuous or indefinite treatment.  The introduction highlights the importance of patient adherence to these treatment regimens and the challenges associated with it. Previous studies have identified various reasons why patients may not adhere to their prescribed therapy, including difficulty attending appointments, financial limitations, pain, disbelief in the benefit of treatment, and refusal to continue treatment due to other medical conditions.  The World Health Organization defines adherence as a person's behavior corresponding with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider. Non-adherence refers to deviating from the prescribed therapeutic regimen, while persistence refers to the duration of continuation with therapy.  Patient non-adherence or non-persistence can occur at different points during therapy. Previous studies have reported rates of therapy discontinuation ranging from approximately 42% to 50% for diseases such as nAMD. Factors such as patient awareness about their disease and its treatment can influence compliance.  The COVID-19 pandemic has posed additional challenges for patient adherence due to restrictions on travel and reduced access to non-urgent care. Despite expert consensus advising continuation of anti-VEGF injection regimens during lockdowns or reduced services for certain eye conditions, fear of infection and logistical difficulties have likely impacted attendance at appointments.  This article aims to fill a gap in research by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis on patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence patterns in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy across different disease states. It seeks not only to determine prevalence but also identify barriers/reasons associated with non-adherence/non-persistence. By addressing these challenges, the ultimate goal is to optimize treatment outcomes and reduce the burden of chronic eye diseases for both patients and healthcare providers.  In conclusion, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the use of anti-VEGF therapies in ocular diseases, the importance of patient adherence to treatment regimens, challenges faced in achieving adherence, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient-led adherence. It sets the stage for further investigation into determining the prevalence of non-adherence/non-persistence, understanding reasons/barriers behind it, and developing strategies to improve treatment outcomes. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, the introduction highlights the need for further investigation in this field. Systematic reviews conducted previously have focused on patient non-adherence and non-persistence to anti-VEGF treatment regimens specifically in nAMD and DMO. These reviews have emphasized a lack of research and called for more studies in this understudied area.  The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to address these research gaps by investigating not only the prevalence of patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy but also identifying the barriers and reasons associated with non-adherence/non-persistence in different disease states.  By understanding both the scale of non-adherence/non-persistence and the factors contributing to it, researchers aim to develop strategies that can tackle these challenges. The ultimate goal is to improve treatment adherence, optimize clinical outcomes, and reduce vision loss associated with ""sight-threatening"" chronic eye diseases such as nAMD, DMO, retinal vein occlusion, and myopic choroidal neovascularization.  The impact of patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence goes beyond individual patients. It also has implications for healthcare providers who are responsible for managing these chronic eye diseases. Identifying strategies that effectively address barriers to adherence can lead to improved healthcare delivery and more successful management of patients' conditions.  Given that previous studies have reported high rates of discontinuation or deviations from prescribed therapy regimens in diseases such as nAMD (approximately 42% to 50%), it is critical to investigate why patients may discontinue treatment or fail to adhere as recommended. Understanding specific reasons for non-adherence/non-persistence will enable researchers and clinicians alike to develop targeted interventions tailored towards addressing these underlying factors.  Furthermore, while recent events like the COVID-19 pandemic pose new challenges for maintaining adherence due to fear, travel restrictions, logistical difficulties under lockdown measures impacting attendance at appointments; quantifying levels of non-adherence/non-persistence during such times will provide valuable insights for future practices. It can inform the development of strategies to minimize disruption to essential ophthalmic care and ensure that patients receive the necessary treatment despite challenging circumstances.  In summary, this introduction paves the way for a systematic review and meta-analysis study that aims to examine patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence patterns in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, understand associated barriers/reasons in different disease states, and ultimately reduce the burden of chronic eye diseases. By shedding light on prevalence rates and factors contributing to non-adherence/non-persistence, this research has the potential to improve treatment outcomes, enhance patient adherence to therapy regimens, and optimize healthcare delivery for individuals with ocular diseases who may benefit from anti-VEGF treatments.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of the prevalence and impact of anxiety disorder and anxiety, highlighting the need for effective and affordable treatment options. It begins by explaining that anxiety disorder is a common mental illness characterized by persistent fear or anxiety lasting at least six months, along with related behavioral disturbances. Previously, accurately counting the incidence of anxiety disorder was challenging until clear diagnostic criteria were established.  The introduction then presents demographic data from the UK, which shows that 3% of the population was eligible for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. However, only 8% of those identified ultimately received a diagnosis and relevant treatment. Young people are particularly affected, with 15-20% experiencing anxiety disorders.  While anxiety is a more widespread form of human mental illness characterized by emotions such as dread and apprehension, it is not as disabling as full-blown anxiety disorders. Anxiety can be adaptive as it serves as a response to danger or potential threats in the environment.  The introduction also highlights the connection between major depression and symptoms of comorbid anxiety in about 85% of patients. Both anxiety disorders and generalized anxiety can have significant negative consequences.  Current treatment strategies for anxiety primarily rely on drug interventions with various drugs available in clinical practice. However, there are variations in efficacy and tolerance among different individuals, leading to personalized drug regimens. The high cost of medication poses financial challenges for many patients.  Clinical medicine aims to relieve symptoms rather than completely cure the condition when treating anxiety disorders; typically achieving a 50% improvement on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) or enabling normal functionality after stopping medication serves as endpoints for judge therapeutic success.However these medications may only treat symptoms temporarily; long-term chronic anxiey often persists after discontinuation/adjusment [REF]. The lifetime prevalence rate worldwide for generalized anxiey disorder is estimated to be approximately 3.7%, underscoring the urgency to find an inexpensive yet effective option [REF].  The introduction then highlights the potential advantages of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in treating psychiatric disorders such as anxiety. Specifically, Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS), a TCM preparation, has been in use for centuries. JWXYS consists of 10 Chinese herbal medicines and is known for its mood-regulating properties. It has various forms and names across different regions.  Though JWXYS is not a standardized prescription preparation, it is often customized by TCM practitioners based on each patient's symptoms and overall condition following the principles of syndrome differentiation and treatment.  This review aims to summarize existing research on JWXYS in treating anxiety disorder and anxiety, providing a deeper understanding of its therapeutic effects. The subsequent articles will focus on specific studies that apply the concept of syndrome differentiation and explore other herbal medicines used in conjunction with the ten main herbs found in JWXYS.  In conclusion, this introduction sets the stage by emphasizing the prevalence and impact of anxiety disorders and generalized anxiey while highlighting ongoing challenges with current drug-based treatments. It suggests that TCM may offer an alternative approach with promising potential benefits for patients suffering from these conditions.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a neurological disorder characterized by acute flaccid paralysis. It states that GBS is an immune-mediated neuropathy and the most common cause of paralysis worldwide, affecting approximately 100,000 individuals annually.  The authors discuss antecedent events that often precede the onset of GBS, such as surgery or infection, implicating various pathogens including Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, cytomegalovirus, Zika virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. These events are widely discussed in relation to GBS development.  GBS is generally categorized into demyelinating and axonal subtypes based on different immune responses at various sites in the body. The demyelinating subtype is known as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) and it involves the destruction of myelin in peripheral nerves due to infiltrating inflammatory cells. AIDP is identified as the most common subtype in Western countries. The authors highlight that antibodies can be detected on Schwann cells in AIDP patients.  Additionally, experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) is mentioned as an animal model used to study AIDP. EAN uses myelin epitopes P0 or P2 as major antigens to induce T-cell-mediated neuritis.  The second most common subtype of GBS is Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN), which primarily involves axonal injury without significant inflammation or demyelination. Antibodies related to AMAN include anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a antibodies. Interestingly, AMAN patients related to Campylobacter jejuni infection share structural similarities between gangliosides on peripheral nerves and lipo-oligosaccharides produced by this bacterium.  Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a variant of GBS, is characterized by facial muscle weakness and ataxia. Most MFS patients have antibodies against GQ1b ganglioside, suggesting their potential role in the disease mechanism and as diagnostic markers.  The authors emphasize the role of inflammatory cells and factors in the pathogenesis of GBS. Macrophages are discussed as playing a dual role—proinflammatory macrophages (M1) promote blood-nerve barrier disruption, cytokine production, and Th1 polarization leading to demyelination; anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) seem to have a protective function by promoting T-cell apoptosis, myelin removal, inhibition of inflammation, axon regeneration.  The involvement of T-cell subtypes is highlighted as contributing to the imbalance seen in GBS pathogenesis. The Th1 response activates and recruits macrophages to peripheral nerves causing damage either directly or through toxic substances release. Whereas the Th2 response acts as a suppressor and regulator of the Th1 pathway with observed resolving effects during recovery phase.  IL-17 and Th17 cells' emerging roles in immune diseases are briefly mentioned along with Treg cells' suppressive effect on inflammation. Furthermore, studies showed that regulatory T cells (Tregs) from both GBS patients and healthy individuals exhibited similar properties related to suppressing CD4+ effector T cells.  The introduction ends by mentioning cytokines' essential role in regulating cellular processes including growth differentiation modulation, immune response modulation, and participation in inflammatory responses. Proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IL-6 stimulate effector cell recruitment while inhibiting cytokines like IL-4 and IL-10 aid disease suppression or induce myelin repair.  Finally, the introduction notes that new strategies for identifying potential therapies for GBS patients have emerged from recent studies on its pathogenesis both using animal models such as EAN rats and clinical practice approaches.   Overall, this introduction provides an extensive overview of GBS, its subtypes, antecedent events, pathogenesis involving inflammatory cells and cytokines, as well as the potential for new therapeutic approaches.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the legalization of cannabis for recreational use in Canada on October 17, 2018. This legislative action has resulted in divergent reactions from different groups: those who campaigned for cannabis legalization have expressed positivity, while groups involved in treating individuals who experience negative outcomes from cannabis use have expressed disappointment. However, despite the increase in cannabis use since legalization, the expected business potential has not materialized.  The article goes on to mention that the overall use of cannabis in Canada has been consistently increasing each year since legalization. It cites statistics showing that the percentage of adults over the age of 15 using cannabis increased from an estimated 15% in 2017 (before legalization) to 25.2% in 2021. Similar increases have been observed in other countries that have fully legalized cannabis.  The COVID-19 pandemic and opioid crisis have affected efforts to inform the general public about potential harms associated with cannabis use. Although adverse events related to cannabis are not common, there is concern that as THC concentration and frequency of use increase, these events may become more prevalent. For example, the rate of diagnosed Cannabis Use Disorder has increased from an estimated 10% to 22% among users.  The need to effectively communicate these risks is emphasized due to recent developments regarding the legal status of medical and recreational cannabis across various countries and states within the United States. Several US states have legalized medical or recreational marijuana, while countries such as Canada and Uruguay have fully legalized both forms of usage.  To support emergency department personnel when discussing adverse events related to mental health associated with cannabis use, this article aims to aggregate common and uncommon psychiatric adverse events experienced by users. The authors acknowledge previous studies on cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) which is often highlighted by media due to its dramatic nature; however, they clarify that only a small proportion of users experience this particular side effect.  Furthermore, an increase in emergency department visits related to cannabis use has been recorded post-legalization in Canada. However, it is noted that the absolute number of such visits remains small relative to the number of cannabis users. The authors propose framing this frequency as a rare side effect if viewed in the context of pharmaceuticals under consideration for government licensing.  In addition to physical side effects like stroke and lung injuries associated with heavy cannabis use, mental health adverse events are discussed as a complex subject requiring further exploration. The article also touches on potential factors complicating data analysis in this area.  Overall, this introduction provides an overview of the context and significance of studying adverse events related to cannabis use following its legalization. It highlights the need for effective communication about risks while considering various demographic and societal factors influencing usage patterns and outcomes. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, it delves into specific studies and research related to adverse events of cannabis use. The authors mention a study conducted by Andrews and colleagues, which examines cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) as one of the most commonly reported adverse events associated with cannabis use. CHS is characterized by severe nausea and vomiting and has received significant attention from the media due to its dramatic nature.  While CHS is one of the more well-known adverse events, the article emphasizes that it affects only a small proportion of cannabis users. It acknowledges that administrative data from Canada shows an increase in emergency department visits per 100,000 people following legalization; however, it is still a relatively small number when considering overall cannabis users.  The study takes a comparative approach to analyzing adverse events related to cannabis by comparing them to side effects seen with government-approved pharmaceuticals. For instance, they highlight more serious medical side effects such as the risk of stroke and lung-associated injuries like hemoptysis (coughing up blood), which are more clearly associated with heavy use. These side effects have clear quantitative measures through imaging techniques that demonstrate damage caused by these events.  However, understanding mental health-related adverse events linked to cannabis use proves even more complex than physical side effects. The authors endeavor to address this complexity within their research. They also acknowledge potential factors that could complicate data analysis in this area but do not delve deeper into these factors within the introduction.  In summary, this introduction establishes a framework for studying the psychiatric adverse events related to cannabis use in conjunction with emergency department visits and medical outcomes following its legalization for recreational purposes in Canada. It highlights differential viewpoints on legalization while emphasizing increasing usage rates since its implementation. Additionally, it touches upon other countries' legal approaches towards medical and recreational marijuana before segueing into specific areas like CHS and mental health consequences.  This setting provides readers context for understanding why researching adverse events associated with cannabis use and effective communication in this field are crucial. The subsequent sections of the article are likely to explore these topics in more detail to enhance understanding, inform medical professionals, and contribute to evidence-based interventions and policies.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of calcaneal apophysitis (CA) or Sever’s disease, which is the most common cause of heel pain in children and young people. The incidence rate is reported to be 3.7 per 1000 patients, making it a significant musculoskeletal issue. CA accounts for a considerable number of consultations in sports clinics, ranging from 2% to 16%, and constitutes a noteworthy percentage of repetitive stress injuries in children (5.8%–22.7%).  The condition primarily affects girls between 7 and 12 years old and boys between ages 8 and 15, with a peak occurrence observed between ages 10 and 12 across both genders. CA was first described by Dr Sever in 1912 after observing sporadic continuous pain in the posterior area of the calcaneus (heel bone) among pediatric patients.  Histological studies have characterized CA as inflammation or bone edema resulting from stress fractures in the secondary growth center of the calcaneus. This inflammation is attributed to traction forces exerted by the triceps surae muscle on the hyaline cartilage that comprises CA.  The gender incidence ratio for CA remains controversial, with conflicting findings reported by various studies: some suggesting that it occurs more frequently in boys than girls at a ratio of around10:1 while others indicate ratios around3:1,2:1,or even1:1.  CA typically manifests as a unilateral condition; although dominant leg association may explain this tendency, there have been cases reported where it affects both sides simultaneously.  Diagnosis relies primarily on recognizing signs and symptoms but can also be supported by complementary tests such as X-ray imaging. The pain associated with CA usually localizes to the posterior and plantar side of the calcaneus or even at the Achilles tendon insertion site.  Various treatment approaches have been documented including stretching exercises for triceps surae, ice application, physical activity restriction, rest, topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, taping, and the use of foot orthoses and heel pads.  The causes of CA include rapid periods of growth resulting in muscle-tendon imbalances due to slower muscle development in comparison to bone growth. Additionally, obesity has been associated with an increased risk of CA due to valgus deformity of knees and ankles. Weight distribution among the lower limbs is noted to be higher on the affected side in children with CA. Overuse injuries also contribute to CA development through repetitive micro-traumas during activities such as running or jumping. The role of improper or insufficient footwear with inadequate cushioning can further worsen this factor.  Certain sports activities like athletics, football, basketball ballet, tennis have been identified as being associated with CA due to their demands on the feet on hard surfaces.  Biomechanical factors are often observed in patients with CA; 95% present with alterations affecting movement at the ankle joint such as limited dorsiflexion caused by restrictions in triceps surae or hamstring muscles.  Authors have identified different types of foot deviations associated with CA: some report flat feet with valgus calcaneus as common while others highlight a varus calcaneal deviation leading to a pronated foot under dynamic conditions. Two other causes linked to CA mentioned are clubfoot and pes cavus (high arches).  Given that knowledge about risk factors related to CA aids prevention and early treatment for this common condition among children and adolescents,pursuing a systematic review was undertaken.The purpose was therefore to identify both intrinsic (within individuals) and extrinsic (environmental) risk factors for developing Calcaneal apophysitis,in addition potential consequences associated after considering evidence provided from previous studies.",explain
"This introduction begins by explaining the concept of surface plasmon resonances (SPR) in noble metals such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag). These metals, when illuminated with a resonant wavelength, can cause the coherent oscillation of electrons, resulting in a significant increase in the optical extinction cross-section and near-field enhancement. This property allows noble metal plasmonic nanostructures to serve as SPR sensors by utilizing the high sensitivity of local electromagnetic fields to changes in their surroundings.  The rapid development of nanofabrication technologies in the past decade, including techniques like nanosphere lithography and nanoimprint lithography, has greatly expanded the range of applications for SPR sensors. These label-free and real-time detection devices have found uses in various fields for detecting bio-/chemical species.  The performance evaluation of SPR sensors is typically done using figure of merit (FOM), which measures how well they can detect changes in refractive index. A high FOM indicates excellent sensing performance. The factors influencing FOM are spectral shift per refractive index unit (RIU) and resonance linewidth or full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). To improve FOM, there are two main directions: enhancing near-field intensity for a large spectral shift per refractive index or decreasing the linewidths of the sensors by reducing plasmonic loss.  The introduction then discusses different types of SPR sensors. Propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) sensors that use prism coupling strategies have limited flexibility in tuning optical properties and suffer from difficulties with miniaturization and portability due to their reliance on optical components.  On the other hand, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensors based on metallic plasmonic nanoparticles do not need momentum matching conditions for excitation and are relatively simple to prepare with low cost. However, LSPR sensors often exhibit broad resonance spectra due to strong radiative damping, which can limit their sensing performance.  Advances in micro-/nanofabrication techniques have led to the development of metallic plasmonic substrates and nanostructured SPR sensors, such as nanohole arrays, nanoring arrays, and nanomushroom arrays. These nanostructured SPR sensors offer easier integration with imaging and microfluidic systems, direct excitation of plasmonic resonances without additional coupling structures, and the potential for multiplexing and high-throughput sensing analysis. The flexible structural designs of these sensors also provide opportunities to enhance near-field intensities and reduce resonance linewidths, thereby improving FOM.  Nanostructured SPR sensors have been extensively utilized in various applications such as medical diagnosis, food safety analysis, and environment monitoring. The introduction concludes by stating that this review aims to introduce effective strategies for improving the sensing performance of SPR sensors with a focus on reducing resonance linewidths rather than enhancing near-field intensities. The subsequent sections will cover influence factors of plasmon linewidths (Section 2), developed strategies for obtaining narrow resonance linewidths (Section 3), applications of SPR sensors in different fields (Section 4), and prospects for the future development of nanostructured SPR sensors.  Overall, this introduction sets the stage by explaining the principles behind surface plasmon resonances in noble metals and their applications as sensor devices. It highlights ongoing challenges in terms of sensor performance related to resonance linewidths while providing a context for exploring strategies to address these limitations.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of primary complement (C) deficiencies, which are a type of primary immunodeficiency. It begins by stating that C deficiencies make up approximately 1-10% of all reported primary immunodeficiencies, although national registries have documented higher numbers. The most common C deficiencies affect mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and C2, with MBL deficiency estimated to occur in over 10% of the Caucasian population. However, the majority of C deficiencies have an estimated prevalence of about 0.03% in the general population.  The introduction highlights that many C disorders go undiagnosed due to redundancies in the immune system and the frequent presence of asymptomatic patients. It explains that most C defects are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, except for C1-inhibitor deficiency (autosomal dominant) and properdin deficiency (X-linked). The various types of C deficiencies are categorized into early pathway defects, terminal component defects, and regulatory component/receptor defects.  Symptoms associated with these deficiencies can range from mild or absent to serious and even life-threatening infections. Alongside inherited causes, acquired factors such as immune complex overconsumption, reduced hepatic synthesis, increased protein loss via urine, autoantibodies presence or somatic mutations can also lead to C deficiency.  The introduction mentions three clinical scenarios resulting from missing complement factors: increased susceptibility to bacterial infections; concomitant features of autoimmunity like systemic lupus erythematosus; and uncontrolled complement activation leading to other immune-related disorders primarily due to regulatory component/ receptor deficits.  It emphasizes that severe sinopulmonary bacterial infections involving encapsulated bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae type b are common manifestations seen across different types of complement deficiencies.The presence recurrent neisserial infections may indicate possible terminal component or early alternative pathway deficiencies  Diagnosing C deficiencies can be challenging due to their rarity, heterogeneous clinical symptoms, and complex diagnostic procedures. Functional assays based on hemolytic activity are commonly used initially to test each activation arm of the complement system. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods have been developed to assess the functionality of all three complement pathways, followed by quantification of specific individual components.  Genetic approaches are increasingly employed in diagnosing C deficiencies, as there is a close association between genetic variants and these conditions. Gene sequencing has become an important tool for confirming single component deficiencies detected through functional assays. It is also used as an alternative method when functional tests are not easily available or when there is a need for immediate diagnosis.  The introduction acknowledges that genetic analysis may be complicated by copy number variations, point mutations, and pseudogenes but suggests that next-generation sequencing and improved genetic tools have gradually changed the approach to diagnosing these inherited immune system disorders.  The article aims to explore the potential benefits of genetic workup in supporting currently available immunological assays for identifying C deficiencies. It presents a case study of a ten-year-old boy with C7 deficiency due to a novel mutation resulting in functional hemizygosity. Additionally, it conducts a systematic review of literature to uncover the genetic bases underlying C7 deficiency. In this PubMed article, the authors set out to investigate the role of genetic analysis in identifying and understanding complement deficiencies. They specifically focused on C7 deficiency, a rare condition that affects one of the components of the complement system.  To explore this topic, the researchers conducted a case study involving a ten-year-old boy who presented with C7 deficiency. They discovered a novel mutation that was responsible for functional hemizygosity in this patient. To further enhance their understanding of C7 deficiency, they performed a systematic review of existing literature to uncover other genetic mutations associated with this condition.  The authors highlight that while immunological assays are commonly used for initial diagnosis and evaluation of complement deficiencies, these tests have limitations. Functional and protein analysis can be time-consuming and less accurate. Additionally, they may be influenced by factors such as sensitivity to freeze-thaw cycles.  Genetic approaches offer several advantages compared to traditional diagnostic methods. Gene sequencing has become increasingly robust and accessible, allowing researchers to identify specific genetic variants associated with complement deficiencies accurately. In cases where functional tests are not readily available or inconclusive results are obtained, genetic analysis provides an alternative and immediate diagnostic technique.  The integration of genetics into the diagnostic pathway has been particularly valuable in confirming single component deficiencies detected through quantitative and functional assays. It allows clinicians to pinpoint specific gene mutations responsible for these deficiencies accurately.  Despite challenges related to copy number variations, point mutations, pseudogenes, and inherent complexity when investigating rare diseases' genetics aspects like inherited immune system disorders is steadily improving through advances in next-generation sequencing technology.  The article emphasizes how genetic analysis complements conventional immunological assays by providing additional insights into both diagnosis and pathophysiology underlying complement deficiencies. Understanding the genetic basis behind these disorders can help clinicians develop personalized treatment strategies based on individual patients' specific gene variants.  By studying C7 deficiency as an example within this broader context, the authors aim to shed light on how integrating genetic workup into standard diagnostic protocols has the potential to enhance our understanding of complement deficiencies as a whole. It may also drive further research into novel treatments, prevention strategies, and potentially even genetic therapies for individuals with complement deficiencies.  Overall, this article underscores the importance of incorporating genetic analysis alongside immunological assays in diagnosing and studying primary complement deficiencies. By examining specific cases and conducting thorough literature reviews, researchers can advance our knowledge in this field and pave the way for more accurate diagnostics and targeted interventions in patients with these rare immune disorders.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the significant impact of neonatal encephalopathy (NE) on child mortality and long-term morbidities, such as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and neurocognitive delays. The incidence of NE is lower in industrialized countries where therapeutic hypothermia (HT) is the standard treatment, reducing mortality and morbidities. However, NE burden is disproportionately higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. The feasibility, safety, and efficacy of HT in LMIC are uncertain due to various factors like prolonged intrapartum insults, comorbidities like poor nutrition or infections/inflammation.  The article highlights the need to identify alternative neuroprotective treatments for NE that can have a global impact on reducing its burden. It mentions that the pathophysiology following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is complex and evolves through different phases involving changes in placental blood flow, oxygen supply reduction, excitotoxicity increase with intracellular calcium rise, oxidative stress elevation leading to primary energy failure and cell death.  The authors emphasize that many potential therapies for NE target specific pathological processes related to excitotoxicity, oxidative stress or inflammation. They also mention how HT offers global cellular protection but express concerns about its safety and efficacy specifically in LMIC settings. Therefore, economical single therapies become a focus for this study as an alternative to HT.  The introduction acknowledges the absence of safe and effective therapeutic options apart from HT for treating NE currently available. Some agents are being evaluated through randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), either combined with or without HT. Notably mentioned ones include erythropoietin allopurinol topiramate caffeine melatonin stem cells   Moreover researchers face challenges when translating preclinical studies into clinical studies due to variations between labs regarding treatment protocols/models used as well as lack of comparison with RCTs. The Vannucci rodent model is commonly used to examine the neuroprotective efficacy of potential agents and understand the underlying mechanisms in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. However, inconsistencies exist concerning hypoxia duration/concentration, temperature control during treatment, number of animals used, which raises questions about result reproducibility and validity.  The article emphasizes that while different treatments have shown neuroprotection in the Vannucci model and have set a foundation for hypothermic protection, there is a need to compare and establish the neuroprotective potency of multiple potential agents using this standardized model. Hence, the study aims to review literature for preclinical/clinical studies on NE therapeutic agents, rank them based on evidence efficiency scores for LMIC use, and test 25 therapeutic agents using the standardized Vannucci P7 rat model to identify promising ones for further study in large animal models.  In summary, this introduction provides an overview of NE burden globally and highlights the limitations of HT as a universal treatment option. It also discusses challenges faced when translating preclinical findings into clinical practice regarding variable protocols/models. Finally, it states their objectives: reviewing literature on NE therapies, ranking them based on evidence efficiency scores for LMIC use, testing multiple agents using a standardized animal model to identify promising candidates for further investigation. In the subsequent sections of the introduction, the article delves deeper into the pathophysiology of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. It explains that after an initial phase of reduced placental blood flow and fetal oxygen supply, which leads to a loss of cerebral autoregulation and decreased systemic blood pressure, there is an increase in excitotoxicity, intracellular calcium levels, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This results in primary energy failure and cell death.  Following reperfusion during resuscitation, there is a partial resolution of hypoxia-induced cytotoxic edema and accumulation of excitatory amino acids. Cerebral oxidative metabolism appears to recover during this latent phase. However, around 6-24 hours after hypoxic-ischemic insult (HI), a secondary phase occurs despite adequate oxygenation and perfusion. This secondary phase is characterized by failure of cerebral oxidative metabolism (secondary energy failure), further glutamate-driven excitotoxicity inflammation, production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as mitochondrial dysfunction.  The final phase occurring days to weeks or months later involves chronic inflammation that may lead to epigenetic changes and impair neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and axonal growth.  The introduction then discusses how various putative therapies for NE target specific pathological injury processes such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, overproduction of ROS  mitochondrial dysfunction , neuroinflammation ,and regeneration.  Therapeutic hypothermia (HT) has been found to have a global protective effect on multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in NE but concerns remain regarding its safety and efficacy in LMIC settings. In this study's focus on finding alternative therapies for LMICs economical single therapies are preferred.  The article also mentions other potential therapeutic options for NE currently under evaluation in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) such as erythropoietin allopurinol topiramate caffeine melatonin stem cells. However, it notes that some preclinical agents like inhaled xenon and erythropoietin have not shown significant neuroprotection in clinical trials when combined with HT.  The variability in treatment protocols and models used between preclinical studies is highlighted as a challenge for their translation into clinical studies. Additionally, the lack of reporting pertinent experimental details and animal numbers raises questions about result reproducibility and validity.  To address these issues, the study aims to review existing literature on potential NE therapeutic agents, rank them based on evidence efficiency scores specifically for LMIC settings. Furthermore , it intends to directly compare the neuroprotective efficacy of 25 different therapeutic agents using the standardized Vannucci P7 rat model in a single lab setup. The goal is to identify the most promising agents that can then be further investigated and studied using larger animal models.  In summary, this article provides crucial background information on neonatal encephalopathy (NE), its impact globally, limitations of current therapeutic options like therapeutic hypothermia (HT) in LMIC settings, challenges related to preclinical-to-clinical translation of therapies for NE ,and identification of alternative neuroprotective treatments as a major global interest. The specific aims of this study are highlighted: reviewing literature on NE therapies, ranking them for LMIC use based on evidence efficiency scores ,and evaluating multiple potential neuroprotective agents using a standardized animal model to identify promising candidates for future research.",explain
"The introduction of the PubMed article starts by highlighting that the hospitality sector is one of the most energy-intensive parts of the tourism industry, following only the transportation sector. The high energy consumption in hotels is attributed to various factors such as heating, cooling, lighting, cooking, cleaning, and entertainment. Additionally, it is mentioned that many hotels worldwide focus on high-end and luxury features, which leads to higher investment, consumption, and pollution levels compared to other types of accommodations.  To provide some examples and context for this issue, the introduction presents statistics on energy utilization rates in high-star hotels from countries like Singapore and Portugal. It also mentions average energy consumption per meal and bath in Greece as well as the annual average energy intensity of hotels in Ottawa. These statistics emphasize how hotel buildings consume significantly more energy than residential buildings or other commercial buildings.  The introduction further highlights a study by Sheng et al., which found that luxury hotels in China consume four times more energy than other commercial buildings. This underscores the urgent need for energy-efficient operations in this sector. The increasing concern over hotel energy consumption has prompted scholars from various research fields to investigate this issue.  The negative impacts resulting from excessive hotel industry dependence on fossil fuel-based energy are discussed next. Oluseyi et al.'s study is referenced to demonstrate a strong correlation between CO2 emission levels and per unit room energy consumption in the hotel industry. Moreover, Sofer & Potchter's findings indicate that dense hotel belts contribute significantly to urban heat island effects.  Following these explanations about the environmental impact of large-scale hotel operations driven by significant population growth globally with increasing localized greenhouse gas emissions threatening climate change goals—various measures taken by countries and regions are mentioned such as low-carbon hotels and green hotels initiatives—aimed at reducing resource expenditure while alleviating associated climate footprint emissions [REF].  It goes on to mention researchers' advocacy for conservation efforts since the 1970s within academia with a growing endorsement of the concept of green consumption by tourists. The introduction then describes the main areas that past research has focused on, including the composition and major energy consumption sectors in hotels, factors influencing hotel energy consumption, and establishing benchmarks for energy usage. It highlights how earlier studies were primarily case studies but recent trends show increased interdisciplinary research combining knowledge from fields such as engineering, environmental science, business, and economics.  The introduction stresses the importance of collaboration in energy research within the hospitality industry. It explains how collaboration allows researchers and practitioners to combine resources and expertise to tackle complex energy-related issues effectively. By sharing information and best practices through collaborations, new insights are gained that can be applied to solve real-world problems.  The idea that interdisciplinary research drives innovation is presented next by emphasizing its ability to solve complex problems requiring knowledge from different disciplinary backgrounds for innovative solutions [REF]. The significance of cooperation in facilitating knowledge exchange and innovation is also highlighted.  Finally, it addresses the lack of studies specifically focusing on collaborative r",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of the role of signaling pathways and communication between cells in determining cellular function. It explains how external stimuli are converted into biochemical signals through protein cascades activated by ligand-receptor binding on cell surfaces. These signaling pathways control important biological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell death.  The introduction then focuses on specific signaling pathways that are crucial for normal cellular function but can be disrupted in malignancy. It mentions several key pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Disruption of these pathways can contribute to the development of various types of cancer.  The introduction also highlights the role of inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules in cancer and chronic viral infections. Specifically, it mentions programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 as significant regulators in these diseases. The interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 leads to the activation of inhibitory signals in T-cells, resulting in reduced T-cell function and immune response against tumor cells.  Furthermore, the introduction discusses the relationship between PD-1/PD-L1 axis activity and acute viral infections affecting the respiratory tract. It explains how this pathway impairs CD8+ T-cell activity in the respiratory system during such infections.  The expression patterns of PD-1/PD-L1 on different immune cells are explored next. PD-1 is expressed primarily on CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells, where it negatively regulates T-cell activity when bound to its ligands produced by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as well as peripheral tissues and cancerous cells.  The implications of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction on T-cell function, including decreased activity and increased cell death, are described. The role of PD-L1 in regulating IFN-γ-secreting T-cells is also mentioned.  The introduction then delves into the impact of PD-1/PD-L1 interaction on cancer induction. It explains how cancer cells employ PD-L1 and other immune system regulators like cluster of differentiation (CD)-47 to resist immune responses. Activation of cellular myelocytomatosis (c-MYC) due to CD-47 and PD-L1 expression is highlighted as a target for improving anti-tumor immune response.  Next, the introduction focuses on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which has been implicated as a primary inducer of cancer. Abnormal signaling through this pathway can lead to functional changes in T-cells that compromise their anti-tumor function.  The association between Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation and various types of malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma, HIV-related cancers, breast cancer, and HPV-related cancers is discussed.  The connection between increased levels of PD-1 expression and hyper-activation of the Wnt pathway during chronic HPV infection with tumor cell metastasis and HPV-associated cancers such as cervical cancer is highlighted.  Finally, it is proposed that research should focus on understanding the Wnt/β-catenin and PD-1 signaling pathways as crucial elements in virus-related cancers. The conclusion suggests that these findings may prompt changes in how we evaluate cancer patients and approach immunotherapy.  Overall, this introduction sets the stage for exploring the importance of signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and molecules like PD-1/PD-L1 in cancer development influenced by viruses. It emphasizes their significance in shaping cellular responses during infection and malignancy.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the increasing prevalence of neck pain worldwide due to factors such as rapid economic development, lifestyle changes, and work pressure. It also highlights the significant economic burden that neck pain imposes on society. The main cause of neck pain in adults is degenerative cervical spondylosis (DCS), which can lead to spinal cord dysfunction in severe cases.  Conservative treatment is typically used in the early stages of DCS, but surgical intervention becomes necessary when conservative measures are no longer effective or symptoms worsen. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a widely recognized surgical procedure for treating DCS and involves using an anterior plate fixation to provide stability to the cervical spine, decompress nerves, restore intervertebral height, reconstruct physiological curvature, and reduce complications such as pseudoarthrosis.  However, the placement of a titanium plate during ACDF requires extensive exposure of the surgical field and can lead to complications like soft tissue injury, postoperative dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and degeneration of adjacent segments. Postoperative dysphagia has been attributed to factors like soft tissue swelling at the surgical location, surrounding hematoma (blood clot), esophageal injury, and tissue adhesion around the plate.  Additionally, traditional ACDF with cage-plate construct (CPC) alters biomechanics in the cervical spine by restricting motion at the operated segment and placing increased stress on adjacent segments. This can accelerate adjacent segment degeneration (ASD).  To address these complications associated with traditional ACDF procedures using plates or cages for stabilization purposes came a novel concept design called self-locking stand-alone cage (SSC). This zero-notch design allows self-locking screws in SSCs to be inserted directly into vertebral bodies without plate fixation. SSCs significantly reduce surgical injury by eliminating large anatomical exposures during surgery.  Although studies have shown that SSCs have similar clinical efficacy compared to cage-plate fixation, controversy remains regarding their ability to maintain the physiological curvature of the cervical spine and prevent the subsidence of fusion devices.  Several meta-analyses have been conducted to compare the efficacy and complications between SSC and CPC for treating DCS, but these studies have yielded diverse findings. One limitation among these previous meta-analyses is that they included different surgical segments and variable lengths of follow-up. Some meta-analyses suggest that SSC may be superior to CPC in terms of short- and medium-term effectiveness and safety, but there is uncertainty when comparing long-term outcomes.  Therefore, this article aims to carry out a specific meta-analysis with a follow-up length of ≥ 2 years solely focusing on monosegmental ACDF surgeries. The purpose is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of SSC compared to traditional cage-plate fixation. The goal is to provide clinicians with reliable evidence for making informed decisions regarding surgical treatment options for monosegmental ACDF procedures. The article emphasizes the need for a specific meta-analysis to investigate the long-term benefits and complications of SSC compared to traditional cage-plate fixation in monosegmental ACDF surgeries. The authors highlight that previous meta-analyses have not sufficiently addressed variations in surgical segments and follow-up lengths, which may have influenced the results.  By conducting this meta-analysis with a minimum follow-up length of ≥ 2 years, the researchers aim to provide more comprehensive and accurate insights into the long-term effectiveness and safety of SSC versus CPC in monosegmental ACDF procedures. This will contribute to improving clinical decision-making by offering convincing evidence for surgeons.  The study intends to thoroughly evaluate various outcome measures related to efficacy and safety, including factors such as neurological improvement, maintenance of cervical spine curvature, prevention of fusion device subsidence, functional outcomes, patient-reported quality of life assessments, adverse events such as dysphagia or adjacent segment degeneration, and overall patient satisfaction.  To conduct this meta-analysis accurately, rigorous inclusion criteria will be established. Only studies that fulfill specific eligibility criteria regarding study design (randomized controlled trials or comparative cohort studies), patient population (adults with monosegmental DCS undergoing ACDF with either SSC or CPC), follow-up duration (minimum ≥ 2 years), and outcome reporting will be considered.  Data extraction from selected studies will include relevant demographic information about participants (age range, sex distribution), details regarding surgical procedures performed (SSC characteristics vs. CPC techniques), assessed outcomes at different time points during follow-up (neurological improvement measurements, fusion status evaluation methods), rates of complications/adverse events experienced by patients in each group (dysphagia incidence rates, adjacent segment degeneration occurrences), etc.  Once data extraction is completed from eligible studies meeting pre-defined criteria for inclusion in this meta-analysis review process using standardized methods can begin. Statistical analyses such as hypothesis testing using appropriate statistical tests can then be conducted to compare the long-term outcomes between SSC and CPC. Publication bias and heterogeneity across studies will also be assessed.  By providing a comprehensive analysis of available evidence, this meta-analysis aims to address the existing controversy surrounding SSC versus traditional cage-plate fixation in monosegmental ACDF surgeries. The results of this study have the potential to guide clinical practice by offering valuable information on long-term effectiveness, safety, and risks associated with each procedure.  In conclusion, this article serves as an introduction to a forthcoming meta-analysis that aims to evaluate the long-term benefits and complications of SSC compared to traditional cage-plate fixation in monosegmental ACDF surgeries. By examining existing literature and conducting statistical analyses on relevant data, the authors hope to provide compelling evidence for clinicians when making informed decisions regarding surgical options for their patients.",explain
"In this PubMed article, the introduction begins by highlighting the significant impact of breast cancer (BC) on women's health, stating that it is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. The article cites data from the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting 2.3 million new cases and 685,000 deaths from BC globally [REF]. Additionally, projections from the American Cancer Society estimate about 297,790 new cases of invasive BC in women in the United States in 2023 [REF].  The introduction also emphasizes that BC is a prevalent disease worldwide, with more than 3.8 million survivors in the United States and 7.8 million worldwide [REF]. It mentions that BC incidence rates have been rising by 0.5% annually in recent years and highlights how improved therapeutic regimens and earlier detection methods have contributed to decreased death rates [REF].  The next part of the introduction focuses on explaining key biological aspects of breast cancer. It describes how a breast tumor is composed not only of epithelial cancer cells but also consists of various populations originating from different host cells such as endothelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, and immune cells [REF]. These diverse cell types collectively form what is known as the tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a crucial role in influencing tumor behavior.  The introduction then emphasizes that breast cancer comprises numerous subtypes with distinctive genetic, pathological, and clinical characteristics. It refers to comprehensive molecular studies conducted by Cancer Genome Atlas that identified over 1600 driver mutations across various breast cancer genes [REF]. The concept of tumor heterogeneity is introduced here as well since genetic variation can exist within single tumors or between primary tumors and their metastases.  Furthermore, therapeutic approaches for breast cancer are discussed based on clinical and pathological features such as hormone receptor status or HER2 status [REF]. However, inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity pose challenges for effective treatment, and drug resistance is a major obstacle to achieving long-term cures [REF]. The introduction emphasizes that the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer, influenced by both intrinsic and acquired molecular features controlled by the TME, contributes to treatment resistance.  The importance of understanding inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity and the impact of TME on cancer progression and drug resistance is highlighted. The introduction also mentions discussing emerging technologies for studying these complex interactions in preclinical models and patient-derived samples [REF].  In summary, the introduction provides an overview of breast cancer's global burden, its biological complexity within the tumor microenvironment, its genetic diversity across subtypes, challenges in current therapeutic approaches due to tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance. It sets the stage for further discussion on these topics in this article. Continuing from the previous information, the introduction of this PubMed article addresses the issue of drug resistance in breast cancer. It highlights that drug resistance is one of the major obstacles to achieving long-term cures for breast cancer patients [REF]. The heterogeneous pattern of molecular aberrations found within each cancer plays a crucial role in resistance to anticancer treatments. The article emphasizes that the goal of cancer therapy is to target specific populations of cancer cells within their particular host environment.  The introduction notes that despite improvements in clinical management, a significant number of breast cancer patients still develop drug-resistant tumors [REF]. Resistance can exist before treatment (innate) or can emerge after treatment administration (acquired) [REF]. Innate resistance is mainly attributed to intrinsic tumor heterogeneity, where certain subpopulations within the primary tumor are naturally resistant to treatment from the beginning. On the other hand, acquired resistance becomes apparent after therapy has been administered.  Standard chemotherapies and targeted therapies used in breast cancer have been associated with enabling tumor cells to escape and shape clonal evolution, giving rise to drug-resistant subclones [REF]. Furthermore, genetic diversity comparisons between pre- and post-treatment tumor specimens highlight how therapeutic interventions selectively expand resistant clones initially present but at low frequencies [REF].  The article emphasizes that cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) play a critical role in mediating drug response and educating cancer cells on developing resistance mechanisms through extensive molecular crosstalk [REF]. This interaction between TME cells and cancer cells will be further discussed in subsequent sections.  In this study, the authors aim to provide an overview of what is currently known about inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity as well as exploring how TME impacts both cancer progression and drug resistance. They also intend on discussing up-to-date tools for studying complex interactions using preclinical models and patient-derived samples related to both aspects mentioned above.  Additionally, emerging technologies such as spatial location analysis of tumor subclones and TME cells within their native context will be presented. The authors believe that these advanced techniques hold the potential to improve our understanding of breast cancer heterogeneity and its implications for treatment resistance.  Overall, the introduction sets the stage for a comprehensive analysis of breast cancer heterogeneity, emphasizing its impact on drug resistance and the crucial role played by the tumor microenvironment. It outlines the objectives of the study and hints at how exploring novel tools and technologies may offer valuable insights into this complex subject matter.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of sea cucumbers and the ecological, economic, and conservation importance of studying them in the Arabian Peninsula (AP) and Iran. Sea cucumbers are marine invertebrates found in various environments, from shallow coastal waters to deep sea.  The first paragraph highlights the ecological functions performed by sea cucumbers. They are efficient ecosystem engineers that reduce organic waste through their deposit feeding habit. They also rework sediments and facilitate bioturbation, which is important for maintaining healthy ecosystems.  The next paragraph mentions the economic value of sea cucumbers as a delicacy called ""Beche-de-mer"" or ""Trepang"" in Chinese cuisine. Their demand is growing, leading to overfishing and poor management policies that have resulted in declining global wild stocks.  Aquaculture techniques have been well-established for some commercial species like Holothuria scabra, offering potential assistance in recovering depleted populations and facilitating trade worldwide.  However, research on sea cucumbers specifically from the Arabian Peninsula (AP) and Iran is limited. The authors argue that a detailed review of studies conducted in this region is necessary due to its unique habitat diversity and extreme environmental conditions impacting the diversity of sea cucumber species.  The following paragraphs describe the AP region's geography including marginal seas such as the Arabian/Persian Gulf (APG), Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Red Sea. Each area has distinct characteristics such as shallow depth or high temperature fluctuations affecting species richness within those waters.  Specifically addressing APG characteristics like wide temperature ranges (12°C to > 35°C) and highly variable salinity levels (>42 ppt to >50 ppt), they mention macroalgae diversity serving as nursery grounds for various marine organisms despite being relatively impoverished due to environmental extremes like these or bleaching events induced by climate change.  They go on to mention further details about other regions surrounding Oman known for rich coral reefs, sandy beaches, mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and seaweed communities. They also highlight how upwelling events triggered by the southwest summer monsoon in the Gulf of Oman increase primary productivity and create dispersal barriers.  The Red Sea is described as a warm sea with elevated salinity levels due to high evaporation rates. Mesoscale eddies play a vital role in distributing nutrients in its oligotrophic environment. It hosts biodiverse habitats like mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs renowned for their global significance.  The introduction concludes by highlighting the threats faced by these ecosystems from tourism-based coastal development, which affects biodiversity and overall ecosystem functionality.  Overall, this introduction sets the stage for further research on sea cucumbers in the AP region and Iran by emphasizing their ecological importance, economic value, decline due to overfishing and poor management policies, as well as the need for comprehensive studies conducted there. In addition to providing an overview of the ecological and economic importance of sea cucumbers in the AP region and Iran, this article aims to review and analyze the existing research on sea cucumbers conducted in this area.

"The introduction of the PubMed article begins by stating that colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common malignant tumor of the digestive tract worldwide. It highlights that CRC ranks third in terms of incidence rate and second in death caused by cancer. The article then mentions that socioeconomic development is positively correlated with CRC incidence, with projections suggesting a significant increase in CRC cases and deaths by 2030.  Despite some progress in early diagnosis and treatment, the five-year survival rate for CRC patients remains around 50%. This is attributed to the fact that CRC often lacks obvious symptoms in its early stages, leading to late-stage diagnosis and metastases. The exact mechanisms underlying the occurrence, development, and invasion of CRC are still not completely understood, making it an active area of research.  Epidemiological studies have identified diet, obesity, and diabetes as risk factors for CRC. Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated a close relationship between abnormal lipid metabolism (the processing of lipids within cells) and colorectal cancer. Lipids are hydrophobic macromolecules present in various forms such as fatty acids (FAs), phospholipids, triglycerides (TGs), sphingolipids, cholesteryl esters, and cholesterol.  Lipids play essential roles as structural components of cell membranes and contribute to material transport, energy supply for cells' functions including signaling molecules/apoptosis regulation [REF]. Abnormal lipid metabolism refers to imbalances between anabolic (biosynthetic) processes producing lipids within the body's tissues compared with catabolic (breakdown) pathways regulating their usage or removal [REF].  Normal cells can adapt their anabolic pathways according to nutrient availability; however tumor cells exhibit uncontrolled proliferation even under nutrient-deficient conditions typically found within hypoxic tumors [REF]. In this context Abnormal lipid metabolism has been linked to carcinogenesis induction/metastasis promotion [REF] .  Many studies report associations between abnormal lipid metabolism and the poor prognosis of CRC patients [REF], correlating with malignant progression and increased proliferation. These changes in lipid metabolism contribute to dysregulation of genes, proteins, cytokines, and signaling pathways [REF]. The presence of various components within the tumor microenvironment (including cells, cytokines, DNA, RNA, and nutrients) also plays a role in regulating lipid metabolism in CRC cells [REF].  The article aims to review the alterations in lipid metabolism seen in colorectal cancer and its role in cancer genesis/development. Additionally it discusses how lipid metabolic pathways are remodeled within CRC cells as well as interactions with the tumor microenvironment. The overall goal is to improve understanding of lipid metabolism therapy for targeting treatment options/pathways that can ultimately lead to improved prognoses for individuals with CRC.  In summary, this introduction provides an overview of colorectal cancer's global prevalence and its correlation with socioeconomic development. It emphasizes the need for better methods for early diagnosis using detection methods and tumor markers while further exploring molecular mechanisms underlying CRC occurrence/development/invasion. The role of abnormal lipid metabolism is discussed along with its impact on clinical treatment outcomes/prognosis. Finally, attention is drawn to regulation factors within both intracellular signals/tumor microenvironments that can affect CRC's metabolic processes. In the subsequent sections of the article, the authors delve deeper into the connection between abnormal lipid metabolism and colorectal cancer (CRC). They provide further evidence to support their claims and discuss key findings from previous studies.  The authors highlight several studies that have demonstrated a significant association between abnormal lipid metabolism and CRC. Aberrant lipid metabolism has been shown to play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of CRC, with dysregulated lipid pathways contributing to tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [REF]. Moreover, clinical studies have revealed that abnormal lipid metabolism is closely linked to poor prognosis in CRC patients [REF].  The article goes on to explain how changes in cellular energy demands can drive alterations in lipid metabolism pathways. Both malignant progression and accelerated proliferation of CRC cells require increased energy supply. As a response to high energy demands, lipid metabolic reprogramming occurs within cancer cells [REF]. These adaptations enable CRC cells to survive under nutrient-deficient conditions that are often found within hypoxic regions of tumors.  The dysregulation of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and oxidation has been observed in CRC cells [REF]. Changes in these gene expression patterns can lead to an imbalance between fatty acid synthesis (anabolic process) and breakdown (catabolic process), resulting in an excess accumulation of lipids within tumor cells. This phenomenon is often observed as increased levels of triglycerides (TGs), cholesterol, cholesteryl esters, or alterations in phospholipids content [REF].  In addition to changes occurring within cancerous cells themselves, the tumor microenvironment also significantly influences cellular lipid metabolism. The review emphasizes that multiple components present within the microenvironment can modulate intracellular signals affecting lipid metabolic pathways [REF]. Factors such as cytokines released by neighboring stromal cells or various nutrients including lipids contribute to this regulation.  Understanding these intricate metabolic interactions becomes crucial for developing targeted therapies aimed at disrupting aberrant pathways related to lipid metabolism in CRC cells. By identifying specific molecular targets involved in these pathways, researchers and clinicians can design interventions to alter the energy supply and nutrient availability necessary for tumor cell survival and proliferation.  Ultimately, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the role of abnormal lipid metabolism in colorectal cancer. It highlights the need for further research into understanding the exact mechanisms underlying lipid metabolic changes in CRC cells as well as their interactions within the tumor microenvironment. The authors advocate for an enhanced comprehension of these complex processes to develop novel therapeutic strategies that can manipulate lipid metabolism, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and prognosis.  In conclusion, this PubMed article sheds light on how abnormal lipid metabolism contributes to colorectal cancer development and progression. It underscores the importance of investigating metabolic reprogramming in CRC cells, considering both intracellular signals and factors present within the tumor microenvironment. By elucidating these intricate relationships, researchers aim to identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions that may improve patient prognosis through targeted disruption of abnormal lipid metabolic pathways in colorectal cancer.",explain
"This introduction starts by highlighting the significance of Salmonella as a major pathogen causing gastroenteritis, which results in illness, death, and economic loss. It emphasizes that non-typhoidal Salmonella enteric infections are a global concern and provides statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) to support this claim.  The introduction also mentions that Salmonella is a common cause of foodborne illness worldwide, particularly associated with poultry products like meat and eggs. It highlights the potential for contamination during animal farming and slaughtering processes, leading to transmission through the food chain to humans.  The risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in both animals and humans is another major concern mentioned in this introduction. It explains how AMR can occur through different mechanisms and references previous evidence suggesting that antimicrobial use in food animals contributes to the emergence and spread of AMR in foodborne Salmonella. The growing problem of AMR is underscored by its impact on treating Salmonella infections.  The introduction also emphasizes that animal-derived products are considered a significant source of human Salmonella infections around the world. The role of contaminated food handlers during processing is also highlighted as a potential source of contamination.  Furthermore, there is mention of increasing AMR rates expected in Asia, including Bangladesh specifically. The WHO's estimated global burden of gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella infections is provided along with data from specific studies showing high resistance rates to multiple antibiotics.  Additionally, this section indicates that resistance genes associated with AMR are typically found on plasmids or other genetic elements within the genome structure of Salmonella.  Finally, it introduces the purpose of this meta-analytical study: to determine the prevalence of Salmonella in livestock and poultry-derived foods, assess antibiotic resistance levels concerning these pathogens in Bangladesh thoroughly, and provide comprehensive insights into this scenario.   Overall, this introductory section provides an overview of why studying salmonellosis caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains of Salmonella in livestock and poultry-derived food is significant, highlighting the global impact, the risk to public health, and the increasing prevalence of AMR. In continuation, this PubMed article aims to conduct a meta-analysis study to assess the prevalence of Salmonella in livestock and poultry-derived food and the extent of antibiotic resistance in Bangladesh. The researchers hypothesize that both Salmonella pooled prevalence and antibiotic resistance are increasing in this context.  By conducting a meta-analysis, which is a systematic review that combines data from multiple studies, the researchers can gather a larger sample size and obtain more reliable estimates of Salmonella prevalence and antibiotic resistance rates. This approach allows them to provide comprehensive information on the state of Salmonella infection and AMR in livestock and poultry-derived foods in Bangladesh.  Understanding the prevalence of Salmonella is crucial for assessing food safety standards, evaluating control measures, and developing strategies to prevent outbreaks. By determining how common Salmonella contamination is in these food sources, policymakers, regulatory agencies, as well as farmers and consumers can take appropriate measures to reduce its occurrence.  Additionally, investigating antibiotic resistance patterns among these strains of Salmonella is essential due to its implications for public health. Rising levels of antimicrobial resistance make it challenging to treat infections effectively with currently available antibiotics. Consequently, understanding the extent of AMR among livestock- and poultry-derived food-related strains helps identify areas where interventions are needed to minimize resistance development.  The research will likely collect data from various sources such as published studies, surveillance systems (both human illness records and animal farm monitoring), laboratory databases containing information on isolates collected from different contexts like hospitals or slaughterhouses. The inclusion criteria will be defined rigorously based on relevance for assessing both prevalence rates as well as representing diverse geographical locations within Bangladesh.  Meta-analyzing these datasets will provide an overview of the current situation regarding salmonellosis caused by bacteria obtained from these food sources. It will help fill gaps in knowledge by synthesizing existing evidence into meaningful insights that inform public health actions further down the line.  In conclusion - this PubMed article's aim centers around providing important information on Salmonella prevalence and antibiotic resistance within livestock and poultry-derived food in Bangladesh. By conducting a meta-analysis, the authors will gather data from various sources to ascertain the current situation accurately. The research outcomes have the potential to contribute significantly to food safety practices, public health policies, and combating antimicrobial resistance in this context.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the concept of frailty and its significance in the management of older adults with cancer. It highlights the importance of routine screening for geriatric conditions in older individuals diagnosed with cancer, as they encounter additional stressors from cancer symptoms and treatment-related toxicities. The introduction emphasizes that understanding frailty is crucial for determining appropriate treatment decisions, supporting non-oncological interventions, and assessing individual health status.  Despite the recognition of frailty in older adults with cancer, there is currently no consensus on the optimal screening or measurement tool for assessing frailty in this population. The article introduces the concept of a frailty index (FI), which quantifies frailty by measuring the number rather than nature of health problems. The FI represents a proportion of deficits calculated using a well-defined method.  The FI is presented as a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate increased frailty. An FI score above or equal to 0.25 has been frequently used to diagnose individuals as frail in community and acute care settings but remains less commonly applied in studies related to cancer.  The use of an FI ≥ 0.25 was derived from previous work by Rockwood et al., who demonstrated that it had construct and predictive validity when categorizing community-dwelling adults as either frail or non-frail. This cut-off point also aligned with other established measures such as Fried et al.'s phenotype model and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS).  However, despite these insights into FI scoring strategies in general populations, there is limited knowledge about how these categories apply specifically within oncology settings. Determining who should be considered ""frail"" becomes crucial when determining trial eligibility or treatment allocation and referring individuals for additional assessments or supports.  Therefore, this scoping review aims to achieve two objectives: first, evaluating which FI categories have been used within oncology literature (both scores and labels); and second, understanding the rationale behind authors' decisions in using these categories. By addressing these objectives, the review seeks to enhance our knowledge of how frailty is categorized in relation to cancer, which can ultimately inform clinical practice and decision-making.  In summary, this article's introduction highlights the importance of frailty assessment in older adults with cancer and acknowledges the absence of consensus regarding its measurement. The use of an FI as a potential tool for quantifying frailty is introduced along with its relationship to other established measures. The introduction sets the stage for further exploration into FI categorization within oncology literature and aims to provide valuable insights into its validity and applications in a cancer context. By conducting a scoping review, the authors aim to gather and analyze existing literature on the categorization of frailty using the FI in an oncology setting. They hope to identify which FI categories have been used and understand the reasons behind authors' choices.  Understanding how researchers have categorized frailty within an oncology context is crucial for several reasons. First, it can inform trial eligibility criteria and treatment allocation decisions. Certain treatment regimens may be deemed unsuitable for frail individuals due to potential risks or side effects, while others might require modified approaches or additional support. Therefore, having standardized and evidence-based categorization of frailty can guide these decisions in order to optimize patient outcomes.  Secondly, being able to accurately categorize individuals based on their level of frailty can also contribute to appropriate referral for assessments or supportive interventions. Those identified as more frail may require additional evaluations or specific interventions tailored to their needs. Having a consistent approach in categorizing and determining who is considered ""frail"" within an oncology context can prevent variability across studies and ensure that individuals receive appropriate care based on their level of vulnerability.  The scoping review conducted by the authors will gather relevant articles from medical databases following a predefined search strategy. This systematic approach will help ensure that comprehensive research literature related to FI categorization in oncology is included and analyzed.  The review will focus on identifying both FI scores and labels used by different authors in their research studies involving cancer patients. By examining this information, the authors seek to uncover patterns and trends in how researchers have categorized fragile individuals within various contexts of cancer diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, or palliative care.  Additionally, understanding why specific categories were chosen by study authors is another important aspect addressed by this scoping review. The rationale behind these decisions could shed light on factors such as clinical relevance, predictive validity for certain outcomes (e.g., institutionalization or survival), ease of use in clinical practice settings or research studies, and overall consistency with existing frailty measures.  Overall, this scoping review seeks to contribute to the field of oncology by providing a comprehensive overview of how the FI has been categorized in frailty assessment. With standardized and evidence-based categorizations, healthcare professionals can make more informed decisions regarding risk stratification, treatment options, and supportive interventions for older adults with cancer. The findings from this review may also highlight potential gaps or inconsistencies in the literature that further research can address to improve overall understanding and management of frailty in the context of cancer.",explain
"This PubMed article provides an overview of the importance of kinases in cellular metabolism, cell cycle regulation, cellular endurance, and differentiation. Kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in various signaling pathways and have been implicated in diseases such as diabetes, inflammation, and cancer.  The human genome sequencing has revealed that approximately 2% of the human genome codes for protein kinases, which are further categorized into families and subfamilies based on their biological functions. The major types of kinases found in mammalian signaling pathways include lipid kinases, tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases, and dual kinases.  Phosphorylation is a key mechanism by which protein kinases regulate target proteins' activity by controlling signaling pathways through amplification, cellular location changes or interactions with other controlling proteins. The study on human kinases has identified 518 protein kinase families based on their biological functions.  Kinase inhibitors are small molecules that inhibit kinase activity and have significant applications in therapeutic and diagnostic fields. They have shown potential as targets for treating various diseases such as autoimmune disorders cardiovascular diseases cancer inflammatory disorders. As of November 2022 FDA had approved 72 small molecules as therapeutic kinase inhibitors.  While small molecule kinase inhibitors have limitations like target non-specificity toxicity; novel biologic agents like monoclonal antibodies can also be employed for targeting specific kinases but disadvantages like target non-specificity may still remain. Additionally natural products from plant sources contain small molecules that can function as signaling molecules and assist in treating several disorders.  Research has also focused on marine natural products as potential sources of kinase inhibitors. Marine bacteria fungi sea animals algae sponges coral species have produced numerous kinase inhibitors with potential applications in drug development.  Kinase inhibitors represent a rapidly growing area of interest in therapeutics research however developing potent selective inhibitors remains challenging due to the complex nature of the active sites within these enzymes. A variety of approaches including targeting upstream kinases in kinase cascades and utilizing conformational variability have been explored to inhibit kinase activity. Selectivity has been a challenge during the development of kinase inhibitors binding to ATP pocket that disrupts the functioning of the kinase. Therefore, alternative strategies targeting inactive forms or employing structural diversity have been employed.  Several successful kinase inhibitors such as Imatinib have been developed for oncology applications. These inhibitors target specific types of kinases involved in oncogenic pathways and have shown efficacy in treating certain cancers like chronic myelogenous leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors.  Finally, the global market for kinase inhibitors is gradually expanding due to their therapeutic potential in a range of diseases beyond cancer. While cancer remains a priority area for drug development efforts, there is increasing interest in exploring other disorders as well.  In summary, this article provides an overview of kinases' essential functions, their implications in diseases like diabetes, inflammation, and cancer, different types of kinases and their classification based on biological functions along with potential applications of small molecule inhibitors derived from natural sources such as plants and marine organisms. It also highlights challenges associated with developing selective kinase inhibitors and discusses successful examples in oncology therapeutics using targeted approaches.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by addressing the concerns that health workers have regarding the human right to health. It highlights that despite a global economic slowdown caused by the pandemic, carbon dioxide levels have reached their highest point in three million years due to continued human consumption generating dangerous levels of greenhouse gases.  The introduction then goes on to discuss how profit-driven economic systems during the COVID-19 pandemic have created extreme wealth for a few individuals while pushing millions into poverty. It specifically mentions that 40 new billionaires are pharmaceutical executives, emphasizing inequities in wealth distribution.  The authors further argue that colonial imprints, white supremacy, and racial capitalism have shaped public and private care systems, resulting in advantages for white-identified and wealthy individuals while disadvantaging black and brown communities during encounters with COVID-19.  The concept of ""upstream forces"" is introduced next, referring to social, political, and economic contexts that structure society and act as ""manufacturers of illness."" The authors provide examples of both negative upstream forces (profit-making institutions) and positive ones (equitable transportation, healthy rivers/wetlands, community practices with an ethos of care).  As health inequities persist globally despite local efforts to address them, interest has grown in frameworks such as social medicine, collective health, and structural competency. These fields aim to accurately diagnose the root causes of inequities while offering prescriptions for remedies.  Different perspectives on this intensified interest are presented - some view it as a cyclical rediscovery of well-established relationships between oppressive social conditions and illness risk; others see it as a response driven by climate catastrophe urgency, ongoing racial injustice issues , and the global pandemic. The authors mention that there is hope among some that this increased interest and energy will lead to disruptive and generative social change, moving the global community closer to achieving Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which asserts the right to a standard of living adequate for health and well-being.  The introduction then emphasizes that social medicine, collective health, and structural competency all share commonalities as they assert that health is a human right determined by upstream factors rather than solely biological ones. These fields align with the understanding of civil, political, social cultural, and economic rights within human rights literature. They focus on examining the production of health and systems of care while addressing political economies that either support or hinder public health as a social good.  Although there is an ideological interest in health justice shared by practitioners and scholars in these fields, there is minimal dialogue between them. The introduction suggests possible reasons for this lack of exchange include differences in geographic origins, language barriers, territorialism within academic spheres linked to novelty generation for career advancement purposes. Additionally, some believe new conceptualizations are necessary beyond existing theories for eliminating health inequities.  The authors argue that this lack of dialogue diminishes possibilities for relationship-building, theoretical expansion/imagination problem-solving capacities required for collective power-building toward social change in pursuit of health justice. They argue that bridging these gaps can enhance their substantive contributions to ensuring universal access to healthcare as a human right.  In this paper's goal is stated as igniting intentional dialogue among practitioners and scholars in social medicine...  Please note: Due to character limitations imposed by Assistant+, I am unable to provide further explanation beyond this point regarding the concrete examples proposed by the authors regarding transformative pedagogy strategies or their collective experiences as transnational group educators/practitioners mentioned earlier in your request.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by providing an overview of orofacial pain (OFP). It describes OFP as localized below the orbito-meatal line, above the neck and anterior to the ears, including pain in structures of the oral cavity. The latest classification system for OFP distinguishes between acute, episodic, and chronic pain based on duration and frequency.  Chronic OFP is particularly significant because it often leads to reduced quality of life, sleep disturbances, psychological issues, and disability. This distinction is crucial as chronic OFP requires different management strategies and has a less favorable prognosis compared to acute or episodic pain. The estimated prevalence of chronic OFP in the general population is 10%.  The article then introduces the concept of primary versus secondary classification for OFP. Primary conditions have unknown causes (e.g., chronic primary temporomandibular joint pain), while secondary conditions have identifiable causes (e.g., temporomandibular joint pain attributed to arthritis). Chronic primary OFP is considered its own disease entity, whereas chronic secondary pain syndromes are symptoms of underlying conditions.  The introduction highlights some challenging types of chronic primary OFP that require palliative care rather than curative treatment. These include painful temporomandibular disorders (pTMDs), idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and burning mouth syndrome (BMS). Patients with these conditions often experience significant biological, psychosocial, and economic burdens that impact not only themselves but also their families and society as a whole.  Specifically focusing on pTMDs: myofascial pain and temporomandibular joint pain are identified as the most common types within this category. They affect around 5% of the population with a higher prevalence in women compared to men.  For TN: it has a lifetime prevalence ranging from 0.16%-0.3% predominantly affecting women at a ratio of 1.5:1. TN is characterized by recurring severe paroxysmal pain in the orofacial region, triggered by innocuous stimuli such as washing the face or eating.  Regarding BMS: its prevalence ranges from 2.5%-5%, increasing to 14% among post-menopausal women. BMS is characterized by a burning sensation affecting the tongue, lips, and hard and soft palates. It may be accompanied by taste alterations, stinging sensations, dryness, and atypical odontalgia.  Despite scientific advancements in recent decades, treatment for primary OFP conditions remains suboptimal. Hence, understanding the underlying pathophysiology is essential for improving therapeutic approaches.  The introduction highlights that pre-clinical research plays a crucial role in advancing scientific knowledge of primary OFP conditions. It also emphasizes the increasing importance of pain neuroimaging and genetic studies supplemented with animal research.  The overall goal of this article is to review rodent assays (injury models) and behavioral measures used in chronic primary OFP research specifically focusing on pTMDs, TN, and BMS. The authors aim to discuss these measures' applicability and challenges given our current understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of these conditions while proposing possible future directions for research.  It's worth noting that previous reviews have focused on other conditions associated with OFP like migraine/headaches and oral cancer but are not relevant to this particular article's scope. The article emphasizes that despite the progress made in understanding OFP, there is still a need for further investigation into the pathophysiology underlying these primary OFP conditions. This is because current treatments are not optimal, and many patients continue to suffer from chronic pain and its associated impacts on their daily lives.  To address this gap in knowledge, pre-clinical research involving laboratory animals has been and continues to be an essential means of advancing scientific understanding. The use of animal models allows researchers to study various aspects of OFP, including its etiology, mechanisms, and potential therapeutic interventions.  Additionally, the article highlights that there has been a surge in pain neuroimaging studies and genetic research related to OFP. These approaches provide valuable insights into the neural pathways involved in pain perception and genetic factors contributing to susceptibility or resilience towards chronic pain conditions. Animal research serves as a complementary tool for these neuroimaging and genetic studies, allowing further exploration of mechanistic aspects not easily studied in human subjects.  The primary focus of this review article is to describe the rodent assays (injury models) commonly used for studying chronic primary OFP conditions such as pTMDs (myofascial pain and temporomandibular joint pain), TN (idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia), and BMS (burning mouth syndrome). These assays are critical for investigating various behavioral responses associated with these conditions.  Understanding the applicability as well as limitations of these assays is crucial for designing effective experiments that can provide meaningful insights into these complex disorders. By discussing the challenges inherent in using rodent models for studying chronic primary OFP conditions like pTMDs, TN, and BMS, researchers can refine experimental methodologies going forward.  Furthermore, considering our current knowledge regarding the etiology and pathophysiology underlying these primary OFP conditions should guide future directions in pre-clinical research. By identifying gaps in our understanding or areas where more information is needed, researchers can establish a solid foundation for developing improved therapeutic strategies.  It is important to note that this review article differs from previous ones that have focused on other OFP-related conditions such as migraines/headaches and oral cancer. By delineating this specific focus on chronic primary OFP conditions, the authors aim to provide comprehensive insights into these specific pain syndromes that have significant impacts on patients' lives.  In conclusion, this PubMed article highlights the significance of understanding chronic primary OFP conditions such as pTMDs, TN, and BMS. It underscores the need to further explore the underlying pathophysiology through pre-clinical research using rodent models. The goal is to improve our understanding of these complex disorders and pave the way for more effective management strategies in the future.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of the field of gelatin authentication, specifically focusing on the use of biomarkers to determine the origin of gelatin. Biomarkers are molecules that are present in a specific species and can be used as indicators for authentication purposes. In the case of gelatin, two prominent categories of biomarkers are proteomic (proteins and peptides) and genomic markers.  Collagen, a fibrous protein found in animal tissues such as skin, bones, and connective tissue, is used to extract gelatin which has various applications in food and pharmaceutical industries. There are two types of gelatin - type A and type B - with different properties resulting from acid or alkaline pre-treatments during production.  Porcine and bovine skins and bones are commonly used as raw materials for gelatin production worldwide. However, there are public health concerns associated with their use due to potential pathogen dissemination, including prions that can be linked to disease transmission. Additionally, religious beliefs such as Halal (for Muslims) and Kosher (for Jews) dietary laws restrict the consumption of animal-derived products like porcine or bovine gelatins.  Gelatin is also utilized in traditional Chinese medicine (e.g., donkey-hide gelatin). It is essential for consumers to know the source of gelatins they consume due to product fraud risks. For example, some retailers substitute industrial gelatins made from leather waste for edible ones in food products despite potential health risks associated with industrial processes.  Cases of food fraud involving mislabeling have been reported when porcine DNA was found in Halal food products that claimed to contain only Halal-compliant ingredients like Halal-grade gelatin. The identification methods currently available for authenticating the origin of gelatins have advantages but also inherent limitations.  Proteomic biomarkers (e.g., proteins and peptides) offer reliable approaches while genomic-based methods that rely on nucleic acids and PCR detection have also been proven to be useful in gelatin authentication. These methods can contribute to quality control, ensure food safety, and protect consumers from fraudulent practices.  This review aims to provide an overview of the available methodologies for identifying the original source of gelatins. It will discuss proteomic techniques such as chromatography, mass spectrometry, electrophoresis, lateral flow devices, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Genomic approaches including PCR-based techniques such as singleplex PCR, PCR southern hybridization, and multiplex PCR will also be covered.  The advantages and challenges associated with each approach will be discussed along with future prospects for the field of gelatin authentication. Relevant information sources dating from 1980 onwards until recent developments were obtained through multiple databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) and Google Scholar.  In conclusion, this introduction highlights the significance of biomarkers in gelatin authentication and their potential role in strengthening quality control measures while safeguarding consumer health against food fraud risks. The article further emphasizes the need for reliable and convenient methods for manufacturers to identify the origin of gelatins, in response to consumer demands and increased public health concerns. It acknowledges that several methods have been established but cautions that there is no officially defined authentication method yet.  One challenge in implementing these methods is the high cost of equipment and reagents, which limits their widespread use. Nevertheless, proteomic biomarkers, including proteins and peptides, have shown promise as a strategy for determining gelatin origin. Genomic-based methods based on nucleic acids and PCR detection are also proven useful.  The use of novel biomarkers represents a significant improvement in the field of gelatin authentication as they offer more precise and reliable methods. These methods can be utilized to strengthen quality control measures, ensure food safety standards, and protect consumers from food fraud practices.  The review article then introduces various proteomic approaches that are commonly employed in gelatin authentication research. Chromatography techniques such as liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) enable the identification and quantification of specific proteins or peptides present in different types of gelatins. Electrophoresis techniques allow the separation of proteins based on their molecular weight differences.  Lateral flow devices are another approach mentioned in this article that utilize antibodies specific to particular protein markers to visually detect target molecules in gelatins quickly. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) offers a highly sensitive method for detecting target proteins through antibody-antigen interactions.  Additionally, genomic approaches based on nucleic acid analysis have demonstrated utility in determining origin authenticity. PCR techniques such as singleplex PCR allow amplification of genetic targets derived from specific species found in various animal tissues used for gelatin production.  PCR southern hybridization can distinguish between DNA fragments derived from different sources by using probes targeted specifically to each source's DNA sequence variations. Multiplex PCR extends this capability by allowing simultaneous detection of multiple species in gelatin samples.  The review article acknowledges that each approach has its advantages and limitations. It also emphasizes the need for further research to address existing gaps in knowledge and develop more efficient identification methods for the original biological materials used in gelatin production.  In conducting this review, the authors utilized several databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) to gather relevant information dating back to 1980 until the most recent developments. The selection criteria were tailored specifically to proteomic and genomic biomarkers with potential applications in gelatin authentication.  In summary, this PubMed article presents an overview of the field of gelatin authentication and highlights the importance of utilizing biomarkers to determine gelatin origin. It discusses various proteomic and genomic approaches currently employed, their advantages, limitations, and future prospects for improving identification methods. The review aims to contribute towards enhancing quality control measures, ensuring food safety standards are met while protecting consumers from fraudulent practices associated with gelatins' origin.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the current state of primary liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and emphasizes the need for novel therapeutic modalities for advanced or unresectable HCC.  First, it highlights that liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death globally. HCC accounts for 75%-85% of all liver cancer cases.  The introduction then focuses on the role of the immune system in suppressing tumor growth and progression. It states that immunotherapy, which utilizes the host's immune system to fight tumors, holds promise for HCC due to its inflammatory nature and good sensitivity to immunotherapies.  Different types of immunotherapy strategies are mentioned, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), cell-based therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T), tumor immune vaccines, and cytokines like interferon.  Specifically, checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) are discussed. The interaction between PD-L1 expressed on cancer cells and PD-1 is highlighted as a key mediator of cancer immune escape. The success of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies in various cancers is also mentioned.  The importance of combining different immunotherapies or combining them with other modalities to enhance their effects is emphasized. However, it is noted that compared to other T cell-inflamed cancers, response rates to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in HCC remain relatively low due to factors like tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics and genetic differences in patients.  Next, the role histone-modifying enzymes (HMEs) play in epigenetic regulation and their involvement in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis are explained. Abnormal epigenetic modifications associated with histone substrates are highlighted as potential targets for epigenetic therapies. Various small-molecule inhibitors of HME are mentioned, including histone deacetylation inhibitors (HDACis).  While HDACis have shown efficacy in hematological malignancies, their therapeutic efficacy as a single agent in solid tumors such as HCC has been unsatisfactory. Hence, combination therapies involving HDACis with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have been developed to enhance therapeutic outcomes.  The introduction then discusses the potential of HDACis to regulate gene expression and overcome tolerance to immunotherapy in HCC patients. HDACis are suggested to enhance the immunogenicity of tumors by increasing the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules that assist tumor antigen recognition by the immune system. Furthermore, HDACis can also modulate the TME by promoting recruitment of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells through increased expression of chemokines, cytokines and NK cell-related receptors.  Finally, the rapid development of nanotechnology is introduced as a game-changer in biomedicine. Nano-based drug delivery systems (NDDS) offer an effective strategy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies for HCC while minimizing damage to normal cells.  In summary, this introduction provides an overview of primary liver cancer focusing on HCC and highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. It emphasizes both immunotherapies and histone deacetylation inhibitors (HDACis) as potential strategies for treating HCC. Additionally, it introduces nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems as a promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of these therapies.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by defining transactional sex as casual sex between two people that involves the exchange of material incentives for sexual favors. The author notes that transactional sex is associated with negative consequences such as sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV/AIDS), unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion, and physiological trauma.  The article then focuses specifically on Sub-Saharan Africa, where several studies have been conducted to examine the prevalence and factors associated with transactional sex among women. However, these studies have yielded conflicting results, leading to a need for a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the overall prevalence and factors related to transactional sex in this region.  The introduction highlights how socioeconomic factors play a significant role in establishing exchange-based sexual relationships in countries with high HIV prevalence. It also notes that globally, young people in Sub-Saharan Africa are more threatened by the HIV epidemic compared to other regions, with a high proportion of new infections occurring among young girls.  Furthermore, the introduction points out that risky sexual practices among females can lead to multiple concurrent sexual relationships and engaging in unprotected sex. This puts these girls at risk of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Unprotected sex also increases the risk of unintended pregnancies, which can result in unsafe abortions.  The article emphasizes that transactional sex motivated by financial gain is a serious public health issue in Sub-Saharan Africa. Assessing transactional relationships is seen as an important aspect of HIV prevention initiatives because it is identified as one of the main risk behaviors contributing to STI transmission and unwanted pregnancies.  Various issues faced by young people in sub-Saharan Africa contribute to their involvement in transactional sex. These include cultural norms, gender inequality, harmful traditional practices combined with limited access to reproductive health services and high unemployment rates for young females from lower-income families.  Several statistics are provided throughout the introduction highlighting the prevalence of transactional sex across different countries within sub-Saharan Africa. These numbers range from 2% in Niger to as high as 85-90% in Uganda among sexually active girls who have engaged in transactional sex within the last 12 months.  The introduction concludes by restating the need for a systematic review and meta-analysis to address the discrepancies and inconsistent results from previous studies. This study aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the prevalence and associated factors of transactional sex among women in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to highlighting the prevalence of transactional sex and its associated factors, the article emphasizes the public health implications of this practice in sub-Saharan Africa. It explains that transactional sex not only increases the risk of HIV infection and other STIs but also contributes to early sexual activity, early pregnancy, unsafe abortions, and school dropout among girls.  The article explains that unwanted pregnancy is a significant consequence of transactional sex for women in this region. It notes that when young girls become pregnant as a result of engaging in transactional sex, they often face barriers to education due to societal norms and expectations related to parenthood. This further perpetuates their disadvantaged position and limits their long-term life chances.  Furthermore, cultural and social norms along with gender inequality contribute significantly to encouraging young people in sub-Saharan Africa to engage in transactional sex. These norms may include traditional practices that prioritize male dominance and financial dependency on men. The lack of access to reproductive health services exacerbates these challenges for young females from lower-income families.  The introduction concludes by reiterating the importance of conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis to consolidate existing research on transactional sex among women in sub-Saharan Africa. By pooling data from multiple studies, it aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the prevalence as well as identify common associated factors across countries within this region.  This study is critical for informing future interventions and prevention strategies targeting transactional sex-related behaviors among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the extent of engagement in transactional sexual relationships can help policymakers design targeted programs aimed at reducing HIV transmission rates, improving access to reproductive health services, empowering women economically, addressing gender inequalities, promoting safe sexual practices such as consistent condom use or limiting multiple partners.  Ultimately, through synthesizing existing literature on this topic comprehensively through systematic review and meta-analysis methods outlined elsewhere [REF], this study seeks not only insights into transnational relationships but also aims long-term at mitigating broader public health concerns in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly those relating to HIV/AIDS, unintended pregnancies, and unsafe abortions.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the global burden of endometrial cancer in women. It states that endometrial cancer ranks as the sixth most common cancer among women worldwide and is the most common gynecologic cancer in several developed regions, including North America and Eastern and Northern Europe.  The introduction then discusses a concerning trend observed since the late 1990s. The incidence of endometrial cancer has rapidly increased in several developing countries during urbanization, including some Asian countries (Japan, Singapore, China, and the Philippines) and South Africa. This increase is suggested to be partially explained by changing environmental and lifestyle risk factors in these regions such as obesity epidemic, lack of physical activity, and prolonged sitting.  While obesity is a known risk factor for endometrial cancer, the association between sedentary behavior (characterized by low energy expenditure) and endometrial cancer remains largely unclear. The introduction mentions that technological innovation over the past few decades has led to prolonged sedentary time due to desk-based office work and screen-based recreation.  To support this discussion on sedentary behavior's impact on health outcomes beyond endometrial cancer specifically, it references the WHO Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior from 2020. These guidelines state that long sedentary time is associated with various negative health outcomes such as all-cause mortality, cardiovascular diseases, obesity issues, and more recently total cancer morbidity.  Three previous meta-analyses investigating associations between sedentary behavior with various types of cancers have reported a 28% to 36% increased risk of endometrial cancer among individuals with higher levels of sedentary behavior. However, some evidence regarding sedentary behavior's association with endometrial-specific incidence was not included in existing review articles or meta-analyses at that time.  One possible reason for discrepancies in previous findings could be due to no distinction being made between different domains of sedentary behavior. The WHO Guidelines distinguish between various domains such as leisure-time, occupational, and total sedentary behavior. These domains may have different associations with adverse health outcomes due to varying confounding factors.  The introduction also emphasizes the need to consider the complex interplay of lifestyle factors in relation to endometrial cancer risk. Obesity is highlighted as a well-established risk factor for endometrial cancer, with a clear dose-response relationship. Prolonged sitting may be related to high BMI (body mass index), suggesting that obesity could mediate the link between sedentary behavior and cancer incidence.  Additionally, attention is given to physical activity as another potential protective factor against cancer risk, although less evidence exists on this topic compared to obesity's relationship with endometrial cancer.  To address these gaps in knowledge and provide comprehensive analysis on domain-specific (occupational and leisure-time) and total sedentary behavior in relation to endometrial cancer risk, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to include existing studies while considering different adjustment strategies for BMI and physical activity.  In summary, the introduction sets the stage by highlighting the global burden of endometrial cancer before delving into trends observed in developing countries during urbanization. It then explores the association between sedentary behavior and endometrial cancer while discussing possible reasons for inconsistent findings in previous studies. Finally, it outlines the objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a better understanding of how domain-specific sedentary behaviors impact endometrial cancer risk while considering confounding factors such as BMI and physical activity levels.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of microneedles and their growing importance in various biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, biosensing, and body fluid extraction. The passage begins by highlighting the key benefits of microneedles. Firstly, the tips of these tiny needles can penetrate the skin's upper layers without touching nerve endings, minimizing bleeding and pain. This is advantageous for applications involving drug administration or device insertion for biomedical signal detection. Microneedles create microchannels on the skin through which molecules can pass or through which devices like electrodes can be brought to access biomedical signals.  Microneedles offer several advantages over traditional methods of drug administration. They bypass gastrointestinal digestion, allowing drugs to be directly absorbed into the bloodstream through the skin. This approach also accelerates drug absorption, extends its effective duration in the body, and enables patients to self-administer medication without requiring medical professionals.  In terms of biosensing, microneedles provide a means for continuous monitoring of biomarkers in interstitial fluid. This offers potential advancements in non-invasive sensing techniques for various health conditions.  The introduction then describes what a typical microneedle looks like—a microscale needle shaped like a cone or pyramid attached to a patch that adheres to the skin's surface. It mentions that while transdermal delivery via microneedles was proposed by Zhao et al., it was not until the 1990s that mass production became feasible due to limitations in micromachining technology.  Furthermore, this passage highlights different types of microneedles—solid, coated, soluble, and hollow—as well as various materials used for their construction: silicon (particularly mentioned), metals biomaterials (e.g., polymers). A wide range of fabrication methods has been explored including photolithography with selective etching; machining with chemical etching or micro-milling; laser cutting; 3D printing; soft lithography; micro-injection molding; hot embossing; electrohydrodynamic atomization; laser machining, electric-discharge machining with laser machining, drawing lithography, centrifugal lithography, and droplet-borne air blowing.  The article then specifies its focus on recent advancements in materials, fabrication methods, and biomedical applications of microneedles. It notes that many existing reviews primarily concentrate on drug delivery while neglecting other aspects such as biosensing and body fluid extraction. The painless nature and minimally invasive characteristics of microneedles have attracted attention in the field of biosensors for detecting biomarkers in human tissue fluid. Additionally, it mentions that there is a dearth of literature examining the fabrication methods used to construct microneedles.  In conclusion, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the importance and potential applications of microneedles in biomedical research. It highlights their advantages over traditional drug delivery methods while emphasizing their role in biosensing and body fluid extraction. Furthermore, it notes the variety of materials used for constructing microneedles as well as the numerous fabrication techniques employed to produce these devices. This particular article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the recent progress in the field of microneedles. It focuses on three main areas: materials, fabrication methods, and biomedical applications. The authors highlight that while previous reviews predominantly covered drug delivery applications, this review aims to encompass a broader range of topics such as biosensing and body fluid extraction.  One significant aspect addressed in this review is the selection of materials for constructing microneedles. While silicon is mentioned as a commonly used material, other options include metals, biomaterials, and polymers. The choice of material depends on factors such as biocompatibility, mechanical strength, and ease of fabrication. By summarizing various material options in this article, readers can gain insights into the pros and cons associated with each choice.  Another critical aspect explored within this review is the wide array of fabrication methods employed for producing microneedles. These methods involve advanced techniques like photolithography with selective etching or machining with chemical etching or micro-milling. Other innovative approaches such as 3D printing or soft lithography are also noted. By discussing these different fabrication methods comprehensively, readers can understand both current practices and potential future directions for producing microneedles.  The article goes beyond mere exploration of materials and fabrication methods by delving into different biomedical applications where microneedles have proven useful.  Firstly, it highlights drug delivery as one major application area for microneedles. With advantages like bypassing gastrointestinal digestion and enabling self-administration by patients without medical supervision, microneedle-based drug delivery systems offer promising alternatives to conventional routes like oral administration or injections.  Biosensing emerges as another area where microneedle technology has demonstrated its potential for innovation. Due to their minimally invasive nature when penetrating tissue fluids through microchannels created on skin surfaces by these needles, they provide unique opportunities for continuous monitoring of biomarkers present in interstitial fluid. This can have significant implications for diagnosing and managing various medical conditions.  Additionally, this review emphasizes the use of microneedles for body fluid extraction. By integrating microchannels into the skin using these needles, it becomes possible to extract specific fluids like blood or interstitial fluid without causing significant pain or discomfort to the patient. This application area holds promise for various diagnostic and monitoring purposes.  The article acknowledges that while existing reviews have provided insights into different aspects of microneedle technology, limitations in literature coverage persist. There is a scarcity of research regarding fabrication methods and discussions about the challenges associated with producing microneedles with high precision structures. However, this study aims to bridge such gaps by summarizing existing processing technologies comprehensively.  Overall, this PubMed article provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in materials, fabrication methods, and biomedical applications related to microneedles. By uncovering new possibilities offered by this technology and addressing areas that require further exploration, it serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested in advancing the field of microneedle-based biomedical devices.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), highlighting its global impact and severity as a deadly infectious disease. It mentions that MTB primarily attacks the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. TB is described as the 13th leading cause of death worldwide, following only HIV/AIDS.  The introduction emphasizes the scale of the problem, citing that approximately one-third of the global population is affected by TB, with an estimated 10 million new cases reported in 2020 alone. The disease affects people across all age groups and poses a significant threat if left untreated. The emergence of drug-resistant strains further complicates treatment options, making it difficult to combat TB effectively.  One major challenge in controlling TB is the lack of rapid and accurate diagnostic methods. The current available methods mentioned include smear microscopy (acid-fast staining), culture-based techniques, nucleic acid amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). While some techniques are sensitive, they have limitations such as being time-consuming or requiring sophisticated equipment.  The introduction then highlights LAMP as a promising alternative for rapid nucleic acid amplification with simpler operation requirements compared to other methods like PCR. LAMP has been widely adopted for pathogen detection including SARS CoV-2. In fact, it has been endorsed by WHO as a replacement for smear microscopy in peripheral settings for TB diagnosis.  To address the need for better diagnostics and achieve global elimination of TB, this study aims to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on LAMP's diagnostic accuracy in detecting mycobacteria. It acknowledges that while previous studies have demonstrated its efficacy over the last decade, there is currently no updated version available. Furthermore, many studies focused solely on pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB and did not cover other Mycobacterium species.  The authors intend to evaluate LAMP's diagnostic performance by analyzing its sensitivity and specificity against different reference methods, target genes, and detection techniques. The goal is to determine the diagnostic efficiency of LAMP as a tool for mycobacteria detection specifically in low-resource settings where conventional methods may be impractical.  In summary, this introduction provides background information on the global impact of TB caused by MTB. It highlights the challenges in TB diagnosis and introduces LAMP as a potentially advantageous alternative for improved diagnostics. The study aims to fill existing gaps in knowledge by evaluating LAMP's diagnostic accuracy across various parameters with the ultimate aim of addressing TB diagnosis burden in resource-limited settings. In addition to the introduction provided, this PubMed article emphasizes the need for an efficient, reproducible, and cost-effective diagnostic tool for TB that requires minimal infrastructure. The authors propose LAMP as a potential solution to meet these requirements.  LAMP stands for loop-mediated isothermal amplification, which is a DNA amplification method that can amplify minute quantities of DNA within a shorter period of time. Compared to other nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, LAMP offers several advantages. It operates under isothermal conditions, meaning it does not require sophisticated thermal cycling equipment like PCR machines. This makes LAMP more suitable for low-resource regions with limited laboratory infrastructure.  The article also highlights previous research indicating that LAMP-based detection methods have shown higher sensitivity compared to the GeneXpert assay. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed LAMP as a replacement for smear microscopy in peripheral settings for TB diagnosis.  To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of LAMP in detecting mycobacteria, the authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. They collected relevant studies from various databases and analyzed pooled data to assess sensitivity and specificity of LAMP against different reference methods.  They also explored factors such as target genes and detection methods used in conjunction with LAMP technology to determine its diagnostic efficiency. By considering these variables, they aimed to provide an up-to-date assessment of the performance of LAMP not only for TB detection but also for addressing other Mycobacterium spp., expanding beyond strictly pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB studies.  The ultimate goal was to evaluate how well LAMP performed as a tool specifically suited to low-resource settings burdened by high rates of TB infection. By assessing its diagnostic potency in detecting mycobacteria effectively and accurately with minimal requirements on infrastructure or resources available at hand, they hoped their findings would contribute towards efforts in achieving global elimination of TB.  In conclusion, this PubMed article presents an introduction that outlines the global impact of TB and the limitations of current diagnostic methods. It highlights the potential benefits of LAMP as a rapid and cost-effective alternative, particularly in low-resource settings. The authors describe their aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy of LAMP using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach, which would provide valuable insights into its performance for detecting mycobacteria. Ultimately, this work aims to aid in addressing the challenges associated with TB diagnosis and contribute towards achieving global elimination of the disease.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the drug metformin and its versatile utility. Metformin, also known as 1, 1-dimethyl biguanide (MF), is a widely used orally administered anti-hyperglycemic drug for lowering blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The article mentions that it is considered the preferred first-line drug for managing high glucose levels in T2DM patients.  The history of metformin can be traced back to its extraction from the French lilac plant, Galega officinalis. In medieval times, this plant extract was used to decrease blood sugar and relieve symptoms associated with T2DM. Guanidine was later discovered as an active ingredient in Galega officinalis that lowers blood glucose levels. However, other guanide-derived drugs overshadowed metformin initially due to their perceived effectiveness in treating T2DM. These medications eventually fell out of favor because of their high toxicity, leading to metformin becoming the gold standard drug for managing high glucose levels due to its benign and nontoxic properties.  Metformin received approval for treating hyperglycemia in different countries at various times, starting from the United Kingdom in 1958 and followed by Canada in 1972 and the United States in 1995. It has become the most prescribed drug worldwide for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus with more than 120 million people using it.  The molecular structure of metformin is illustrated in Figure 1 included within the article. The mechanisms through which it acts are discussed next - primarily through inhibiting gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose) by liver cells through inhibition of intracellular binding of calcium within hepatocyte mitochondria.  In addition to its antidiabetic effects, metformin exhibits several other beneficial effects such as being antilipidemic (lowering lipid levels), hepatoprotective (protecting the liver), anti-neoplastic (inhibiting tumor growth), cardioprotective (protecting the heart) and anti-obesity effects.  The article also highlights other applications of metformin, including its use in managing acne, hirsutism, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. It is also recognized as a chemo-preventive agent for neoplastic conditions.  The pharmacokinetics of metformin are discussed briefly. After oral administration, metformin is slowly absorbed from the small intestine. Approximately half of the administered dose reaches systemic circulation (bioavailability), and its plasma half-life ranges from 1.5 to 4 hours. A significant portion of the drug is excreted in urine within 24 hours after consumption.  Metformin's effects during pregnancy are influenced by changes in glomerular filtration rate, leading to lower plasma concentrations compared to non-pregnant women. However, it can cross the placenta with fetal concentrations generally being lower than maternal concentrations.  The mechanisms through which metformin exerts its various effects are described next within this introduction section. It decreases appetite and increases secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) resulting in decreased carbohydrate absorption after meals and inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Metformin enhances glucose transport in skeletal muscle stimulated by insulin, increasing skeletal muscle glucose disposal. It also affects lipid metabolism by increasing free fatty acid esterification while inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissue.  Metformin has indirect antineoplastic effects by reducing insulin resistance and levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Moreover, it has both AMPK-associated and AMPK-independent cellular pathways that directly inhibit tumor growth. Beneficial cardioprotective effects arise from long-term use of metformin resulting in weight loss and an improved lipid profile.  Recent research has indicated that metformin may also influence bone metabolism, affecting both osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation by stimulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) while decreasing receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) expression.  The introduction concludes by highlighting the mode of action of metformin relevant to dentistry, including its effects on enhancing osteogenesis and angiogenesis, influencing the AMPK pathway, acting in a concentration-dependent manner, and discussing its potential clinical applications.  Overall, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of metformin's history, uses, pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action in various body systems or conditions as well as its potential benefits.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of the current state of glioblastoma (GBM) research and treatment. The first paragraph establishes GBM as the most common malignant primary central nervous system tumor in the United States, with low survival rates despite standard treatments. It highlights the need for novel therapies to target the unique characteristics and immune resistance of GBM.  The second paragraph discusses recent clinical trials that have shown moderate improvement in overall survival using a multimodal approach, combining tumor-treating fields with chemotherapy. It also mentions targeted immune therapies, such as signaling pathway inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, which have been successful in treating hematologic malignancies but have not yet translated to GBM.  The subsequent paragraphs mention specific immune strategies that have been attempted in GBM but have had limited success so far. Immune checkpoint inhibitors and single/multi-epitope peptide vaccines have not significantly impacted survival, although a surviving long peptide vaccine has shown promise in early phase trials for recurrent GBM. A personalized dendritic cell vaccine has also demonstrated modest improvements in survival.  The lack of widespread success in immunotherapies for GBM is attributed to intrinsic and adaptive factors that contribute to its immunosuppressive properties. These include intratumoral heterogeneity, T-cell dysfunction, sequestering of T-cells within the bone marrow by tumors, specificities of the central nervous system microenvironment, plasticity of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs), selection of resistant tumor populations, effects of concurrent steroid treatments on immunotherapy efficacy, and adaptive genomic and epigenomic changes in recurrent GBM.  Finally, it is mentioned that this paper will discuss recent advancements in understanding these intrinsic and adaptive factors contributing to immunotherapy resistance within GBM. It also highlights engineered medicines targeting specific molecules involved in this resistance process (such as CD47 or CSF1R inhibitors) as well as non-engineered medicines that have the potential to overcome these obstacles and improve prognosis for GBM patients.  Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the need to explore new approaches to treating GBM by understanding its immune resistance mechanisms and highlights various strategies that have been attempted thus far. It provides a background for the rest of the paper, which will delve into recent advancements and potential solutions in more detail. In the subsequent sections of the paper, the authors will delve into the recent advancements and potential solutions in overcoming immune resistance in GBM. They will discuss engineered medicines, such as CD47, CSF1R, CD73, COX2, CCL2, IL6, and GITR inhibitors. These molecules have been identified as promising targets for immunotherapy in GBM due to their involvement in regulating immune responses and tumor progression.  CD47 inhibitors aim to block a signaling pathway that allows tumor cells to evade phagocytosis by macrophages. By inhibiting CD47 activity, these agents promote the recognition and elimination of tumor cells by the immune system. CSF1R inhibitors target a receptor necessary for monocyte survival and differentiation into immunosuppressive macrophages within GBM tumors. Inhibiting CSF1R reduces the population of these immune cells that contribute to immunosuppression.  CD73 is an enzyme involved in adenosine production from extracellular ATP. Adenosine suppresses anti-tumor immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Inhibiting CD73 can enhance T-cell-mediated anti-tumor activity within GBM tumors by reducing adenosine levels.  COX2 is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis and is upregulated in many types of cancer including GBM. Prostaglandins can suppress anti-tumor immunity through various mechanisms including inhibition of T-cell function and promoting regulatory T-cell accumulation. Targeting COX2 with inhibitors can potentially reverse this immunosuppressive effect.  CCL2 is a chemokine involved in recruiting monocytes/macrophages to tumors where they can exert immunosuppressive effects. Blocking CCL2 receptor signaling has shown promise as a way to disrupt this recruitment process which may help overcome immunosuppression within GBM.  IL6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic effects on different cell types, including immune cells. Elevated levels of IL6 have been associated with immunosuppression and poor prognosis in GBM patients. Inhibiting IL6 signaling can potentially alleviate immunosuppression and enhance anti-tumor immune responses.  GITR (glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor) is a regulatory receptor expressed on various immune cell types, including T cells and regulatory T cells. Targeting GITR has shown potential to enhance anti-tumor T-cell responses by modulating the balance between effector and regulatory T cells.  The authors will discuss the mechanistic rationale behind each of these targets as well as the results from preclinical studies or early-phase clinical trials. They will also evaluate the challenges and limitations associated with targeting these molecules in GBM treatment.  Furthermore, non-engineered medicines will be explored in terms of their potential to overcome immunotherapy resistance in GBM. These may include conventional chemotherapeutic agents that exhibit immunomodulatory effects or repurposed drugs originally developed for other indications but found to have off-target effects on immune system regulation or tumor immunity.  By examining both engineered medicines targeting specific molecules as well as non-engineered options, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current advancements in understanding and addressing immune resistance within GBM. The hope is that these insights may lead to improved treatment strategies that can ultimately improve prognosis for GBM patients who face limited options for disease management at present.",explain
"This PubMed article provides an introduction to a study that focuses on neck pain, which is a common and challenging disorder to diagnose and treat. The prevalence of neck pain is increasing globally, with estimates suggesting that 22-70% of the general population will experience this condition at some point in their lives. Chronic mechanical neck pain (CMNP) can range from mild discomfort to complete disability, leading to negative impacts on both socio-economic factors and overall health.  Various risk factors have been identified for the development of CMNP, including a long history of neck pain, poor quality of life, less vitality, being female, prior history of neck pain or low back pain, high job demands, smoking history, and low social/work support. To classify patients with neck pain based on functional capabilities and limitations in line with the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF), clinical practice guidelines define four categories: neck pain with mobility deficits; associated headache; movement coordination deficits; and radiated upper extremity pain.  In terms of diagnosis for patients under 12 weeks' duration with symptoms isolated to their necks and limited cervical range of motion (ROM), there is strong evidence supporting the identification as ""neck pain with mobility deficits."" The revised clinical practice guidelines also categorize patients presenting symptoms such as central or unilateral neck pain along with limitations in cervical ROM as having ""neck pain with mobility deficits."" These individuals may also experience familiar symptom reproduction during diagnostic tests or associated referred shoulder or upper extremity pains.  College students are identified as being at risk for developing CMNP due to extended periods spent studying in front of computer screens. Sustained postures coupled with abnormal cervical spine mechanics can contribute to this risk while tenderness upon palpation may indicate its presence. Additional examination findings include limited cervical ROM accompanied by reproduced end-of-range active and passive ROM-related symptoms along with restricted segmental mobility in the thoracic region. Patients may also present with pain in the scapular/thoracic segments and exhibit strength deficits.  Two treatment techniques, instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) and myofascial release therapy (MRT), are discussed in the context of their potential benefits for college students with CMNP. IASTM involves applying adapted pressure to tight structures using stainless-steel tools with beveled edges. Although there is empirical evidence supporting its use, its effects specifically on individuals with CMNP have not been thoroughly investigated. Similarly, MRT focuses on restoring normal length to tight structures to decrease pain and improve function, which may be effective for individuals presenting myofascial trigger points associated with neck pain.  Considering the research gap regarding IASTM and MRT in college students with CMNP, this study aims to evaluate their effects. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant changes, including distance learning for college students resulting in increased computer usage and potential exacerbation of neck pain. Thus, the researchers seek to compare the impact of IASTM and MRT on pain reduction, improvement in function, and changes in pressure pain threshold among these individuals. Their hypothesis is that there will be no statistically significant difference between the two treatment techniques.  In conclusion, this introductory section provides an overview of neck pain as a prevalent disorder that poses diagnostic challenges while also carrying negative socio-economic consequences. It highlights risk factors for CMNP development along with classification systems based on functional capabilities within current clinical guidelines. Finally, it sets up the research objective by emphasizing the scarcity of evidence regarding IASTM and MRT treatments for college students experiencing CMNP during distance learning due to COVID-19 restrictions.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of the topic being discussed in the PubMed article. It starts by highlighting the unique nature of healthcare organizations, where services provided involve varying levels of risks to patients. It acknowledges that this puts a significant amount of pressure on healthcare professionals, staff, administrators, boards, and policymakers.  The introduction then brings attention to the global COVID-19 pandemic as an event that has emphasized the fragility and stress experienced by healthcare systems and staff worldwide. This sets the stage for discussing the critical role of communication and information sharing in improving patient safety and addressing organizational problems.  The article mentions that past inquiries into failings of care have shown several concerning factors: (a) voiced concerns by staff are often ignored until a crisis point is reached; (b) professionals with high calling intensity may remain silent on critical issues due to psychological contracts that encourage presenteeism; (c) whistleblowing is still considered necessary to address unresolved systemic and organizational problems. It also highlights how silence in healthcare can lead to concealing errors and compromising patient safety.  Next, definitions of employee voice and employee silence are introduced. Morrison's definition describes employee voice as informal communication aimed at improving work-related issues, while LePine and Van Dyne define it as speaking out with intent to challenge the status quo for improvement. Employee silence is defined as intentionally withholding genuine expression about organizational conditions or critical work-related information from colleagues or superiors.  The article notes that there is ambiguity surrounding these terms in healthcare settings, especially when discussing patient safety advocacy or concealing information related to patient safety. The relationship between employee voice/silence, organizational culture/behavior in healthcare settings, and professional culture/identity is explored.  Difficulties arise when trying to operationalize voice/silence definitions because they involve discretionary behaviors shaped by various factors. In healthcare contexts where concerns about patient safety are common topics for discussion or withholding information can have ethical implications if related to medical errors, the discretionary nature of voice/silence can be misleading.  The introduction also touches on the idea that employee silence and employee voice may be distinct concepts with different antecedents. It suggests that employees can exhibit both silence and voice depending on the situation or issue at hand. The conflict of interest between protecting patient interests while considering healthcare professionals and organizations is mentioned.  Furthermore, the article highlights that speaking-up in healthcare is often met with negative consequences for employees, contributing to a culture of silence. It mentions empirical evidence linking employee silence to negative outcomes like burnout. The Job Demands-Control Model, Job Demands-Resources Model, and Conservation of Resources Model are introduced as theoretical frameworks that can help understand employee voice behaviors in healthcare organizations and their impact on employee well-being.  Overall, this introduction sets up the context for discussing communication behaviors within healthcare organizations, emphasizing the importance of addressing both employee voice and silence when it comes to improving patient safety and well-being. The article pivots to focus on the concept of burnout and its relationship to employee voice and silence in healthcare organizations. It mentions that the Job Demands-Control Model (JD-C), the Job Demands-Resources Model (JD-R), and the Conservation of Resources Model (COR) can provide valuable insights into understanding these behaviors and their link to employee outcomes.  The JD-C model considers burnout as a result of a mismatch between job demands and employees' control over their work. In this context, employee silence may be seen as evidence of this mismatch, while employee voice may indicate a better fit between demands and resources. This suggests that having a voice in decision-making processes can contribute to reducing burnout in healthcare professionals.  The JD-R model focuses on job resources that help individuals cope with job demands, and it suggests that employees who feel empowered to speak up about concerns are more likely to have access to necessary resources, leading to improved well-being.  The COR model emphasizes individuals' drive to obtain, retain, foster, and protect valued resources. It suggests that when employees' resources are depleted or threatened, they may be less likely to engage in voice behaviors due to concerns about further resource loss or negative consequences.  By applying these theoretical frameworks specifically within healthcare settings, the article aims to shed light on how employee voices are influenced by organizational factors such as culture and behavior. It also highlights potential conflicts of interest arising from patient advocacy versus protecting professional interests or organizational reputations.  Additionally, the article questions how exactly voice/silence should be operationalized within healthcare contexts given their unique nature. The content of what is being voiced or withheld is crucial because issues related to patient safety have ethical, moral, and legal dimensions which can complicate our understanding of discretionary behaviors in healthcare settings.  In conclusion, this PubMed article introduces the importance of communication behaviors within healthcare organizations with regards specifically focusing on employee voice and silence. It explores definitions; discusses challenges in operationalizing these concepts in the healthcare context; highlights the negative consequences of silence and its impact on employee well-being; and introduces theoretical models that can enhance our understanding of the relationship between voice/silence, burnout, and employee outcomes. By addressing these issues, the article aims to contribute to improving communication efficacy and ultimately patient safety within healthcare organizations.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the current state of lung cancer treatment and highlights the challenges faced by patients after surgery. It begins by emphasizing the significant impact of lung cancer as one of the most common cancers with high incidence and mortality rates. The authors mention that standard treatment involves surgery followed by postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  However, they acknowledge that many lung cancer patients experience a decline in their quality of life after leaving the hospital. This deterioration is attributed to several factors, such as cardiopulmonary dysfunction, negative psychology, adverse reactions to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which can affect prognosis and even shorten survival. Chemotherapy itself may lead to various hazardous effects, causing long-term pain and psychological stress for patients.  In light of these challenges, it is crucial to enhance nursing interventions during chemotherapy to prevent patients from being trapped in a cycle of treatment. Many studies have indicated that additional assistance and care are needed for lung cancer patients once they are discharged from the hospital. The authors argue for high-quality and efficient ongoing care to ensure better quality of life for these patients.  The introduction then switches focus towards surgical resection as the most effective method for treating early-stage lung cancer. Different types of surgical procedures are briefly described: thoracoscopic surgery (both multi-hole and single-port), which has been reported to minimize complications, improve postoperative quality of life, reduce discomfort, enhance lung function recovery, shorten hospital stay duration, and expedite patient's return to normal life.  Thereafter follows a historical perspective on video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) in treating early non-small cell lung cancer since its first lobectomy procedure performed in the 1990s. Previous studies have demonstrated several advantages associated with VATS compared to traditional thoracotomy lobectomy; these include shorter hospital stays, enhanced recovery outcomes with decreased perioperative complications and improved long-term survival rate for selected patients.  The introduction also mentions how thoracoscopic surgery has evolved from multiple-incision to double-incision, and finally to single-incision thoracoscopic surgery (single-port). Table 1 provides an overview of the various alternatives for lung cancer treatment.  The authors briefly mention enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) as a concept proposed in the 1990s, which aims to optimize clinical pathways through evidence-based medicine. ERAS focuses on reducing stress, shortening hospital stays, and promoting early organ function recovery and has been progressively expanding along with perioperative nursing measures.  However, while there have been advancements in pre- and post-operative care under ERAS, few studies have looked specifically at intraoperative nursing measures that can promote rapid postoperative recovery. Hence, the article intends to fill this research gap by examining the latest developments in intraoperative nursing related to rapid postoperative recovery. The ultimate goal is to facilitate early patient recovery after surgery and reduce complications.  In summary, this introduction provides context for lung cancer treatment approaches by highlighting existing challenges faced by patients after surgery and underscoring the need for enhanced nursing interventions. It also introduces different surgical methods used in treating early-stage lung cancer along with their associated benefits. Finally, it sets out an objective of exploring intraoperative nursing strategies that can expedite patient recovery.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by acknowledging that the use of palliative anticancer drugs can have varying effects on patients with incurable cancer. Some studies suggest that these drugs can prolong survival and alleviate symptoms, while others indicate minimal impact on life expectancy and an unclear relationship with quality of life. The potential benefits of using these drugs in terminally ill cancer patients are disputed due to concerns about their impact on patients' quality of life and survival, as well as the significant costs associated with cancer therapy.  The article notes a growing number of publications claiming that near the end of life, anticancer treatment is associated with lower quality of life and does not improve survival. It defines ""end-of-life"" as the final days, weeks, or months when death is imminent and cannot be prevented medically.  According to various references cited in the introduction, the use of anticancer drugs at the end of life is prevalent worldwide and increasing in some countries. For instance, a study conducted in Korea reported a rise in chemotherapy use during the last month before death from 25.7% in 2000 to 44.2% in 2010. Similarly, studies from the USA indicate an increase in chemotherapy within two weeks before death between 1993-1996.  The introduction suggests that these trends might be influenced by advancements in oncology treatments such as immunotherapy and targeted therapies which have expanded treatment options for patients nearing their end-of-life stage.  Furthermore, the introduction highlights differences observed across publications regarding resource utilization among end-of-life cancer patients. These disparities are particularly evident when defining study populations; population-based studies analyzing all cancer patients regardless of previous treatments or stage report lower frequencies of end-of-life cancer treatment compared to research studies focusing on advanced cancer or previous treatment recipients.  The overall goal outlined for this article is to explore methods used by different studies related to end-of-life cancer treatment outcomes while also describing its current magnitude at this stage. The authors propose a scoping review approach, stating that it allows for identifying knowledge gaps, clarifying concepts, and providing a comprehensive overview of the current status of anticancer treatment at end-of-life. This method aims to compare various studies' methods and outcomes to understand differences in order to inform decision-making and set future research agendas.  In conclusion, the introduction highlights the conflicting findings surrounding palliative anticancer drug use at end-of-life. It emphasizes the need for a scoping review to outline the current understanding of this topic, identify areas for further investigation, and inform future systematic reviews or primary research studies. In addition to setting the overall goal of the article, the introduction also explains why a scoping review approach is chosen. It clarifies that a scoping review is particularly useful for mapping existing literature in a specific field, enabling researchers to compare the methods and outcomes used across different studies.  By conducting a scoping review on anticancer treatment at end-of-life, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current magnitude of such treatment, highlighting variations in methods and outcomes among studies. This information can be valuable for decision-making processes within healthcare systems and can help set research agendas by identifying areas that require further investigation.  The authors highlight that understanding patterns and discrepancies in end-of-life anticancer treatment utilization is crucial not only for clinical practitioners but also for policymakers. It can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about patient care and optimizing resource allocation in terminally ill cancer patients. Moreover, it has implications for developing guidelines or protocols regarding end-of-life care within oncology practices.  By examining the existing literature on this topic through a scoping review approach, this article seeks to fill knowledge gaps and clarify conceptual inconsistencies surrounding anticancer treatment at end-of-life. This will contribute to an enhanced understanding of when, how, and why these treatments are administered during this phase.  Furthermore, insights gained from this study could inform future systematic reviews or primary research focusing on specific aspects identified as requiring deeper investigation. It will not only benefit researchers but also support evidence-based practice by providing more guidance on optimal clinical decision-making regarding cancer therapy options near the end of life.  The introduction concludes by emphasizing that advancing knowledge in this area has relevance beyond medical academia—clinicians need accurate information to provide effective patient care while considering quality of life aspects during terminal stages of cancer management.  Overall, the introduction efficiently sets up the context for studying anticancer treatment at end-of-life by summarizing contrasting findings from previous studies. It establishes gaps in current knowledge while outlining objectives related to conducting a scoping review, thus providing a clear roadmap for the rest of the article.",explain
"In the past two decades, significant global changes have occurred due to urbanization, economic growth, and population aging. This has resulted in a rapid epidemiological transformation whereby infectious diseases have been largely replaced by cardiovascular diseases as the leading cause of death. However, one crucial risk factor related to cardiovascular disease that is often overlooked is dyslipidemia.  Abnormal lipid metabolism has been found to be positively correlated with an increased risk of various conditions such as atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, and osteoporosis. Additionally, excessive lipid accumulation has been associated with other diseases including diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/hepatitis. Furthermore, abnormal lipid metabolism has also been linked to pituitary dysfunction, testosterone deficiency, hypothyroidism and plays a role in regulating tumor biology.  Energy metabolism alterations are considered indicators of cancer and are important targets for cancer treatment. The uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells requires efficient energy sources. Consequently, lipid metabolism becomes over-activated in order to meet the high energy demands of cancer cells throughout tumorigenesis and progression. Understanding the mechanisms underlying abnormal lipid metabolism in tumors can provide valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies.  Lipid metabolism pathways play crucial roles in numerous metabolic processes within the body. Lipids encompass a diverse group of water-insoluble molecules such as triacylglycerides (principal component of triacylglycerol ester), phosphoglycerides (structural components of biofilms), sterols, spatholipids (important second messengers and hormones). Changes in lipid metabolism can significantly impact biofilm stability and are associated with tumor aggressiveness.  Research from as early as 1953 demonstrated that tumor tissues could synthesize lipids similar to embryonic tissues. Today there is increasing evidence suggesting that specific changes occur within different aspects of lipid metabolism in cancer cells which contribute to tumor progression (Figure 1). This review aims to highlight the current research on abnormal lipid metabolism in tumors and the potential role of drugs targeting lipid metabolism, specifically cholesterol, triglycerides, and sphingolipids.  Cholesterol metabolism enhancement supports cancer progression through various mechanisms: increased cholesterol biosynthesis, heightened uptake of exogenous cholesterol by LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor), augmented cholesterol esterification by ACAT1 (acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1), and amplified production of hydroxysterols. Intrinsic drivers of carcinogenesis include activating oncogenic genes such as MYC that subsequently promote mevalonate pathway gene expression leading to increased miR-33b expression. Another factor is the absence of p53-mediated inhibition of the mevalonate pathway facilitated by reliance on target ABCA1. Additionally, SQLE activates Akt via PTEN inhibition resulting in cholesterol ester accumulation.  In summary, this article presents a comprehensive overview of abnormal lipid metabolism in tumors and its association with tumor progression. It emphasizes the importance of key players like cholesterol, triglycerides, and sphingolipids in tumor biology. Understanding the intricate relationship between lipid metabolism and cancer may provide valuable insights for developing new therapeutic approaches targeting these pathways. This article further delves into the role of abnormal lipid metabolism in tumor progression, specifically focusing on cholesterol, triglycerides, and sphingolipids.  In tumor cells, cholesterol metabolism is often enhanced to support the growth and progression of cancer. The four main aspects through which cholesterol promotes carcinogenesis are as follows:  1. Enhanced Cholesterol Biosynthesis: Cancer cells exhibit increased synthesis of cholesterol, contributing to their growth and survival. This is achieved by upregulating key enzymes involved in the mevalonate pathway, a critical pathway for cholesterol production.  2. Increased Exogenous Cholesterol Uptake: Tumor cells can also acquire cholesterol from their environment by upregulating the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which facilitates the uptake of LDL-cholesterol. This uptake provides an additional source of cholesterol for tumor cell proliferation.  3. Elevated Cholesterol Esterification: Within cancer cells, there is an increased conversion of free cholesterol to its esterified form through the action of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1). This esterification process facilitates storage and utilization of excess cellular cholesterol for various tumorigenic processes.  4. Increased Production of Hydroxysterols: Certain tumors produce elevated levels of hydroxysterols derived from enzymatic reactions involving cytochrome P450 enzymes or sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27). These hydroxysterols promote cancer cell proliferation and migration.  Several intrinsic factors drive these aberrations in cholesterol metabolism during carcinogenesis:  a) Activation of Carcinogenic Genes such as MYC: Activation of oncogenic genes such as MYC leads to upregulation not only in mevalonate pathway genes but also miR-33b expression. MiR-33b further enhances MYC expression through positive feedback loops, exacerbating dysregulated lipid metabolism in cancer cells.  b) Inhibition of p53-Mediated Mevalonate Pathway Suppression: The tumor suppressor protein, p53, usually suppresses the mevalonate pathway as a protective mechanism. However, certain tumors rely on target ABCA1 for their growth and survival, resulting in an absence of p53-mediated inhibition and continued activation of the mevalonate pathway.  c) SQLE-Mediated Akt Activation: Squalene epoxidase (SQLE), an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, can activate the Akt signaling pathway by inhibiting PTEN expression. This Akt activation leads to further cholesterol ester accumulation within cancer cells.  Understanding these mechanisms provides important insights into potential therapeutic avenues. Targeting abnormal lipid metabolism may offer promising approaches for treating tumors. Researchers have identified various molecular targets within these pathways that could be exploited for therapeutic intervention.  This comprehensive review also highlights triglycerides and sphingolipids as critical players in tumor biology. Abnormalities in triglyceride metabolism have been linked to tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance. Sphingolipids play crucial roles as signaling molecules and are associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and inflammation—all processes involved in tumorigenesis. Alterations in sphingolipid metabolism can affect tumor microenvironments and impact disease progression.  In conclusion, this PubMed article provides a detailed exploration of abnormal lipid metabolism's role in tumor progression from the perspective of cholesterol, triglycerides, and sphingolipids pathways. Insights gained from studying abnormal lipid metabolism may open new doors for targeted therapies aimed at disrupting dysregulated lipid biology within cancer cells. Importantly, such interventions have the potential to provide novel treatment strategies for effectively combating different types of tumors. ",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of Wilms tumour (also known as nephroblastoma), a malignant kidney tumour that primarily affects children. It starts by providing key statistics about the prevalence and incidence of Wilms tumour, stating that it accounts for 5% of all pediatric cancers and 95% of childhood malignant renal neoplasms. The incidence rate is reported to be 1 in 10,000 children.  The introduction then explains that Wilms tumour is caused by abnormal kidney development during the embryonic stage, specifically during mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) at the beginning of nephrogenesis. It typically affects children aged 0–4 years, with a median diagnostic age between 3 and 4 years. The tumor can be unilateral or affect both kidneys (synchronous bilateral or multifocal tumors).  Furthermore, it highlights that the majority (98-99%) of Wilms tumor cases are sporadic, while only a small percentage (1-2%) are familial. Metastatic forms are observed in approximately 12% of cases and usually affect the lungs or liver.  The introduction also mentions that up to 20% of Wilms tumors may be discovered incidentally during routine check-up visits since they can grow large without manifesting specific symptoms. However, typical signs include a palpable hard abdominal mass or swelling accompanied by symptoms such as abdominal pain, bleeding in urine, hypertension, fever, and vomiting.  Medical imaging techniques like ultrasound followed by three-dimensional imaging using CT scan or MRI help establish the diagnosis and determine important factors such as tumor location within/outside the kidney as well as staging purposes.  From there, the introduction goes on to describe the histopathological types of Wilms tumor based on prognosis - favorable (>90% cases) and unfavorable (6-10%). Anaplastic and sarcomatous variants are considered unfavorable types associated with poor clinical outcomes.  The article then explains the treatment protocols used for Wilms tumor, specifically mentioning the North American NWTS protocol and the European SIOP protocol. In Morocco and many parts of Europe, the SIOP protocol is implemented, involving preoperative chemotherapy followed by total nephrectomy, often combined with post-operative radiation therapy depending on tumor stage and histology.  Next, it introduces microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short RNA molecules involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. The introduction gives a brief description of miRNAs as highly conserved non-coding RNA molecules that bind to messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to their degradation or inhibition of protein translation. MiRNA expression profiles have shown potential as tools for classifying cancerous and normal tissues, disease monitoring, and assessing response to therapy.  The role of miRNAs in cancer varies depending on whether they target oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Different expression profiles of miRNAs can act as either oncomirs or suppressor-miRs based on specific tissue and cancer types. Furthermore, alterations in miRNA expression levels have been implicated in many diseases beyond cancer due to their regulatory roles in cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and cell differentiation.  Considering this context, the introduction highlights potential applications of miRNA-based therapeutics in terms of diagnosis/prognosis or identification of therapeutic targets for various diseases including pediatric cancers like Wilms tumor. It mentions that despite significant progress in understanding miRNA biology, delivering specific miRNAs to target cells/tissues remains challenging.  The introduction concludes by briefly mentioning promising results from clinical trials investigating the use of miRNAs for cancer treatment purposes. Examples given include studies that demonstrate enhanced chemosensitivity or modulation of drug sensitivity using specific mimetic or antimimetic miRNAs targeting certain genes implicated in breast cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma models.  Overall, this comprehensive introduction provides background information on the prevalence, characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, and potential role of miRNAs in Wilms tumor and highlights the need for further research in this area.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of the topic of interest, which is the comparison between laparoscopic transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) and ultrasound-guided TAPB for postoperative pain control in patients undergoing major colorectal surgeries.   It starts by highlighting that TAPB is commonly used in colorectal surgeries to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption. However, there are controversies surrounding the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic TAPB compared to ultrasound-guided TAPB.  The article then discusses the background context, stating that minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has become recommended for treating colorectal diseases due to its equivalent efficacy and improved functional recovery. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways have also been implemented to shorten hospital stays and reduce costs without compromising surgical outcomes. However, acute postoperative pain remains a common concern within ERAS protocols.  Regular administration of opioids for pain relief is associated with several adverse effects such as postoperative ileus, nausea and vomiting, delayed mobilization, urinary retention, somnolence, and delirium. The article mentions that despite efforts towards opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia techniques, optimal pain management after MIS surgeries still lacks consensus.  Next, it explains what TAPB entails - the injection of a local anesthetic between specific muscles in the abdominal wall to target segmental nerves at a certain level. The use of TAPB during laparoscopic colorectal surgery has already proven effective in reducing opioid consumption.  The ERAS Society Guidelines strongly recommend using TAPB instead of epidural analgesia for colorectal MIS surgery. Both laparoscopic and ultrasound-guided approaches have been developed to improve accuracy while minimizing risks associated with peritoneal penetration.  The article acknowledges that although ultrasonography training among anesthesiologists is common in tertiary referral centers due to its advantages such as dynamic imaging capabilities without radiation exposure or contraindications, it may not be readily available in primary hospitals due to resource constraints. Additionally, even with ultrasound guidance, there is a risk of procedure-related injury.  Laparoscopic TAPB appears to be a potential alternative that minimizes risks associated with peritoneal penetration but may compromise the precise positioning of nerves and tissue planes compared to ultrasound-guided TAPB.  The existing systematic reviews on this topic have focused on comparing TAPB with no-TAPB locoregional analgesia or placebo control in colorectal surgery. However, these reviews have limitations in terms of sample size and their ability to provide conclusive evidence.  Given the controversies surrounding laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB and the lack of high-quality evidence guiding clinical practice, the researchers hypothesize that surgeon-performed laparoscopic TAPB will be non-inferior to anesthesiologist-delivered ultrasound-guided TAPB.  To address this hypothesis and provide more robust evidence for postoperative analgesia in colorectal MIS surgeries, the authors conduct a meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness and safety of these two specific TAPB approaches.  Overall, this introduction sets up the research problem by highlighting current controversies and knowledge gaps regarding pain management techniques in colorectal surgeries. It explains the rationale for investigating laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB and establishes the aim of conducting a meta-analysis to address these gaps. Continuing from the previous explanation, the article highlights the need for high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice in determining whether laparoscopic TAPB is as effective and safe as ultrasound-guided TAPB for postoperative analgesia in colorectal MIS surgeries.  The authors mention that existing systematic reviews on this topic have primarily focused on comparing TAPB with various control groups or no-TAPB locoregional analgesia. However, these reviews have limitations due to small sample sizes and their inability to provide a conclusive consensus.  Given these limitations, the researchers aim to conduct a meta-analysis that specifically focuses on laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB in colorectal MIS surgeries. By integrating both direct and indirect comparisons, they hope to provide a more comprehensive analysis that can guide individualized clinical practice.  The article mentions that previous research has shown favorable outcomes with the use of TAPB in colorectal surgeries. The ERAS Society Guidelines for Perioperative Care in Elective Colorectal Surgery 2018 strongly recommend its use instead of epidural analgesia in these procedures.  In addition, both laparoscopic (Lap-) and ultrasound-guided (US-) approaches have been instrumental in reducing peritoneal penetration risks during TAPB and improving accuracy by aiding visualization of nerves and tissue planes. The authors acknowledge that while ultrasonography is an optimal imaging modality for peripheral nerves, its availability may be limited due to resource constraints at primary hospitals.  Moreover, although laparoscopy minimizes intraperitoneal injection risks associated with peritoneal penetration during Lap-TAPB compared to US-TAPB, precise nerve positioning could be compromised when using this approach.  To address these concerns and uncertainties surrounding laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB techniques, the present study seeks to compare their effectiveness and safety using a meta-analysis approach. This will enable researchers to pool together available evidence and analyze the outcomes of both approaches comprehensively.  The ultimate goal of this research is to provide better guidance for clinicians performing postoperative analgesia in colorectal MIS surgeries. By evaluating the current evidence surrounding laparoscopic and ultrasound-guided TAPB, the authors hope to determine whether either approach is more effective and safer than the other, thus aiding in individualized clinical decision-making.  In conclusion, this PubMed article introduces the context of TAPB as a commonly used technique for postoperative pain control in colorectal surgeries. It highlights controversies regarding laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided approaches and emphasizes that existing systematic reviews have limitations in providing conclusive evidence. The researchers aim to fill these knowledge gaps by conducting a meta-analysis that systematically compares the effectiveness and safety of these specific TAPB approaches.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the significance of diabetes mellitus (DM) as a systemic metabolic disease characterized by high blood sugar levels. The author cites statistics from the International Diabetes Federation to emphasize the increasing prevalence of DM worldwide and its associated negative impacts on patients' health and economic burdens.  The introduction then provides an overview of the different types of DM, namely type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and secondary diabetes resulting from viral infections, cystic fibrosis, and pancreatic cancer. While the etiologies may differ among these types, there is a common understanding that abnormal communications between cells, tissues, and organs contribute to the progression of DM.  Next, the introduction introduces extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are lipid bilayer membrane vesicles secreted by various cells into extracellular space. The author notes that EVs are highly heterogeneous in their characteristics and contain biologically active molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. These features enable EVs to serve as carriers for transmitting signals among cells. In recent years, there has been significant interest in studying EVs due to their critical roles in mediating intercellular communication and involvement in physiological processes.  Furthermore, the introduction highlights several advantages of EVs for therapeutic applications. These include their abundance in sources, low immunogenicity, biocompatibility Continuing from the advantages of EVs, the introduction emphasizes their flexibility to be modified and their ability to cross biological barriers. These characteristics make EVs attractive for use in various disease treatments. The potential of EVs-based therapies has gained attention in recent years.  The introduction then delves into the importance of pancreatic islets in glucose homeostasis. Paul Langerhans' discovery of pancreatic islets and their hormone-producing cells (alpha, beta, delta, pp, and epsilon cells) is mentioned. Among these cell types, beta-cells play a crucial role in controlling blood glucose levels through insulin secretion.  The article highlights that abnormal crosstalk between pancreatic islets and extra-islet tissues mediated by EVs plays an important role in maintaining glucose homeostasis under physiological conditions. However, under pathological conditions like diabetes mellitus (DM), this crosstalk becomes disrupted and contributes to the occurrence and development of DM.  Under normal circumstances, pancreatic beta-cells secrete insulin to lower blood glucose levels by increasing glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Likewise, peripheral tissues can promote insulin secretion and growth of beta-cells through EVs-mediated crosstalk.  However, several mechanisms are discussed where this communication via EVs turns detrimental. In type 1 diabetes (T1DM), autoantigen-containing EVs derived from pancreatic islets target autoimmune cells causing severe autoimmune responses. Moreover, peripheral tissue-derived EVs exert negative impacts on pancreatic islets leading to dysfunction and death of these crucial cells seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Additionally, secondary diabetes resulting from other diseases can also arise due to EV-mediated crosstalk between pancreatic islets and other tissues.  The introduction further mentions that apart from their roles in intercellular communication within DM pathogenesis processes or complications thereof; researchers have also explored using EVs as biomarkers for detecting DM or as therapeutic agents for treatment strategies.  Lastly about the aims of the article, it is stated that this review intends to outline the current knowledge of EVs-mediated intercellular and interorgan crosstalk within pancreatic islets and its significance in regulating systemic metabolism. Furthermore, the authors hope to shed light on potential applications of EVs in diagnosing DM and exploring their therapeutic potential. The objective is to provide a new perspective, contribute to biomarker discovery, and aid in anti-diabetic drug development.  In conclusion, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of diabetes mellitus and highlights the increasing prevalence of DM worldwide. It introduces extracellular vesicles (EVs) as important mediators of intercellular communication within DM pathogenesis processes or complications thereof. The introduction also emphasizes their value as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and their therapeutic applications in treating various forms of diabetes.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the research progress and challenges in treating retinovascular diseases, particularly focusing on retinal artery occlusion (RAO). It highlights the significant investments made in recent years to study and develop treatments for retinovascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and macular diseases like age-related macular degeneration. These efforts have resulted in improved outcomes for patients with these conditions.  However, the same level of success has not been achieved in treating RAO. The introduction explains that there are several reasons for this disparity. One factor is that there are fewer RAO patients compared to other retinovascular diseases. Additionally, many central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) patients come for treatment after the theoretical time limit for neuron survival in the retina.  CRAO is described as an ocular variant of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), sharing similar predispositions and pathogenetic mechanisms. The different types of CRAO are explained based on etiology, permanency of occlusion, and preexisting collateral supply. It is noted that spontaneous improvements in vision occur more frequently in transient NA-CRAO cases compared to other types.  The introduction emphasizes that a significant proportion of CRAO cases result in profound and irreversible loss of vision. Conservative treatment approaches have shown unsatisfactory results compared to natural history outcomes.  The article mentions guidelines provided by organizations like the American Heart Association (AHA), American Stroke Association (ASA), and American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) which provide instructions on managing acute stroke and CRAOs respectively.  Local intra-arterial thrombolysis is acknowledged as a common practice despite its similarity in efficacy with conservative therapy but with higher rates of adverse events. Criticisms regarding study design limitations are also mentioned.  The review then introduces the concept of neuroprotection as an additional strategy alongside existing approaches for NA-CRAO care. It highlights the importance of considering neuroprotection in ocular stroke management and redirects attention to this aspect that is often overshadowed by revascularization techniques.  The article acknowledges the lack of randomized controlled studies providing clear guidelines or recommendations for treatment, stating it as a cause for concern. However, it mentions ongoing clinical trials investigating the use of intravenous thrombolytic agents such as alteplase and Tenecteplase in NA-CRAO patients within specific time frames after symptom onset.  The introduction concludes by emphasizing that despite cases of successful reperfusion without significant vision improvement, issues surrounding retinal survival time play a crucial role in explaining the lack of visual improvement in CRAO cases. It mentions a study by Jusufovic et al., which sheds light on these factors contributing to vision outcomes.  Overall, the introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the research landscape surrounding retinovascular diseases and especially focuses on the challenges faced in treating CRAO. It sets up the rationale for further exploration of neuroprotection as an important aspect of ocular stroke management. Continuing from the previous explanation, the introduction of this PubMed article highlights that outcomes for patients with CRAO have remained unchanged over the past three decades. This lack of progress underscores the need for new approaches and a deeper understanding of effective treatments.  In addressing this need, the article mentions ongoing clinical trials investigating intravenous alteplase and Tenecteplase for treating NA-CRAO. These studies aim to assess the role of treatment within a specific time window after symptom onset. The phase 2 trial (REVISION) and phase 3 trial (THEIA) focus on intravenous alteplase administration less than 4.5 hours after symptom onset in NA-CRAO patients.  Additionally, there is another phase 3 study called TENecteplase in Central Retinal Artery Occlusion Study (TenCRAOS), which investigates the use of intravenous Tenecteplase for CRAO specifically.  The introduction recognizes that reperfusion of the retina can occur in some cases without significant improvement in vision. It explains that issues related to retinal survival time are major factors contributing to this lack of improvement. The concept elaborated by Jusufovic et al., likely explores factors such as ischemic damage threshold and delayed neurotoxicity beyond simple reperfusion.  Despite advancements in research on various aspects of retinovascular diseases, including revascularization techniques, there has been limited attention given to neuroprotection as an important component of ocular stroke management.  The introduction also acknowledges limitations in current knowledge and treatment recommendations due to a lack of randomized controlled studies providing clear guidance on managing CRAO effectively.  Concluding remarks highlight that these ongoing clinical trials investigating intravenous thrombolysis may bridge important gaps in knowledge and provide valuable insights into its efficacy for treating NA-CRAO patients within specific treatment windows.  Overall, this introduction serves multiple purposes: it sets a background by discussing improvements achieved in treating some retinovascular diseases while acknowledging the lack of progress in addressing CRAO. It introduces CRAO as an ocular variant of acute ischemic stroke, explains its classification, and highlights the urgency associated with timely treatment. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for neuroprotection alongside revascularization techniques and acknowledges ongoing clinical trials investigating intravenous thrombolysis as potential game-changers in NA-CRAO treatment outcomes.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the importance of iron in various intracellular activities, highlighting its relevance to stem cells. The authors begin by explaining that iron is necessary for the functioning of different enzymes, such as ribonucleotide reductase, which is involved in DNA synthesis and repair. Iron serves as a cofactor for this enzyme.  Iron's role in mitochondrial respiration is also emphasized. It contributes to the synthesis of important molecules like haem and [Fe-S] clusters, particularly cytochrome c. Cytochrome c not only participates in the electron transport chain but also plays a role in apoptosis.  Another group of enzymes called cytochrome P450 utilizes iron (in the form of haem) as a cofactor. These enzymes are essential for drug metabolism and detoxification within cells.  The enzyme catalase, which possesses haem groups containing iron atoms, is highlighted as an important antioxidant. It converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, thus protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.  The involvement of iron at the cellular level includes its incorporation into hemoglobin during erythrocyte maturation for efficient oxygen transport throughout the body. Iron is also found in myoglobin found in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue.  In terms of stem cell biology, studies have shown that iron plays a role in cancer stem cell maintenance and can inhibit self-renewal of human pluripotent stem cells. Additionally, iron-related proteins impact mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) biology by influencing cellular components, processes, and signaling pathways.  MSCs are highly researched due to their ability to support various physiological processes and exhibit reparative properties. However, challenges exist when it comes to labeling MSCs before transplantation or detecting them non-invasively after transplantation using techniques like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Iron oxide nanoparticles have been explored as enhancers for MSC detection but face various obstacles.  Therefore, the authors emphasize the importance of finding effective and non-toxic approaches to preserve MSC functionality during extraction and in-vitro cultivation, as well as facilitating non-invasive detection of transplanted MSCs. They propose exploring iron-related genes and proteins, such as ferritin, transferrin receptor-1, and MagA, as reporter genes because their encoded proteins allow for cellular iron accumulation which can ease in-vivo MSC detection via MRI.  The review also addresses the roles of deferoxamine (an iron chelator) and other iron-related proteins like haem oxygenase-1, lipocalin-2, lactoferrin, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and hepcidin in preserving MSC characteristics both in vitro and in vivo while enhancing their therapeutic potential.  In summary, this introduction provides an overview of iron's importance in intracellular activities related to stem cells. It highlights its involvement in enzyme functions, mitochondrial respiration, cellular components like hemoglobin and myoglobin, pathological implications including cancer stem cells', significance during transplantation procedures involving MSCs. The authors propose utilizing specific iron-related genes/proteins for improved detection methods along with other compounds to preserve MSC functionality and enhance therapy outcomes. Continuing with the explanation of this PubMed article, the authors emphasize that MSCs have shown promising results in various in-vitro, pre-clinical, and clinical trials for a wide range of pathologies, including COVID-19. However, despite their therapeutic potential, MSCs are not frequently used in clinical settings for ameliorating pathological conditions.  One significant reason for this underutilization is the challenges associated with labeling MSCs before transplantation and detecting them non-invasively after transplantation using techniques like MRI. To address this issue, the authors propose exploring effective and non-toxic approaches that not only preserve MSC functionality during extraction and in-vitro cultivation but also permit accurate detection of transplanted MSCs non-invasively. The ability to track transplanted cells is crucial for successful monitoring of their therapeutic effects.  The review focuses on investigating iron-related genes (such as ferritin, transferrin receptor-1, and MagA) as reporter genes because their associated proteins allow cellular iron accumulation. This accumulation facilitates enhanced detection and tracking of transplanted MSCs via MRI.  In addition to investigating iron-related genes as reporter genes, the authors also delve into the roles of other iron-related proteins in preserving MSC characteristics both in vitro and in vivo while enhancing their therapeutic potential. They discuss deferoxamine (an iron chelator), haem oxygenase-1 lipocalin-2 lactoferrinbone morphogenetic protein-2(BMP-2),and hepcidinas potential candidates.  Deferoxamine has emerged as an interesting compound due to its ability to bind excess iron ions within cells effectively. Its usage may prevent unwanted side effects associated with high levels of intracellular free iron while helping maintain optimal function and characteristics of MSCs.  The authors further explore other iron-related proteins such as haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which has been implicated in regulating oxidative stress and inflammation. HO-1 expression could be stimulated to enhance MSCs' therapeutic potential and protect them from damaging conditions.  Lipocalin-2, lactoferrin, BMP-2, and hepcidin are among other iron-related proteins discussed in the review. These proteins have been shown to affect various cellular processes, including immune modulation, tissue repair, angiogenesis, and stem cell proliferation.  The authors highlight the importance of understanding how iron-related genes and proteins can influence MSC functionality both in vitro (during cultivation) and in vivo (after transplantation). By investigating their roles and mechanisms of action, researchers can potentially develop improved strategies for preserving MSC characteristics while enhancing their therapeutic effects.  In conclusion, this PubMed article explores the significance of iron in various intracellular activities related to stem cells. It highlights the challenges associated with labeling and detecting transplanted MSCs non-invasively using techniques like MRI. The authors propose investigating iron-related genes as reporter genes for enhanced detection methods along with exploring the roles of different iron-related proteins in preserving MSC characteristics while optimizing their therapeutic potential. This understanding could lead to improved approaches for successful induction and tracking of transplanted MSCs as well as enhancing their regenerative abilities in different pathological conditions.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides a background and overview of the concept of ""pyroptosis."" The term pyroptosis was first proposed in 2001 and combines the words ""pyro,"" representing inflammation or fever, and ""ptosis,"" representing programmed cell death. The introduction then mentions that pyroptosis has been redefined as a form of programmed necrosis mediated by gasdermin proteins.  Gasdermins are pore-forming proteins, and there are six different gasdermin proteins identified: A, B, C, D, E, and DFNB59. However, DFNB59 is not associated with the formation of membrane pores or pyroptosis. The members of the gasdermin family have two domains: an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain connected by a flexible peptide.  The focus of this review is on GSDMD (gasdermin D), which is described as the most extensively studied executive protein involved in pyroptosis. GSDMD is cleaved into an active N-terminal domain (GSDMD-NT) upon activation induced by various stimuli. Inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1/4/5 (and murine caspase-11) are responsible for cleaving GSDMD into its active form.  GSDMD-NT then oligomerizes and forms membrane pores in cells leading to various outcomes including lytic cell death, release of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-18, disruption ionic homeostasis/organelle dysfunction/cell lysis/sustained release inflammatory cytokines due to massive membrane pore formation causing loss in integrity.  The article explains that while GSDMD-induced pyroptosis can protect against bacterial infection there have been numerous studies demonstrating that abnormal activation of GSDMD can cause severe inflammatory cascades leading to diseases like ischemic stroke FMF NOMID EAE nonalcoholic fatty liver disease cancer HIV infection Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The article also mentions that pyroptosis plays an important role in the clinical symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, specifically in terms of excessive inflammation and cytokine storm seen in COVID-19.  Given the crucial role of GSDMD in pyroptosis and inflammatory disorders, the review aims to summarize the structure and activation mechanisms of GSDMD, as well as highlight the discovery of potential GSDMD inhibitors. Inhibiting GSDMD could hold promise for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, including COVID-19.  This introduction effectively provides a brief history of pyroptosis, introduces key concepts related to gasdermin proteins (specifically GSDMD), and outlines its importance in both normal physiological processes (e.g., protection against bacterial infections) and pathological conditions (e.g., various inflammatory diseases). It sets up the rationale for focusing on GSDMD and explores potential therapeutic avenues by targeting this protein. Continuing from the previous explanation, this PubMed article further delves into the role and implications of GSDMD in pyroptosis and inflammatory disorders. The article highlights that abnormal activation of GSDMD can result in persistent inflammation, disrupting ionic balance, organelle function, causing cell lysis, and leading to sustained release of inflammatory cytokines. These consequences have been implicated in various diseases such as ischemic stroke, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), sepsis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cancer, HIV infection, as well as neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).  Additionally, the article emphasizes the significant role of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or COVID-19. It explains that excessive inflammation and cytokine storm contribute to tissue damage and organ failure observed in COVID-19 patients. As GSDMD serves as a regulatory protein upstream of this cytokine storm response during SARS-CoV-2 infection, it becomes an attractive target for potential treatment interventions against COVID-19.  In light of these findings and its pivotal involvement in pyroptosis-related processes and inflammatory disorders，the review aims to provide a comprehensive summary focusing on the structure and activation mechanisms specifically associated with GSDMD. By understanding these aspects more deeply，it may be possible to identify therapeutic strategies targeting GSDMD for various conditions.  Furthermore，the article highlights ongoing efforts towards finding potential inhibitors of GSDMD. Inhibiting GSDMD activation or its activity could help mitigate excessive cell death，inflammatory responses，and related pathological consequences found across multiple diseases including but not limited to COVID-19.  By providing an overview of the current knowledge and research progress regarding GSDMD，the review offers a foundation for further investigations and therapeutic advancements. It aims to stimulate interest in exploring novel approaches for the development of therapeutic interventions that modulate GSDMD and its downstream effectors.  In conclusion, this PubMed article introduces the concept of pyroptosis and highlights the role of GSDMD as a key executor in this process. It discusses the implications of abnormal GSDMD activation on various inflammatory diseases, including COVID-19. The review emphasizes the importance of understanding GSDMD structure, activation mechanisms, and potential inhibitory strategies to advance our understanding of pyroptosis-related disorders and develop effective treatments.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of circadian rhythm and its role in regulating various biological activities in all living beings. It explains that when circadian rhythms are synchronized with the light-dark cycle, melatonin is secreted to initiate sleep during the nighttime. The relationship between circadian rhythm markers such as dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and core body temperature (CBT) rhythms and sleep timing is referred to as the ""phase angle"" of circadian entrainment.  The introduction also highlights that while Earth's rotation and social activity rhythms follow a 24-hour cycle, the endogenous circadian rhythm in humans may be slightly longer than 24 hours. The length of this intrinsic circadian period is known as ""tau."" It mentions that tau can vary from individual to individual, with women typically having a slightly shorter tau than men.  Furthermore, it discusses how endogenous circadian rhythms are entrained to follow a 24-hour cycle through various external cues called zeitgebers. Light stimulation plays a crucial role in this entrainment process by activating neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which regulates the molecular signaling pathway and transcription of clock genes involved in determining the phase of the circadian cycle.  The article then introduces Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD), which is a circadian rhythm disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep and waking up at desired times due to delayed sleep phases. It emphasizes that DSWPD prevalence is high during adolescence and young adulthood, making it crucial to establish effective treatment strategies for this disorder.  The introduction further states that there are many aspects yet unclear about DSWPD, including its pathological mechanism, appropriate classification, assessment methods based on patients' backgrounds, psychosocial characteristics, physiological findings, and treatment strategies for different subgroups within DSWPD.  Additionally mentioned are delayed sleep phases (DSP) experienced by individuals who do not meet diagnostic criteria for DSWPD but still have a delayed sleep phase. The concept of social jetlag (SJL), which refers to differences in sleep timing between weekdays and rest days, is also introduced as a concern related to circadian rhythm and sleep hygiene in young people.  The complex interaction between social schedules, light exposure patterns, genetics, homeostatic pressure on sleep, and the circadian system that contribute to DSWPD's development is acknowledged. It notes that approximately 40% of DSWPD patients have normal melatonin secretion profiles despite a clearly delayed sleep-wake schedule. This subgroup is referred to as ""circadian-entrained DSWPD"" and is influenced by psychological, behavioral backgrounds in addition to biological factors.  Furthermore, it highlights comorbidity between DSWPD and psychiatric disorders such as neurodevelopmental and mood disorders. It mentions the 2015 guidelines published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs) including DSWPD but emphasizes the need for additional treatment methods specifically for circadian-entrained DSWPD and those complicated by psychiatric disorders.  Finally, this review article aims to describe physiological and psycho-behavioral backgrounds of different types of DSWPD seen in young people while discussing the relationship between psychiatric disorders and DWSWPD. It also intends to address current issues related to treatment approaches based on psychological and psychiatric assessments.",explain
"This introduction provides background information and sets the context for the research study. It begins by highlighting the increasing global incidence of heart failure (HF) and the high prevalence of HF among women. The authors reference a report from the American Heart Association projecting a rise in HF prevalence, emphasizing that HF causes significant morbidity and mortality among women, especially in older age groups.  The introduction then discusses how HF tends to manifest differently in women compared to men. Women are more likely to experience HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which occurs at an older age and is associated with more symptoms. Despite being less prone to coronary artery disease (CAD) before menopause, women report worse quality of life and higher risk for depression.  The next section focuses on guideline-directed medical therapy for HF, noting that it does not differ between men and women but pointing out that women are often underrepresented in clinical trials for HF treatment.  The introduction then introduces sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), explaining their mechanism of action as hypoglycemic agents that primarily decrease blood glucose levels by increasing urinary glucose excretion. The authors highlight that SGLT-2is have been shown to have additional effects on the cardiovascular system, leading to their approval as treatment for HF.  Key recommendations from recent guidelines regarding SGLT-2is use in patients with reduced ejection fraction are mentioned from both American and European societies. Potential mechanisms through which SGLT-2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular benefits are briefly described.  Following this, the authors describe sex differences in myocardial adaptation after a cardiac event, highlighting that HFpEF is more common in women who also tend to have more comorbidities compared to men with heart failure. They cite relevant studies showing disparities between male and female patients regarding hospitalization rates and outcomes associated with SGLT-2 inhibitor use.  Based on identifying this gap in knowledge about potential sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes among HF patients using SGLT-2is, the authors state their goal to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of SGLT-2is on primary composite outcomes stratified by sex.  The methods section briefly explains the search strategy and inclusion criteria for eligible studies. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to ensure transparency and rigor in study selection.  Finally, the authors mention that they used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for assessing study quality and detail their data extraction process. They specify statistical analysis techniques employed, such as inverse variance weighted averages, hazard ratios, odds ratios, heterogeneity assessment methods, and significance threshold.  Overall, this introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the global burden of heart failure with an emphasis on gender disparities. It introduces SGLT-2 inhibitors as a potential treatment option for HF patients and highlights gaps in knowledge regarding sex-specific effects. The introduction of this PubMed article continues by discussing the primary outcome of interest for the study, which is a composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent visit for heart failure. This outcome is important because it reflects the overall impact and severity of HF on patients' health and well-being.  The authors then provide details about the methods used in their study. They conducted a comprehensive search and review of three major databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane) from 2017 to 2022 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated SGLT-2 inhibitors for HF outcomes. Only dedicated cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT-2is and subgroup analyses based on sex were included in the analyses.  To evaluate the quality of included studies, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used. This tool assesses several domains such as random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding procedures, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. Three authors independently extracted data using a standardized form to ensure accuracy and consistency.  Statistical analysis was performed using Cochrane Review Manager software (RevMan version 5.4). The researchers calculated inverse variance weighted averages of logarithmic hazard ratios using a random effects model to determine study weight. Pooled hazard ratios stratified by sex were calculated based on intention-to-treat analysis. The odds ratio was also computed between pooled hazard ratios to compare primary composite outcomes between sexes.  Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using both I^2 statistics and Cochrane Q statistics. A low level (<25%) indicates little heterogeneity among studies while higher levels indicate increasing heterogeneity.  The introduction concludes by mentioning that all reported p-values below 0.05 are considered statistically significant in this analysis.  By providing an overview of their methodology with specific emphasis on study selection criteria, quality assessment tools used, data extraction process details, and statistical analysis methods, the authors ensure transparency and reproducibility in their study.  In summary, the introduction of this PubMed article establishes the background and significance of heart failure as a global health problem, particularly among women. It introduces SGLT-2 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic option for HF patients and highlights the need to investigate potential sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes associated with SGLT-2 inhibitor use. The section also outlines the specific research objectives, search strategy employed, study inclusion criteria, quality assessment procedures used, data extraction process details, and statistical analysis methods. This thorough explanation sets up the subsequent sections of the article that present the findings from their systematic review and meta-analysis.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of the key concepts and issues addressed in the PubMed article. It begins by highlighting the large distribution ranges observed in many marine organisms, which is often attributed to the absence of physical barriers. The average range of a teleost reef fish in the Indo-Pacific region is estimated to be 9 million km2, while a typical freshwater fish range is only around 350,000 km2.  The introduction then emphasizes that population structure and dispersal patterns in marine ecosystems are much larger in spatial scale compared to terrestrial and freshwater environments. This phenomenon can be attributed to long-distance colonization and range expansion processes influenced by oceanographic and geographic factors.  Furthermore, the introduction states that genetic variation within species is linked to geographical processes that result in sub-divided populations. This has implications for management practices related to commercial exploitation and conservation efforts.  The role of sharks and rays in maintaining coastal and oceanic ecosystem structure is emphasized next. Sharks serve as top predators, while smaller ones function as mesopredators or prey for larger sharks and other oceanic predators. The unique life history traits of elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, skates), such as late sexual maturity, long gestation period, low fecundity, slow growth rate, high maternal investment, and long lifespans are highlighted as reasons why their populations are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures such as overfishing, habitat modification pollution ,and climate change.  Accordingly,m The primary cause of decline among shark and ray populations is identified as overfishing due to rates exceeding their capacity for replenishment. Additionally,m more than half of this fishing mortality arises from bycatch – unintentionally captured animals not targeted for fishing.  The expansion of shark fishing industry is also attributed partly due declining availability commercial fishes (teleosts) or strict restrictions on capturing them.  The diverse habitats occupied by sharks - including coastal waters,, pelagic waters,, limiting to continental shelves, and completely oceanic species - are mentioned, along with the distribution of rays that are mainly marine with some adapted for low salinity habitats and freshwater environments.   Population subdivisions in rays are considered more common than in sharks due to limited dispersal and geographical impediments. The aggregation of coastal shark populations for mating and parturition at specific locations is noted as a factor influencing genetic divergence between populations within different geographic regions.  Several examples are provided to support these concepts. For instance, observations about philopatry (returning to the natal site) among blacktip reef sharks in the Indo-Pacific highlight its contribution to genetic structuring. Another example concerns bull sharks, where significant genetic variation was observed among nurseries suggesting male-biased dispersal patterns.  The introduction underscores that understanding elasmobranch biology and life history is essential for developing effective species-specific management plans. Challenges related to governing shark and ray populations across international waters are discussed due to migrations crossing national boundaries and lack of comprehensive knowledge about migratory habits.  Lastly, it is indicated that present conservation efforts for sharks and rays suffer from inadequate resources (funds, technical capacity), as well as limited political will required for efficient monitoring, control, and management of elasmobranch fisheries/trade.  The introduction concludes by stating the purpose of the study: examining patterns of phylogeography (spatial genetics)and population structure within families both within individual species’ levels,and across multiple families  And provide insights through a meta-analysis combining data from various sources(publications,and unpublished studies.)",explain
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures for various applications, such as studying drug efficacy and toxicity, as well as creating disease models. Compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, 3D-culture models provide a more accurate representation of the in vivo environment and therefore improve the quality of experiments conducted.  The advancements in 3D devices and technologies have led to the development of microfluidic chips known as organ-on-a-chip (OOC) systems. These OOC devices are designed to mimic the cellular microenvironment found in human organs by incorporating features like fluid flow through micro-channels to simulate vasculature networks. This allows for the provision of nutrients and transportation of waste and metabolites within these simulated systems. By mimicking both structural features and physical conditions, OOC models have great potential for translating in vitro findings into better understanding human physiology.  One significant advantage offered by OOCs is the potential to make drug discovery processes faster and cheaper compared to conventional methods, with cost reductions estimated up to 26%. However, despite progress made thus far, their broad applicability is hindered by a lack of online detection schemes that enable real-time observation of cellular behaviors. This limitation restricts our understanding of cellular mechanisms over time and hampers efforts to correct defects or improve OOC model production.  To date, several analytical techniques have been employed in conjunction with OOCs for monitoring cellular behavior, including optical imaging methods like phase contrast microscopy or fluorescence-based assays alongside electrochemical sensors or label-free assays such as photonic crystal technology. Additionally, capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS) have been used successfully given their high sensitivity and specificity for analyzing changes in metabolites, proteins, lipids within cultured cells.  However MS cannot be directly integrated with OOCs due mainlyto challenges posed by cell media present in the chambers, which typically contain salts, nonvolatile buffers, and compounds that can interfere with MS analysis by creating ion suppression. The current approach relies on offline sample preparation methods to normalize chip-to-chip variability or manipulate cell excretes before MS analysis. Unfortunately, this significantly reduces the ability to track metabolites over time - an essential factor for unraveling cellular mechanisms.  Given the advantages offered by MS for biomedical applications, this article focuses specifically on investigating approaches that enable direct coupling of OOCs with MS. The review examines different techniques and hyphenation methods that bridge OOCs with MS analysis including electrophoresis, solid phase extraction, liquid chromatography and droplet-based chips. These techniques are assessed for their strengths and limitations in enabling real-time analysis.  This comprehensive review is intended to summarize recent developments in direct coupling of OOCs with MS analysis techniques. By evaluating various approaches and considering their capabilities as well as weaknesses for real-time analysis, it provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in developing robust interfaces that allow rapid and specific characterization of OOC content using MS as the analytical tool of choice. Furthermore, the article specifically focuses on the techniques used to evaluate mimetic tissue models in OOCs. Along with a brief discussion on traditional methods such as phase contrast microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), there is an emphasis on the use of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements. TEER allows researchers to assess the barrier function of epithelial cell layers in OOCs and provides valuable insights into cellular behavior in these complex systems.  After providing an overview of the general analytical techniques used for OOC evaluation, the review delves into MS as a powerful tool for studying metabolites, proteins, and lipids within 3D cell systems. By utilizing MS for in-situ monitoring of OOCs, researchers can gain insight into the molecular composition of culture media, excreted metabolites, and waste products. The high sensitivity and specificity of MS make it an ideal candidate for unraveling intricate metabolic pathways within these complex cellular models.  However, despite its advantages, integrating MS directly with OOCs poses several challenges. The presence of cell media in OOC chambers containing salts, nonvolatile buffers, and interfering compounds can lead to ion suppression during MS analysis. This issue restricts real-time analysis capabilities since offline sample preparation methods are currently employed to normalize chip-to-chip variability or manipulate cell excretes before undergoing MS analysis.  To address this challenge and enable real-time analysis of molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, or proteins within OOCs using MS technology directly coupled to these systems is being explored. The review explores various hyphenation techniques that bridge the gap between OOC platforms and MS analysis including electrophoresis-based approaches which allow separation prior to detection by mass spectrometry.  Additionally solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography are examined as possible strategies for sample pre-treatment or isolation before introducing samples into mass spectrometers.The potential utility of droplet-based chips, which offer a highly controlled microfluidic environment and the ability to compartmentalize samples, is also explored.  As with any analytical technique, there are limitations associated with each approach. The review provides an in-depth analysis of these limitations and challenges encountered when coupling OOCs with MS. By understanding these constraints, researchers can make informed decisions regarding the choice of methodologies that best suit their specific research needs.  Overall, this PubMed article serves as an exhaustive review of the recent developments in direct coupling of OOCs with MS analysis. It aims to facilitate the development of robust interfaces for analyzing OOC content using MS as a rapid, sensitive, and specific technique. By highlighting the capabilities and shortcomings of each approach for real-time analysis within complex cellular systems like OOCs, this article represents a valuable resource for researchers seeking to advance our understanding of cellular mechanisms and optimize drug discovery processes through improved analytical methodologies.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article starts by highlighting the increasing prevalence of diabetes as a serious global public health issue. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) predicts that the number of diabetes mellitus patients worldwide will reach 783 million by 2045. In China, an epidemiological investigation found a 12.4% estimated prevalence of diabetes in 2018, with only 50.1% of treated diabetic patients being adequately controlled.  The introduction then emphasizes the significant impact that diabetes has on individuals and society. People living with diabetes are at risk of developing life-threatening complications, leading to increased need for medical care, reduced quality of life, and added stress on families. Poor management of diabetes and its complications can result in frequent hospital admissions and premature death.  Despite advancements in antidiabetic drugs, glycemic control remains far from perfect, with some drugs causing adverse events and increasing cardiovascular disease risk without effectively improving clinical symptoms.  This highlights the urgent need for new drugs that are effective with minimal side effects, favorable hypoglycemic effects, and potential symptom relief.  The introduction then mentions Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which has been used to treat diabetes for thousands of years. TCM has made significant progress in modernization and globalization in recent years.  Jinlida granule is introduced as a Chinese patent medicine composed of various herbs. It was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) in 2005. It has been widely used in clinical practice.  Previous research conducted by the authors includes a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating Jinlida's efficacy and safety in T2D patients who received Jinlida or placebo alongside metformin treatment for 12 weeks. The results showed a more significant reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels among those receiving Jinlida compared to placebo.  Furthermore, meta-analysis and systematic reviews of Jinlida granules have shown significant reductions in fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), and HbA1c levels.  Animal experiments have also demonstrated that Jinlida granules can enhance the function of brown and beige adipocytes, improving glucose and lipid metabolism. They can also reduce insulin resistance in rats fed with high fat by regulating phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).  However, previous studies on Jinlida focus primarily on its effect on blood glucose levels and their potential mechanisms while neglecting its role in improving clinical symptoms of T2D.  Hence, this current study aims to conduct a secondary analysis based on the previous randomized controlled trial to investigate the role of Jinlida in reaching standard target blood glucose levels as well as improving clinical symptoms. The goal is to bridge the gap between hypoglycemic agents and improvements in diabetic clinical symptoms. This PubMed article aims to investigate the role of Jinlida granules in reaching standard target blood glucose levels and improving clinical symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The authors recognize that previous studies have primarily focused on the effect of Jinlida on blood glucose levels and its potential mechanisms, largely ignoring its impact on improving clinical symptoms.  To address this gap, the study conducted a secondary analysis based on a previous randomized controlled trial. In this trial, a total of 192 subjects with T2D were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either Jinlida granules or placebo alongside metformin treatment for a duration of 12 weeks.  The results from the previous trial showed that glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was significantly reduced in the group receiving Jinlida granules compared to the placebo group. Additional meta-analyses and systematic reviews of Jinlida granules also demonstrated significant reductions in fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), and HbA1c levels.  Building upon these findings, the current study aims to delve deeper into understanding how Jinlida contributes to reaching standard target blood glucose levels while also examining its impact on improving clinical symptoms associated with T2D.  Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used for thousands of years as an alternative approach to managing various health conditions, including diabetes. However, modernization and globalization have led to significant progress in incorporating TCM into conventional medicine practices. Jinlida granule is one such example; it is a Chinese patent medicine composed of 17 different Chinese herbs approved by CFDA for treating T2D since 2005.  In addition to analyzing its effects on glycemic control measures like HbA1c, FBG, and 2hPG as mentioned earlier, animal experiments have suggested that Jinlida granules could improve glucose and lipid metabolism by promoting the thermogenesis of brown and beige adipocytes. This effect is accomplished by enhancing mitochondrial function and inhibiting the expression of miR-27a. Jinlida granules have also exhibited the ability to reduce insulin resistance by regulating phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in rats fed with a high-fat diet.  Despite these promising findings, limited attention has been given to assessing Jinlida's impact on improving clinical symptoms associated with T2D. Clinical symptoms play a crucial role in overall quality of life for individuals living with diabetes. Therefore, this study aims to bridge that gap between hypoglycemic agents' effectiveness and improvements in diabetic clinical symptoms.  By conducting a secondary analysis based on their previous randomized controlled trial data, the authors hope to shed light on Jinlida's potential role in achieving standard target blood glucose levels while promoting better patient outcomes through relieving clinical symptoms.  Overall, this research contributes to addressing the urgent need for new antidiabetic drugs with minimal side effects, favorable hypoglycemic effects, and symptomatic relief for individuals living with T2D. By exploring Jinlida granules' potential benefits beyond blood glucose control measures, it provides valuable insights into leveraging Traditional Chinese Medicine approaches within mainstream diabetes management strategies.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of migraine as a prevalent neurological condition and its significant impact on individuals' lives. It highlights the high prevalence and disability associated with migraine, particularly occurring between the ages of 35 and 39. The introduction emphasizes the social, familial, and economic implications of migraine, including decreased quality of life, work absenteeism, reduced work efficiency, and increased healthcare costs.  The article mentions that pharmacological interventions are commonly used for acute management of migraines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans. Additionally, prophylactic drugs like topiramate or valproic acid are recommended for chronic migraines. However, limitations exist with these approaches due to adverse effects such as increased blood pressure or allergic reactions.  Behavioral change interventions play a fundamental role in managing migraines alongside pharmacological treatments. These interventions include stress management, sleep hygiene optimization, dietary modifications, and regular exercise. The article specifically highlights aerobic exercise and yoga as preventive alternatives for migraines.  While the dissemination of information on migraines and exercise has increased through social media channels in recent years, the quality of that information remains questionable. Nevertheless, several international scientific societies recommend incorporating exercise into migraine treatment plans to improve symptoms.  Despite these recommendations for exercise in migraine treatment guidelines by various headache societies (e.g., French Headache Society; Danish Headache Society; American Headache Society), limited specific guidance is provided regarding which types of exercises are most effective for migraines.  The objective of this clinical practice guideline is to address this gap by providing recommendations on different modalities that could effectively treat migraines through exercise while considering patient characteristics such as frequency of attacks  Through a review process encompassing current evidence about exercise interventions (intensity,frequency,duration) along with disability reduction & improved quality life,the guideline aims at offering parameters associated with each prescribed modality based on patient’s preferences/experiences.It states clearly that this guideline is not meant to establish a standard of medical care but rather assists healthcare and exercise professionals (neurologists,physical therapists,exercise physiologists)in better managing patients with migraines by providing them with more specific recommendations or an exercise prescription.  In conclusion, the introduction sets the stage for the article by highlighting the global prevalence and impact of migraines on various aspects of individuals' lives. It establishes a need for specific guidance on exercise interventions within migraine treatment plans while acknowledging the absence of clinical practice guidelines in this area. The article aims to provide evidence-based recommendations on different exercise modalities and lifestyle adaptations that can improve migraine symptoms while accounting for individual patient characteristics and preferences. The PubMed article emphasizes the importance of developing a guide to assist clinicians in providing better recommendations and more specific exercise prescriptions for patients with migraines. While various scientific societies recommend incorporating exercise into migraine treatment plans, there is a lack of detailed information regarding the specific exercise modalities that are most effective.  The article acknowledges the growing interest and information about migraines and exercise on social media platforms. However, it highlights concerns regarding the quality of this information. To ensure that healthcare professionals have access to reliable and evidence-based recommendations, the need for comprehensive guidelines on exercise prescription for migraines is emphasized.  The main objective of this clinical practice guideline is to provide healthcare professionals, including neurologists, physical therapists, and exercise physiologists, with a series of recommendations on different exercise modalities that may be effective in treating migraines. The goal is to improve symptoms such as intensity, frequency, and duration while reducing disability and enhancing overall quality of life.  By reviewing existing evidence on exercise interventions for migraines, including their impact on symptoms and disability reduction as well as improvements in quality of life, this guideline seeks to provide parameters for tailoring exercise prescriptions based on individual patient characteristics. Factors such as migraine frequency physical condition,and patient preferences are considered in order to enhance the effectiveness of these interventions.  It's important to note that while this guideline aims to inform best practices for healthcare professionals when recommending exercises for migraine treatment,it does not establish a standard approach or specify exact protocols.It instead underlines the role played by patients' clinical presentation/experiences/expectations along with clinicians' expertise so that they can use their discretion when prescribing exercises based on current evidence-backed recommendations.  Overall,the article emphasizes both the significance of incorporating behavioral change interventions like regular aerobic exercises into migraine management alongside pharmacological approaches.Additionally,it stresses upon addressing limitations within current guidelines by developing comprehensive resources specifically focused upon appropriate exercise prescription parameters.This could help not only improve symptom management but also enhance overall quality of life for patients with migraines.

"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the importance of the gut microbiome in maintaining health and preventing disease. It starts by defining microbiota as communities of microorganisms that exist alongside the host ecosystem in a specific environment, while highlighting that the microbiome refers to the microbial genome.  The introduction then goes on to mention that metagenomic sequencing has identified over 10 million microbial genes in the human gut microbiome, indicating its complexity. The gut microbiome is described as playing a significant role in health and disease, with studies suggesting its influence on the interaction between the central and enteric nervous systems (known as the gut-brain axis) and subsequent effects on mental health outcomes like depression.  Furthermore, dysbiosis or an unhealthy gut microbiome has been linked to various diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The article emphasizes recent research indicating that the gut microbiome also modulates immune system functions. Components or metabolites produced by certain bacteria within the gut are known to promote anti-inflammatory responses.  Characterizing a healthy gut microbiome is challenging due to its diverse composition both within and between individuals. However, it is generally accepted that higher diversity, richness, stability of microbial communities along with an abundance of species associated with short-chain fatty acid production contribute to better health outcomes.  The introduction then highlights growing interest in understanding how vitamin D affects the composition of the gut microbiome. Vitamin D's active form (calcitriol) has been found to bind macrophages resulting in bacterial killing through antimicrobial peptide production. Studies conducted on rodents have shown associations between vitamin D deficiency or lack of vitamin D receptor activity with increased levels of less healthy bacteria from Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla.  Vitamin D also has a role in maintaining gastrointestinal integrity by reducing cell permeability and regulating tight-junction proteins which prevent pathogenic bacterial invasion into epithelial cells.  The article mentions a systematic review that found a link between vitamin D and the diversity and abundance of different bacteria in the gut microbiome, with subsequent interventional studies in healthy women indicating significant increases in microbial diversity and the abundance of health-promoting probiotic taxa after vitamin D supplementation.  However, the introduction highlights that there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically exploring the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the gut microbiome. Only three small RCTs have been conducted so far, with sample sizes ≤26 and intervention durations ≤16 weeks. Although some positive effects on beneficial bacteria were observed in these studies, their overall impact on diversity indices was mixed.  Given this scarcity of data from RCTs, the aim of this study is introduced: to investigate the effect of supplementing older adults with 60,000 IU/month of vitamin D over five years on their gut microbiome composition using a subsample (n = 835) from the larger population-based D-Health Trial. This study aims to address the gaps in current knowledge by conducting a long-term intervention with a larger sample size compared to previous studies. The authors acknowledge that the study population consists of older adults, who are often at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency and gut dysbiosis due to age-related factors.  To conduct this study, the authors recruited 835 individuals from the larger D-Health Trial, which is a population-based trial focusing on various health outcomes. The selected participants will be supplemented with 60,000 IU of vitamin D per month for five years. It's important to note that this dose falls within the range considered safe for long-term use by international guidelines.  By investigating the effect of long-term vitamin D supplementation on gut microbiome composition in an aging population, this study hopes to shed light on potential interactions between vitamin D status and gut microorganisms. Understanding these interactions could provide valuable insights into interventions aimed at improving gut health and preventing or managing related diseases.  The researchers plan to employ comprehensive metagenomic sequencing techniques to analyze changes in microbial diversity and abundance before and after the intervention period. They aim specifically to assess how vitamin D supplementation influences both overall microbiome composition and specific bacterial taxa associated with health-promoting effects.  A thorough characterization of microbial communities before and after supplementation will allow for a more detailed analysis of any observed changes related to diversity indices or specific bacterial taxa associated with health benefits. These findings will contribute significantly towards understanding whether prolonged use of moderate-dose vitamin D supplements can positively impact gut microbiota in older adults.  The article concludes by emphasizing that given their large sample size, long intervention period, and comprehensive analysis approach utilizing metagenomic sequencing techniques, they hope their study can provide robust evidence regarding any potential causal effect between vitamin D supplementation and alterations in gut microbiome composition.  The implications from this research could extend beyond simply linking gut health with better immune function but also broaden our understanding of how nutrients like vitamin D might interact with gut microorganisms to influence various aspects of health and disease. Such knowledge could inform future strategies for the prevention and management of conditions associated with altered gut microbial composition.  In summary, this PubMed article introduces the importance of the gut microbiome in health and disease, outlines current gaps in knowledge regarding vitamin D supplementation's effects on the gut microbiome, describes the study's objectives and methods, and highlights potential implications for improving our understanding of interactions between nutrients, gut health, and overall well-being.",explain
"This PubMed article provides an introduction to the topic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and its current understanding and treatment.   The introduction begins by defining ASD as a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by communication deficits, social impairments, repetitive behaviors, and sensory-motor coordination defects. It also mentions that ASD is now encompassed under the term ""ASD"" in the latest diagnostic systems, such as the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5-TR). The worldwide prevalence of ASD is estimated to be around 1 in 160 children, with a higher prevalence in males than females.  The article highlights that the number of reported ASD cases has increased significantly over the past 30 years. In particular, it mentions that both China and the United States have seen a rise in ASD cases exceeding 2% of their respective populations. This increase has led to a considerable negative impact on patients' daily lives, as well as their families' and social development.  Next, it is stated that although researchers have not yet defined the exact pathogenesis or mechanism underlying ASD's development, genetic, environmental, neurodevelopmental, and immune factors are believed to play significant roles. Furthermore, there currently exists no effective treatment for ASD due to insufficient evidence clarifying its mechanism.  The article goes on to mention various drugs that have been utilized for specific symptoms or comorbidities associated with ASD but not specifically targeting ASD itself. These drugs include risperidone and aripiprazole for agitation and irritability but come with adverse effects such as weight gain; methylphenidate., atomoxetine.,and guanfacine for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms but may cause sleep disruption; loss of appetite nausea ,irritability fatigue sedation hypotension among others.  In addition to pharmacological therapies., behavioral and educational interventions (BEI) have been used for ASD treatment. However, high-quality BEI programs require a significant time commitment and may take a long time to show benefits.  The article then introduces the concept of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), which encompasses medical care practices outside of mainstream medicine. The regimens of CAM that have been tried in ASD patients include biologically based treatments (such as dietary interventions, nutraceuticals, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and chelation) and non-biologically based treatments (such as mind-body medicine, manipulative body-based practices like massage or acupuncture). While some CAM therapies have shown some benefit in treating ASD symptoms., there is still insufficient evidence to confirm their clinical effectiveness.  Within the realm of CAM therapies., acupuncture stands out as a traditional Chinese medicine approach with potential promise for treating ASD. Acupuncture involves the insertion of needles into specific acupoints on the patient's body to stimulate therapeutic responses. Traditional Chinese Medicine frames ASD within their classification system ""Shen zhi"" diseases, linking it with various symptom categories such as sluggishness depression irritability decreased appetite or delays in development such as speech cognition walking etc . The understanding is influenced by TCM's concept that considers individualized treatment based on overall syndrome differentiation rather than simply targeting disease-specific symptoms.  Despite its historical usage within TCM for thousands of years., acupuncture has not gained authoritative recognition in Western medicine due to the lack of sufficient scientific evidence. This leads to the objective behind this review article - exploring the potential usefulness and efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment option for individuals with ASD.  In conclusion., this introduction provides an overview of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) along with its current diagnostic criteria prevalence response to available treatment options shortcomings thereof leading researchers healthcare providers patients families alike search effective alternative or complementary therapies such as Complementary Alternative Medicine (CAM). Acupuncture specifically discussed within TCM context differentiated syndromes serves as a focus for the study presented in this article.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the significance of colorectal cancer (CRC) as a prevalent malignancy, ranking as the third most frequent among cancer patients. It states that CRC is responsible for more than 1.8 million new cases per year and approximately 900,000 annual deaths. Although advancements in cancer therapy have led to improved survival rates for CRC patients, the therapeutic outcomes remain suboptimal, with only a 12% five-year survival rate.  The complexity of CRC incidence and development is then discussed in relation to both exogenous and endogenous factors. Recent research in molecular pathological epidemiology has revealed a strong association between dietary and lifestyle factors and the risk of developing CRC. Factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, processed meat intake, genetic predisposition, and certain therapeutic agents like aspirin have been identified as potential contributors to CRC risk.  The article also mentions specific molecular aberrations found in CRC samples through large-scale sequencing studies. Hypermutation accompanied by microsatellite instability (MSI) caused by hypermethylation and suppression of the MLH1 gene is detected frequently in CRC samples. Furthermore, several candidate genes including APC TP53 SMAD4 PIK3CA KRAS are often found to be mutated.  A focus on understanding molecular processes and signaling pathways involved in CRC development follows this discussion. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), part of a signaling pathway that controls various cell activities like proliferation, metabolism, phenotype acquisition, motility, and angiogenesis emerges as a critical component implicated in driving CRC pathophysiology due to its impact on these cellular functions.  Attention then shifts towards long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which have been implicated in regulating the mTOR signaling pathway associated with cancers including colorectal cancer. lncRNAs are RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but play important roles influencing gene activity at different levels. Some lncRNAs exhibit features similar to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Oncogenic lncRNAs are demonstrated to stimulate tumor activity, while tumor suppressor lncRNAs inhibit it. Overexpression of specific lncRNAs has been associated with poor prognosis and metastatic behavior in CRC patients.  The potential of targeting lncRNAs as a therapeutic approach in CRC is also highlighted. RNA sequencing data from the TCGA dataset showed differential expression of around 200 lncRNAs in CRC patients, suggesting their involvement in the disease. Additionally, mTOR emerges as a potential target affected by these regulatory mechanisms involving lncRNA expression.  The introduction concludes by outlining the purpose of the systematic review – exploring and highlighting mTOR-associated lncRNAs using literature databases with an aim to identify possible correlations between specific lncRNA expressions and mTOR regulation in CRC cases. In this systematic review, the authors aim to investigate the potential role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating the mTOR signaling pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC). They begin by explaining that lncRNAs are a class of transcripts that are longer than 200 nucleotides and do not code for proteins. Despite lacking protein-coding capabilities, lncRNAs have been found to play crucial roles in gene regulation at various levels, including transcription, translation, and protein modification.  The authors highlight that previous studies have indicated the involvement of several lncRNAs in modulating the activity of the mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway is a critical signaling cascade that controls multiple cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, motility, and angiogenesis. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in various cancers, including CRC.  Moreover, dysregulated expression of certain lncRNAs has been associated with poor prognosis and metastatic behavior in CRC patients. These findings suggest that targeting these specific lncRNAs could serve as a potential therapeutic approach for CRC management.  To support their investigation into mTOR-associated lncRNAs in CRC cases, the authors rely on literature databases as valuable resources for identifying possible correlations between specific lncRNA expression patterns and mTOR regulation. They aim to gather relevant information from previous studies regarding interactions between particular lncRNAs and components within the mTOR pathway.  By synthesizing existing research findings on this topic through a systematic review approach, they hope to provide valuable insights into how various lncRNAs may influence or be influenced by mTOR activity in CRC cases. This thorough examination can help broaden our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying CRC development and progression while also highlighting prospective targets for future therapeutic interventions.  The study's methodology likely involves an extensive literature search using relevant keywords related to colorectal cancer (CRC), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and the mTOR pathway. The authors would then carefully select peer-reviewed articles that have investigated the association between specific lncRNAs and mTOR regulation in CRC. They may employ a standardized approach, such as Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to ensure the systematic review is conducted effectively.  The ultimate goal of this study is to provide an updated overview of mTOR-associated lncRNAs in CRC cases, thereby aiding future research efforts and potentially identifying novel targets for therapeutic interventions. By shedding light on the intricate interplay between lncRNAs and the mTOR pathway in CRC, this systematic review offers valuable insights into potential avenues for personalized medicine approaches and improved patient outcomes.  It is important to note that while the information provided here gives an understanding of the article's introduction section, additional details about specific methodologies, results, conclusions, and implications would be found in subsequent sections of the research article itself.",explain
"This introduction is from a Position Statement prepared by the Nutrition Department of the Brazilian Association for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (ABESO). The statement aims to provide guidance on strategies and interventions for weight loss in individuals with obesity.  The statement begins by acknowledging that obesity is a chronic, progressive disease caused by various factors, primarily related to lifestyle (sedentary behavior and poor eating habits) as well as genetic, psychological, cultural, and ethnic factors. The treatment of obesity is complex and long-lasting, requiring lifestyle changes such as nutritional therapy, physical activity, psychological interventions, and potentially pharmacological or surgical treatments. It emphasizes that even modest weight loss (5%) can improve metabolic health and reduce cardiovascular risk.  The authors highlight the importance of long-term follow-up strategies for patients with obesity in order to promote sustainable weight loss. They present Figure 1 which demonstrates examples of successful strategies for long-term weight management.  The article then addresses specific dietary factors associated with obesity. One significant issue observed in Brazil in recent decades has been an increase in calorie intake primarily from ultraprocessed foods. The authors cite studies showing that these products make up a substantial proportion of dietary energy intake and are positively associated with excess weight and obesity prevalence across all age groups. They also mention similar findings from studies conducted in other countries.  Low intake of vegetables is identified as another relevant factor associated with obesity based on a North American study where an inverse association was found between consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and weight gain. Furthermore, low intake of fiber-rich foods was linked to increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality according to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.  Given these findings concerning dietary factors contributing to obesity prevalence worldwide,the authors emphasize the importance of recommending balanced diets for preventionand treatmentofobesityandits comorbidities.They note that “diet” has unfortunately become associated with food restriction due to common usage of the term “diet foods” or low-fat and sugar-free products. They highlight the true meaning of the word “diet” in its original Greek origin, which denotes a synonym for quality of life and encompasses healthy eating practices from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives.  The statement also addresses the negative impact of fad diets on obesity treatment. These diets often promise rapid weight loss but lack scientific evidence to support their efficacy and safety. The authors caution against these approaches, as they can have potentially harmful effects on health and are often created solely for commercial purposes.  Finally, the authors advocate for individualized meal plans that consider cultural habits, lifestyle, preferences, and personal circumstances to facilitate adherence to treatment. They emphasize that highly restrictive diets are difficult to maintain long-term and can lead to increased dropout rates and weight regain.  In summary, this introduction provides an overview of the complex nature of obesity as a chronic disease influenced by multiple factors. It emphasizes the need for comprehensive strategies involving nutrition therapy alongside other interventions. Additionally, it highlights specific dietary factors contributing to obesity prevalence worldwide while debunking misconceptions surrounding dieting terminology. Finally, it warns against fad diets while promoting individualized meal plans for successful long-term weight management.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article starts by providing background information on the demographic dividend and its potential benefits for countries. In 2017, the African Union committed to harnessing the demographic dividend through investments in youth, which prompted leaders across the continent to develop policy roadmaps and action plans for attaining this dividend. The main idea is that countries can accelerate economic growth and maximize per capita gains by making strategic investments in health, education, and labor-market.  The demographic transition is then explained as a process initiated by declines in national fertility rates and infant/child mortality rates. These changes modify the population age structure, resulting in a larger labor force and lowered dependency ratio. However, it is emphasized that realizing these dividends requires optimal policy conditions.  It is also pointed out that countries have only a limited window of opportunity to act on maximizing the potential of the demographic dividend. The length of this window varies depending on factors such as historical context and development levels.  The article highlights that evidence supporting demographic dividend-favorable policies mainly comes from Southeast Asian and European countries with limited knowledge from African countries. This indicates a research gap that needs to be addressed.  Previous studies have suggested key policy areas to capitalize on the demographic transition including expanding family planning services, improving health/nutrition for mothers/children, increasing educational attainment, and investing in labor/economic sectors. However, specific policy investments/enactments for creating a favorable environment are less documented.  To address this gap, two literature reviews conducted by Population Reference Bureau (PRB) and World Bank are mentioned. They identified specific policy inputs conducive to achieving the demographic dividend among various West African countries. The PRB review particularly focused on legalizing contraception, disease prevention/public health investment, free public education provision etc., while World Bank review highlighted financial resource allocation/stakeholder support/institutional building/results monitoring.  Despite evidence-based policies existing for realizing the demographic dividend at hand, their incorporation into national planning is not well understood. Thus, a comprehensive review of the national policy landscape is needed.  The demographic transition stages of African countries are explained, indicating that most countries in sub-Saharan Africa are either in the pre-dividend or early-dividend phase. The different priorities for these phases are highlighted: pre-dividend countries should focus on human development outcomes to accelerate fertility decline and develop necessary skills for the labor market, while early-dividend countries should prioritize job creation to sustain economic growth.  The article acknowledges that specific policy enactments suggested in existing literature largely come from Southeast Asian and European countries, leaving a gap in knowledge for African countries. Therefore, the study aims to use the Demographic Dividend Framework developed by Gates Institute to review two pre-dividend African nations as case studies. The goal is to identify evidence-based policies conducive to fostering a demographic dividend-favorable environment, assess existing national policies for comprehensiveness and gaps, and provide recommendations for policy amendments.  Overall, this introduction sets up the context and purpose of the article by explaining what the demographic dividend is, its potential benefits for African countries, and gaps in knowledge regarding specific policies for achieving it.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a serious inflammatory disorder that primarily affects premature infants. It highlights the prevalence and mortality rates of NEC, as well as the limited treatment options available. The history of NEC diagnosis is briefly described, mentioning the development of clinical staging systems by Bell et al. and Walsh and Kliegman.  The introduction also addresses the limitations in diagnosing NEC and understanding its causes. It emphasizes the absence of a universal definition for NEC, which has led to multiple definitions being used in different institutions. This lack of consensus can result in variations in diagnosis among clinicians. Additionally, the multifaceted nature of NEC makes it challenging to discover effective biomarkers for diagnosis and prevention.  To address these limitations, the authors propose that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have great potential in improving our understanding and management of NEC. They highlight previous successful applications of AI/ML in other disease areas such as sepsis or cancer but note that only a few studies have explored its use specifically for NEC.  The article aims to provide an overview by summarizing the basic concepts of AI/ML, reviewing existing literature on AI/ML in relation to NEC, and discussing potential limitations and pitfalls associated with their implementation.  Overall, this introduction sets up the context by describing key aspects related to NEC such as its impact on preterm infants, diagnostic challenges faced by clinicians due to varying definitions, limited treatment options available currently, and gaps in understanding its underlying causes. It emphasizes how AI/ML could potentially address some of these challenges but acknowledges that further research is needed given their relatively limited application thus far within this specific field. The article then proceeds to delve into the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in Section 2. It provides a basic understanding of AI and ML technologies for readers who may not be familiar with these concepts. The authors explain that AI refers to computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, while ML is a specific subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time.  In Section 3, the article reviews the existing published literature on the application of AI and ML in NEC. It discusses various studies that have explored different aspects, including disease prediction, biomarker discovery, risk evaluation, and treatment planning. The authors highlight how these studies have shown promise in improving outcomes for both adult patients and neonates suffering from various diseases but note that only a limited number of studies have been conducted specifically on NEC.  The authors also identify some limitations and pitfalls associated with using AI/ML techniques in healthcare settings. In Section 4, they discuss these challenges which include biases within datasets used for training AI models, interpretability issues where it may be difficult to understand how certain conclusions are reached by the algorithms, lack of standardization in implementing AI/ML models across different healthcare institutions, privacy concerns related to patient data usage for training purposes, potential legal implications if errors occur due to algorithmic decision-making, as well as ethical considerations regarding autonomy in medical decision-making.  The introduction sets up the rationale for conducting this review by highlighting the current gaps and challenges faced by clinicians and researchers working on NEC diagnosis and management. By emphasizing the potential benefits of leveraging AI/ML technologies in addressing these challenges while acknowledging their limitations within this field thus far; it helps provide context for readers interested in exploring this emerging area of research.  Overall, this PubMed article aims to contribute knowledge about applying AI/ML techniques specifically within the field of NEC management. It provides an overview before delving into more detailed discussions concerning the concept of AI/ML, relevant literature, and associated limitations. By doing so, it sets the stage for further research and development in this field that could potentially improve NEC diagnostics, treatment strategies, and patient outcomes for this devastating disorder.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of esophageal cancer (EC) and its global incidence rates, as well as the varying pathological types in different regions. It highlights the significance of EC as one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract.  The first paragraph states that EC originates from the esophageal mucosal epithelium and has varying incidence rates among countries and regions. East Asia, specifically, has the highest incidence rate, which can be twice as high as the global average. Additionally, it mentions that in China, more than 90% of EC cases are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), while low-incidence areas like Europe and the United States predominantly have adenocarcinoma.  The paragraph goes on to provide statistics for new cases and deaths worldwide in 2020. It estimates 604,000 new cases globally (accounting for 3.1% of all cancers) with a mortality rate ranking sixth among malignant tumors. It also highlights China's significant burden in terms of EC cases and deaths recorded in 2015.  Furthermore, it emphasizes that a large proportion (70%) of patients with EC miss out on surgical intervention due to late detection and a high tumor burden. However, if detected early along with precancerous lesions known as ESCC lesions – minimally invasive treatments performed under endoscopy can result in a high 5-year survival rate (~90%).  Despite this success for early-stage patients treated using minimally invasive methods, it is noted that overall diagnosis rates for EC remain low. Many patients are diagnosed only after developing dysphagia or metastatic symptoms when their tumor is already at an advanced stage.  To improve early diagnostic rates specifically for ESCC (the predominant type), screening high-risk populations becomes crucial since early-stage symptoms are often not distinct enough to raise suspicion for potential cancerous growths.  However, due to inconsistencies in the professional expertise of endoscopists, there are missed cases resulting from the failure to recognize lesions during screening in high-risk areas. This leads to highlighting the potential benefit of computer-aided endoscopic monitoring.  The introduction concludes by mentioning that studies have shown that computer-aided diagnosis, specifically using artificial intelligence (AI), can help detect and classify suspicious lesions, ultimately improving ESCC detection rates. AI-assisted endoscopic diagnosis is seen as a promising solution for addressing an increase in workload and improving inspection efficiency.  Overall, this introduction provides essential background information on EC's global prevalence, varying pathological types across regions, importance of early detection and treatment for better patient outcomes, along with the potential role of AI-assisted endoscopy in improving diagnostic rates. Continuing from the introduction, this PubMed article focuses on summarizing the current status of utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) for endoscopic detection of early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The authors aim to explore the potential of AI-assisted endoscopy in improving diagnostic rates, reducing missed cases, and increasing efficiency.  Esophageal cancer poses significant challenges in terms of early detection. Often, patients are diagnosed at advanced stages when treatment options become limited and prognosis is poor. Improving the early diagnosis rate is crucial for better patient outcomes and reducing the disease burden. This necessitates effective screening methods targeting high-risk populations.  Traditional endoscopy has been a valuable tool in detecting esophageal lesions. However, it heavily relies on the expertise and experience of the endoscopist. In areas with high incidence rates of ESCC, there can be a significant workload on healthcare professionals responsible for conducting screenings. Moreover, there have been cases where lesions were missed due to human error or variations in clinical judgement.  In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging AI algorithms to enhance endoscopic diagnostics. These algorithms use advanced machine learning techniques to assist endoscopists by automatically detecting suspicious lesions and providing real-time analysis during procedures.  The advantage of AI-assisted diagnosis lies in its ability to detect subtle or early-stage lesions that could potentially be missed by human observers alone. By analyzing patterns and characteristics within images or videos captured during an endoscopy examination, AI algorithms can help identify precancerous or cancerous regions with high accuracy.  The article likely elaborates on different studies that have explored various approaches for AI-assisted diagnosing of early ESCC using cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning algorithms or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These techniques involve training computational models with large datasets containing labeled images or videos from past clinical cases.  Researchers are able to fine-tune these models so they develop recognition capabilities specific to identifying ESCC lesions. The objective is to create an AI system that can not only enhance the endoscopist's ability to detect lesions but also support decision-making processes in real-time by providing immediate feedback during the examination.  By summarizing the current state of research in this field, the article likely discusses different studies and their outcomes, highlighting promising results that demonstrate improved diagnostic rates, reduced missed cases, increased efficiency, or enhanced overall detection accuracy when using AI-assisted endoscopy.  Ultimately, this research has significant implications for clinical practice and patient care. Successfully implementing AI technology into routine endoscopic examinations could revolutionize esophageal cancer detection by improving early diagnosis rates and potentially saving lives.  To conclude, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in detecting early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) through endoscopy. It emphasizes how AI algorithms can address current challenges faced by traditional screening methods and explores their potential impact on improving diagnostic rates and patient outcomes. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, researchers aim to enhance endoscopists' abilities to detect suspicious lesions effectively while conducting screenings in high-risk populations.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of the topic of the article, which focuses on the role of ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1) in stem cells and its potential for treating stem cell-related diseases.   The introduction begins by highlighting the self-renewal and multidirectional differentiation potential of stem cells, which are divided into embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and adult stem cells (ASCs). It then mentions that stem cell therapy has promising application prospects, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to rebuild a patient's hematopoietic and immune system, and mesenchymal stem cells reducing transplantation rejection and severe lung injury induced by COVID-19.  Next, it states that mechanisms regulating the self-renewal and differentiation potential of stem cells can be compromised due to gene mutations, cell fusion, chromosomal mutations, etc., leading to tumor growth from malignant transformation. The importance of transcription factors like Oct4, Sox2 Nanog, Klf4, and c-Myc in regulating pluripotency, differentiation ability, and cell reprogramming is emphasized. However, recent studies have discovered that posttranscriptional modifications also play a critical role in regulating cellular processes and determining the fate of stem cells.  The introduction then describes various posttranscriptional modifications affecting mRNA biosynthesis including N6-methyladenosine (m6A), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), inosine (I), pseudouridine (Ψ), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), N6-2’-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am),and 7-methyguanosime(m7G). These modifications influence mRNA folding translation or transport processes.  The remaining part focuses on A-to-I editing which is the most common type of RNA editing in animals and its involvement in various gene regulatory mechanisms at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. It highlights the ADAR protein family, which was discovered in 1987 and contains three members: ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3. ADAR1, a specific adenosine deaminase, is explained to bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and convert adenosine (A) to inosine (I) as part of A-to-I editing. Mutations in the ADAR1 gene are associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) and Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH), both related to neurological lesions associated with chronic activation of type I interferon.  The introduction also mentions that apart from its role in triggering adaptive immunity, research has identified various effects of ADAR1 on immune cell functions such as early T-cell development or mediating T-cell immune tolerance. Moreover, it explains that knockout of ADAR1 leads to lethality or premature death of mouse embryos and describes how it promotes leukemia stem cell self-renewal via let-7 pri-microRNA editing.  Further on, it adds that ADAR1 plays a vital role in the survival and maintenance of intestinal stem cells by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress signals. Additionally, through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation triggered by Adar1 stimulus affects hematopoietic stem cells' regulation.  The introduction concludes by acknowledging that while some roles of ADAR1 in stem cells have been identified through research so far, there is still limited understanding regarding its mechanism as a potential target for clinical treatment for stem cell-related diseases. As a result,the article aims to discuss the protein structure,biological function,and potential therapeutic strategies associated withADRAr activityin stem cells based on existing knowledge thus far. In this article, the authors aim to delve deeper into the protein structure and biological function of ADAR1 in relation to stem cells. They also intend to explore potential treatment strategies for stem cell-related diseases based on ADAR1's role.  The significance of studying ADAR1's impact on stem cells lies in its ability to regulate vital biological processes. The previously mentioned study showing that knockout of ADAR1 leads to lethality or premature death in mouse embryos emphasizes the importance of RNA editing regulation through ADAR1. Moreover, specific functions of ADAR1 have been identified in different types of stem cells.  For instance, studies have revealed that ADAR1 plays a crucial role in promoting leukemia stem cell (LSC) self-renewal by editing let-7 pri-microRNA. By reprogramming malignant progenitor cells, ADAR1 contributes to leukemia progression. Additionally, it has been observed that knockdown of ADAR1 reduces the self-renewal ability of blast crisis leukemia stem cells (BC-LSC) in RAG2+ γc+ mice.  In relation to intestinal stem cells and gut homeostasis, it has been discovered that high expression levels of ADAR1 are found in Lgr5+ cells. Its absence leads to rapid apoptosis and loss of these active circulating stem cells within the small intestine and colon.  Furthermore, investigations have unveiled an association between the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation triggered byADRAr stimulus affecting regulation concerning malignant hematopoieticstemcells' proliferation.Notably,the exact mechanisms underlying howADRAr impacts diverse type sofstemcells have stillyet tobefully understood.Thus,thisreview aims not onlyto elucidatethe protein structureandbiologicalfunctionsofADRARinthe contextofstemcellsbut alsotoexplore itspotential asanovel target for treating diseases relatedtostemcells.Potential therapeuticstrategiesforstemcell-related diseases based on the function of ADAR1 will also be discussed.  Understanding the role of ADAR1 in stem cells has implications for potential therapeutic interventions. Manipulating ADAR1 activity or targeting its downstream pathways may offer new avenues for treating stem cell-related diseases, including certain types of leukemia or intestinal disorders.  In conclusion, this PubMed article provides a comprehensive introduction to the role of ADAR1 in stem cells. It highlights its importance in various aspects such as self-renewal, differentiation potential, and regulation of immune cell functions. The authors aim to further examine the protein structure and biological function of ADAR1 in relation to stem cells while exploring potential therapeutic strategies. This research carries significant implications for understanding the fundamental biology of stem cells and developing new treatment approaches for related diseases.",explain
"In this introduction, the authors present two main concepts: critical thinking and blended learning. They argue that critical thinking is a crucial skill in today's competitive world and is considered essential in both professional and academic fields. Critical thinking consists of two domains: disposition (the mindset or attitude) and skill (the ability to accurately analyze data or use alternative methods to solve problems).  The authors highlight the importance of creativity in critical thinking, as it allows for innovative solutions in decision-making and problem-solving. However, they express concern that education has shifted towards a focus on information transfer rather than developing intelligent and creative individuals due to information overload and rapid technological advances.  The study by Karakoc Najafi et al. is mentioned as supporting the notion that university education should emphasize critical thinking skills. This serves as a rationale for examining the effects of blended learning on critical thinking.  Blended learning is described as a combination of face-to-face classroom learning and online learning, offering flexibility, timeliness, continuity, and effectiveness. It has gained popularity as an approach that combines the benefits of traditional teaching with electronic resources.  The authors argue that blended learning promotes active student engagement by allowing them to seek knowledge independently. Various subcategories within blended learning are mentioned, such as flex model, self-blended model, enriched virtual model, and rotation model. These models aim to enhance students' ability to investigate their own needs, engage in critical thinking processes actively, take initiative in different situations, and improve problem-solving skills.  Different perspectives on the impact of blended learning on students' critical thinking skills are presented through references to studies by Wahyuni (supporting positive impact), Hajrezayi et al. (suggesting non-significant contributions), Harrington et al.(highlighting a need for more research into specific subcategories like flipped classroom). These diverse findings set the stage for further investigation into blended learning's effects on critical thinking abilities.  Considering nursing education specifically important, the authors assert that teaching critical thinking is a significant effort in this field. They further suggest that education should focus on teaching thinking itself rather than merely transferring information to learners.  To address these concerns and gaps in knowledge, the authors conducted a systematic review of previous studies to comprehensively examine the effects of blended learning and its subcategories on critical thinking (and its subcategories). The ultimate goal is to understand how blended learning can enhance these crucial skills in the twenty-first century.  Overall, this introduction provides a broad overview of key concepts such as critical thinking, blended learning, and their significance. It presents supporting evidence from existing literature while establishing the rationale for conducting the proposed study. In addition to establishing the rationale for their study, the authors highlight the necessity of reviewing current educational strategies. They emphasize the repeated emphasis on making greater use of active learning strategies. This suggests a recognition that traditional teaching methods may not be as effective in developing critical thinking skills.  The authors specifically mention an extensive systematic review of previous studies as their chosen methodology. By conducting this type of review, they aim to provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of existing research on the effects of blended learning and its subcategories on critical thinking.  Their focus on critical thinking as one of the essential skills in the twenty-first century aligns with broader societal needs for individuals who can think critically, solve complex problems, and make informed decisions. As such, their study has implications beyond academia and could potentially contribute to efforts aimed at improving educational practices across various fields.  By investigating how blended learning impacts critical thinking skills, the authors aim to address a gap in knowledge regarding this specific pedagogical approach. They mention earlier research findings that have presented mixed results or focused on other aspects within blended learning methodologies (such as flipped classrooms). This indicates that while some studies have shown positive outcomes, there is still uncertainty about whether blended learning consistently enhances critical thinking skills.  By delving into previous research findings and conducting a systematic review, the authors intend to provide a more nuanced understanding of these relationships. This will allow them to determine if there are specific factors or approaches within blended learning that lead to more significant improvements in students' critical thinking abilities.  It is worth noting that nursing education is explicitly mentioned as a context where teaching critical thinking holds particular importance. The inclusion of this reference highlights nursing's unique demands for high-level decision-making skills and problem-solving abilities related to patient care.  Overall, this introduction sets up an argument for investigating how blended learning can impact individuals' development of critical thinking skills—a crucial competency needed in today's competitive world—and lays out why it is an important area for further research. The comprehensive review methodology and focus on an essential skill for the twenty-first-century workforce contribute to the article's significance in understanding the potential benefits and limitations of blending learning environments.",explain
"This introduction provides an overview of the problem being discussed in the PubMed article, which is post-stroke dysphagia. It begins by stating that stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease characterized by ischemia or hemorrhage, with ischemic stroke being the most common type. The introduction then highlights the high prevalence of stroke in China, with millions of new cases every year and a rising trend among younger individuals.  The introduction goes on to emphasize that dysphagia, difficulty swallowing, affects a significant percentage (29-78%) of stroke patients. It explains that dysphagia occurs due to damage to various organs involved in swallowing and weakness in key muscles responsible for movement during swallowing.  The impact of post-stroke dysphagia on patients' quality of life is discussed next. While survival rates have improved due to medical advancements, many survivors are left with debilitating sequelae such as dysphagia and impairments in speech, motor skills, and memory. Dysphagia increases the burden on families and society as it can lead to complications like aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition.  The introduction then mentions existing guidelines for diagnosing and treating post-stroke dysphagia developed by European Stroke Organization and European Society for Dysphagia. These guidelines recommend various interventions such as dietary modifications, nutritional interventions, behavioral interventions (swallowing training), oral health care, medication options like Capaicin receptor 1 agonist and dopaminergic drugs), as well as peripheral or central nervous regulation techniques (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation).  However, despite these recommendations, there is currently no specific or highly effective treatment schedule for post-stroke dysphagia. This leads to the discussion of acupuncture as a widely used treatment method in China and some East Asian countries for stroke recovery.  Tongue acupuncture is specifically highlighted as a micro-acupuncture therapy that has shown effectiveness in treating post-stroke dysphagia. It is described as a fast, relatively painless, and side-effect-free therapy that stimulates nerve receptors and helps with nerve sensory input, promoting recovery of damaged areas in the brain. The theory behind tongue acupuncture is based on the relationship between the tongue and meridians in traditional Chinese medicine.  Furthermore, the introduction explains that stimulation of acupuncture points on the tongue can regulate qi (energy) and blood flow, nourish the blood channels of the tongue, and promote recovery in the tongue and pharynx. Tongue acupuncture is considered effective in improving swallowing function by enhancing cortical nerve cell excitability, promoting neurological function recovery, activating related pathways or combinations thereof.  In summary, this introduction provides an overview of post-stroke dysphagia as a significant problem faced by stroke survivors. It highlights current statistics on stroke prevalence and emphasizes the need for effective treatment strategies. The focus then shifts to tongue acupuncture as a promising therapy based on its potential mechanisms of action within traditional Chinese medicine principles. The article further delves into the details of tongue acupuncture as a treatment for post-stroke dysphagia. It explains that tongue acupuncture was developed by renowned acupuncturist Guan Zhengzhai and has become an integral part of acupuncture alongside ear and head acupuncture methods.  According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, the heart is believed to be connected to the tongue through the circulation of meridians and the infusion of qi and blood. The heart is responsible for governing blood vessels and spirit, while the tongue is governed by the heart-mind and brain marrow. Stimulation of the tongue through acupuncture can promote brain function repair and alleviate post-stroke dysfunction through a concept referred to as ""blood-vessel-heart-spirit.""  Clinical practice has shown that tongue acupuncture therapy is relatively painless for patients, easy to administer, and more effective when combined with body acupuncture techniques. Researchers have found that using tongue-acupuncture points can improve swallowing function by altering cortical nerve cell excitability, facilitating neurological function recovery, enhancing neuron muscular excitability, activating relevant pathways or their combination in controlling swallowing-related nerves and muscles.  The article stresses that based on accumulated evidence from clinical practice, tongue acupuncture has proven effective in promoting functional recovery for patients with post-stroke dysphagia without significant side effects.  Additionally, it notes that this therapy aligns well with traditional Chinese medicine principles regarding holistic treatment approaches. This includes addressing not only symptoms but also considering underlying imbalances within meridians or Zang-fu (organ) systems.  The researchers suggest that due to its ease of administration by acupuncturists and acceptance among patients, along with its demonstrated efficacy in improving swallowing function after stroke without causing pain or adverse effects; Tongue Acupuncture presents itself as a valuable therapeutic option worth exploring further.  In conclusion, this PubMed article highlights the prevalence of post-stroke dysphagia in stroke survivors in China specifically but applicable globally as well. It presents tongue acupuncture as a promising adjunctive treatment modality for dysphagia after stroke, backed by clinical experience and theoretical foundations from traditional Chinese medicine practice. The effectiveness of this non-invasive therapy in promoting swallowing function recovery makes it a potentially valuable addition to the management options available for post-stroke dysphagia. However, further research is required to validate and refine the application of tongue acupuncture in this context, as well as to explore its mechanisms of action more comprehensively.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the amygdala and its related regions, collectively known as the extended amygdala, which play a crucial role in emotional processing in the brain. The traditional understanding of these regions focuses on their involvement in motivated actions, defensive behaviors, fear learning, and threat avoidance. The amygdala is further divided into functionally distinct subregions: the basolateral (BLA), central (CeA), and medial (MeA) subregions. In addition to these classical structures, another region called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is also considered part of the extended amygdala.  Both CeA and BNST are primarily composed of neurons that utilize GABA as a fast inhibitory neurotransmitter. These GABAergic neurons also synthesize and release various neuropeptide modulators, although their specific roles are not yet well characterized.  The abbreviation ""AMY"" is used to refer to both classical amygdala structures (BLA, CeA, MeA) and the extended amygdala (BNST), as they all contribute to behavioral responses towards emotionally salient stimuli and consolidation of emotional memories.  While historically studied in the context of threat avoidance and fear conditioning, extensive research has linked AMY not only with negative emotions like anxiety and aversion but also with positive emotions like approach and reward.  Recent experimental studies have shown that manipulation of CeA and BNST neurons can strongly influence transitions between sleep and wakefulness. These findings suggest that AMY circuits play a more extensive role in regulating arousal beyond their traditional association with affective behavioral states.  The article then introduces narcolepsy as a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness accompanied by abnormal episodes of sleep intrusion during wakefulness. Narcolepsy patients may experience sleep-like episodes at any time during the day along with hallucinations. Around half of narcolepsy patients also show symptoms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, where they physically act out their dreams due to the failure of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep.  The focus of the article is specifically on narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), which is more severe and associated with cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong positive emotional stimuli. NT1 is strongly linked to the loss of a specific neuron subpopulation in the lateral hypothalamus that produces Orexin, a neuropeptide essential for stabilizing wakefulness. NT1 patients display lower levels of Orexin in their cerebrospinal fluid and brain.  The article discusses the intricate circuitry involved in transitions between sleep and wake states, emphasizing the role of Orexin-expressing neurons projecting from the lateral hypothalamus to regions regulating REM sleep. In NT1, with the loss of Orx neurons, there is an inappropriate intrusion of muscle atonia during wakefulness.  Overall, this introduction provides an understanding of the amygdala and its extended regions' role in emotional processing and introduces narcolepsy type 1 as an example where dysfunction in these circuits leads to abnormal sleep-wake transitions. The article goes on to explain that the circuitry underlying the switches between sleep and wake states is complex and involves multiple subregions, pathways, and neurotransmitters. However, given the interpretation of narcolepsy as an intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness, it is crucial to review the circuitry believed to underlie muscle atonia during REM sleep.  During REM sleep, muscle atonia is maintained through activation of the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus (SLD), also known as the subcoeruleus nucleus. This activation ultimately leads to inhibition of motor neurons and a loss of voluntary muscle control. In contrast, during wakefulness, projections from Orexin-expressing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (Orx-LH) inhibit regions involved in regulating REM sleep, including SLD. This inhibition allows normal muscle tone to persist.  In NT1 patients with a loss of Orx neurons in the LH, this tonic inhibition of SLD is lost. As a result, there is an inappropriate intrusion of muscle atonia during wakefulness. The article includes a diagram illustrating functional connections between AMY regions (BLA, CeA), Orx-LH neurons, regions promoting REM-off state transitions (associated with maintaining arousal), and SLD.  The authors emphasize that the interactions between AMY circuits and arousal regulation are multifaceted and extend beyond their established roles in emotional processing. They suggest that unraveling these complex interactions may provide insights into understanding conditions such as narcolepsy.  The subsequent sections discuss animal models that mimic NT1 by genetically manipulating the Orx system or inducing lesions in specific brain areas like BLA or CeA. These models help explore how dysregulation within AMY circuits affects sleep-wake transitions associated with cataplexy-like episodes observed in NT1.  The goal of this article is to shed light on how disruptions within amygdala-related circuits contribute to abnormal symptoms seen in narcolepsy, specifically NT1. By understanding the intricate neural network involved in sleep-wake transitions and how it intersects with emotional processing, researchers hope to uncover potential therapeutic targets for managing symptoms of narcolepsy.  The article concludes by acknowledging that while significant progress has been made in understanding the role of AMY circuits in narcolepsy and related sleep disorders, there are still many unanswered questions. Further research is needed to fully comprehend the contributions of AMY circuitry to arousal regulation and its implications for sleep disorders such as NT1.  Overall, this PubMed article provides a comprehensive overview of the amygdala and its extended regions' involvement in emotional processing and delves into their connections with narcolepsy type 1. The authors aim to bridge the gap between our understanding of emotion-related brain regions and how dysregulation within these circuits can lead to disruptions in sleep-wake cycles seen in NT1.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the significant global impact of cancer on human life and health. It cites data from GLOBOCAN 2020, which estimates that there will be approximately 19.3 million new cases of cancer and at least 10 million cancer deaths worldwide in 2020. The introduction further emphasizes that cancer is increasingly becoming the leading cause of death in many countries.  The paragraph goes on to mention commonly used treatment methods for targeting tumors, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, and targeted therapy. It also highlights tumor immunotherapy as a novel treatment approach that has gained recognition. Tumor immunotherapy primarily focuses on strengthening the body's immune system to recognize and destroy abnormal cells.  The paragraph discusses the significance of tumor immunotherapy by mentioning that it was named one of the top 10 technological breakthroughs by Science magazine in 2013. It also mentions James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2018 for their discovery regarding negative immune regulation as a potential treatment for cancer.  The next section describes various clinical applications of tumor immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, adoptive cellular immunotherapy, and cancer vaccines. The efficacy of these therapies is noted through examples where long-term remission has been achieved after treatment.  Furthermore, tumor immunotherapy offers potential for curing patients with metastases who were previously considered incurable. The rapid development of tumor immunotherapy is highlighted before explaining how it differs from traditional therapies by primarily targeting the immune system rather than tumor cells themselves.  While acknowledging that tumor immunotherapy has benefited many patients overall, it mentions that these patients still remain a minority suggesting there is room for improvement in expanding its benefits to a larger population.  A transition occurs when two studies reveal significant impacts between gut microbiome and cancer immunotherapy using mouse models before specifying favorable gut microbes identified through different studies conducted across various regions such as France, North America, and South America.  The introduction then shifts focus to obesity as a risk factor for various health conditions and the limited effectiveness of dietary interventions and drugs in treating morbid obesity. It highlights bariatric surgery as an efficient treatment option for most patients and how it can alter the gut microbiota profile.  Moreover, it notes that alterations in microbial metabolites after bariatric surgery have shown benefits in other diseases such as type 2 diabetes. However, the impact of these microbial metabolites on cancer and antitumor immunity requires further investigation.  In this review article, the authors aim to introduce changes in microbial metabolites caused by bariatric surgery and analyze their effects on anticancer immunity. They also seek to establish a connection between changes in microbiota due to bariatric surgery and its influence on the effectiveness of cancer treatment specifically for patients with obesity. The article delves into the specific aim of the review, which is to explore the relationship between microbial metabolites caused by bariatric surgery and their impact on cancer and antitumor immunity. The authors recognize that alterations in the gut microbiota have been observed after bariatric surgery and have shown beneficial effects in other diseases. However, the connection between these changes and their influence on cancer treatment outcomes remains unclear.  To address this gap, the authors plan to analyze how microbial metabolites after bariatric surgery affect anticancer immunity. By examining this relationship, they hope to provide valuable strategies for cancer patients who are also dealing with obesity.  The review is structured to investigate several key aspects related to this topic. Firstly, it will explore changes in microbial metabolites caused by bariatric surgery. This may involve examining shifts in specific bacterial species or overall microbiota composition due to surgical interventions designed to induce weight loss.  Next, the article aims to understand how these post-bariatric surgery microbial metabolites impact anticancer immunity. This involves assessing whether certain microbial metabolites enhance or inhibit immune responses against tumors.  The authors highlight that previous research has shown regional differences in what is considered a favorable gut microbiome for cancer immunotherapy. They cite examples from studies conducted across France, North America, South America, and China that identified different beneficial gut microbes for various types of cancer.  Additionally, understanding how these microbial metabolites affect antitumor immune responses may shed light on strategies for optimizing cancer treatment outcomes specifically for individuals with obesity. This knowledge could potentially lead to personalized interventions targeting both obesity and cancer simultaneously.  Given that bariatric surgery alters not only gut microbiota but also its associated metabolism processes within our bodies (microbial metabolism), it becomes critical to investigate how these metabolic changes contribute to anticancer immune responses positively or negatively.  By analyzing available literature on associations between post-bariatric surgery bacterial species shifts/metabolic changes and implications for cancer treatment, the authors aim to provide insights into how altering gut microbiota through bariatric surgery can either promote or hinder anticancer immunity.  This information may have significant implications for clinical practice and patient care. If certain microbial metabolites are found to positively enhance antitumor immune responses, future therapies could potentially include interventions that manipulate these metabolites to improve cancer treatment outcomes.  On the other hand, if specific microbial metabolites are associated with negative effects on anticancer immunity post-bariatric surgery, measures can be taken to mitigate their impact or explore alternative approaches for patients with obesity who require cancer treatment.  In summary, this PubMed article introduces the topic of tumor immunotherapy and its effectiveness in various cancers while highlighting its regional variations in terms of favorable gut microbes. It then transitions to discussing obesity as a risk factor and how bariatric surgery alters gut microbiota composition and metabolism. Finally, it establishes the objective of reviewing the impact of microbial metabolites after bariatric surgery on anticancer immunity and provides potential strategies for improving cancer treatment outcomes in individuals with obesity.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting that health professions trainees in the 21st century have access to a significant amount of open access educational resources, which exceeds what an individual's mind can handle. As a result, future practitioners need to be proficient in knowledge acquisition. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching recognized this need and emphasized incorporating habits of inquiry and improvement as a learning strategy in medical education reform. In response to these evolving needs, inquiry-based learning (IBL) has emerged as an appealing educational strategy.  IBL focuses on learner-driven knowledge acquisition through development of inquiries and hypothesis generation. It differs from problem-based learning (PBL), which involves learners investigating problems provided by teachers. Another similar teaching method is case-based learning, where learners are given cases to target their investigation and research. However, this article specifically focuses on pure trainee inquiry learning and its specific benefits compared to other teaching methods.  The theory behind IBL is constructivist, learner-driven active knowledge acquisition. Students formulate hypotheses and make observations to construct their own knowledge. The framework for IBL can be divided into five phases: orientation (introduction of the topic), conceptualization (generation of open questions and hypotheses), investigation (exploration or observation), conclusion (reviewing problem, hypothesis, interpretation), and discussion (communicating findings externally and reflecting internally).  While IBL curriculum design has evolved since its inception in the 1950s by Jerome Bruner, the core foundation of student-directed epistemic curiosity remains consistent as it encourages active participation and improves scientific literacy. Studies have shown that IBL can enhance students' analytical thinking abilities compared to traditional lecture-based curricula.  There may be some variability in how IBL is classified or sub-divided in the literature. Some categorize it based on assigned tasks such as scholarly research or literature-based research while others consider it overlapping with PBL or sub-classify it based on the roles and responsibilities of teachers and students.  Although there are apparent benefits of IBL in higher education, particularly in fostering inquiry behavior, its outcomes in health professions education have not been fully understood. Thus, this article aims to conduct a scoping review of published literature exploring student outcomes in IBL curricula in health professions training. The objectives are to describe the extent of existing literature, characterize study designs and outcomes, and identify gaps where future studies on IBL should focus. In order to conduct this scoping review, the authors will analyze and synthesize the existing literature on inquiry-based learning in health professions education. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of student outcomes in IBL curricula, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current research.  The researchers intend to describe the extent of existing literature by identifying relevant studies that have explored student outcomes in IBL curricula within health professions training. They will search various databases and sources to ensure a comprehensive scope of the available literature.  To characterize study designs and outcomes, the authors will assess each included study for its research design, methodology, data collection methods, and analysis techniques. This approach will allow them to identify common patterns or trends across studies and highlight any variations in findings.  Additionally, this scoping review aims to identify gaps in the health professions education literature where future studies on IBL should focus. By conducting a thorough analysis of existing research, this review can reveal areas that have not yet been explored or require further investigation. These identified gaps can guide researchers towards future avenues of inquiry regarding student outcomes in IBL curricula.  The ultimate goal of this scoping review is to contribute valuable insights into understanding how IBL impacts student outcomes specifically within health professions training. By synthesizing the available evidence on this topic, researchers hope to shed light on both the benefits and limitations associated with implementing IBL approaches in these educational contexts.  The findings from this scoping review can serve as a foundation for future empirical studies examining student outcomes in relation to different aspects of inquiry-based learning. This may include exploring specific interventions or instructional strategies associated with successful implementation of IBL curricula as well as investigating potential factors influencing student engagement or motivation within these environments.  Through their comprehensive analysis and synthesis, the authors anticipate providing an overview of current knowledge regarding student outcomes resulting from inquiry-based learning approaches within health professions education. Ultimately, they aim for their work to inform educators' decision-making processes and contribute to the ongoing enhancement of educational practices in this field.  In conclusion, this scoping review will analyze and synthesize the existing literature on student outcomes in inquiry-based learning curricula within health professions education. By providing a comprehensive overview of available research, characterizing study designs and outcomes, and identifying gaps for future studies, this review aims to contribute valuable insights into understanding the impact of IBL on students' educational experiences in these professional training programs.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the two phases involved in the development of the vertebrate intestine. The first phase involves the initial formation of a neonatal/juvenile form, while the second phase is characterized by maturation into the adult form. This second phase typically occurs during postembryonic development, specifically during a perinatal period where plasma thyroid hormone (T3) levels reach their peak.  The article highlights that this perinatal period corresponds to approximately 2-3 weeks after birth in mice and during metamorphosis in amphibians such as Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis. It is important to note that due to significant similarities between these two species, they will be collectively referred to as Xenopus throughout this study.  Furthermore, the authors emphasize that maturation of the intestine during this second phase appears to be highly conserved across different vertebrate species. They provide examples indicating that at birth, mice have villi but no crypts (where adult stem cells reside) in their intestines and develop crypts within 3 weeks after birth when T3 levels are high. Likewise, premetamorphic Xenopus tadpoles have simple intestinal structures with mostly a single layer of epithelial cells when there is little or no T3 present.  The article then discusses how increased T3 levels trigger metamorphosis in frogs at approximately 4 weeks of age, resulting in larval epithelial cell death and dedifferentiation. Some larval epithelial cells undergo dedifferentiation to form clusters of cells expressing adult intestinal stem cell markers such as Lgr5 by around 6-7 weeks after fertilization.  By stage 66 or about 2 months after fertilization, these proliferating stem cells differentiate into a complex multi-folded epithelium surrounded by connective tissue and muscles similar to those found in adult mammalian intestines. The location pattern of stem cells in adult frogs is also similar to that observed in the crypt-villus units of adult mammalian intestines.  The article further provides a schematic diagram illustrating the structural changes occurring during Xenopus intestinal metamorphosis. It depicts how the tadpole intestine, which is structurally simpler than that of frogs, consists mainly of three tissue layers: inner epithelium, connective tissue, and outer muscle layers. In contrast, the frog intestine features multiple epithelial folds with elaborate connective tissue and muscle layers. The diagram also highlights key events in this transformation process such as larval epithelial cell apoptosis and the formation of adult stem cells.  Additionally, the introduction mentions the critical role played by T3 during postembryonic development, highlighting that T3 deficiency can lead to severe developmental problems in all vertebrates including humans. The authors highlight that T3 is both necessary and sufficient for anuran metamorphosis. Blocking endogenous T3 synthesis allows Xenopus tadpoles to remain in their tadpole form for prolonged periods compared to wild-type animals who typically complete metamorphosis within approximately 2 months.  The article concludes by mentioning how technological advancements in genetic studies have facilitated research into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying T3 regulation of cell fate and tissue transformation during metamorphosis. The authors particularly focus on recent studies investigating intestinal remodeling with an emphasis on exploring potential connections between cell cycle activation, larval epithelial cell death, and adult stem cell development.  Overall, this introduction sets up a clear framework for understanding how vertebrate intestines undergo maturation through two distinct phases while also emphasizing the essential role played by thyroid hormone (T3) levels during postembryonic development and metamorphosis.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article discusses the challenges faced in tumor chemotherapy, specifically in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). The authors highlight that the main reason for the failure of tumor chemotherapy is the ineffective delivery of drugs to the site of the tumor. They explain that GBM therapy is particularly challenging because it is difficult for drugs to penetrate into the brain and reach the lesion site.  One major factor contributing to drug resistance in tumors is the use of low-specific and highly cytotoxic therapeutics, as well as fluctuations in drug levels in blood plasma. Additionally, they describe how the blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in maintaining normal brain function and creating a balanced environment within the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB is a specialized structure composed of endothelial cells covered partially by pericytes and surrounded by astrocyte end feet.  The authors emphasize that due to a lack of fenestration or small pores in endothelial cells, BBB has low permeability. Furthermore, tight junctions between adjacent brain endothelial cells make this barrier significantly tighter than peripheral microvessels. As a result, only a small fraction (approximately 2%) of small molecules can cross into brain tissue and almost none or 100% biological macromolecules can pass through BBB. This limited permeability severely restricts the effectiveness of therapeutic agents for brain diseases like GBM.  They note recent advancements made in GBM therapy include receptor-mediated targeted therapy, focused ultrasound opening BBB, and Borneol for ""orifice-opening"" of BBB. Among these strategies, receptor-mediated intracerebral transport appears promising because it offers high specificity, affinity, and selectivity. Many receptors overexpressed on BBB can be targeted with ligands to facilitate drug delivery into brain tissue.  However, despite these advances, there are still limitations affecting intracerebral transport efficiency for medications intended for GBM treatment. The authors argue that current studies primarily focus on ligand-receptor and cell-tissue interactions, while ignoring the dynamic changes in BBB function during the development and treatment of brain diseases. They assert that this oversight can lead to the failure of intracerebral drug delivery over time.  Furthermore, they mention the limited clinical application of most brain-targeted drug delivery systems due to poor druggability. These factors highlight the need for safe and effective approaches to treating brain diseases, including discovering new mechanisms, breakthrough technologies, and emerging treatments for anti-GBM therapy.  The authors then discuss the connection between GBM pathology and BBB. Under normal conditions, BBB acts as a barrier composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells with tight junctions, basement membranes, and glial cell end feet. However, under pathological conditions like GBM or other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), cerebral ischemia, or Alzheimer's disease (AD), BBB becomes impaired with decreased tight junction proteins and increased permeability.  They reference previous research indicating that pathological fenestration in BBB can provide an opening pathway for therapeutics to cross into brain tissue. Pathological BBB restoration occurs during first administration of certain nanotherapeutics targeted to treat GBM but results in reduced transport efficiency upon re-administration during multiple dosing treatments.  Their previous study found that targeted nanoparticles could restore pathological BBB through inhibition of VEGF downstream signaling pathway but suffered from decreased intracerebral transport efficiency leading to poor outcomes in GBM therapy. Consequently, they propose a combined sequential treatment using functionalized nanoparticles along with a reversible BBP permeability regulator called SC79 as a means to treat GBM effectively. This approach was shown to enhance anti-GBM effect compared to using nanoparticles alone.

"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of Achilles tendinopathy (AT), a type of degenerative tendon disease that can cause functional impairment and morbidity. The article begins by citing epidemiological data that estimate the prevalence of AT to be 2.16 cases per 1,000 patient-years in the general population and 6.2%-9.5% in the athlete population.  The introductory paragraph also highlights the anatomical categorization of AT into two primary categories: insertional, which occurs at the calcaneus Achilles tendon junction, and mid-portion, which occurs 2-6 cm proximal to the calcaneus. Mid-portion tendinopathy is characterized by diffuse or localized swelling, degenerated tendon morphology, and pain caused by repetitive loading without adequate compensation from the plantar flexor muscle function.  Furthermore, it is mentioned that exercise-based therapy has been proposed as one of the most effective management strategies for mid-portion AT. Various exercise interventions have been reported for AT such as eccentric training using protocols like the ""Alfredson protocol,"" concentric training, and combined (eccentric plus concentric) training using protocols like the ""Stanish"" and ""Silbernagel"" protocols.  Among these interventions, eccentric loading has emerged as a primary conservative approach for AT rehabilitation over recent years due to its hypothesized ability to influence collagen formation in tendons and enhance tendon volume and tensile strength. Additionally, eccentric exercises may potentially reduce neovascularization (formation of new blood vessels) and related nerve ingrowth responsible for pain development.  A meta-analysis examining eccentric exercise treatments on both healthy tendons and pathological tendons revealed no significant immediate volume changes in healthy tendons following acute exercise interventions but did report immediate reductions in volume in pathological tendons with no long-term adaptations observed.  Another aspect discussed is that both concentric training and combined exercise treatments have shown effectiveness in improving plantar flexor functions such as power, which is believed to occur through strengthening the affected tendon. It remains unclear whether the effects of eccentric loading differ from other loading types like slow concentric loading, and the ""time-under-tension"" hypothesis is mentioned as a possible explanation. This hypothesis suggests that positive adaptations can be achieved regardless of contraction type as long as mechanical strain is performed slowly and with adequate intensity.  To date, while various exercise treatments have reported positive findings in functional outcomes for AT patients, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the specific effects of different exercise treatments on specific functional outcomes such as strength in mid-portion AT. The ability to differentiate these effects may contribute to more tailored treatment approaches for individuals with AT.  Therefore, this systematic review aims to analyze the effect of different exercise treatments (eccentric, concentric, combined) on various functional outcomes (strength, power, range of motion, balance) specifically in individuals with mid-portion AT. In this systematic review, the authors aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature on exercise treatments for mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy and their impact on various functional outcomes. By synthesizing the available evidence, they hope to shed light on the effectiveness of different exercise modalities and help guide clinicians in developing more targeted treatment approaches.  The article acknowledges that while eccentric training has been widely studied and recognized as a beneficial intervention for Achilles tendinopathy, there is still limited research on other exercise modalities such as concentric training or combined eccentric-concentric training. It is important to determine whether these alternative exercise treatments can elicit similar functional improvements as eccentric loading, ultimately allowing clinicians to tailor treatment plans based on individual patient needs.  Functional outcomes analyzed in this systematic review include strength, power, range of motion, balance, and potentially other relevant measures related to Achilles tendon function. The authors recognize that assessing these outcomes will provide valuable insights into how specific exercises influence muscle-tendon function and overall rehabilitation progress.  The methodology employed in conducting this systematic review involves an exhaustive search of relevant literature using established databases such as PubMed. Selection criteria are applied to identify studies that meet specific inclusion/exclusion criteria related to study design (e.g., randomized controlled trials) and outcome measures assessed. Data extraction will involve synthesizing key information from selected studies including sample size, participant characteristics (e.g., age range), intervention protocols utilized (e.g., duration, frequency), primary outcome measures assessed (e.g., isometric strength), and findings reported.  To ensure reliability and minimize bias in the analysis process, appropriate quality assessment tools will be utilized to evaluate the rigor of included studies. This ensures that only high-quality research is considered when drawing conclusions about the effects of different exercise treatments for mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.  Upon completing data extraction from all eligible studies, a comprehensive synthesis will be performed summarizing key findings regarding each type of exercise modality evaluated. The authors will assess the strength of evidence and discuss any limitations identified. Additionally, they will highlight gaps in the existing literature and propose recommendations for future research in this area.  By systematically evaluating the effects of eccentric, concentric, and combined exercise treatments on specific functional outcomes in individuals with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy, this study holds promise for advancing our understanding of effective rehabilitation strategies. Ultimately, it may lead to more personalized treatment approaches tailored to individual patient needs, allowing clinicians to optimize care delivery for individuals suffering from this debilitating condition.",explain
"This introduction begins by highlighting the prevalence and impact of cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). It states that cognitive dysfunction is one of the most common non-motor symptoms in PD and is much more common in PD patients compared to healthy aging individuals. The presence of cognitive dysfunction worsens the prognosis of PD, increases caregivers' burden, and leads to economic consequences.  The introduction then provides statistics on the frequency and progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD. It mentions that 40-50% of PD patients have MCI at baseline, and around 75-80% of those with MCI eventually progress to dementia based on longitudinal studies.  Next, the concept of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is introduced. SCD refers to a decrease in cognitive capacity without detectable impairment on neuropsychological tests. It suggests intact cognitive functions but may indicate underlying pathological changes. SCD has been identified as an at-risk state for developing MCI or dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD).  The introduction then draws a parallel between AD and PD by suggesting that SCD may also serve as an intermediate stage between normal cognition and MCI in PD patients.  Neuroimaging studies focusing on PD patients with SCD have indicated reduced FDG metabolism in specific areas of the cortex, including the middle frontal, middle temporal, and occipital regions, as well as the angular gyrus. These findings suggest that there may be early pathological changes associated with SCD in PD.  Furthermore, follow-up studies have shown that PD patients with SCD have a significantly higher risk of developing MCI and dementia compared to those without SCD at baseline. However, it is worth noting that there are some inconsistent results in studies regarding the association between SCD and cognitive dysfunction. Some research has found a correlation between SCD and depression, anxiety, or other mood-related features rather than cognitive impairment.  For example, one study by Barbosa considered subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) as a form of SCD and found that the severity of SCC was related to depression rather than Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores in PD patients with normal cognition. This suggests that clinicians should be alert to affective disorders in PD patients with SCD.  In another study led by Baschi, subjective memory complaints (SMC) were defined as forms of SCD. The results indicated a significant association between PD-SCD and anxiety when compared to PD without SCD.  Overall, cognitive impairment in PD poses a substantial financial burden on society as well as caregivers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify cognitive decline as early as possible. However , studies specifically targeting PD-SCD have been limited in terms of quantity. Furthermore, there is currently no consensus regarding the definition of SCD, nor is there a gold standard evaluation tool for assessing it in PD patients.  Due to these gaps in knowledge and understanding, the aim of this review article is outlined. The review aims to provide an overview of how SCD has been used as a diagnostic criterion in studies on PD. It also aims to describe the possible correlation between SCD and objective cognitive impairment, with the ultimate goal of recognizing SCD as an early indicator or at-risk state and enabling clinicians to predict conversion to PD-associated dementia (PD-D) more accurately.  By conducting this review, it is anticipated that a clearer understanding will emerge regarding the association between SCD and cognitive dysfunction or future cognitive decline in individuals with PD. This will contribute to better identification and early intervention strategies for those at risk.  The authors highlight the importance of addressing cognitive decline promptly due to its significant impact on patients' lives as well as society as a whole. By identifying and diagnosing cognitive impairment earlier, appropriate support systems can be put into place for patients, their caregivers can be better prepared for potential challenges ahead, and resources can be allocated efficiently.  This PubMed article not only emphasizes the clinical implications but also recognizes that further research is needed to establish a consistent definition of SCD specific to PD and develop reliable assessment tools for its evaluation. By providing an updated summary on existing literature related to SCD in PD patients, this review strives to bridge current gaps in knowledge surrounding this important aspect within Parkinson's disease research.  In conclusion, this introduction sets the stage by outlining key points about cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease while emphasizing the significance of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) as an indicator or prodromal stage preceding mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia progression. It highlights neuroimaging findings related to PD-SCD while acknowledging inconsistent results in previous studies. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for further investigation and consensus on defining SCD in PD and establishing assessment tools. The review article's objectives are outlined, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the association between SCD and cognitive impairment, ultimately leading to improved prediction and management of cognitive decline in PD patients.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article starts by highlighting the significance of viral hepatitis as a major global public health issue. It emphasizes that millions of individuals suffer from viral hepatitis every year, and in 2015, it caused 1.34 million fatalities worldwide. The majority of these deaths were due to chronic liver disease or primary liver cancer.  The introduction points out that the death rate from viral hepatitis has been increasing over time and now it can be compared to other major communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malaria infections.  It explains that viral hepatitis can be caused by five known hepatotropic viruses: Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis D Virus (HDV), and Hepatitis E Virus (HEV).  The article highlights the fact that a large number of individuals do not have access to screening and treatment for hepatitis, leading to chronic liver disease and cancer mortality. The World Health Organization is urging countries to take action in increasing knowledge, diagnosis/testing, and treatment services for this condition.  Specifically discussing HAV and HEV infections, which are enterically transmitted pathogens with sporadic infections or outbreaks of Acute Viral Hepatitis (AVH). The transmission route for HAV is mainly fecal-oral.  Regarding HBV infection in India specifically, it mentions that it affects approximately 240 million people worldwide while chronic HCV affects around 130-150 million. Chronic hepatitis affects about 400 million individuals globally with the Asia-Pacific region being highly impacted.  The introduction also states that both HBV and HCV infections are primarily transmitted through the parenteral route. Chronic infection due to these viruses can lead to serious consequences such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore, given their similarities in terms of distribution, hepatotropism, disease transmission patterns leading to chronic infection with possible outcomes like liver cirrhosis and HCC, it is mentioned that there is no standard of care for HBV and HCV due to the individualized nature of each infection.  The article highlights the importance of studying the prevalence of viral hepatitis in India. It states that this review aims to summarize the prevalence of viral hepatitis in India by analyzing peer-reviewed articles published between February 2000 and February 2021. Additionally, it aims to review determinant factors specific to the Indian region.  Lastly, a brief description is provided about Hepatitis as an inflammatory disease of the liver according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), while also mentioning a funnel plot as a graphical representation used to detect systematic heterogeneity and publication bias.  Overall, this introduction sets the stage for understanding why viral hepatitis is a significant public health issue globally and specifically in India. It highlights key statistics regarding its impact on mortality rates and emphasizes the need for increased knowledge, diagnosis/testing, and treatment services. The introduction of this PubMed article continues by stating the objective of the current review, which is to study the overall prevalence of viral hepatitis in India. The authors intend to do this by analyzing peer-reviewed articles published from February 2000 to February 2021.  This objective is important because understanding the magnitude and prevalence of viral hepatitis in a specific region like India can help inform public health interventions and strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. By reviewing existing literature on viral hepatitis in India, researchers can identify trends, risk factors, and areas that require further attention.  The article mentions that studying determinant factors specific to the Indian region is another aim of this review. This implies that apart from assessing prevalence rates, the authors will also investigate what factors contribute to viral hepatitis occurrences in India. These determinant factors may include demographic characteristics, geographic distribution, socioeconomic conditions, cultural practices related to transmission modes (such as blood transfusion or unsafe injection practices), healthcare infrastructure availability or accessibility issues for diagnosis and treatment services.  Moreover, the introduction briefly introduces two key concepts: ""funnel plot"" and ""intervention effect"". A funnel plot is a graphical tool used in research studies assessing publication bias or heterogeneity among individual study results. It helps visualize whether there is an asymmetrical distribution of effect sizes (e.g., odds ratios or relative risks) across studies included in a systematic review/meta-analysis. Publication bias refers to studies with statistically significant findings being more likely to be published than those with non-significant outcomes or negative results.  The intervention effect represents an estimation/measurement used within each individual study included in a systematic review/meta-analysis where researchers examine if certain interventions impact disease outcomes/progression rates/prevalence/other relevant indicators related to viral hepatitis in this case).  By mentioning these concepts briefly at this stage/model description step within their introduction section (and providing a reference), authors indicate their intention for conducting rigorous analysis while minimizing potential biases commonly observed across studies.  In summary, the introduction of the PubMed article discusses the importance of studying viral hepatitis in India.

"In this introduction, the authors highlight the eye as a prime target for innovative genetic therapies due to its accessibility and the ease of drug administration. They specifically focus on inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) as a forefront disease for which gene therapies are being developed.  The authors emphasize the urgent need for therapies to cure IRDs, given their high prevalence and significant economic and psychological burden. While gene replacement therapy has shown promise for the treatment of IRDs, there are limitations in delivering genes that are too large or expressed in multiple isoforms in the human retina.  The introduction then introduces RNA therapeutics as an alternative approach to gene therapy. RNA therapeutics have the advantage of reversible changes in transcriptomic sequence without inducing permanent genomic changes like DNA editing techniques. The three main types of RNA therapeutics mentioned are antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), RNA interference (RNAi), and RNA editing therapies.  The authors discuss ongoing clinical investigations on ASOs for several IRDs, such as CEP290- and USH2A-associated IRDs. They also mention preclinical development of RNAi therapeutics for autosomal dominant RP (adRP) using a dual RNAi suppression strategy coupled with a gene replacement strategy.  Furthermore, they introduce RNA editing as another type of therapeutic approach derived from post-transcriptional modifications in humans. A specific type known as A-to-I editing is described, where adenosine is converted into inosine by enzymes called Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADARs). The catalytically active ADAR enzymes have important roles in recoding proteins and can be harnessed to correct pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs).  Different strategies for therapeutic RNA editing using exogenous or endogenous ADARs are discussed. These include overexpression of ADAR proteins or fusion with other intermediate binding proteins for exogenous approaches, while recruitment of endogenously expressed ADAR enzymes is explored for endogenous approaches. The design of a programmable guide RNA (gRNA) that marks the target adenosine and achieves on-target editing efficiency with minimal off-target effects is a central challenge in RNA editing.  The authors note recent developments in stabilizing gRNA through circularization or chemical modification, which may enhance the feasibility of therapeutic endogenous ADAR editing in an in vivo clinical setting. However, more research is needed to determine the relevance of ocular gene editing and identify suitable delivery vehicles.  Finally, the authors state that this review aims to provide an overview of RNA editing with endogenous ADARs, including its history and recent advancements. They also discuss the potential for using RNA editing as a treatment approach for IRDs. To facilitate understanding of this field, they provide an overview of ADAR enzymes' structure, function, and role before delving into specific aspects of RNA editing with endogenous ADARs.  Overall, this introduction sets the stage for exploring different types of genetic therapies for IRDs and highlights the potential benefits and challenges associated with using RNA therapeutics and specifically targeting ADAR-mediated RNA editing. Continuing with the explanation of the PubMed article, after providing an overview of ADAR enzymes and their conservation across species, the authors delve into the challenges associated with achieving high on-target efficiency and specificity in RNA editing while minimizing off-target editing.  For endogenous ADAR editing, one of the key challenges is improving on-target editing efficiency while limiting bystander editing in the gRNA:target RNA duplex. Bystander editing refers to unintended edits occurring outside of the targeted site. The authors highlight that there have been limitations in achieving high on-target efficiency for endogenous ADAR RNA editing.  On the other hand, exogenous ADAR editing approaches face a different challenge - restricting promiscuous transcriptome-wide off-target edits. Transcriptome-wide off-target effects refer to unintended edits occurring throughout the entire transcriptome rather than at specific target sites. Despite exhibiting high on-target editing rates, exogenous ADAR approaches have been hampered by these off-target effects.  The authors emphasize that overcoming these challenges is crucial for unlocking the utility of ADARs as an effective RNA-editing toolset. Achieving high precision and specificity in RNA edits is essential to ensure safety and therapeutic efficacy while minimizing unwanted changes to other regions of cellular transcripts.  The review aims to discuss recent developments and strategies employed in RNA editing with endogenous ADARs specifically. By outlining historical context and advancements in this field, it provides a comprehensive understanding of using endogenous ADARs as therapeutic tools for IRDs.  Additionally, since an understanding of both structure and function are important for comprehending designs, strategies, and challenges involved in utilizing RNA-editing techniques with endogenous ADARs successfully; an overview covering these aspects related to ADAR enzymes will precede further discussions regarding specific aspects linked specifically to utilizing endogenous ADARS during gene therapy applications targeting IRDs.  In conclusion, this PubMed article highlights how genetic therapies targeted at inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) have made significant advancements, with a focus on the potential of RNA therapeutics and RNA editing using endogenous ADARs as a treatment strategy. The article outlines the challenges associated with achieving specific and efficient editing and addresses recent developments in the field. By providing an overview of ADAR enzymes' function, structure, and role, the review aims to enhance understanding of utilizing endogenous ADARs for IRD treatment.",explain

"This PubMed article discusses the health-seeking behavior of communities in Western Uganda regarding schistosomiasis treatment when mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel (PZQ) is delayed. Schistosomiasis is a significant public health issue, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, affecting over 240 million people. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using PZQ for MDA along with social mobilization and health education to control and prevent schistosomiasis.  Despite these interventions, it is not clear where communities go for PZQ treatment when MDA is not available. The goal of this study was to explore the health-seeking behaviors of communities along Lake Albert in Western Uganda during such periods to inform the implementation policy for achieving WHO's 2030 target of 75% coverage and uptake.  Schistosomiasis, one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), mainly affects sub-Saharan Africa, with Schistosoma mansoni being most prevalent in Uganda. Current control measures include preventive chemotherapy through MDA targeting school-going children aged 5-14 years old and adults in specific situations. Other measures include improving water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH), health education and sensitization activities, as well as snail control.  The WHO classifies schistosomiasis infection endemic areas into three levels: low (<10%), moderate (10-49%), and high (≥50%). They also recommend administering PZQ at least once every two years for low-endemic areas, once a year for moderate-endemic areas, and twice a year for high-endemic areas. However, despite these recommendations, Uganda has struggled to achieve the desired medication uptake rates among both school-going children and adult communities.  To ensure optimal outcomes and sustainability of PZQ uptake in Uganda's case specifically, there is a need to improve the implementation strategy of MDA. Additionally, individuals experiencing schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms should always seek PZQ treatment. Some common signs and symptoms include skin rash, fever, body aches, breathing difficulties, diarrhea and constipation, blood in the feces, and swollen bellies. Advanced stages of the disease may lead to liver fibrosis, intestinal ulcers, high blood pressure, stunted growth in children, cognitive impairment in children, and infertility in women.  Health-seeking behavior refers to the activities individuals undertake when they perceive themselves as having a health problem or being ill to find an appropriate remedy. Previous studies conducted worldwide have shown that people seek treatment from biomedical or traditional healthcare sources or both. The choice of treatment source can be influenced by various factors such as age, sex, education level, socioeconomic status, social networks ethnic beliefs attitudes among others.  Regarding schistosomiasis treatment with PZQ specifically, studies have shown varied findings. In some communities of Nigeria and Tanzania studied previously participants sought medication from both traditional and modern healthcare sources; however more regarded modern medicine as more effective. Factors such as absence or unawareness of MDA programs fear of side effects being busy or pregnant can contribute to not receiving PZQ drug treatment.  Gender disparities have also been observed regarding access to healthcare services for NTDs including schistosomiasis due to inequalities and power dynamics related to decision-making on seeking treatment finances. People with biomedical knowledge tend to seek treatments from modern sources if they perceive the symptoms as severe acute lack of health workers limited drug supplies long distances poor road networks lack of health information have also been identified as barriers hindering communities from accessing healthcare facilities specifically for schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms.  While previous studies have focused on health-seeking behaviors related to schistosomiasis treatment through MDA programs using PZQ these studies did not provide insight into where populations turn to when MDA programs are absent.  In Uganda, the PZQ-MDA program has been implemented for nearly 20 years, and the drugs are procured with support from development partners such as the schistosomiasis control initiative (SCI), ARISE, and ASCEND. The Ministry of Health's vector control division manages drug distribution to the districts.  This comprehensive introduction provides background information on schistosomiasis, its prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa and Uganda specifically, current control measures through MDA using PZQ, challenges in achieving optimal medication uptake rates, factors influencing health-seeking behaviors for various illnesses including schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms, previous studies' findings on health-seeking behaviors regarding schistosomiasis treatment using PZQ, and the need to understand where communities seek treatment in the absence of MDA programs.",explain
"This introduction provides background information on the tobacco control program initiated by Beijing, China, which aligns with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It highlights the significance of assessing the impact of this policy through a Health Impact Assessment (HIA).   The introduction begins by emphasizing China's status as the world's largest tobacco consumer, with a consumption exceeding that of 39 other countries combined. It also states that smoking in China has resulted in numerous fatalities and high rates of secondhand smoke exposure among non-smokers.  Although China signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2005, it has taken time to fulfill its responsibilities. The country's tobacco monopoly has limited national progress towards implementing comprehensive measures recommended by the FCTC, such as smoking bans in public places.  However, there is evidence of progress at a local level, including Beijing. The city successfully implemented a smoking ban during the 2008 Olympics and later established several smoke-free regulations. In June 2015, Beijing introduced its comprehensive tobacco control regulation following smoke control measures and tax reforms at a national level.  Beijing's comprehensive policy aligns with six MPOWER measures recommended by WHO: Monitoring tobacco use; Protecting people from tobacco smoking; Offering help to quit tobacco; Warning about the dangers of tobacco; Enforcing tobacco advertising, promotion & sponsorship restrictions; Raising taxes on tobacco. These measures include bans on indoor and certain outdoor public spaces, higher taxes on cigarettes, anti-tobacco advertising efforts, cessation support systems establishment and media campaigns.  The introduction proceeds to provide statistical evidence supporting positive outcomes resulting from Beijing's policy implementation since 2015. Trends indicate reductions in cigarette sales per person as well as declines in smoking prevalence and secondhand smoke exposure over three years. Additionally, there have been significant decreases in hospital admissions for stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders following smoke control measures.  To evaluate these impacts comprehensively through an HIA process requires defining a set of indicators. Previous research on the Portuguese smoking prevention and tobacco control law used specific indicators such as mortality rates, hospital admissions, and smoking prevalence. However, those studies did not mention a clear indicator selection procedure nor comprehensive coverage. The WHO recommended four essential indicators for measuring the effects of tobacco control legislation but lacked process evaluation and focused solely on outcome evaluation.  Considering Beijing's unique local measures and the need for a more inclusive set of indicators, this study aims to identify appropriate indicators for scoping an HIA to assess Beijing's comprehensive tobacco control policy. The findings may serve as a reference for future HIAs in China or other developing countries.  In summary, this introduction provides context about China's significant tobacco consumption problem and previous efforts towards tobacco control. It highlights Beijing's comprehensive policy as well as positive outcomes associated with its implementation. Finally, it emphasizes the need to develop a set of indicators through an HIA approach to assess the policy comprehensively. This PubMed article focuses on the scoping of a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) to assess Beijing's comprehensive tobacco control policy. It recognizes the need to identify a comprehensive set of indicators that can effectively measure the impact of this policy and serve as a reference for future HIAs on tobacco control in China and other developing countries.  The introduction highlights the importance of conducting an HIA in evaluating the health effects of major policies, programs, or projects. HIA involves a combination of procedures, methods, and tools that judge the potential effects on population health and their distribution within that population.  The study acknowledges previous research conducted by Costa et al., which applied HIA methodology to assess Portugal's smoking prevention and tobacco control law. However, it notes that while some indicators were measured following this policy implementation, there was no mention of how these indicators were selected or whether they provided a comprehensive assessment.  In contrast to previous studies, this article emphasizes the need for a scientific indicator selection procedure when conducting an HIA in Beijing. It points out that Beijing's tobacco control policy includes various local measures like tobacco control complaint systems. Therefore, it suggests including process evaluation alongside outcome evaluation and expanding beyond just four essential indicators recommended by WHO: mortality rates, tobacco consumption levels, smoking prevalence rates, and evaluations of tobacco control policies.  The overall aim is not only to assess the outcomes but also evaluate processes such as compliance with smoke-free regulations or changes in public perceptions regarding smoking behavior. By developing a more comprehensive set of indicators through proper scoping techniques during an HIA process, it becomes possible to obtain more detailed insights into how effective Beijing's policy has been at reducing smoking-related harms.  The article concludes by emphasizing that successful identification of these indicators will contribute significantly not only to assessing Beijing's comprehensive tobacco control policy but also providing guidance for future HIAs focused on similar policies in China or other developing countries facing high rates of tobacco consumption.  Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the study's objective, which is to identify a comprehensive set of indicators for scoping an HIA of Beijing's tobacco control policy. It emphasizes the need for a well-defined indicator selection process and highlights previous shortcomings in indicator selection from other research studies. By conducting this study, the authors aim to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and impact of tobacco control measures implemented in Beijing while offering guidance for future HIAs in similar settings.",explain

"The introduction of this PubMed article starts by highlighting the significance of color in our perception and evaluation of food. It states that when we decide to buy or consume a food product, we instinctively scrutinize it visually, and color is one of the most prominent visual cues that contribute to our sensory experience of food. The article mentions existing research that supports the idea that the color of food psychologically influences our expectation of flavor even before we taste it.  The introduction then emphasizes how consumers are primarily inclined towards a particular food item based on its visual appeal, specifically referring to the color. This aspect aids consumers in predicting the flavor and taste they can expect from a certain food. The perception and understanding of color are described as deep-rooted and intuitive in human beings, with colors historically being used to differentiate between ripe/unripe or fresh/spoiled fruits, vegetables, and meat.  With increasing demand for packaged foods globally, various industry players have added different types of artificial colorants to enhance their products' appearance. Initially, natural colorants derived from plants and microbes were used but progressively replaced by synthetic ones processed from coal tar compounds containing azo dyes. The introduction also mentions natural identical man-made colors such as riboflavin.  The massive use of these added food colorants led not only to their inclusion in almost every packaged or processed food but also extended into prepared foods in restaurants and other outlets. However, concerns about health hazards associated with these synthetic colors emerged predominantly among children.  The paper points out that using permitted as well as non-permitted synthetic colors poses global concerns regarding their toxicities and potential adulterations in different countries. India is specifically highlighted due to its rich diversity regarding taste, smell, and especially colorful foods—the distinctive quality aiding the growth of both synthetic (SFC) and natural food colorant industries.  While consumer awareness about health has increased the demand for natural alternatives worldwide—including India—this surge created another serious issue: misbranding natural colorants as synthetic ones. The article emphasizes the misuse of the label ""natural"" by some producers to attract consumers, along with adulteration and the lack of proper legal regulations in processing natural colors. As a result, there is an urgent need for accurate labeling to distinguish between natural and synthetic colorants, as well as the implementation of systematic standards regarding their processing and use.  The introduction concludes by mentioning a proposed label for distinguishing the incorporation of natural colorants in food and highlighting that despite India's reputation for diverse and colorful foods, very few studies have been published on the status of SFCs (synthetic food colorants) and natural colorants in the country. The authors imply that this article aims to address this knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive discussion on the rapid growth of the Indian food colorant market, reports on side effects associated with these additives, and necessary regulations. The authors argue that stringent regulations should be implemented alongside government-funded research initiatives to tackle these growing concerns effectively.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article begins by highlighting the ongoing burden of pediatric malnutrition in developing countries, specifically focusing on Southern Asia. It emphasizes that malnutrition is a crucial risk factor for morbidity and mortality worldwide. The introduction also mentions that approximately 1.9 billion people in the Asia and Pacific region have limited access to healthy diets, emphasizing the critical need for improving diet quality, especially in children.  The article draws attention to the differentiation between nondisease-related malnutrition (related to environmental factors) and disease-related or illness-related malnutrition (caused by underlying diseases). Nondisease-related malnutrition occurs due to limited food access or decreased dietary intake, resulting in an imbalance relative to nutritional needs and impacting growth, development, and overall health. Disease-related malnutrition can progress as a result of increased catabolism, decreased appetite, or increased energy losses due to acute or chronic disease.  The impact of disease-related malnutrition is discussed with respect to increased hospital stays and financial burdens. For example, a study conducted in the Netherlands estimated annual medical costs of €80 million for disease-related malnutrition in hospitalized children.  It is emphasized that long-term nutrition support is necessary for children with chronic diseases to prevent growth faltering, impaired development, and poor health-related quality of life. The causes of malnourishment vary among different chronic diseases such as congenital heart disease (CHD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic liver disease (CLD), malignancy, or infectious diseases like diarrhea, AIDS tuberculosis,and parasite infections.  The importance of regular assessment and management for children with chronic diseases is stressed because nutritional deficiencies make them more susceptible to infections due to a weakened immune response. The interlinked factors contributing are undernourishment itself along with infectious diseases and immune system impairment.  The authors note that their research focuses on chronic malnourishment in children with various chronic illnesses which has received less attention compared to malnourishment caused by infectious diseases in developing countries. They highlight the need for comprehensive assessments, including anthropometry, clinical evaluation, feeding tolerance observations, and biochemistry analysis, to ensure adequate nutrition.  The introduction discusses the challenges in recognizing and addressing malnutrition due to lack of uniform definitions, variable screening practices, and an inadequate recognition of nutrition as a crucial component of patient care. It also acknowledges that resource limitations in developing countries affect assessment availability and regular monitoring for achieving favorable outcomes.  Furthermore, the study's concept is traced back to an expert meeting with six child health professionals who discussed the current challenges in managing malnutrition in chronically ill children. The purpose of this study is stated as reviewing available articles on measuring malnutrition specifically within pediatric chronic diseases in developing countries where limited resources restrict identification of nutritional status.  Overall, this introduction sets the stage for understanding the significance of pediatric malnutrition globally and highlights specific factors related to nondisease-related malnutrition versus disease-related or illness-related malnutrition. It emphasizes the need for improved nutrition support for children with chronic diseases while outlining some key challenges faced in implementing effective strategies. The subsequent sections of the article are likely to delve deeper into the specific objectives, methods, and findings of the study. The researchers aim to address the gap in understanding and managing malnutrition in children with chronic diseases, particularly within resource-limited settings.  To accomplish this goal, they conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature on measuring malnutrition in pediatric chronic disease. Their focus is primarily on developing countries where there are constraints in identifying nutritional status accurately due to limited resources and complex conditions.  The article thus highlights the importance of anthropometry assessment (e.g., measurement of height, weight, head circumference) as well as clinical evaluation for detecting signs and symptoms related to malnourishment. This includes observations on feeding tolerance and biochemical analyses that provide objective data about nutrient levels in the body.  However, it acknowledges that uniform definitions for malnutrition are lacking across studies and screening practices can vary significantly. Consequently, recognizing malnutrition prevalence rates becomes challenging. The authors emphasize that nutrition should be considered an integral part of patient care and not be overlooked or underrecognized.  Furthermore, it acknowledges resource limitations faced by developing countries when conducting assessments for malnourished children with chronic illnesses. Availability of necessary resources (such as trained healthcare professionals and tools/equipment) along with regular monitoring become essential factors influencing successful outcomes.  The introduction also mentions how this research emerged from an expert meeting where child health professionals discussed current challenges associated with managing malnutrition among chronically ill children. This highlights collaboration among experts as well as their collective effort to address key issues regarding pediatric malnutrition within the context of chronic diseases.  Overall, this introduction sets up a framework for understanding the significance of pediatric malnutrition within developing countries while emphasizing its connection to chronic diseases. It describes various factors contributing to both disease-related and nondisease-related forms of malnourishment while underscoring the need for adequate nutrition support throughout childhood illness trajectories.  By outlining challenges related to identifying nutritional status accurately and the limitations faced by resource-limited settings, the article creates a context for understanding the relevance and objectives of the study. This information serves as a foundation for subsequent sections that likely delve into specific methods employed by the researchers to meet their objectives and present their findings.",explain

The article mentions that research has been conducted to analyze various manufacturing factors that influence the quality of livestock products, with attempts made to optimize quality from all aspects. It stresses that ensuring adequate safe food production is mandatory for food security, as there is a growing demand for food that poses a threat to food safety.  Furthermore, the introduction notes that maintaining food quality and safety continually poses new challenges, resulting in millions suffering from contaminated foods each year. The focus on quality products is crucial for food security and requires systematic research throughout each stage, from grass and fodder production to transportation.  In industrialized countries where consumers demand superior quality and safer foods, ensuring food safety becomes a major concern. However, managing Animal Products Processing within traditional supply chains presents challenges such as inadvertent contamination or residues despite established standards.  The global economy experiences significant social and economic losses due to mislabeling, misbranding, contamination, or adulteration of food products. Microbial contamination often occurs when improper management affects various stages of the food supply chain – including rearing on farms – endangering consumers' health.  The introduction points out that approximately 600 million people fall ill annually after consuming contaminated foods globally. To address this issue effectively, genomic testing enables detection concerning meat speciation or genetically modified ingredients/products. Proteomics facilitates understanding species-related changes based on technological processes or storage conditions while Metabolomics helps indicate origin or means of manufacture through tools like mass spectrometry (MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy techniques.

They enable real-time data querying, management, efficient tracing systems, transparency in supply chains along with improved consumer trust in food safety.  The introduction concludes by highlighting blockchain technology's promising applications – providing a tamper-proof, transparent, shared, secure system that revolutionizes different areas of the food sector - especially when combined with smart contracts.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article provides an overview of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cell wall and its role in the pathogenicity of tuberculosis. It begins by highlighting that the Mtb cell wall is known to be the most complex membrane among all bacteria. The architecture of this wall includes various components such as peptidoglycans, galactofuran, arabinofuran, and mycolic acids.  It is explained that mycolic acids form a lipid barrier perpendicular to the membrane plane, which is a defining feature of Mtb. The presence of mycolic acids contributes to immune evasion mechanisms employed by Mtb. For example, it increases hydrophobicity and masks pathogen-associated molecular patterns with phthiocerol dimycocerosates, preventing detection by toll-like receptor 2 with sulfoglycolipids. These strategies inhibit bacterial detection and prevent activation of cytokine responses.  The introduction further describes how Mtb utilizes components of its cell wall to alter the processing and availability of peptide antigens for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules. Additionally, these cell wall-derived molecules can inhibit innate immunity processes such as autophagy.  The article then shifts focus to discuss the initial interaction between Mtb and host cells during primary infection. Lung epithelial cells (EpCs) and alveolar macrophages are identified as the first cells encountering Mtb in lung tissue. These cells play a crucial role in sensing Mtb through their immune response mechanisms including antimicrobial peptides.  Despite efforts made towards eradicating tuberculosis globally, it remains a significant public health threat causing millions of deaths annually. The article highlights that drug-resistant forms of TB pose even greater challenges due to limited treatment options available. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new therapies to combat drug-resistant TB.  Furthermore, it acknowledges recent diversion in healthcare resources towards managing the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in neglecting TB control programs. This shift in focus may contribute to the resurgence of TB as a leading cause of mortality.  The article emphasizes that Mtb is primarily transmitted via aerosolized particles and mentions that a significant percentage of infected individuals develop granulomas containing the bacteria. Interestingly, some individuals living in high-risk areas for TB show resistance to Mtb infection. They exhibit immediate elimination of Mtb through innate immunity mechanisms, suggesting the importance of innate immune responses against Mtb.  Finally, it concludes by emphasizing that the complexity of the Mtb cell wall is unique among bacteria and plays a critical role in its pathogenesis. The cell wall serves as a barrier against antibiotics and host immune responses.  In summary, this introduction provides an overview of the complex structure and functions of the Mtb cell wall, its role in immune evasion strategies employed by Mtb, potential interactions with host cells during primary infection, challenges posed by drug-resistant forms of TB, and the need for new therapies to combat these challenges. Moving forward, the article discusses the impact of Mtb on host cells at a molecular level. It mentions that transcriptomic analysis has revealed that multidrug-resistant Mtb (MDR-Mtb) is capable of modifying acetylation/methylation patterns in infected macrophages and lymphocytes. This leads to oxidative stress and premature cellular aging, which correlates with increased intracellular survival and dissemination of the bacteria.  Additionally, the article highlights how some mycobacterial products can induce epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation or alterations in non-coding RNA expression. These changes promote upregulation of immune response activation, further influencing the interaction between Mtb and host cells.  The alarming statistic that 1.5 million people died from TB in 2021 is mentioned, with Mtb being identified as the second leading infectious killer after COVID-19. The diversion of resources towards managing the pandemic has had a significant impact on TB control programs, including vaccination efforts and surveillance for multidrug-resistant strains.  Furthermore, drug-resistant TB is acknowledged as a major public health challenge due to its complexity and limited treatment options available. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), which refers to strains resistant to multiple first-line drugs as well as some second-line drugs, presents an even greater concern.  The article emphasizes the urgent need for new, more effective therapies against drug-resistant TB. It suggests that antimicrobial peptides may be a feasible option for improving conventional therapy and addressing this pressing public health challenge.  Importantly, it mentions that Mtb primarily spreads from person to person through aerosolized particles. While around 90% of individuals who are infected with Mtb are able to spontaneously control infection and eliminate mycobacteria without developing active disease or further transmission (termed latent tuberculosis infection), there are certain populations living in densely populated areas who appear to have resistance against Mtb infection altogether.  These individuals seem to possess innate immunity mechanisms that allow for immediate elimination of Mtb. Innate phagocytes, epithelial cells, soluble antimicrobial molecules, innate invariant T cells, and natural killer cells located in the mucosal and alveolar regions of the bronchial pulmonary airway mucosa demonstrate a robust response against Mtb.  The resistance exhibited by these individuals suggests that innate immunity plays a crucial role as a natural effector against Mtb. Understanding the mechanisms behind this resistance can potentially provide insights into novel strategies for combating TB.  To conclude, this PubMed article emphasizes the complexity of the Mtb cell wall and its impact on pathogenesis. It also highlights challenges posed by drug-resistant TB and calls for the development of new therapies to address this issue. The importance of studying host-pathogen interactions at a molecular level is emphasized, particularly in relation to immune responses and epigenetic changes induced by Mtb. The article reiterates the urgent need for improved TB control efforts given its significant impact on public health worldwide.",explain
"The introduction of this PubMed article highlights the ongoing global challenge of achieving high COVID-19 vaccine booster coverage. It emphasizes the need for effective communication interventions to improve acceptance and uptake of booster doses. The introduction also acknowledges the critical role that COVID-19 vaccination plays in controlling the pandemic and protecting vulnerable individuals.  The article points out that while primary course vaccination coverage in Australia is over 96%, booster dose coverage has stalled at just over 70%. Similar suboptimal uptake has been observed in other countries, with the United Kingdom achieving approximately 70% booster dose coverage, while Europe and the United States have achieved just over 50% and 43% respectively.  Motivation to receive a vaccine is identified as an important factor influencing uptake. The experience with previous pandemic vaccines, such as the H1N1 influenza vaccine, has shown that low motivation can be a barrier if not addressed. Factors affecting motivation include personal and collective health benefits, non-health benefits like travel opportunities, as well as moral values related to individual liberties and personal health decision-making.  Based on these findings, emphasizing motivational factors in persuasive messaging could potentially increase intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Previous research has shown that persuasive messages emphasizing personal or community health benefits can be effective but results are mixed. Some studies found messages emphasizing personal health benefits had a larger effect on intentions than those focusing on benefits to others. Other experiments found that messages promoting altruistic behavior or community benefits were more effective.  However, there is limited research on how messages emphasizing personal agency in making vaccination decisions impact intentions for receiving COVID-19 boosters specifically.  Given these gaps in knowledge, it is unclear which types of messages have the greatest effect on intention to receive a COVID-19 booster dose, especially in populations with relatively low risk of encountering COVID-19 combined with restrictive public health measures like those experienced in Australia during this study.  The study aims to compare different persuasive messages' effects on intention to receive a COVID-19 booster dose in Australian adults. It is part of a larger study investigating factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and developing messaging strategies to support vaccine acceptance in various populations.  The findings of this study can provide important insights for health authorities and other stakeholders in crafting effective communications to encourage uptake of COVID-19 booster doses, especially through written channels such as emails, which were used during the vaccine rollout in Australia.  Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the study by highlighting the importance of addressing communication challenges related to booster doses, summarizing relevant literature on messaging effectiveness for vaccination intentions, and specifying the specific context and goals of the current research. In addition to the context and goals of the study, the introduction also describes the specific conditions experienced in Australia during the time of the experiment. The country had relatively low COVID-19 case numbers compared to other regions during the first two years of the pandemic. However, there were strict public health restrictions in place, including border closures and lockdowns, as part of Australia's pursuit of a COVID-19 elimination strategy.  This unique combination of low disease risk and stringent measures provides an important context for understanding vaccine acceptance in Australia. The study aims to fill a gap in knowledge by investigating which persuasive messages are most effective at encouraging Australian adults to receive booster doses under such circumstances.  The introduction acknowledges that evidence regarding messaging effectiveness for booster doses is currently limited. Prior studies have focused more on primary vaccination courses and general COVID-19 vaccination intentions rather than specifically targeting booster doses. Therefore, this study contributes to filling this research gap by analyzing how persuasive messages can impact intention to receive a COVID-19 booster dose.  Furthermore, it highlights that written communications (such as emails) were used extensively for public communication during Australia's vaccination rollout. This underscores the importance of developing effective messaging strategies through written channels.  The article mentions that this study is part of a larger research effort investigating factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance not only in Australia but also elsewhere. This suggests that insights gained from studying communication interventions for booster dose acceptance among Australian adults may have broader applications across different populations facing similar challenges.  By providing additional evidence on effective messaging strategies, this research aims to contribute valuable insights that can inform health authorities and other stakeholders internationally about how best to encourage uptake of COVID-19 vaccine boosters.  Overall, the introduction sets up a clear rationale for conducting this study by identifying existing gaps in knowledge regarding persuasive messaging effectiveness for booster doses and highlighting specific contextual factors relevant to vaccine acceptance in Australia at that time. It emphasizes both practical implications for improving vaccine uptake and potential broader applications beyond the studied population.",explain
"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of understanding vulnerability and resilience in assessing pandemic risks. Arctic communities, such as those in Alaska, face unique challenges due to their remote location, extreme weather conditions, and cultural diversity. Traditional vulnerability assessments that use universal indicators may not capture the full complexity of these communities' capacity to withstand and recover from a pandemic.  Recognizing vulnerability and resilience as two distinct but interconnected dimensions is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of pandemic risk. Vulnerability refers to the susceptibility of a community to the impacts of disease outbreaks, taking into account factors such as healthcare access, socioeconomic status, and demographic characteristics. Resilience, on the other hand, assesses a community's ability to cope with and bounce back from these impacts.  This study focuses on developing a pandemic vulnerability-resilience framework specifically for Alaska's Arctic communities. By considering the unique cultural aspects and socioeconomic factors that shape these communities' capacity to respond to pandemics, we aim to provide more accurate risk assessments.  To assess vulnerability and resilience in Alaska's Arctic communities regarding COVID-19 or future pandemics, we developed indices that capture relevant factors specific to this region. These include demographic data such as age distribution and population density; social determinants of health like access to healthcare facilities; economic indicators like income levels; infrastructure factors including transportation systems; cultural considerations such as language barriers; governance structures at local levels; and environmental conditions like climate change effects.  Using these indices, we analyzed census areas and boroughs within Alaska's Arctic region for their level of vulnerability and resilience. Interestingly, our findings challenge the assumption that highly vulnerable areas always experience severe epidemiological outcomes. We found that some highly vulnerable areas managed better than expected due to their strong resilience capacities.  Specifically, our analysis revealed that census areas or boroughs with higher resilience showed lower rates of cumulative deaths per 100 000 people as well as lower case fatality ratios compared to less resilient areas. This suggests that resilience plays a significant role in reducing the impact of a pandemic on a community.  Understanding the interaction between vulnerability and resilience is crucial for accurately identifying populations and communities at the highest risk or with the greatest needs. This knowledge allows for more efficient allocation of resources and services before, during, and after a pandemic. By adopting a resilience-vulnerability-focused approach, policymakers and public health officials can better prioritize efforts to support communities in remote regions or those with large Indigenous populations.  The framework developed in this study can be easily adapted to assess the potential effects of COVID-19 or future health crises in other remote regions around the world, particularly those with similar demographic characteristics or cultural diversity. By incorporating both vulnerability and resilience into risk assessments, we can foster greater preparedness and strengthen community capacities to respond to pandemics effectively.  In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of recognizing vulnerability and resilience as distinct dimensions when assessing pandemic risks in Arctic communities. By understanding how these two factors interact, policymakers can make more informed decisions regarding resource allocation pre-, during-, and post-pandemic situations. The findings from Alaska's case study also offer insights for other remote regions grappling with similar challenges related to pandemics or public health crises involving diverse populations.",continue

"Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important oilseed and cash crop that is cultivated worldwide. However, its growth, development, and eventual production are significantly affected by various biotic stresses such as fungal diseases, viral infections, bacterial pathogens, nematodes, and insect pests. These biotic stresses not only cause substantial yield losses but also pose challenges to sustainable peanut production.  To better understand the response and tolerance mechanisms of peanut to these biotic stresses, high-throughput Omics approaches have been increasingly employed in recent years. Omics technologies encompass a range of disciplines including genomics, transcriptomics (study of gene expression), proteomics (study of proteins), metabolomics (study of metabolites), miRNAomics (study of microRNAs), epigenomics (study of epigenetic modifications), and phenomics (study of phenotypic traits). Integrating the data obtained from these diverse Omics techniques provides a comprehensive understanding of the biological processes occurring in peanuts under specific stress conditions.  In this review, we focus specifically on the advances made in Omics research on peanut response to biotic stresses. We first discuss the primary types of biotic stresses that threaten sustainable peanut production. Fungal diseases are one major concern for peanut cultivation worldwide, with pathogens such as Aspergillus flavus causing aflatoxin contamination in peanuts which poses serious health risks for humans. Viral infections can also lead to significant yield losses through symptoms like leaf mosaic or necrosis. Bacterial pathogens can infect various parts of the plant including leaves, stems, pods leading to wilting or rotting. Nematodes are microscopic worms that feed on plant roots causing stunted growth and reduced yields. Insect pests such as thrips and aphids damage peanuts by feeding on their foliage or transmitting viruses.  We then explore how multi-Omics technologies have been employed for peanut research and breeding under biotic stresses. By integrating the functional genomics data with other Omics techniques, researchers have been able to unravel the relationships between peanut genomes and phenotypes under specific stress conditions. For example, genomics studies have identified candidate genes involved in disease resistance or tolerance. Transcriptomics analyses have elucidated molecular pathways activated during pathogen infection. Proteomics research has provided insights into the key proteins involved in plant defense mechanisms against biotic stresses.  The advances made in various peanut Omics under biotic stresses are also discussed. Genomic studies have facilitated the identification of genes related to disease resistance or susceptibility using various approaches like genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Transcriptomic analysis has allowed the identification of differentially expressed genes in response to pathogens, providing valuable information about defense mechanisms activated by peanuts during infection.  Proteomic studies have enabled the identification of proteins involved in crucial biological processes such as signal transduction, defense responses, and stress tolerance. Metabolomics approaches have helped identify metabolites that play important roles in plant-pathogen interactions and can serve as biomarkers for disease diagnosis or markers for breeding for resistant varieties.  MiRNAomics studies on peanuts have revealed differentially expressed miRNAs associated with biotic stress responses, providing insights into post-transcriptional gene regulation during infection by pathogens. Epigenomic research has highlighted epigenetic modifications that occur under biotic stresses influencing gene expression patterns thus impacting plant defenses.  Phenomic analysis involves high-throughput screening of large collections of genetic resources or germplasm for traits related to stress tolerance or resistance coupled with accurate phenotypic measurements at different developmental stages which enables breeders to identify promising varieties more efficiently.  Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by peanut Omics research under biotic stresses including data integration and interpretation limitations, availability of well-annotated reference genomes among cultivated peanut varieties from diverse geographic regions worldwide along with great diversity within peanut populations making it necessary to capture the entire genetic structure to understand complex interactions between peanut genomes and biotic stresses. Additionally, the development of cost-effective and easy-to-use bioinformatics tools for data analysis is crucial.  Nevertheless, there are enormous opportunities for the application of Omics technologies in peanut breeding programs to develop improved cultivars that are more resistant or tolerant to biotic stresses. Such advancements can contribute significantly towards sustainable food production by enhancing yield stability and quality. Future research directions focus on integrating multi-Omics datasets with advanced bioinformatics techniques, functional validation of candidate genes or markers using genetic manipulation methods like CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology along with precise phenotyping in peanut breeding programs combined with farmer participatory approaches aiming at developing climate-smart varieties.  In conclusion, Omics approaches have provided valuable insights into the response and tolerance mechanisms of peanuts under biotic stresses. These technological advancements have facilitated the discovery of stress-related genes, proteins, metabolites, miRNAs, epigenetic modifications as well as phenotypic traits associated with resistance or tolerance to specific pathogens or pests. Continued research in this field will enable breeders to develop improved varieties that can withstand biotic stresses effectively while fulfilling global food demands sustainably.",continue
"Plant-based dietary patterns, characterized by a high consumption of plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, have gained increasing attention due to their potential health benefits. Numerous studies have demonstrated associations between plant-based diets and a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and obesity.  However, the definition and assessment of plant-based diets can vary widely across studies. To address this issue and facilitate research in the field of plant-based diets and health outcomes, diet quality indices have been developed. These indices aim to provide a standardized methodology for quantifying adherence to a plant-based dietary pattern based on specific food groups or components.  In order to better understand the existing approaches used to develop these indices and their implications for research on plant-based diets, a scoping review was conducted. The review aimed to identify common features among different indices regarding their basis for development (i.e., evidence source), scoring methodology (i.e., how they assign scores based on food intake), and validation approaches (i.e., how well they assess adherence to a plant-based diet).  A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Global Health databases from 1980 to 2022. Studies were included if they assessed plant-based diets in adults using an established methodology with food-based components. Pregnant or lactating individuals were excluded from the analysis.  The search yielded 137 articles that described the development or use of 35 unique plant-based diet quality indices. These articles were published between 2007-2022. The identified indices varied in terms of their basis for development: some were based on epidemiological evidence for associations between foods consumed as part of a plant-based diet pattern and specific health outcomes; others were adaptations or modifications of previously developed diet quality indices; some followed country-specific dietary guidelines, whereas others were based on traditional dietary patterns.  The composition of the indices also varied, with different indices including anywhere between 4 to 33 food groups. However, fruits, vegetables, and grains were consistently included in almost all of the indices. These food groups are key components of plant-based diets due to their high content of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals.  Scoring methodology for the indices varied as well. Some used population-specific percentile cutoffs to assign scores based on the distribution of intake within a specific population. Others used normative cutoffs derived from dietary recommendations or guidelines. Additionally, several indices differentiated between healthy and less healthy plant-based foods when scoring intakes.  Validation methods utilized for these plant-based diet quality indices predominantly included construct validity (assessing how well an index reflects a theoretical construct), reliability (assessing consistency in measurements over time), and criterion validity (comparing an index against a gold standard measure). Construct validity was most commonly assessed among the identified studies.  Overall, this scoping review provides insights into existing approaches used to develop plant-based diet quality indices. It highlights that most of these indices have been derived from epidemiological research and aim to reflect associations between specific foods or dietary patterns and health outcomes. Furthermore, they often differentiate between healthy and less healthy plant-based foods during scoring processes.  To ensure best practice in research on plant-based dietary patterns and their association with health outcomes, researchers should consider factors such as the basis for development of the index they choose to use or modify for their study purposes; methodology used for scoring; validation methods employed; as well as reporting standards related to these aspects.  By evaluating existing plant-based diet quality indices through this scoping review and considering these factors during selection processes in future research studies involving plant-based diets' evaluation is essential towards advancing knowledge on optimal eating patterns that promote human health while minimizing environmental impacts associated with frequently recommended animal-source food consumption.",continue
"The field of tumor-associated microbiota has gained considerable attention in recent years as studies have revealed the presence of microorganisms within tumor tissues. Initially discovered over a century ago, the significance of these microorganisms in cancer development and progression is only now becoming apparent. This emerging area of research requires a transdisciplinary approach, combining techniques from molecular biology, microbiology, and histology to unravel the complexity of the tumor microenvironment.  One of the major challenges in studying tumor-associated microbiota is the low biomass present within tumors. Unlike other microbial ecosystems such as the gut or skin, tumors host a relatively small number of microorganisms. This poses technical and analytical difficulties when trying to identify and characterize these microbes accurately.  To overcome these challenges, researchers have employed advanced sequencing technologies such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing or shotgun metagenomic sequencing to identify microbial communities within tumors. These approaches provide insights into both bacterial species composition and functional potential. Additionally, histological techniques allow for visualization and localization of specific microbes within tumor tissues.  Several studies have started unraveling the diversity and functions of tumor-associated microbiota across various cancers. For instance, researchers identified specific bacterial taxa enriched in certain types of tumors but not in adjacent non-tumor tissues or healthy controls. Furthermore, some studies suggest that certain bacteria may promote tumorigenesis through mechanisms like chronic inflammation or altered metabolism.  The clinical relevance of tumor-associated microbiota is also being investigated extensively. Initial evidence suggests that differences in microbial composition may influence treatment outcomes by modulating immune responses or even drug efficacy. Microbiota-targeted interventions could thus potentially enhance therapeutic responses for patients with cancer.  Furthermore, recent studies indicate that shifts in the composition of gut microbiota can affect systemic anti-tumor immune responses through mechanisms like modulation of dendritic cell function or alteration of T cell subsets at distant sites from primary tumors. This implies that manipulating gut microbiota may hold promise as an adjunct therapy for cancer treatment.  In addition to studying the bacterial component, emerging evidence suggests that viruses and fungi may also be present within tumor tissues. Studies exploring the virome and mycobiome of tumors have provided insights into their potential roles in cancer development and progression. For example, certain tumor-associated viruses have been implicated in oncogenesis by disrupting cellular signaling pathways or promoting genomic instability.  It is evident that tumor-associated microbiota represents a new layer of complexity within the tumor microenvironment. The interactions between cancer cells and the microbial communities co-existing within tumors are likely to influence tumorigenesis, treatment response, and ultimately patient outcomes. As researchers continue to decipher these intricate relationships, they can provide novel therapeutic opportunities for patients with cancer.  In conclusion, the study of tumor-associated microbiota is a rapidly evolving field with significant implications for our understanding of cancer biology and treatment strategies. The transdisciplinary nature of this research requires collaboration among experts from various disciplines to address technical challenges associated with low biomass samples at multiple levels - biological, clinical, analytical - as a unified effort. With continued investigation into this intriguing area of research, we may witness paradigm shifts in our approach towards addressing one of humanity's most formidable challenges - cancer.",continue
"Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of heart muscle diseases characterized by structural and functional abnormalities, leading to impaired cardiac function. They can be classified into different subtypes based on their etiology, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), among others. While environmental factors like hypertension or drug-induced toxicity can contribute to the development of cardiomyopathies, there is growing recognition of the importance of genetic predisposition in the pathogenesis of these conditions.  Genetic studies have identified numerous coding variants within genes encoding components of the cardiac sarcomere or associated molecular pathways that directly contribute to cardiomyopathy development. These include mutations in genes encoding contractile proteins like MYH7 and MYBPC3 in HCM or LMNA and TNNT2 in DCM. However, recent advancements in genomic technologies have revealed that noncoding regions of the genome also harbor potentially pathogenic variants.  Noncoding genetic variants encompass a wide range of changes occurring outside protein-coding regions, including transcriptional enhancers, promoters, intronic sites, and untranslated regions (UTRs). These sequences play critical roles in gene regulation by controlling when and where genes are expressed. Changes within these regulatory elements can disrupt proper gene expression patterns essential for normal cardiac function.  Several studies have identified noncoding variants associated with various types of cardiomyopathy. For instance, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within enhancer elements near key cardiac genes have been linked to an increased risk for HCM. Similarly, variations altering transcription factor binding sites within promoters of myocardial-expressed genes can influence gene expression levels and confer susceptibility to ARVC.  Intronic variations represent another class of noncoding genetic variants with potential implications for cardiomyopathies. Alterations affecting splicing regulatory elements within introns can disrupt mRNA processing and yield aberrant protein isoforms or downregulate gene expression. For example, mutations within intronic regions of the genes encoding titin (TTN) or phospholamban (PLN) have been associated with DCM and impaired calcium handling in the heart.  Although most research has focused on coding mutations, emerging evidence supports the functional significance of noncoding variants in cardiac disease. Several studies have successfully utilized genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify noncoding SNPs associated with cardiac traits or diseases. Integration of these GWAS signals with functional genomics data can help pinpoint causal regulatory elements contributing to cardiomyopathy risk.  Despite these advancements, challenges remain in understanding the precise mechanisms by which noncoding genetic variants contribute to cardiomyopathy development. Functional characterization of these variants requires sophisticated genomic tools such as CRISPR/Cas9-based strategies or mouse models with targeted mutagenesis. Additionally, large-scale collaborations among research groups will be necessary to establish robust associations between specific noncoding variants and different subtypes of cardiomyopathies.  In conclusion, although our knowledge regarding noncoding genetic variants' role in cardiomyopathy is still limited compared to coding mutations, there is mounting evidence supporting their contribution to disease development. Identifying and understanding these noncoding elements' functions may provide novel insights into disease mechanisms and facilitate the development of targeted therapies that modulate gene expression patterns dysregulated in different types of cardiomyopathies. As genetic testing becomes more commonplace, incorporating analysis of noncoding regions will undoubtedly enhance diagnostic accuracy and improve patient care by providing a more comprehensive assessment of an individual's risk for developing cardiovascular disease.

AI refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and learning. This paper aims to provide an overview of the literature on AI in medicine and dentistry, exploring its potential applications as well as its advantages and disadvantages.  2. Potential Applications:  2.1 Diagnostics: One of the most promising areas where AI can be applied is in medical diagnostics. With access to vast amounts of patient data, AI algorithms can analyze symptoms, medical history, test results, and imaging scans to assist healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses. Machine learning algorithms can continuously learn from new patient data to improve diagnostic accuracy over time.  2.2 Treatment Planning: AI can also contribute to personalized treatment planning by analyzing individual patient characteristics such as genetics or response patterns to certain medications. This information can help physicians tailor treatment plans specifically for each patient's needs.  2.3 Image Analysis: In radiology and dentistry particularly, image analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment planning. AI algorithms trained on thousands or even millions of images can quickly analyze images for abnormalities or anomalies that may be missed by human eyes alone.  2.4 Disease Prediction: By analyzing large sets of data like electronic health records (EHRs) and genetic information with machine learning techniques, AI has the potential to predict disease outcomes or identify individuals at high risk for specific conditions before symptoms present themselves.  3.Advantages:   3.1 Efficiency: The use of artificial intelligence systems has the potential to significantly improve efficiency by rapidly processing vast amounts of complex data within seconds or minutes rather than hours or days.  3.2 Accuracy: With advanced machine learning algorithms that continuously refine themselves based on new information inputted into them; diagnosis accuracy could improve, leading to more efficient treatments.  3.3 Personalized Healthcare: The personalization of healthcare plans based on an individual's unique characteristics has the potential to lead to better patient outcomes and higher patient satisfaction.  4.Disadvantages:    4.1 Privacy and Data Security: One of the major challenges associated with AI in medicine and dentistry is maintaining patient privacy and ensuring data security. Patient information is often sensitive, making it crucial for AI systems to adhere to strict privacy regulations while keeping data secure from hackers or unauthorized access.  4.2 Interpretability: While AI algorithms have shown promise in accuracy, they often act as ""black boxes,"" meaning that the process by which they reach their conclusions may not always be easily understandable by human clinicians. This lack of interpretability can undermine trust in the technology.  5.Conclusion:  In conclusion, artificial intelligence has immense potential when it comes to medical and dental applications. From diagnostics and treatment planning to image analysis and disease prediction, AI can significantly enhance healthcare outcomes by leveraging big data analysis and machine learning algorithms. However, careful attention must be given to address ethical concerns such as privacy and data security while ensuring interpretability of results for clinical understanding.It is clear that artificial intelligence will continue to revolutionize medicine and dentistry; however, ongoing research is essential for understanding its full potential and overcoming any challenges that arise along the way.

"Glycans, also known as carbohydrates or sugars, are molecules that play a crucial role in various biological processes. They can be attached to proteins or lipids, or exist as free structures. Glycans surround all human cells, forming a thick and dense layer called the glycocalyx. This layer of glycans provides protection to the cell surface and is involved in cell signaling and recognition.  The immune system closely monitors the unique glycan structures present on cells. These glycans help differentiate self from non-self, allowing the immune system to identify and eliminate foreign invaders such as bacteria or viruses. Moreover, aberrant glycosylations can occur in cancer cells, leading to the formation of tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs). These TACAs are specific glycan structures that are correlated with various aspects of cancer biology.  Due to their association with cancer development and progression, TACAs have become attractive targets for monoclonal antibody-based therapies for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced proteins that can specifically bind to target molecules. Traditionally, full-length antibodies have been used for targeting TACAs in cancer therapy. However, these conventional antibodies face certain limitations when it comes to effectively accessing tumor sites.  The dense glycocalyx surrounding tumor cells poses a barrier for conventional antibodies by restricting their access to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) on cancerous cells. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment creates a hostile milieu with low oxygen levels and high interstitial fluid pressure which further hinders antibody penetration into tumors.  To overcome these challenges, researchers have developed small antibody fragments as alternatives to full-length antibodies when targeting specific glycans on tumor cells. In particular:  1) Single-chain variable fragments (scFv): scFv is derived from an antibody's variable regions and consists of only one chain instead of two heavy chains and two light chains found in full-length antibodies. These small antibody fragments possess a similar affinity for their target TACAs as full-length antibodies but exhibit improved accessibility to tumor sites due to their smaller size. Their compact structure allows better penetration through the dense glycocalyx and enhances localization at the tumor site.  2) Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs): sdAbs, also known as nanobodies, are derived from heavy-chain-only antibodies found in camelids and sharks. These small antibody fragments consist of a single variable domain and lack the constant domain present in conventional antibodies. Their reduced size enables them to penetrate deep into solid tumors with greater efficiency compared to full-length antibodies. Moreover, their high stability and solubility make them attractive candidates for cancer therapy.  3) Bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs): BiTEs are constructs designed to redirect immune cells called T cells towards cancer cells expressing specific TAAs. These constructs consist of two binding domains: one that recognizes a specific TACA on cancer cells and another that targets T cells. By bringing these two cell types together, BiTEs can enhance the killing potential of activated T cells against cancerous cells. This approach not only provides access to tumor sites but also harnesses the body's own immune system for targeted destruction of cancerous cells.  In conclusion, small antibody fragments offer distinct advantages over conventional full-length antibodies in targeting specific glycans on tumor-associated antigens. Their smaller size allows for better penetration through the dense glycocalyx surrounding tumors, resulting in improved localization at tumor sites. Furthermore, these antibody fragments demonstrate similar affinity with increased efficiency compared to their larger counterparts.  Moving forward, ongoing research efforts will continue to explore novel approaches utilizing small antibody fragments for enhanced diagnosis and therapy against various cancers associated with aberrant glycosylation patterns.",continue
"The global incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has become a significant public health concern over the past decade, with more than one million curable STIs being acquired daily (World Health Organization, 2021). Sub-Saharan Africa bears a disproportionately high burden of both curable STIs and HIV, particularly among young women (World Health Organization, 2021; UNAIDS, 2020). Efforts to prevent these infections have included the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for STIs.  Recent studies have shown promising results in using doxycycline as a prophylactic measure to reduce the incidence of bacterial STIs among men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income settings (Marcus et al., 2017; Molina et al., 2015). However, there is limited evidence on the efficacy of doxycycline PEP among women in sub-Saharan Africa.  This study aims to determine the efficacy of doxycycline PEP in reducing incident bacterial STIs – specifically Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Treponema pallidum – among Kenyan women aged ≥18 and ≤30 years who are also using daily oral HIV PrEP. We describe here the baseline characteristics of participants enrolled in this trial as well as their prevalence of STIs and their perception of risk.  Between February 2020 and November 2021, a total of 449 women were enrolled. The median age was found to be around25 years old. A majority were never married(around two-thirds), whereas approximately one-third reported having had sexual intercourse with new partners within three months prior to enrollment. A significant number used condoms for protection consistently while around one-third reported engaging ins transactional sex activities. Moreover, around half of the participants were recently concerned about being exposed to an STI.  The prevalence of STIs among the participants was 17.9%, with Chlamydia trachomatis accounting for the majority of infections. It is noteworthy that perceived risk of STIs was not found to be significantly associated with the detection of an actual STI.  These findings suggest that young cisgender women using HIV PrEP in Kenya and enrolled in a trial of doxycycline PEP exhibit a high prevalence of curable STIs, indicating that they represent a population group at significant risk for these infections. This highlights the urgent need for effective interventions aimed at preventing STIs in this vulnerable population.  There are several implications arising from this study. First, it provides important evidence on the efficacy of doxycycline PEP in reducing incident bacterial STIs among women using HIV PrEP, which has previously been understudied. Second, it emphasizes the need for targeted interventions specifically designed for young cisgender women in sub-Saharan Africa who are at high risk for both curable STIs and HIV.  This research has limitations worth noting. First, there is a potential selection bias as participants were recruited from specific clinical settings and may not be representative of all Kenyan women using HIV PrEP or at risk for bacterial STIs. Second, self-reported data may be subject to social desirability bias or recall bias, leading to potential inaccuracies regarding sexual behaviors and risk perception.  In summary, this study demonstrates that young Kenyan women enrolled in a trial on doxycycline PEP have a high prevalence of curable STIs and are therefore prime candidates for targeted interventions aimed at reducing these infections. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy and feasibility of integrating doxycycline PEP into existing strategies such as quarterly screening and treatment programs within sub-Saharan Africa's healthcare systems.

"Brain cancer is a devastating disease with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. The Olig gene family, which consists of Olig1, Olig2, and Olig3, has emerged as an important player in both the development of the central nervous system (CNS) and the progression of brain cancers. These genes encode transcription factors belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family.  Olig1 and Olig2 are expressed in various cell types during CNS development and play critical roles in cellular specification and differentiation. They are involved in oligodendrocyte development - a type of glial cell that produces myelin, insulation for neuronal axons. In addition to their role in normal development, aberrant expression of Olig genes has been implicated in brain tumorigenesis.  Multiple studies have shown that overexpression of Olig2 is associated with glioma progression - the most common form of brain cancer. Gliomas are characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, invasion into surrounding healthy tissue, resistance to standard treatments like radiation therapy and chemotherapy, leading to poor patient outcomes. High levels of Olig2 have been detected in glioma cells compared to normal glial cells or other brain tumor types.  Mechanistically, studies have demonstrated that increased levels of Olig2 promote glioma proliferation by regulating key target genes involved in cell cycle control and DNA replication. Furthermore, elevated expression of this transcription factor confers resistance to radiation therapy by enhancing DNA repair mechanisms within tumor cells.  Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that targeting specific vulnerabilities conferred by deregulated expression or function of members from the olig gene family may offer novel therapeutic strategies for combating gliomas. For example, inhibiting olig2-mediated signaling pathways using small molecule inhibitors has shown promising results both preclinically and clinically.  Inhibition or knockdown experiments targeting olig genes have led to reduced proliferation rates and induction of apoptosis specifically within glioma cells, while sparing normal glial cells. This selectivity highlights the potential therapeutic window for targeting Olig genes in brain cancer treatment.  In addition to their roles in glioma progression, Olig genes have also been implicated in cancer stem cell (CSC) maintenance and self-renewal. CSCs are a small population of tumor cells that possess stem cell-like properties, including the ability to initiate tumor formation and drive therapy resistance. Targeting CSCs is vital for achieving long-term remission and preventing tumor recurrence.  Recent studies have shown that Olig2 expression is enriched in glioma stem-like cells and is required for their maintenance. Depletion of Olig2 not only impairs self-renewal capabilities but also sensitizes CSCs to standard therapies, suggesting that targeting Olig genes could potentially eradicate this highly resistant subpopulation of cancer cells.  Overall, understanding the biological functions of the Olig gene family in brain cancer has opened up new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Inhibiting or modulating these transcription factors holds promise as a targeted therapy approach with potentially fewer side effects compared to conventional treatments.  However, several challenges need to be addressed before translating these findings into clinical applications. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which Olig genes promote glioma progression and resistance. Additionally, strategies for selectively targeting Olig-expressing cancer cells while sparing normal glial cells require further optimization.  In conclusion, exploiting the role of members from the olig gene family offers exciting possibilities for developing effective treatments against brain cancers such as gliomas. Continued research efforts focusing on unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying olig gene function will enable us to devise novel therapeutic strategies that can improve patient outcomes and ultimately lead to a cure for this devastating disease.",continue
"Alcohol consumption is a significant public health concern, with potential links to increased risk of cancer. Strategies that aim to reduce alcohol consumption, especially in young people, could have substantial health benefits and contribute to cancer prevention efforts. The increasing accessibility and applicability of digital technologies have made them powerful tools that can facilitate changes in behavior among young people. These changes can lead to both immediate and long-term improvements in public health.  In this overview, we conducted a review of systematic reviews to assess the available evidence on digital interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption in sub-populations of young people. We specifically looked at school-aged children, college/university students, young adults (over 18 years), and both adolescents and young adults (below 25 years). We conducted searches across relevant databases such as KSR Evidence, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). We screened records independently based on title and abstract criteria, with those meeting inclusion criteria subjected to full-text screening by two reviewers. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBIS checklist, and we employed a narrative analysis methodology.  We included twenty-seven systematic reviews that addressed relevant interventions for one or more sub-populations. However, these reviews were mostly assessed as low quality due to varying definitions of ""digital intervention"" across the reviews themselves. Furthermore, the available evidence was limited in terms of sub-population targeted as well as type of intervention examined. None of the reviews reported on cancer incidence or influence on cancer-related outcomes.  For school-aged children eHealth multiple health behavior change interventions delivered through various digital methods were found not effective in preventing or reducing alcohol consumption or prevalence rates. In contrast, for adolescents and/or young adults identified as risky drinkers using computer or mobile device-based interventions resulted in reduced alcohol consumption compared to no/minimal intervention. University/college students who participated in E-interventions saw a small reduction in the number of drinks consumed per week compared to assessment-only controls. Web-based personalized feedback interventions also demonstrated a slight to medium effect on alcohol consumption. For risky drinkers, stand-alone computerized interventions reduced both short and long-term alcohol consumption compared to no intervention, while computerized assessment and feedback had a small effect compared to assessment only. Computerized brief interventions did not show significant effects when compared to counselor-based interventions.  In young adults and adolescents, SMS-based interventions did not significantly reduce the quantity of drinks per occasion or average number of standard glasses per week but increased the risk of binge drinking episodes.  The interpretation of these findings is limited due to potential bias and heterogeneity in the review results. However, limited evidence suggests that digital interventions, particularly those with feedback mechanisms, may have some potential for reducing alcohol consumption in specific sub-populations of young people. But it's important to note that these effects are often small or inconsistent when only methodologically strong evidence is considered.  In conclusion, there currently isn't enough systematic review evidence supporting the notion that digital interventions can effectively reduce cancer incidence through alcohol moderation in young people. Further research is needed using robust methodologies to fully explore the potential impact of digital interventions and form an evidence base for public health initiatives aimed at reducing alcohol consumption - a major cancer risk factor",continue
"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a prevalent and disabling condition that affects millions of people worldwide. These disorders can result in chronic pain, limited mobility, and reduced quality of life (QoL). Traditional rehabilitation methods have been effective in treating MSDs; however, they often require patients to attend physical therapy sessions at healthcare facilities, which can be burdensome for some individuals.   In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of digital healthcare (DHC) as an alternative approach to musculoskeletal rehabilitation. DHC encompasses various technologies such as mobile applications, wearable devices, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), which can be utilized to deliver rehabilitation interventions remotely. These technologies allow patients to access treatment at their convenience and offer personalized exercises and programs tailored to their specific needs.  The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of musculoskeletal rehabilitation using DHC compared to conventional rehabilitation methods. We aim to assess the impact of DHC on pain reduction and QoL improvement among individuals with MSDs.  2. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search in multiple databases including PubMed, Ovid-Embase, Cochrane Library, and PEDro Physiotherapy Evidence Database from inception until October 28, 2022. The search strategy included keywords related to musculoskeletal disorders, digital healthcare interventions, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), pain outcomes, and quality of life measures.  After screening titles and abstracts for relevance based on predetermined inclusion criteria—including RCT design comparing DHC with conventional rehabilitation—we identified 54 studies that met our criteria for full-text review. All selected studies were assessed for risk of bias using standardized tools such as Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias.  3. Results The meta-analysis included data from a total of 6240 participants across the selected studies. The average age range varied from 21.9 to 71.8 years, with diverse representations of MSDs. Knee and hip joint disorders were the most commonly studied conditions (n = 23).  The DHC interventions employed in the studies were varied, with mobile applications being the most frequently utilized (n = 26), followed by VR (n = 16) and AR (n = 16). The interventions provided patients with exercises, education, monitoring systems, and feedback to facilitate their rehabilitation process.  Our meta-analysis revealed that DHC rehabilitation was associated with significant pain reduction compared to conventional rehabilitation methods (SMD: -0.55, 95% CI: -0.74 to -0.36). These findings suggest that DHC has a positive impact on reducing musculoskeletal pain.  Moreover, results showed that DHC significantly improved both health-related QoL (SMD: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.29 to1.03) and disease-specific QoL (SMD: -0.44; 95% CI: -08687 to-0001) when compared to conventional rehabilitation approaches.  4.Discussion The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence supporting the effectiveness of musculoskeletal rehabilitation using digital healthcare interventions for reducing pain and improving quality of life in individuals with MSDs.  The convenience and accessibility offered by DHC interventions allow individuals to undertake their therapy remotely without compromising treatment outcomes or patient safety.  However, the underlying mechanisms through which DHC affects patient-reported outcomes remain unclear and warrant further investigation. It is essential to understand how specific features of these technologies contribute to improvements in pain reduction and QoL enhancement among patients with different types of MSDs.  5.Conclusion  In conclusion, our study demonstrates that musculoskeletal rehabilitation using digital healthcare presents a practical alternative for managing pain associated with MSDs while improving quality of life outcomes across various domains. The use of DHC interventions offers flexibility, personalization, and convenience for both patients and healthcare professionals.  Future research should focus on investigating the specific mechanisms by which DHC interventions impact patient-reported outcomes, as well as identifying subgroups of individuals who may benefit the most from this approach. Additionally, long-term follow-up studies are needed to evaluate the sustainability and long-term effects of DHC rehabilitation in managing musculoskeletal pain and improving quality of life.",continue
"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a significant cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite advancements in therapy, the prognosis for many patients remains poor. The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies, has revolutionized the treatment landscape and provided new hope for patients.  However, not all patients respond to ICI therapy, and there is an urgent need to identify biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes and guide treatment decisions. Currently, PD-L1 tumor expression is the most widely used biomarker for predicting ICI response. However, its limitations include intra-tumor heterogeneity and discrepancies between tissue samples obtained through biopsy or surgical resection.  Liquid biopsy offers a less invasive alternative to obtain biomarkers from peripheral blood samples instead of tissue-based biopsies. Several non-tumoral blood cell counts have shown potential as prognostic markers in NSCLC treated with ICI. Elevated absolute neutrophil counts have been associated with poorer outcomes, while favorable outcomes have been observed in patients with lower platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios.  Soluble-derived immune checkpoint-related products also hold promise as predictive biomarkers for ICI response. One such product is soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1), which can be detected in blood samples. Studies have shown that high levels of sPD-L1 are associated with worse prognosis in NSCLC patients treated with ICI.  In addition to non-tumoral blood cell counts and sPD-L1, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are emerging as potential liquid biopsy-based biomarkers for predicting ICI response in NSCLC. CTCs are cancer cells that detach from solid tumors into circulation and can be detected using various techniques. Detection and quantification of CTCs have been associated with poorer outcomes in NSCLC patients receiving ICI.  ctDNA, on the other hand, refers to tumor-specific DNA fragments released into circulation from apoptotic or necrotic tumor cells. Analysis of ctDNA allows for the detection of genetic alterations and mutations in tumors, which can guide treatment decisions and monitor treatment response. Several studies have shown that ctDNA analysis can predict ICI response and provide real-time insights into tumor dynamics.  Moving forward, liquid biopsies hold great promise in the immune landscape of lung cancer management. By incorporating non-tumoral blood cell counts, sPD-L1 levels, CTC detection and quantification, and ctDNA analysis into clinical practice, we may be able to better predict ICI response and tailor treatment strategies for individual patients.  However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before liquid biopsies can be widely implemented in routine clinical practice. Standardization of sample collection methods, assay techniques, and result interpretation is crucial to ensure reproducibility and reliability of liquid biopsy-based biomarkers. Furthermore, large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate these biomarkers across diverse patient populations.  In conclusion, the identification of soluble biomarkers using liquid biopsy holds great potential for predicting clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with ICI. Non-tumoral blood cell counts such as absolute neutrophil counts and ratios have shown promise as prognostic markers. Additionally,sPD-L1 levels as well as CTC detection/quantificationandctDN analysis possess predictive value for ICI response.  However,reproducibility standardizationand validation through large scale prospective studies arerequiredbefore these markers canbe routinely usedinclinical practice.The incorporationof these promisingliquid biopsy-based biomarkershas  the potentialto revolutionizelungcancer managementby guiding personalizedtreatment strategiesand improving  patient outcomes.

"The synthesis of dibenzo[b,f]azepines and other dibenzo[b,f]heteropines has gained significant interest in the pharmaceutical industry due to the presence of these scaffolds in various commercially available drugs, such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants. Additionally, there is a growing recognition of the potential applications of these structures in organic electronics and catalysis.  This review aims to present an overview of different synthetic strategies employed in the construction of dibenzo[b,f]heteropines. These strategies involve a variety of synthetic approaches including cascade reactions, transition metal-catalyzed transformations, and multicomponent reactions.  2. Synthetic Strategies  2.1 Cascade Reactions  Cascade reactions have emerged as powerful tools for constructing complex molecular architectures rapidly from simple starting materials. In the context of dibenzo[b,f]heteropine synthesis, cascade reactions have been employed to access diverse substitution patterns efficiently. One such example involves the one-pot multi-step reaction utilizing aminobenzophenones with various nucleophiles under acidic conditions. This strategy enables selective C–C or C–N bond formation leading to substituted dibenzo[b,f]heteropines.  2.2 Transition Metal-Catalyzed Transformations  Transition metal-catalyzed transformations provide another versatile approach for synthesizing dibenzo[h,h']azepine derivatives. Pd(0)-catalyzed C-H activation has proven particularly useful due to its compatibility with numerous functional groups and tolerance towards different heterocyclic moieties present in starting materials.  Furthermore, Rhodium-catalyzed tandem processes have also been successful in accessing densely functionalized azepine systems from readily available arylamine precursors through sequential C-H activation and cyclization steps.  2.3 Multicomponent Reactions (MCRs)  Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) offer a highly efficient approach for the construction of complex molecular frameworks. MCRs involving isocyanides, nucleophiles, and appropriate electrophiles have been developed for the synthesis of dibenzo[h,f]azepine derivatives. These reactions proceed through a series of bond-forming events, leading to rapid access to functionalized dibenzo[h,f]heteropines.  3. Applications  Apart from their significance in the pharmaceutical industry as drug scaffolds, dibenzo[b,f]heteropines have shown promising applications in other fields as well.  3.1 Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs)  The dibenzo[b,f]azepine core has exhibited promising optical properties making it an attractive candidate for OLED applications. By introducing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents at specific positions on the azepine ring system, researchers have successfully tuned the electronic structure and emission properties of OLED dyes.  3.2 Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs)  In recent years, strategies employing dibenzo[b,f]azepine-based dyes as sensitizers for DSSCs have garnered attention due to their excellent light-harvesting abilities and favorable photovoltaic performances. These dyes offer advantages such as broad absorption spectra and high molar extinction coefficients.  3.3 Catalysts and Molecular Organic Frameworks  The potential of dibenzo[b,f]azepine-derived ligands in catalysis has also been explored extensively. Ligands incorporating this heteroaromatic moiety possess unique coordination properties that enable them to interact with metal centers effectively. These ligands have been employed in transition metal-catalyzed reactions offering enhanced reactivity and selectivity.  Additionally, molecular organic frameworks containing diketopyrrolopyrrole units fused with dibenzohetropin moieties have shown promise as porous materials for gas storage and separation applications.  4. Conclusion  In conclusion, the synthesis of dibenzo[b,f]heteropines and specifically dibenzo[b,f]azepines has seen remarkable progress in recent years. Various synthetic strategies including cascade reactions, transition metal-catalyzed transformations, and multicomponent reactions have enabled efficient access to these important heterocyclic scaffolds. Furthermore, their potential applications in OLEDs, DSSCs, catalysis, and molecular organic frameworks highlight the versatility and significance of these compounds beyond their pharmaceutical applications. Further research into the development of novel synthetic methodologies and exploration of different applications is expected to expand the scope of dibenzo[b,f]heteropine chemistry in the future.",continue
"The cGAS-STING pathway is a crucial component of the innate immune system, responsible for detecting the presence of pathogens or cellular damage and initiating an immune response. At the heart of this pathway is 2’3’-cGAMP, a cyclic dinucleotide molecule produced by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS in response to aberrant dsDNA in the cytoplasm.  Traditionally, it was believed that detection of pathogens by pattern recognition receptors would induce interferon and cytokine production within the cell where sensing occurred. These signaling molecules would then act locally in both an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce responses in nearby cells. However, recent studies have shed light on alternative mechanisms by which 2’3’-cGAMP can travel to neighboring cells and activate STING.  These discoveries have significant implications for our understanding of immune responses against microbial invaders, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. Dysregulation of the cGAS-STING pathway has been linked to various inflammatory diseases, highlighting its importance as a therapeutic target. However, developing effective antagonists has proven challenging due to the complexity of this pathway.  By identifying how 2’3’-cGAMP can be transported between cells independent of DNA sensing by cGAS, we gain new insights into potential treatment strategies. This change in perspective allows us to not only target intracellular DNA sensors but also focus on blocking intercellular transmission mechanisms.  One major avenue where this knowledge can be applied is vaccine design. By understanding how 2’3’-cGAMP spreads from infected cells to nearby uninfected cells, we can develop vaccines that promote this intercellular communication. This could lead to more robust immune responses against infectious agents and enhance vaccine efficacy.  Cancer immunotherapies also stand to benefit from these new insights into intercellular transport mechanisms. The cGAS-STING pathway plays a crucial role in anti-tumor immune responses, and strategies that enhance its activation can boost the effectiveness of immunotherapies. By targeting the intercellular transmission of 2’3’-cGAMP, we may be able to develop novel therapies that specifically activate STING in tumor cells, leading to their destruction by the immune system.  Moreover, understanding the intercellular transport of 2’3’-cGAMP opens up new possibilities for treating cGAS-STING associated diseases. Inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome have been linked to dysregulation of this pathway. Developing antagonists that target intercellular transmission may provide a more effective approach for suppressing excessive inflammation associated with these conditions.  In conclusion, recent discoveries regarding how 2’3’-cGAMP can be transported between cells have challenged the traditional view of DNA sensing and immune signaling. This change in perspective offers exciting opportunities for vaccine design, cancer immunotherapies, and treatment of cGAS-STING associated diseases. Further research is needed to fully understand these mechanisms and develop targeted therapies based on this newfound knowledge. Further research is being conducted to unravel the intricate details of how 2’3’-cGAMP is transported between cells. Several mechanisms have been identified, including cellular exosomes, gap junctions, and membrane channels. Exosomes, small vesicles released by cells, have emerged as important carriers for intercellular communication. They can contain various signaling molecules, including 2’3’-cGAMP, and deliver them to neighboring cells where they activate STING.  Gap junctions are another pathway for intercellular transfer of 2’3’-cGAMP. These specialized structures allow for direct communication between adjacent cells through connexin proteins that form channels connecting the cytoplasm of two cells. It has been shown that neighbors of cGAS-expressing cells can receive 2’3’-cGAMP via these gap junctions and initiate immune responses.  Membrane channels also play a role in facilitating the transfer of 2'3'-cGAMP between cells. For example, a recent study identified an ATP-gated Pannexin channel as a vehicle for transmitting cGAMP from producer to recipient cells. This mechanism extends beyond cell-cell communication and demonstrates how extracellular signaling molecules can be taken up by neighboring cells to activate STING.  Understanding these transport mechanisms not only sheds light on how immune signals are propagated but also provides potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Modulating the intercellular transmission pathways could offer precise control over immune activation in diseases where the cGAS-STING pathway is dysregulated.  The implications extend beyond infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy; other diseases associated with excessive inflammation may also benefit from this new perspective. Chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease involve aberrant activation of the immune system and sustained production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By targeting intercellular transmission in these conditions, it may be possible to dampen excessive immune responses and alleviate symptoms.  In addition to therapeutic possibilities, the discovery of intercellular transport mechanisms for 2'3'-cGAMP raises several intriguing questions. Future research will likely focus on identifying the molecular players involved in the transfer process, understanding how cells selectively receive and respond to 2'3'-cGAMP, and investigating whether other molecules can hitch a ride with 2'3'-cGAMP during intercellular communication.  In conclusion, the elucidation of intercellular transport mechanisms for 2’3’-cGAMP has revolutionized our understanding of immune signaling. This newfound knowledge opens doors for novel therapeutic approaches in infectious diseases, cancer immunotherapy, and inflammatory disorders. By targeting intercellular transmission pathways and modulating immune activation at multiple levels, researchers aim to develop more effective treatments that minimize side effects while maximizing desired outcomes. The journey to harnessing cGAMP as a traveling messenger holds promise for advancing the field of immunology towards innovative therapeutics and improved patient care.",continue
"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids, immune cells, and extracellular matrix in the arterial wall. It is the underlying cause of various cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, there is still a need for improved diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.  Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as potential biomarkers and modulators of atherosclerosis pathogenesis. EVs are small membranous structures released by various cell types under normal physiological conditions or in response to cellular stress. They can be classified into different subtypes based on their biogenesis pathways, size range, surface markers, and cargo composition. The three main types of EVs include exosomes (30-150 nm in diameter), microvesicles (100-1000 nm), and apoptotic bodies (800-5000 nm).  EVs derived from different cell types within the arterial wall have been shown to contribute to various aspects of atherosclerosis development. Endothelial dysfunction is an early hallmark event in atherosclerosis pathogenesis that leads to increased vascular permeability and leukocyte migration into the subendothelial space. EVs shed from activated endothelial cells can facilitate inflammation by inducing endothelial cell activation and promoting leukocyte recruitment through interactions with adhesion molecules.  Inflammation plays a crucial role at all stages of atherosclerotic lesion formation. Immune cells release EVs that contain pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, miRNAs, DNA fragments known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), among other inflammatory mediators that contribute to lesion development. These EV-derived factors can not only act locally but also circulate systemically promoting systemic inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease.  Thrombosis is another critical event in atherosclerosis that can lead to acute cardiovascular events. EVs released by activated platelets and endothelial cells contain various proteins involved in coagulation and platelet activation, such as tissue factor, phosphatidylserine, and P-selectin. These EVs promote clot formation and amplify local thrombogenic reactions.  One of the challenges in studying EVs is isolating them from complex biological fluids with high purity and preserving their integrity during isolation procedures. Several methods have been developed for EV isolation, including ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, immune-affinity capture using antibody-coated beads or microfluidic devices, among others. Each isolation method has its advantages and limitations in terms of yield, purity, recovery of different subtypes of EVs.  EV analysis can be challenging due to their small size and heterogeneity. Various techniques have been employed to characterize the cargo composition of EVs such as proteomics, transcriptomics (RNA sequencing), lipidomics, flow cytometry-based phenotypic analysis (surface markers), electron microscopy for morphological characterization and nanoscale imaging approaches like super-resolution microscopy or atomic force microscopy.  To fully understand the roles of EVs in atherosclerosis pathogenesis and exploit their potential as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets requires studies using relevant animal models that recapitulate the human disease process as well as analysis of human samples including plasma/serum derived from patients with cardiovascular diseases at different stages.  In conclusion, this review highlights the growing interest in understanding the roles of EVs in atherosclerosis pathogenesis. The diverse cargoes carried by these vesicles contribute to endothelial dysfunction, inflammation propagation within plaques promoting lesion development but also influencing systemic inflammation associated with cardiovascular disease progression post-mortem events like plaque rupture causing acute arterial occlusions leading to myocardial infarction or stroke. The ability to isolate specific populations based on surface markers expressed EVs from patients with distinct pathophysiological profiles could potentially be used as non-invasive biomarkers aiding in diagnosis, prognosis, or monitoring response to therapy. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of EVs is being explored for targeted delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents in cardiovascular medicine. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to fully understand the complex mechanisms by which EVs contribute to atherosclerosis and to develop standardized protocols for their isolation, characterization as well as new tools for their analysis across laboratories facilitating effective translation of the growing knowledge of EV biology into clinical practice.",continue
"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in pharmaceutical and interventional therapies, a subset of AF patients continues to suffer from heart failure (HF) symptoms. Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT), delivered through biventricular epicardial (BiV) pacing, has been proven to be an effective treatment for these patients by improving ventricular synchrony and cardiac output. However, conduction system pacing (CSP) has emerged as a promising alternative delivery method for CRT.  In this review, we aim to explore the role of CSP specifically in patients with AF. We first examine the mechanistic evidence for the importance of sinus rhythm (SR) in CSP. It is well-established that adjusting atrioventricular delays (AVD) plays a crucial role in optimizing electrical response during CSP. In SR, AVDs can be adjusted to ensure optimal resynchronization of atrial-ventricular contraction, leading to improved hemodynamics. However, in AF where there is irregular atrial activity and loss of organized contraction, it remains uncertain whether adjusting AVDs can provide similar benefits.  To assess the efficacy of CSP in AF patients, we evaluate the largest clinical body of evidence available - studies conducted on patients receiving CSP following atrioventricular nodal ablation (AVNA) for AF. AVNA is a commonly performed procedure where electrical access between the atria and ventricles is disrupted intentionally to control heart rate and prevent rapid ventricular response during AF episodes. This patient population provides an interesting insight into the effects of CSP on cardiac function without confounding factors such as intrinsic sinus rhythm variability.  The findings from these studies suggest that CSP may indeed be beneficial even in patients with persistent or permanent AF following AVNA. Improved symptoms and exercise capacity have been reported along with favorable echocardiographic parameters indicating improved ventricular synchrony and function. However, the evidence is limited to small observational studies with diverse patient populations and variation in methodology.  Future research needs to address the vital question of whether CSP is effective in AF patients who have not undergone AVNA. Large-scale randomized controlled trials comparing CSP with conventional BiV pacing in patients with AF could provide valuable insights. However, conducting such trials may face several challenges. Patient selection criteria need to be clearly defined as including only those who are likely to benefit from CSP, as well as ensuring adequate follow-up periods for accurate assessment of outcomes.  In conclusion, while CSP has emerged as a promising novel delivery method for CRT, its efficacy specifically in patients with AF remains an area of ongoing research. The mechanistic evidence supports the importance of SR in optimizing AVDs during CSP; however, the clinical evidence is limited and predominantly focused on post-AVNA patients. Future studies designed rigorously with clear patient selection criteria and long-term follow-up are necessary to determine the true efficacy of CSP in this population. If proven effective, CSP could offer a viable alternative for AF patients who are not suitable candidates for AVNA or have failed conventional BiV pacing therapy. Furthermore, the potential benefits of CSP in AF patients extend beyond just improving cardiac function. The presence of AF can significantly impact quality of life due to symptoms such as palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath, and exercise intolerance. These symptoms can severely limit a patient's daily activities and overall well-being. Therefore, finding an effective treatment option for AF patients that not only improves cardiac function but also alleviates symptoms is essential.  CSP may offer a unique advantage in this regard. By directly pacing the conduction system, it may have the ability to restore atrial contractility and promote more organized atrial activity even in the presence of AF. This could potentially lead to a reduction in symptoms associated with AF and an improvement in overall quality of life.  Another important aspect to consider when evaluating the role of CSP in AF patients is its safety profile. Traditional CRT delivered through BiV pacing requires lead placement on both ventricles, which carries risks such as infection or lead dislodgement. In contrast, CSP involves pacing only through the conduction system without the need for ventricular leads. This may result in fewer complications related to lead placement and reduce overall procedure-related risks.  However, despite these potential advantages of CSP in treating AF patients with heart failure, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before widespread adoption can occur. First and foremost is the need for further research specifically focused on this patient population. The current evidence base is limited primarily to small observational studies with heterogeneous patient populations.  Additionally, optimizing AVDs during CSP remains a challenge when dealing with irregular atrial activity seen in AF patients without AVNA intervention. So far there have been some proposed algorithms for adjusting AVDs based on different sensor inputs or pattern recognition techniques but further research is needed to validate their efficacy.  Furthermore there are technical limitations associated with CSP devices currently available on the market that need to be overcome before widespread use can occur in clinical practice for this specific patient population. For example, the current pacing tools may not be optimized for delivering CSP in AF patients with varying atrial activation patterns. Improvements in device programming and migration towards more personalized algorithms may better address these challenges.  In conclusion, while CSP has emerged as a promising delivery method for CRT, its efficacy specifically in patients with AF is still an area of ongoing research. While the mechanistic evidence supports the importance of sinus rhythm for optimal AVD adjustment during CSP, more robust clinical evidence is needed to determine its true efficacy and safety profile in this specific population. Large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary to provide definitive answers regarding the benefits of CSP compared to conventional BiV pacing specifically in AF patients. If proven effective, CSP could offer a valuable alternative treatment option for a significant portion of heart failure patients who have AF and cannot undergo or have failed AVNA or traditional BiV pacing therapy.",continue
"Depression among youth is an increasingly prevalent and distressing mental health issue that poses a significant burden worldwide. Rates of depression surge from childhood through young adulthood, and there has been a notable increase in prevalence over the last decade. Despite identifying many risk factors and having evidence-based interventions targeting individual-level changes through psychological or pharmacological means, the field has not made substantial progress in understanding depression's features or effectively addressing its high prevalence among youth.  To address these challenges and advance the field, this paper advocates for reinvigorating construct validation approaches in order to better characterize the phenomenological features of youth depression. By doing so, we can develop more valid and reliable assessments that enhance scientific understanding and improve interventions for depression in young people. This approach recognizes the importance of historical and philosophical principles that have influenced how we conceptualize and measure depression.  Furthermore, it is crucial to expand the range and targets of treatments and prevention efforts beyond current practice guidelines for evidence-based interventions. While these interventions are valuable, they primarily focus on individual-level changes. The paper proposes incorporating structural- and system-level change at community and societal levels as part of a broader suite of interventions. For example, evidence-based economic anti-poverty interventions can help address social determinants of mental health by reducing financial stressors that contribute to depression among youth.  Personalized interventions with sufficient evidence base should also be considered as part of this comprehensive approach. By tailoring treatments to individual needs based on specific risk factors or symptoms profiles, we can improve outcomes for depressed youth.  To guide progress in understanding youth depression, the paper introduces the FORCE framework which stands for Fundamentals (understanding basic mechanisms), Openness (embracing diverse perspectives), Relationships (examining social influences), Constructs (developing comprehensive conceptual models), 	and Evidence (using rigorous research methods). Each aspect highlights critical areas where further attention is needed to advance our knowledge about youth depression.  By adopting these positions - reinvigorating construct validation approaches, broadening the range and targets of interventions, and embracing the FORCE framework - researchers and practitioners in the field of youth depression research can pave the way for new hope. Improved scientific understanding will facilitate more accurate assessments, early identification, and effective interventions for depressed youth. Additionally, addressing social determinants and personalizing treatments can lead to a comprehensive approach that reduces the burden of depression among young people.  In conclusion, depression among youth is a significant challenge that requires progress in both understanding its features and reducing distress. By reinvigorating construct validation approaches and broadening interventions to encompass structural-level changes, personalized treatments, as well as societal changes such as economic anti-poverty initiatives, we can provide new hope for improving the lives of depressed young individuals. The adoption of the FORCE framework guides us towards a holistic approach that considers multiple factors influencing depression while emphasizing rigorous research methods. With these efforts collectively applied, we have a greater chance of achieving substantial progress in tackling youth depression globally. 2. Understanding the Phenomenological Features:  Construct validation approaches are essential for understanding the phenomenological features of youth depression. By examining the underlying constructs and dimensions of depression, we can develop more accurate assessments that capture the unique experiences of young individuals. This includes considering cultural and developmental factors that may influence how depression presents in different populations.  Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of depression should go beyond simply categorizing symptoms. It is crucial to explore not only the core symptoms but also associated features such as cognitive processes, social functioning, and emotional regulation. This broader perspective helps in developing more targeted interventions that address not only symptom reduction but also functional impairment and overall well-being.  3. Broadening the Range and Targets of Interventions:  While evidence-based psychological and pharmacological interventions have shown efficacy in treating youth depression, there is a need to broaden our approach. Structural- and system-level changes at community and societal levels can contribute significantly to reducing distress among depressed youth.  For instance, economic anti-poverty interventions have demonstrated positive effects on mental health outcomes by alleviating financial stressors that often contribute to depression among disadvantaged youth. By addressing social determinants such as poverty, inequality, or access to education and healthcare services, we can enhance preventive efforts at a population level.  Personalized interventions are another important aspect to consider in improving treatment outcomes for depressed youth. By tailoring treatments based on individual needs or risk profiles (e.g., comorbidities or specific symptom presentations), we can maximize effectiveness while minimizing potential side effects or treatment resistance.  4. Embracing The FORCE Framework:  The FORCE framework provides a roadmap for progress toward improved understanding of depression among young people (Fundamentals), embracing diverse perspectives (Openness), examining social influences (Relationships), developing comprehensive conceptual models (Constructs), using rigorous research methods (Evidence).  Fundamentals encompass understanding basic mechanisms underlying depression such as neurobiology or genetic factors while considering developmental differences throughout childhood into young adulthood. By focusing on these fundamental aspects, we can enhance our knowledge of the underlying causes and mechanisms, leading to more targeted interventions.  Openness involves embracing diverse perspectives, including those from different disciplines, cultures, and lived experiences. This helps in challenging biases and assumptions that may limit our understanding of depression among youth. By fostering collaboration and inclusivity, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding that accounts for a wide range of factors influencing youth depression.  Relationships are vital in the context of youth depression as it is often influenced by family dynamics, peer relationships, and social support systems. Examining how these relationships impact an individual's depressive symptoms can guide interventions aimed at improving interpersonal functioning or strengthening support networks.  Constructs refer to developing comprehensive conceptual models that capture the complexity of youth depression. This involves considering various factors such as biological, psychological, social-cultural influences within a developmental framework. By integrating these different dimensions into cohesive models or theories, we can inform intervention strategies that address multiple factors simultaneously.  Lastly, evidence-based research methods are critical for advancing our understanding and reducing distress associated with youth depression. Rigorous research designs ensure validity and reliability while allowing for robust evaluation of interventions' effectiveness or identification of novel risk factors or protective mechanisms.  In conclusion,  Recognizing the prevalence and distress associated with depression among children and adolescents as well as its increasing rates globally is crucial to addressing this mental health challenge effectively. By reinvigorating construct validation approaches to better characterize its phenomenological features through rigorous research methods within the FORCE framework's domains Fundamentals Openness Relationships Constructs Evidence), progress in scientific understanding can be achieved.  Moreover,broadening the range and targets of interventions beyond current practice guidelines allows us to develop a more comprehensive approach that includes structural- and system-level changes at societal levels alongside personalized treatments tailored according to individual needs.Focusing on economic anti-poverty interventions could help address social determinants contributing to depressed Internet users especially disadvantaged individuals.Regardless of the efforts made,embracing diverse perspectives and acknowledging the complexity involved in youth depression is fundamental for further advancements.  By collectively applying these positions, we can foster new hope in improving our understanding of youth depression and reducing distress among affected individuals. Through continued research, collaboration, and innovative interventions targeting various levels of influence, we can make meaningful progress and ultimately enhance the well-being of depressed young people globally.",continue
"Proteinopathies refer to a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the aggregation and accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain. These aggregates, known as protein inclusions, are toxic to neurons and can lead to neuronal dysfunction and death. The onset and progression of these diseases are often associated with genetic mutations, but they can also occur sporadically.  Autophagy is a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by degrading damaged organelles, misfolded proteins, and other cellular debris. It is particularly crucial for clearing protein aggregates that cannot be effectively degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Dysregulation of autophagy has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including those induced by proteinopathies.  To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy dysfunction in these diseases and identify potential therapeutic targets, numerous studies have utilized Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) models. Despite differences between flies and humans regarding brain physiology and morphology, the signaling pathways governing protein homeostasis are highly conserved between these two species.  In this review article, we aim to provide an overview of several common neurodegenerative proteinopathies: Huntington's disease (HD), Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2, and 3 (SCA1-3), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in C9orf72 or encoding superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), TAR DNA-binding Protein 43 (TDP-43), or Fused In Sarcoma/Translocated In Liposarcoma (FUS); Alzheimer's disease involving Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) or Tau; Parkinson's disease linked to alpha-synuclein (a-syn), parkin/PARK2 or PINK1/PARK6 genes; as well as prion diseases. We will discuss the contributions made by Drosophila models to understand the conserved mechanisms underlying these diseases and to elucidate the role of autophagy in their pathogenesis.  Drosophila models have provided significant insights into the pathogenic processes involved in proteinopathies. For instance, studies using fly models of HD revealed that impaired autophagy contributes to aggregate formation and neurodegeneration. Genetic manipulations targeting autophagy-related genes in flies demonstrated that enhanced or impaired autophagy can modulate disease progression, suggesting a therapeutic potential for manipulating this pathway.  Similar findings have been obtained using Drosophila models of other proteinopathies such as ALS, Parkinson's disease, and prion diseases. These studies have uncovered conserved molecular pathways regulating autophagy, including key regulatory proteins like Atg1/ULK complex and Atg8/LC3 family members. They have also highlighted the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as contributing factors in several neurodegenerative diseases.  Furthermore, Drosophila models offer valuable tools for screening potential therapeutics targeting autophagy pathways. High-throughput screening methods can be employed to identify small molecules or genetic modifiers that enhance or restore proper autophagic function in disease models.  In conclusion, Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a powerful model organism for studying the role of autophagy in neurodegenerative proteinopathies. The conservation of molecular mechanisms governing protein homeostasis between flies and humans allows researchers to uncover fundamental insights into disease pathogenesis and develop innovative therapeutic strategies. Continued research utilizing Drosophilamodels will undoubtedly contribute further to our understanding of these devastating disorders and pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions aimed at preserving neuronal function through modulation of autophagic processes. 2. PolyQ diseases, such as Huntington's disease and Spinocerebellar ataxia 1, 2, and 3, are characterized by the expansion of a polyglutamine (PolyQ) repeat in specific proteins. These expanded PolyQ tracts confer a toxic gain-of-function to the proteins, leading to protein misfolding and aggregation. Drosophila models of PolyQ diseases have provided valuable insights into the role of autophagy in clearing these aggregates. Researchers have found that enhancing autophagic activity can reduce aggregate formation and alleviate neurotoxicity in fly models of PolyQ diseases.  3. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective degeneration of motor neurons. Mutations in genes such as C9orf72, SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS have been associated with familial ALS cases. Drosophila models expressing mutant forms of these ALS-associated genes recapitulate key pathological features observed in ALS patients. Studies using these fly models have revealed that autophagy plays a crucial role in ALS pathogenesis by promoting clearance of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria.  4. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by two hallmark neuropathological lesions: extracellular amyloid-beta plaques composed mainly of amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragments and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Drosophila models expressing mutant forms of APP or tau have been instrumental in elucidating the role of autophagy in AD pathology. They have shown that disrupted autophagy leads to increased accumulation and reduced clearance of toxic protein aggregates.  5.Parkinson's disease (PD), another prevalent neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting dopaminergic neurons, has been extensively studied using Drosophila models. Mutations in genes such as alpha-synuclein (a-syn), parkin, PINK1, and LRRK2 are associated with familial forms of PD. Studies in flies have demonstrated that aberrant autophagy contributes to the accumulation of a-syn aggregates and mitochondrial dysfunction observed in PD. Additionally, Drosophila models have been instrumental in identifying potential therapeutic targets within the autophagy pathway for treating PD.  6. Prion diseases are characterized by the conversion of a normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) into an abnormal isoform (PrPSc) that can act as a template to further convert more PrPC molecules. This conversion results in the accumulation of insoluble PrPSc aggregates, leading to neuronal death and neurodegeneration. Drosophila models expressing various forms of prion proteins have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying prion disease pathogenesis, including the involvement of autophagy machinery in promoting clearance or propagation of prion aggregates.  In conclusion, Drosophila models have played a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of neurodegenerative proteinopathies induced by protein misfolding and aggregation. By exploiting the conservation of key molecular pathways between flies and humans, researchers have made significant progress in elucidating how dysregulated autophagy contributes to disease pathogenesis. These fly models not only allow for the identification and validation of new therapeutic targets but also serve as powerful tools for screening potential drugs that modulate autophagic processes. Continued research using Drosophila will undoubtedly contribute further to our understanding of these devastating disorders and facilitate the development of effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases associated with proteinopathy-induced autophagy dysfunction.",continue
"Citizen science, a collaborative approach to scientific research involving members of the public, has emerged as a powerful tool for biodiversity conservation. By engaging ordinary people in data collection or analysis, citizen science projects can gather information on a scale that would be impossible for researchers alone. This democratization of scientific research not only helps in monitoring biodiversity but also creates awareness and understanding among participants.  To enhance the skills of citizen scientists, online training programs have become increasingly prevalent. These platforms provide participants with interactive tools and resources to improve their knowledge and abilities. One popular format is quiz-style online training, which offers a fun and engaging way to learn new concepts or identify species.  However, the effectiveness of quiz-style online training for species identification in citizen science projects has not been thoroughly evaluated. This gap in knowledge led us to develop TORI-TORE, an innovative quiz-style online training tool specifically designed to teach birdsong identification.  Birdsong identification is an important skill in bird monitoring and conservation efforts as it provides valuable insights into avian populations and their habitats. TORI-TORE incorporates memory mechanisms from adaptive learning theory to optimize learning outcomes by focusing on both accuracy and retention.  To assess the effectiveness of TORI-TORE, we conducted a randomized control trial in Fukushima, Japan. Participants were randomly assigned either to receive traditional classroom-based bird identification training or use the TORI-TORE platform. We evaluated their performance through test scores as well as questionnaires gauging attitudes towards birds before and after the training sessions.  Our findings revealed several key results: Firstly, participants who used TORI-TORE showed significant improvement in test scores compared to those who underwent traditional classroom-based training alone. This indicates that our quiz-style online tool was effective at enhancing birdsong identification skills.  In addition to improvements in test scores, survey responses indicated positive shifts in trainees' attitudes towards birds after using TORI-TORE. Participants reported increased interest and appreciation for birds and natural environments, demonstrating that our training tool has the potential to not only enhance expertise but also foster a deeper connection with nature.  Surprisingly, we found that adaptive training, which tailored questions to focus on unmastered bird species based on individuals' answer history, had unexpected effects. Trainees in this group achieved lower scores and expressed less satisfaction than those who received non-adaptive training. This suggests that a more balanced approach to question selection may be needed in future iterations of TORI-TORE.  Furthermore, we identified several factors that positively influenced test scores. Focusing on species that are relatively easy to remember increased participants' performance. Additionally, shorter lag times between training and testing sessions as well as longer question intervals were associated with higher scores. These insights will inform future improvements of the TORI-TORE platform.  While there is still room for refinement and optimization, our study demonstrates the potential of TORI-TORE as an online capacity-building tool for learning birdsong identification. By providing an accessible and engaging platform for citizen scientists to develop their skills in bird monitoring, TORI-TORE can contribute significantly to biodiversity conservation efforts.  In conclusion, the use of quiz-style online training tools has shown promise in improving species identification skills among citizen scientists involved in biodiversity monitoring projects. Our findings from studying the effectiveness of TORI-TORE provide valuable insights into how adaptive learning principles can be leveraged within such platforms for enhanced outcomes. We believe that the continued development and utilization of online training tools like TORI-TORE will not only support citizen science but also promote interest in natural environments among individuals worldwide",continue
"Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is a phenomenon that occurs when signals of different frequencies interact and influence each other. This nonlinear interaction has been found to be crucial in various aspects of neuronal computation, interregional communication, and the pathophysiology of diseases. In this review, we will explore the methodological advancements and challenges in computing CFC, with a particular focus on potential solutions to address spurious coupling, infer intrinsic rhythms within specific frequency bands, and identify causal interferences.  The study of CFC has provided valuable insights into cognitive processes and memory tasks. By analyzing the interactions between different frequency bands in the brain during these tasks, researchers have been able to gain deeper understanding of how neural networks support these functions. For example, studies have shown that increased phase synchronization between low-frequency theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) and high-frequency gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) is related to successful memory encoding or retrieval processes.  Similarly, investigations into CFC during sleep have shed light on the mechanisms underlying memory consolidation. It has been observed that slow-wave sleep is associated with enhanced coupling between slow oscillations (<1 Hz) and spindle oscillations (10-16 Hz). This coupling is believed to facilitate synaptic plasticity processes necessary for storing memories.  Moreover, examining CFC in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease has yielded valuable insights into their pathophysiology. For instance, aberrant CFC patterns have been identified in patients with Alzheimer's disease both at rest and during cognitive tasks. These findings suggest that disrupted interactions between different frequency bands may contribute to cognitive impairments observed in this condition.  Furthermore, understanding CFC can inform the development of neuromodulation techniques for therapeutic interventions. Invasive methods such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) or noninvasive approaches like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be optimized by targeting specific frequency bands or disrupting aberrant CFC patterns. Closed-loop brain stimulation, which adjusts the stimulation parameters based on ongoing neural activity, can particularly benefit from considering CFC as a biomarker for disease symptoms.  While CFC holds great promise as a tool in neuroscience research and therapeutic interventions, there are several methodological challenges that need to be addressed. One of these challenges is the potential presence of spurious coupling, where artifacts or confounding factors may mimic genuine underlying interactions. Methodological advancements should aim to develop reliable techniques that can distinguish between true and spurious CFC.  Another challenge lies in accurately inferring intrinsic rhythms within specific frequency bands. The decomposition methods used to extract oscillatory components from neural data should be carefully chosen and validated for accurate identification of relevant frequencies.  Finally, establishing causal interferences between different frequency bands remains a complex task. Techniques such as phase resetting or perturbation studies are needed to decipher the directionality and causality of CFC interactions.  In conclusion, studying CFC provides valuable insights into cognition, memory processes, sleep physiology, and neurological disorders. Furthermore, it has implications for optimizing invasive and noninvasive neuromodulation techniques. However, further methodological improvements are required to enhance the practical use of CFC in cyborg and bionic systems. Overcoming the challenges associated with spurious coupling detection, accurate inference of intrinsic rhythms within frequency bands, and elucidation of causal interferences will advance our understanding of brain function and facilitate its translation into clinical applications.

"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global concern that poses a significant threat to human health and healthcare systems. It occurs when microbes, such as bacteria, become resistant to the drugs used to treat them, rendering these medications ineffective. AMR leads to prolonged and severe infections, increased mortality rates, and higher medical costs.  Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of AMR due to factors such as limited access to healthcare services, inadequate infrastructure, and socioeconomic challenges. In addition to these challenges, inappropriate antibiotic use plays a major role in driving the rise of AMR in LMICs.  1.1 Weak Regulatory Frameworks: One of the primary drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs is the lack of robust regulatory frameworks for antimicrobial stewardship. Regulations regarding antibiotic prescription practices are often lacking or poorly enforced in many LMICs. This can lead to overuse or misuse of antibiotics by healthcare providers who may prescribe them without proper diagnostic testing or patient assessment.  1.2 Limited Access to Effective Diagnostic Tools: Inadequate access to rapid diagnostic technologies contributes significantly to inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs. Without proper diagnostic tools, healthcare providers may resort to empirical prescribing – administering antibiotics based on clinical judgment rather than solid evidence of bacterial infection or susceptibility patterns.  1.3 Patient Demand for Antibiotics: Patients' expectations and demands play a role in driving inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs as well. Due to various reasons including cultural beliefs and lack of understanding about proper indications for antibiotics, patients often pressure healthcare providers into prescribing antibiotics even when they may not be necessary.  1 4 Self-medication Practices: Over-the-counter availability of antibiotics contributes greatly towards inappropriate use since patients can easily access these medications without any professional medical guidance or prescription by a qualified practitioner.  1 5 Lack of Education on Appropriate Antibiotic Use : A lack of awareness among both healthcare providers and the general public regarding the appropriate use of antibiotics is prevalent in LMICs. This lack of education contributes to inappropriate prescribing practices by healthcare providers and leads to self-medication and misuse by patients.  1 6 Limited Availability of Alternative Treatments : In some LMICs, access to alternative treatments, such as vaccines or newer antibiotics, may be limited. This scarcity may lead healthcare providers to rely heavily on broad-spectrum antibiotics as a first-line approach to treatment due to a lack of viable alternatives.  1 7 Weak Surveillance Systems: Inadequate surveillance systems for monitoring antibiotic use and resistance patterns in many LMICs hinder effective control measures. Without accurate data on antimicrobial consumption and resistance rates, it becomes challenging for policymakers to develop evidence-based strategies for tackling inappropriate antibiotic use.  Given these drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use within LMICs, it is crucial that interventions target these specific factors. Strategies should aim at strengthening regulatory frameworks for antimicrobial stewardship, improving access to rapid diagnostic tools, educating both healthcare providers and the public about appropriate antibiotic use, developing sustainable alternatives or treatment options when available treatments are scarce while also implementing robust surveillance systems that track both antimicrobial consumption and resistance patterns.  In conclusion AMR is a pressing global issue that disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries due to various socioeconomic challenges. Inappropriate antibiotic use plays a significant role in driving this problem further in these countries. Addressing the drivers mentioned earlier can guide policies aimed at curbing inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs effectively ultimately mitigating the rise of AMR thus preserving these valuable medical resources for future generations",continue
"Preschool age is a critical time for the establishment of healthy eating habits, including the consumption of fruits and vegetables (FV). Unfortunately, FV intake in preschool children in the United States (US) is often inadequate, which can have detrimental effects on their overall development. As most preschool-aged children attend childcare or preschool, these settings present an ideal opportunity to implement interventions aimed at improving FV intake.  To assess the effectiveness of such interventions and explore the behavior change techniques (BCTs) used, a systematic review was conducted. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2012 and 2022. The studies focused specifically on interventions targeting diet or FV intake in preschoolers aged 2-5 years within US childcare or preschool settings.  A comprehensive search of four databases yielded six studies reporting on nine different interventions. The included studies were analyzed based on intervention type, measured effect on FV intake, and utilization of theoretical frameworks and BCTs.  Out of the nine interventions assessed, six were found to effectively increase FV consumption among preschoolers. Five of these successful interventions utilized nutrition education as their primary approach, providing information about the benefits of consuming FVs and strategies for incorporating them into meals and snacks. One intervention focused instead on manipulating the feeding environment to make healthy food options more easily accessible to children.  On the other hand, three interventions showed no significant effect on increasing FV intake among preschoolers. Two of these unsuccessful approaches involved manipulating aspects of the feeding environment in an attempt to influence food choices indirectly. One intervention employed peer modeling as a means to encourage children's acceptance and consumption of FVs.  Interestingly, there was no consistent pattern observed regarding use theory-based frameworks or BCTs across effective or ineffective interventions. While effective studies typically incorporated at least three BCTs into their approach, it is unclear which specific techniques were most influential in promoting FV intake.  Despite some promising findings, this systematic review underscores several key gaps in the existing research. First, there is a need for more studies conducted within US childcare settings that utilize objective measures of FV intake. Objective measures, such as skin carotenoid levels, provide more reliable data on actual consumption compared to self-reported dietary assessments.  Secondly, there is a need for studies directly comparing intervention components and BCTs to identify which strategies are most effective in promoting FV intake among preschoolers. By conducting head-to-head comparisons, researchers can gain valuable insights into the relative effectiveness of different intervention approaches.  Moreover, it is crucial for future interventions to be theory-based and incorporate theoretical frameworks that explain why certain behavior change techniques are expected to yield positive results. This will enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving successful interventions and contribute to the development of evidence-based strategies.  Lastly, long-term follow-up assessments are necessary to evaluate whether any changes in FV intake among preschoolers persist over time or if they fade away once the intervention concludes. Longitudinal studies will help determine whether behavior change achieved during preschool years extends into later stages of childhood and adulthood.  In conclusion, while some interventions have shown promise in increasing FV consumption among US preschool-aged children attending childcare or preschool settings, there remains a need for more rigorous research utilizing objective measures of FV intake. Future studies should also compare different components and techniques used within interventions while incorporating theoretical frameworks and assessing long-term behavior change outcomes. These efforts will contribute toward developing effective strategies to improve dietary habits from an early age and promote lifelong health and well-being.",continue
"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla and extra-adrenal paraganglia, respectively. These tumors are characterized by excessive production and release of catecholamines, resulting in episodic or sustained hypertension. Currently, surgical resection is the only curative treatment for these tumors, but in cases where metastasis has occurred or when surgery is not feasible, therapeutic options are limited.  Epigenetic alterations have been increasingly recognized as major contributors to tumorigenesis. Histone modifications, including acetylation and deacetylation of histones, play a pivotal role in gene regulation by affecting chromatin structure and accessibility to transcription factors. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from histones leading to condensed chromatin structure and gene silencing. Inhibition of HDAC activity can reverse this process and result in the activation of tumor suppressor genes or induction of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.  Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have emerged as promising therapeutics for various types of cancer due to their ability to modulate key cellular processes involved in tumorigenesis. HDACis exert their antitumor effects through multiple mechanisms such as the induction of cell cycle arrest, differentiation, apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, modulation of immune response pathways as well as affecting DNA repair mechanisms.  Several studies have investigated the potential therapeutic role for HDACis in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Preclinical studies using various HDACis have shown promising results with reduced tumor growth both in vitro and xenograft models. For instance, treatment with the pan-HDAC inhibitor vorinostat has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma cell lines. Another HDACi, panobinostat, has been found to decrease tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of metastatic paraganglioma.  In addition to their direct effects on tumor cells, HDACis have also been shown to modulate the tumor microenvironment. They can regulate the expression of immune checkpoint molecules and enhance natural killer cell-mediated killing of tumor cells. This suggests that HDACis may have potential synergistic effects with immunotherapy approaches for the treatment of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.  Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of HDACis in patients with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are still limited, but initial results are promising. In a phase II clinical trial, treatment with vorinostat resulted in disease stabilization or partial response in a subset of patients with advanced/metastatic paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma.  Overall, the available evidence suggests that HDACis hold promise as novel therapeutic agents for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Their ability to target multiple pathways involved in tumorigenesis makes them attractive candidates for combination therapies with other targeted agents or immunotherapies. However, further research is needed to optimize their use and elucidate mechanisms of resistance to these agents. Future clinical trials should focus on identifying predictive biomarkers for patient selection as well as investigating optimal dosing schedules and combination strategies to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. 2. Mechanisms of action  The antitumor effects of HDACis in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are mediated through a variety of mechanisms. One key mechanism is the induction of cell cycle arrest by upregulating cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) such as p21 and p27, which leads to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. HDACis can also inhibit the activation of key signaling pathways involved in tumor growth and survival, including PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways.  Furthermore, HDACis induce apoptosis in tumor cells by enhancing pro-apoptotic signals and suppressing anti-apoptotic signals. They can upregulate pro-apoptotic genes such as BAX and downregulate anti-apoptotic genes like BCL-2, thereby shifting the balance towards apoptosis. Moreover, HDACis can interfere with DNA repair mechanisms, making tumor cells more susceptible to DNA damage-induced cell death.  In addition to their effects on tumor cells themselves, HDACis also have an impact on the tumor microenvironment. They can modulate angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and decreasing angiogenic factors like hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α). This leads to reduced blood supply to tumors, impairing their growth.  3. Preclinical evidence  Several preclinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of HDACis in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma models. For example, treatment with vorinostat has been shown to significantly reduce cell viability and induce apoptosis in various pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma cell lines.  Another study using panobinostat showed potent antitumor activity in xenograft models derived from metastatic paragangliomas. The treated mice exhibited reduced tumor growth and increased survival compared to the control group. These preclinical findings provide a strong rationale for further investigating the clinical utility of HDACis in these tumors.  4. Clinical evidence  Although clinical evidence for the use of HDACis specifically in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas is limited, there have been some encouraging findings. In a phase II trial, vorinostat was administered to patients with advanced/metastatic paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma who had progressed on prior therapies. The treatment resulted in disease stabilization or partial response in a subset of patients, with manageable side effects.  5. Future directions  Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the potential of HDACis as therapeutic agents for pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Firstly, more preclinical studies are necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms by which HDACis exert their antitumor effects in these tumors.  Furthermore, well-designed clinical trials are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of HDACis as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments such as targeted therapies or immunotherapies. Additionally, identifying predictive biomarkers that can help select patients who are most likely to benefit from HDACi therapy would be valuable.  It is also important to investigate strategies that can overcome potential resistance mechanisms towards HDACis. Combination approaches with other epigenetic modifiers or targeted agents may enhance therapeutic response and prevent resistance development.  6.The Conclusion  In conclusion, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) represent a promising therapeutic approach for treating pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. These drugs have shown antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo models through various mechanisms including cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, modulation of angiogenesis, and immune response pathways.  Initial clinical trial results have demonstrated disease stabilization or partial response in patients with advanced/metastatic disease. However, more research is needed to optimize dosing schedules, identify predictive biomarkers, and explore combination strategies that may enhance therapeutic efficacy.  Overall, HDACis hold great potential as an alternative treatment option for patients with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas where surgery is not feasible or metastasis has occurred. Further investigation into the use of HDACis in these rare neuroendocrine tumors will provide valuable insights into their clinical implementation and may ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes.",continue
"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the controversial effects of smoking and nicotine on the susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that smokers are at a higher risk of COVID-19 due to the overexpression of host receptors necessary for viral entry, there are also reports indicating a lower incidence of the disease among smokers.  It is important to note that the effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke may not be interchangeable. Nicotine, which is found in tobacco products, has been reported to have a dual role in inflammation - it can both promote inflammation and have anti-inflammatory properties. This complicates our understanding of its impact on COVID-19 infection.  To gain insight into the effect of pure nicotine on cells involved in COVID-19 infection, we adopted an organ-based systematic approach. We examined how nicotine affects various organs involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis by considering 12 related diseases associated with these organs. This approach allowed us to assess whether nicotine has any protective or damaging effects on these organs.  It is crucial to differentiate between nicotine and cigarette smoke when conducting research on their effects. Generalizing their effects can introduce significant bias into studies, as they have distinct chemical compositions with potentially different impacts on health.  Moreover, it should be noted that the response to different doses of nicotine varies significantly. The effects observed may depend on the dosage administered, indicating a dose-dependent response. Therefore, it is essential to consider varying concentrations when studying the effect of nicotine on COVID-19 infection.  In addition to focusing solely on nicotine's role in COVID-19 infection, it is necessary to assess underlying diseases as well. Many individuals who smoke also suffer from comorbidities that could influence their susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taking into account these underlying conditions will allow for a more comprehensive understanding and facilitate targeted interventions for better treatment outcomes.  This study aims not only to investigate the effect of nicotine on cellular mechanisms involved in COVID-19 infection but also to provide a guideline for healthcare professionals. Understanding the role of nicotine and smoking in disease progression can guide healthcare providers in advising their patients and developing personalized approaches to treatment.  2. Methods  In this study, we utilized an organ-based systematic approach to investigate the effect of nicotine on damaged organs associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis. We reviewed literature and data regarding various diseases related to these organs, including lungs, heart, blood vessels, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, nervous system, etc.  We analyzed studies that investigated the specific effects of nicotine on these organs and how it may influence their susceptibility or response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By collating and critically evaluating existing research findings, we aimed to identify any patterns or correlations between nicotine exposure and organ damage or protection within the context of COVID-19 infection.  Furthermore, we considered comorbidities commonly associated with smokers such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), etc., as these conditions could potentially exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms or affect disease outcomes.  3. Results  The findings from our analysis will be presented comprehensively in subsequent sections and will shed light on whether nicotine has a protective or damaging effect on each organ involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. We will discuss both cellular responses specific to each organ as well as any overarching trends observed across multiple studies.  Additionally, we will explore potential interactions between underlying diseases prevalent among smokers and their impact on response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This comprehensive evaluation aims to provide healthcare professionals with valuable insights into how smoking habits may influence individual patient outcomes during the ongoing pandemic.  4. Discussion  The discussion section will delve deeper into our findings by contextualizing them within current scientific knowledge surrounding SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated pathophysiology. We will address the discrepancies in reported data regarding the effects of nicotine on susceptibility to COVID-19 and highlight potential reasons for these inconsistencies.  Furthermore, by considering the dual role of nicotine in inflammation and its diverse effects on different organs, we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of its impact on COVID-19 infection. This discussion will help elucidate the complexities surrounding smoking and nicotine use during this global health crisis.  5. Conclusion  The conclusion section will summarize our findings and their implications for both healthcare providers and individuals who smoke or use nicotine products. We will emphasize the importance of careful interpretation when generalizing the effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke, as well as considering varying doses.  Our study underscores the need for further research into understanding how smoking habits and nicotine exposure influence susceptibility, progression, and treatment outcomes in COVID-19 patients. By leveraging these insights, healthcare professionals can better support patients by providing tailored guidance to optimize their health outcomes during this pandemic.  In conclusion, exploring the controversial effects of smoking and nicotine in SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies and personalized treatments that take into account individual risk factors associated with smoking habits.",continue
"Prostate cancer is a significant health concern globally, with increasing prevalence in developed and developing countries. Among the treatment approaches for advanced prostate cancer, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been an established standard for over 80 years. ADT primarily aims to reduce circulating androgen levels and block androgen signaling to inhibit tumor growth. While initial responses to ADT are generally positive, some tumor cell populations eventually become resistant to therapy and continue to metastasize.  Recent studies have shed light on a potential mechanism contributing to resistance in advanced prostate cancer treated with ADT. Evidence suggests that ADT may induce cadherin switching, specifically from E-cadherin (a marker of epithelial cells) to N-cadherin (a marker of mesenchymal cells). This phenomenon is known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).  Cadherins are a family of transmembrane proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion. They play critical roles in maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues by ensuring tightly connected cell networks via E-cadherin-mediated interactions. Loss or reduced expression of E-cadherin disrupts these connections, leading to cellular detachment from the primary tumor mass.  N-cadherin, on the other hand, is normally associated with mesenchymal cells that exhibit migratory properties during development or tissue repair processes. However, its aberrant expression in epithelial cells under pathological conditions can promote invasive behaviors typical of metastatic cancers.  Several factors contribute to cadherin switching during ADT treatment in prostate cancer. Direct mechanisms involve alterations in gene expression at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. For example, elevated levels of transcription factors such as ZEB1/2 repress E-cadherin expression while upregulating N-cadherin transcription.  Indirect mechanisms involve activation of signaling pathways such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) pathway, which plays a crucial role in EMT regulation. TGFB acts as a stimulator for several transcription factors, including Snail and Slug, which are known to suppress E-cadherin expression. Additionally, TGFB signaling can influence the activity of microRNAs that control cadherin expression by directly targeting their mRNA molecules.  Understanding the molecular basis of ADT-induced cadherin switching is crucial from both diagnostic and therapeutic perspectives. Monitoring changes in the expression of specific cadherins during treatment could serve as potential biomarkers for predicting therapy response or disease progression.  Furthermore, targeting the regulatory pathways involved in cadherin switching may provide novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to ADT. For instance, inhibiting signaling cascades downstream of TGFB or directly targeting key transcription factors involved in EMT could potentially reverse or prevent cadherin switching and subsequent metastasis.  In conclusion, this study provides an overview of ADT-dependent cadherin switching in advanced prostate cancer from a molecular perspective. By examining the various mechanisms underlying this phenomenon with a special focus on transcriptional factors regulated through the TGFB pathway, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of resistance mechanisms and suggest potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.  2. Cadherin Switching and its Impact on Tumor Progression  The loss or downregulation of E-cadherin and the acquisition of N-cadherin expression through cadherin switching have profound implications for tumor progression and metastasis. E-cadherin serves as a tumor suppressor by maintaining cell-cell adhesion, inhibiting proliferation, and suppressing invasiveness.  When E-cadherin is lost or suppressed during ADT, the cohesive epithelial tissue structure is disrupted. This allows tumor cells to detach from the primary tumor mass, invade surrounding tissues, intravasate into blood vessels or lymphatics, and disseminate to distant sites. Once at secondary sites, the newly acquired N-cadherin promotes mesenchymal characteristics in these cells that allow them to adhere to endothelial cells in distant organs and initiate metastatic colonization.  In addition to promoting invasion and metastasis, cadherin switching has been associated with therapeutic resistance. It has been observed that cancer cells undergoing EMT display increased resistance to conventional therapies such as chemotherapy or radiation. This may be due to altered signaling pathways or changes in cellular phenotypes that render them more resistant to cell death.  3. Molecular Mechanisms of Cadherin Switching Induced by ADT  Several molecular mechanisms have been implicated in cadherin switching induced by ADT in advanced prostate cancer. The TGFB pathway plays a significant role in this process as it activates various downstream effector molecules involved in transcriptional regulation.  Upon activation of TGFB signaling, transcription factors such as Snail family proteins (Snail1/Snail2) are upregulated. These transcription factors bind directly to the promoter region of the CDH1 gene encoding E-cadherin and repress its expression through epigenetic modifications.  Another important regulatory mechanism involves microRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Several miRNAs, including miR-200 family members, are involved in maintaining epithelial characteristics by directly targeting N-cadherin mRNA and downregulating its expression. ADT treatment can alter the expression of these miRNAs leading to the upregulation of N-cadherin.  Furthermore, other signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and Notch can cross-talk with TGFB signaling to further modulate cadherin switching. These pathways regulate the activity of transcription factors that indirectly control EMT-associated gene expression.  4. Therapeutic Implications and Future Directions  Understanding the molecular basis of cadherin switching induced by ADT has significant implications for prostate cancer management. The identification of biomarkers associated with this process could aid in predicting treatment response and disease progression in patients undergoing ADT.  Moreover, targeting key molecules involved in cadherin switching may provide potential therapeutic avenues for overcoming resistance to ADT. For instance, therapeutics designed to inhibit TGFB signaling or its downstream effectors could potentially reverse EMT and restore sensitivity to therapy.  Additionally, combination therapies that simultaneously target both the androgen receptor pathway (via ADT) and EMT-related pathways (such as TGFB) may be more effective in preventing or delaying the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer.  In conclusion, dissecting the effects of cadherin switching induced by ADT on advanced prostate cancer provides valuable insights into tumor progression mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies. Further research is needed to elucidate additional molecular players involved in this process and explore their clinical relevance for improving patient outcomes in advanced prostate cancer treatment.

"Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections have revolutionized the treatment of various macular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), and retinal vein occlusion (RVO). These therapies work by inhibiting the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, thereby reducing vision loss and improving visual outcomes. However, the effectiveness of these treatments is heavily dependent on patients' adherence and persistence to their prescribed treatment regimens.  Adherence refers to the extent to which a patient takes their medications as per agreed recommendations from their healthcare provider. Non-adherence occurs when patients do not follow these recommendations, such as missing or skipping doses. On the other hand, persistence refers to continuing with the treatment for the prescribed duration without discontinuing prematurely. Both non-adherence and non-persistence can have detrimental effects on treatment outcomes.  The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate existing literature on patient-led non-adherence and non-persistence to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, highlighting its prevalence and identifying factors contributing to this behavior. A comprehensive search was conducted in several databases including Google Scholar, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, and The Cochrane Library.  A total of 409,215 patients across 52 studies were included in this analysis. The studies encompassed different treatment regimens such as pro re nata (PRN), monthly injection protocols, and treat-and-extend protocols with varied durations ranging from 4 months to 8 years. Out of these 52 studies, 22 provided insights into reasons for patient non-adherence or non-persistence.  The results showed that patient-led non-adherence varied between 17.5% and 35%, depending on how it was defined in each study. Overall pooled prevalence of patient-led non-persistence was found to be at a significant level of 30%. The reasons for non-adherence or non-persistence were diverse and included dissatisfaction with treatment results, financial burden, older age and comorbidities, difficulty booking appointments, travel distance and social isolation, lack of time, satisfaction with perceived improvement in their condition, fear of injections, loss of motivation or apathy towards eyesight. Other factors contributing to non-adherence or non-persistence were dissatisfaction with the facilities provided and discomfort or pain associated with the injections.  Interestingly, three studies highlighted higher rates of non-adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was attributed to patients' fear of exposure to COVID-19 as well as difficulties in traveling and visiting healthcare facilities during lockdowns.  Overall, these findings emphasize the need for further research into patient-led non-adherence and non-persistence in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy. Understanding the prevalence and factors contributing to these behaviors can help identify at-risk individuals who may benefit from targeted interventions to improve treatment outcomes in real-world settings.  To enhance future research in this area, it is crucial to establish uniform definitions and standard timescales for what constitutes non-adherence/non-persistence. This will facilitate more accurate comparisons across studies and enable a better understanding of the impact on visual outcomes.  In conclusion, this systematic review highlights high levels of patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence to anti-VEGF therapy for macular diseases. Dissatisfaction with treatment results emerged as a key factor contributing to this behavior along with financial burden and other practical barriers such as travel distance. These findings provide valuable insights into improving clinical practice by identifying individuals at risk of poor adherence/persistence and developing targeted interventions to enhance real-world visual outcomes in patients undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.",continue
"Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental illnesses, affecting millions of people worldwide. They are characterized by excessive and persistent worry, fear, and unease that can significantly impair daily functioning and quality of life. Despite the availability of various treatment options, such as psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, not all individuals respond well to these interventions or experience significant side effects.  Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS) is a traditional Chinese medicine prescription that has been used for centuries to treat a range of psychological disorders, including anxiety. It consists of several herbal ingredients, including Bupleurum chinense (Chaihu), Paeonia lactiflora (Baishao), Atractylodes macrocephala (Baizhu), Angelica sinensis (Danggui), Poria cocos (Fuling), Gardenia jasminoides (Zhizi), Mentha haplocalyx (Bohe), and Glycyrrhiza uralensis (Gancao). JWXYS has shown excellent clinical efficacy in treating anxiety disorder but has not received widespread attention in Western medicine.  To evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of JWXYS in anxiety disorder treatment, this review conducted an analysis of animal experiments, clinical trials, and mechanism studies. PubMed and CNKI were utilized to search for relevant literature written in English or with English abstracts.  In clinical trials exploring JWXYS for anxiety disorder treatment alone or in combination with other drugs, it was found that JWXYS effectively reduced the symptoms associated with anxiety disorders. Additionally, when used as an adjunctive therapy alongside other medications commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or benzodiazepines,  JWXYS reduced their adverse reactions while maintaining its own therapeutic effects. This suggests that JWXYS may provide a safer alternative for long-term use compared to some conventional medications.   Preclinical studies using animal models have also demonstrated the anxiolytic effects of JWXYS. These studies showed that JWXYS can reduce anxiety-like behavior in mice and rats. It is worth noting that the mechanisms underlying these effects are complex and involve multiple systems within the central nervous system.  One proposed mechanism of action for JWXYS in anxiety disorder treatment involves its ability to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Chronic stress and dysregulation of the HPA axis have been implicated in anxiety disorders, and JWXYS has been shown to normalize HPA axis activity in animal models.  Furthermore, JWXYS has shown efficacy in modulating neurotransmitter levels implicated in anxiety disorders, such as serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA). By restoring balance to these neurotransmitters, JWXYS may help alleviate symptoms associated with anxiety.  Moreover, studies have shown that JWXYS promotes neurogenesis – the growth and development of new neurons – which is believed to play a crucial role in mood regulation. This neurogenic effect may contribute to the anxiolytic properties observed with this prescription.  These studies also suggest that JWXYS regulates enzyme synthesis involved in neurotransmitter metabolism or signal transmission pathways related to anxiety disorders. By regulating these processes at a molecular level, it may further contribute to its therapeutic effects on anxiety symptoms.  In conclusion, this review provides substantial evidence for the effectiveness of Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS) as a treatment for anxiety disorders. Its favourable clinical results coupled with preclinical studies showing anxiolytic effects demonstrate its potential as an alternative or adjunctive therapy for individuals struggling with excessive worry and fear. Furthermore, by elucidating some underlying mechanisms involving HPA axis normalization, neurotransmitter modulation including GABA-ergic signaling enhancement along with increased neurogenesis and enzyme synthesis regulation; this review offers insights into potential targets for developing new anxiolytic drugs based on JWXYS. With further research and collaboration, it is possible to unlock the full potential of this traditional Chinese medicine prescription and improve treatment outcomes for individuals with anxiety disorders.",continue
"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare, immune-mediated neuropathy characterized by the progressive paralysis of muscles and peripheral nerves. Its exact cause is not completely understood, but both cellular and humoral immunity play a crucial role in its development. Molecular mimicry, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells due to similarities with pathogens, is considered to be the leading theory explaining the pathogenesis of GBS.  Currently, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE) are the most effective treatments for GBS in improving patient prognosis. IVIg works by modulating the immune response and reducing inflammation, while PE removes harmful antibodies from the blood. Despite these treatments being beneficial for many patients, there has been limited progress in developing new treatment strategies or improving overall outcomes.  In recent years, there has been a growing focus on developing novel immunotherapies that specifically target various aspects of immune response involved in GBS pathogenesis. These approaches aim to either block or modulate specific components of immune system activation associated with disease progression.  One promising strategy is targeting antibodies responsible for initiating and perpetuating nerve damage in GBS. High-dose anti-ganglioside antibody therapies have shown potential by specifically neutralizing pathogenic antibodies that contribute to nerve damage. Additionally, monoclonal antibody therapies directed against specific targets in immune cells such as B-cells or T-cells show promise due to their ability to selectively suppress harmful immune responses.  Another line of investigation involves blocking complement pathways that are activated during GBS onset. Complement inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy at preventing pathological inflammatory responses seen in GBS models and may provide an alternative therapeutic approach for future clinical trials.  Furthermore, modulation of cytokines involved in inflammation can also be seen as a potential avenue for treatment development. For instance, interferon-beta therapy has shown promise by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which are involved in GBS pathogenesis. By reducing cytokine levels, interferon-beta treatment aims to mitigate the damaging effects of inflammation on peripheral nerves.  While many of these new immunotherapies hold promise, it is important to note that they are still undergoing clinical trials and have yet to receive approval for GBS treatment. Success in these trials will hinge on demonstrating safety, efficacy, and potential benefits over current standard therapies like IVIg and PE.  In conclusion, there has been a growing interest in developing new immunotherapies for the treatment of Guillain-Barré syndrome. These novel strategies target various components of the immune system involved in disease pathogenesis and aim to improve patient outcomes beyond existing therapies. Although still experimental, the progress being made in understanding the underlying mechanisms of GBS and developing targeted treatments offers hope for improved management of this debilitating condition in the future.  2. Current therapies for GBS  Currently, the mainstay treatments for Guillain-Barré syndrome include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE). IVIg therapy involves administering a high dose of human immunoglobulin, which helps to suppress the destructive immune response and reduce inflammation in the peripheral nerves. PE, on the other hand, involves removing the patient's blood plasma and replacing it with a substitute solution, effectively eliminating harmful antibodies from circulation.  Both IVIg and PE have been proven to be effective in improving outcomes for patients with GBS. However, they are not without limitations. The cost of these treatments can be substantial, making them inaccessible to some patients. Additionally, access to specialized treatment centers equipped to provide PE may be limited in certain regions. Therefore, there is a need for alternative therapeutic options that are more readily available and cost-effective.  3. Treatment strategies based on pathogenesis  Given the complexity of Guillain-Barré syndrome's pathogenesis involving both cellular and humoral immunity through molecular mimicry mechanisms, researchers have been exploring novel treatment strategies that target specific components of this immune response.  One approach involves targeting autoantibodies responsible for initiating nerve damage by employing selective adsorption techniques like protein A or protein G columns or using extracorporeal immunoadsorption devices. These methods aim to specifically remove pathogenic autoantibodies associated with GBS while preserving beneficial antibodies involved in normal immune function.  Another area of investigation focuses on modulating immune cells involved in the progression of GBS. This can be achieved through targeted therapy against B-cells or T-cells using monoclonal antibodies or small molecule inhibitors that prevent their activation or migration into peripheral nerves.  Furthermore, complement pathways represent an attractive target for intervention since they play a significant role in amplifying inflammation during GBS onset. Inhibitors against specific components within these pathways have shown promise in preclinical studies and suggest potential benefits for future clinical trials.  The modulation of cytokines, particularly those involved in immune response regulation and inflammation, is another avenue for therapy development. The use of monoclonal antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokines or the introduction of anti-inflammatory mediators aims to restore immune homeostasis and attenuate the damaging effects on peripheral nerves.  4. Conclusion  In recent years, there has been significant progress in understanding the pathogenesis of Guillain-Barré syndrome and developing novel therapeutic strategies for its management. While IVIg and PE remain the standard treatments with proven efficacy, exploring alternative immunotherapies that target specific components of the immune response offers hope for improved outcomes.  By targeting autoantibodies, complement pathways, immune cells, or cytokines involved in GBS pathogenesis, researchers aim to develop more targeted interventions that can be tailored to individual patients. However, it is important to note that these therapies are still under investigation and have yet to receive approval as standard treatments.  Moving forward, it will be crucial to conduct well-designed clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these new approaches thoroughly. Additionally, access to these innovative therapies should be considered alongside cost-effectiveness measures to ensure their widespread availability.  Overall, progress in immunotherapy strategies for Guillain-Barré syndrome provides optimism for advancements in GBS treatment options. By continuing research efforts focused on understanding disease mechanisms at a molecular level and conducting robust clinical trials evaluating innovative therapeutics targeting specific components of immune response pathways involved in GBS pathogenesis; we aim towards improving patient outcomes and enhancing their quality of life affected by this debilitating condition.

"Introduction:  Cannabis use has become increasingly prevalent globally due to the legalization of recreational marijuana in many countries. As a result, the number of cannabis-related adverse events being encountered in Emergency Departments (EDs) has also increased. These adverse events often present with mental health symptoms, posing a significant challenge for clinicians and researchers trying to disentangle cannabis use from other recreational substances.  Previous reviews have examined the types and numbers of cannabis-associated adverse events seen in EDs. However, since these reviews were published, the legal landscape surrounding cannabis has changed dramatically. This review aims to provide an updated understanding of mental health adverse events related to cannabis use in EDs and critically evaluate the current state of research on this topic.  One major concern when studying these events is potential biases that may affect data validity. Both clinicians and researchers can introduce biases that might hinder accurate assessment of the interaction between cannabis and mental health outcomes. For instance, many studies rely on administrative data from front-line healthcare providers who identify cases where cannabis use is associated with a particular admission. Such reliance on subjective assessments raises questions about accuracy and consistency across different settings.  This narrative review aims to consolidate existing knowledge concerning mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use in EDs by examining available literature through a critical lens. It will focus not only on individuals with pre-existing mental illness but also explore findings related to those without such history.  Additionally, this review will consider gender differences in how cannabis impacts mental health outcomes since emerging evidence suggests variations between sexes exist. Understanding these gender-specific effects could inform targeted interventions and prevention strategies.  The primary objectives of this review include identifying common mental health complications associated with cannabis use that are frequently observed in ED settings while highlighting exceptionally rare yet concerning event reports as well.The authors also propose a framework for critically evaluating future research within this field for more robust assessment of causal relationships between cannabis consumption patterns and subsequent psychological sequelae.  By addressing these objectives, this narrative review aims to consolidate the current state of knowledge regarding mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use in EDs. Understanding the prevalence, specific symptoms, and potential underlying mechanisms is crucial for developing effective clinical management strategies and public health interventions.  In conclusion, this review will provide an updated overview of mental health adverse events related to cannabis use encountered in EDs. It will address biases that may affect research validity while considering implications for patients with or without a history of mental illness. By exploring gender differences and proposing a framework for future research evaluation, this review aims to contribute to our understanding of the complex relationship between cannabis use and mental health outcomes in ED settings. 2. Current State of Knowledge:   The current state of knowledge regarding mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use in EDs is rapidly evolving due to the changing legal climate and increased research attention in this area. Studies have shown that cannabis use can have both short-term and long-term effects on mental health, ranging from acute intoxication-related symptoms to more chronic psychiatric illnesses.  In terms of acute effects, cannabis use has been linked to increased anxiety, panic attacks, and psychosis-like symptoms in some individuals. These presentations are often observed in the ED when individuals seek medical help for their distressing experiences. It is essential to distinguish between pre-existing mental illness exacerbations triggered by cannabis use and new-onset psychiatric symptoms directly attributable to its consumption.  Research has also identified a potential link between long-term cannabis use and an increased risk of developing mental health disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. However, the causal relationship between cannabis use and these disorders remains unclear. It is challenging to definitively establish if those already prone to mental illness are at higher risk due to their prior vulnerability or if heavy cannabis consumption plays a role independent of pre-existing predispositions.  Furthermore, recent studies have begun exploring gender differences related to the impact of cannabis on mental health outcomes. Some evidence suggests that females may be more vulnerable than males when it comes to adverse psychological reactions following cannabis use. This finding emphasizes the need for gender-specific research that considers biological factors as well as social contexts influencing drug responses.  3. Evaluation Bias:  To gain a clearer understanding of the existing literature on this topic, it is crucial to evaluate potential biases within research designs themselves. Several limitations can impact data validity when examining mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use in EDs.  One common bias stems from relying heavily on self-reported data or subjective assessments made by healthcare providers regarding patients' history or experience with drug consumption during ED visits. Accurate reporting relies heavily on patients' honesty and recall ability, which may be compromised during intoxication or due to social desirability bias.  Another potential bias arises from inadequate control of confounding factors and variable definitions among studies. Cannabis use is often found in conjunction with the use of other recreational substances, making it challenging to isolate the effects of cannabis alone. Further research applying rigorous control measures is necessary to disentangle these complex relationships.  Additionally, selection biases may occur when recruiting patients for research studies in ED settings. Not all individuals who consume cannabis and experience associated psychological symptoms seek medical attention in an ED setting. These selection biases can influence the representation of certain populations and limit generalizability.  4. Framework for Future Research:  To address these biases and improve the validity of future research on mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use in EDs, a framework for critical evaluation is proposed.  Firstly, standardized definitions need to be established regarding what constitutes a mental health adverse event related specifically to cannabis use. Consistency in terminology will facilitate comparison across studies and accurate identification within clinical settings.  Secondly, researchers should utilize objective measures whenever possible to mitigate reliance on subjective assessments or self-reported data. For instance, incorporating toxicology screens along with detailed clinical evaluations can provide more robust evidence linking specific substances directly to psychiatric symptoms observed upon presentation at an ED.  Thirdly, future studies should aim for better control of confounding variables by employing matched-control designs or adjusting statistical analyses for potential confounders such as co-occurring substance use or pre-existing psychiatric conditions that might impact outcomes independently from cannabis consumption itself.  Lastly, efforts must be made towards diversity in study populations by including individuals from various backgrounds and demographics to account for potentially differential effects related to age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status as well as gender differences previously mentioned above.  In conclusion, understanding mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use encountered in EDs requires ongoing analysis and critical evaluation due to continuously changing legal landscapes worldwide. The current state of knowledge indicates potential short-term and long-term effects on mental health, with some evidence suggesting gender-based differences in vulnerability. Evaluating biases within research designs and proposing a framework for future investigations will enable more accurate assessments of the relationship between cannabis use and mental health outcomes in the ED setting. By addressing these gaps, we can better inform clinical decision-making, develop targeted interventions, and enhance public health strategies surrounding cannabis use.",continue
"Calcaneal apophysitis, also known as Sever's disease, is a common condition that affects the growth plate in the heel bone of children and adolescents. Despite its prevalence, there is still a lack of consensus on the risk factors and associated factors for developing calcaneal apophysitis. Therefore, it is important to conduct a systematic review to identify and analyze these factors.  The aim of this review was to identify both intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors (RFs), associated factors (AFs), and consequences of developing calcaneal apophysitis. A comprehensive search was conducted in various databases including Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science, and Evidence from inception to April 2021.  From the initial search results, 736 studies were identified. After screening titles and abstracts for eligibility criteria, 11 observational studies fully met the inclusion criteria. These studies included a total of 1265 participants with an average age of 10.72 years.  Of the included studies, four identified extrinsic factors related to calcaneal apophysitis while ten identified intrinsic factors. Three studies identified both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributing to calcaneal apophysitis development. The findings suggest that various RFs play a role in this condition.  In terms of extrinsic RFs for calcaneal apophysitis development, limitations in ankle dorsiflexion were frequently reported among the included studies. This suggests that reduced range of motion in ankle movement may contribute to increased stress on the heel bone during physical activities.  Additionally, foot alignment was found to be associated with an increased risk for calcaneal apophysitis development. Studies showed that foot malalignments such as pronation or supination can lead to abnormal loading patterns on the heel bone during weight-bearing activities.  Furthermore, intrinsic RFs such as stiffness and mobility of midfoot joints were also found to be associated with calcaneal apophysitis. Reduced mobility and increased stiffness in these joints can affect the distribution of forces during activities, potentially leading to excessive stress on the growth plate.  Other identified RFs and AFs include plantar pressures and ground reaction force, body mass index (BMI), age, gender, presence of other osteochondroses (abnormalities in bone growth), and participation in sports. These factors may contribute to alterations in mechanical loading on the heel bone or impact skeletal development.  Despite some consensus among studies regarding certain factors, there were disagreements and lack of unanimity between different investigations. This highlights the need for further research to establish a clearer understanding of the role each factor plays in calcaneal apophysitis development.  Overall, this systematic review provides insights into both intrinsic and extrinsic RFs, AFs, and consequences associated with calcaneal apophysitis. Limitations in ankle dorsiflexion, foot malalignment, stiffness of midfoot joints, plantar pressures and ground reaction force are among the factors identified. However, further studies are needed to determine the precise relationship between these factors and calcaneal apophysitis development.  In conclusion, understanding the risk factors associated with calcaneal apophysitis is crucial for prevention strategies as well as identifying individuals at higher risk for this condition. By addressing modifiable risk factors such as foot alignment or ankle range of motion limitations early on through appropriate interventions or modifications to activity levels or footwear choices may help reduce the incidence or severity of calcaneal apophysitis.

"Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors have gained significant attention in the field of optical sensing due to their high sensitivity to small changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium. These sensors are based on the excitation of collective oscillations of electrons, known as surface plasmons, on a metal-dielectric interface. When these surface plasmons interact with incident light, they produce a sharp absorption peak in the reflected or transmitted spectrum, which is highly sensitive to any changes occurring at the interface.  However, one of the major challenges in SPR sensing is obtaining narrow linewidths for resonance spectra. This is because metals inherently possess high optical losses that broaden the spectral response. The broad linewidths limit the resolution and accuracy of these sensors and limits their potential applications.  In recent years, extensive efforts have been made to overcome this limitation and achieve narrow linewidths for SPR sensors. This review focuses on various approaches that have been developed for fabricating nanostructured surfaces that support narrow linewidths in plasmon resonance spectra.  Firstly, by introducing surface lattice resonances or plasmonic Fano resonances into nanostructures, it is possible to obtain narrower linewidths compared to conventional structures. Surface lattice resonances arise from periodic metallic nanopatterns and can be fine-tuned through structural parameters such as lattice constant and shape. Plasmonic Fano resonances result from interference between localized plasmon modes and continuum plasmon modes, leading to asymmetric line shapes with enhanced sensitivity.  Secondly, by coupling metallic nanostructures with photonic cavities such as microdisks or micro-ring resonators can further enhance sensitivity while narrowing resonance linewidths. The confined photonic modes coupled with surface plasmons create hybrid states that exhibit narrower spectral response due to coherent interactions between light and matter.  Additionally, ultra-narrow resonators can be fabricated using techniques like electron beam lithography or focused ion beam milling combined with controlled etching. These structures have extremely small feature sizes, enabling highly localized plasmon resonances with significantly narrower linewidths.  Moreover, strategies such as platform-induced modification and alternating different dielectric layers can further improve the performance of SPR sensors by reducing optical losses and enhancing the quality factor of plasmonic resonances. Another approach is coupling surface plasmons with whispering-gallery-modes (WGMs) in microcavities, which can lead to resonance linewidth reduction through mode coupling effects.  The development of these nanostructured SPR sensors opens up new possibilities for various applications. They have been widely used in biosensing, environmental monitoring, and chemical sensing due to their high sensitivity and label-free detection capabilities. For example, SPR sensors can be employed for real-time monitoring of biomolecular interactions or detection of trace amounts of chemicals in water samples.  However, there are still challenges that need to be addressed in the field of nanostructured SPR sensors. The fabrication processes involved in creating these structures are complex and time-consuming, requiring precise control at the nanoscale level. Additionally, optimizing the design parameters for specific applications is crucial but challenging due to trade-offs between sensitivity and linewidth narrowing.  In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches to achieve narrow linewidths in nanostructured SPR sensors. These advancements pave the way for improved sensing capabilities in terms of resolution and accuracy. Addressing the existing challenges will contribute to further development and utilization of these sensors for a wide range of applications in optical sensing fields. ",continue
"The complement system is a cascade of proteins that plays a crucial role in immune defense. It acts as a first line of defense against pathogens, aiding in their clearance and promoting inflammation. Deficiencies in complement components can result in an increased susceptibility to infections, autoimmune diseases, or immune disorders.  Among the primary complement deficiencies, deficiencies in the terminal pathway components are particularly important to identify due to the significantly higher risk of Neisseria meningitidis infections. These infections can be life-threatening and require immediate medical attention.  In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical and genetic patterns of C7 deficiency by conducting a systematic review and reporting on a novel deletion found in a ten-year-old boy infected with Neisseria meningitidis B.  The patient displayed clinical symptoms that suggested reduced C activity. To confirm this suspicion, functional assays were performed using the Wieslab ELISA Kit. The results confirmed significantly reduced activity of all three pathways - classical (0.6% activity), lectin (0.2% activity), and alternative (0.1% activity). Further analysis through Western blot revealed the complete absence of C7 protein in the patient's serum.  To understand the genetic basis underlying this deficiency, Sanger sequencing was performed on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples of the patient. This allowed for identification of two pathogenetic variants within the C7 gene - one known missense mutation G379R and another novel heterozygous deletion located at c.*99_*101delTCT within 3'UTR region.  Further investigation revealed that this deletion caused instability in mRNA expression from both alleles but only allowed expression from alleles containing missense mutations such as G379R variant present alongside it. Consequently, it resulted in functional hemizygosity where only one allele carrying mutated C7 variant was expressed.  This finding highlights an additional mechanism leading to functional hemizygosity observed within patients with C-terminal pathway component deficiencies. It expands our understanding of the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms causing C7 deficiency.  Identifying specific genetic variants associated with complement deficiencies is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it allows for accurate diagnosis and classification of patients with immune disorders, aiding in appropriate treatment decisions. Secondly, it enables better risk assessment for complications such as Neisseria meningitidis infections, allowing for prompt identification and preventative measures such as vaccinations.  In summary, this study presents a systematic review of clinical and genetic patterns observed in C7 deficiency. We report a novel deletion within the C7 gene that results in functional hemizygosity due to mRNA instability. The findings shed light on the genetic bases underlying complement deficiencies and emphasize the importance of comprehensive genetic analysis in patients presenting with immune disorders or increased susceptibility to infections. Early detection through genetic testing is crucial for implementing appropriate management strategies to minimize complications and improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, the identification of this novel deletion in the C7 gene contributes to the growing knowledge of genetic variants associated with complement deficiencies. This finding expands our understanding of the complex genetic landscape underlying immune disorders and provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms involved.  The implications of C7 deficiency are significant, particularly in terms of susceptibility to Neisseria meningitidis infections. Prompt identification of individuals with C7 deficiency is essential to minimize the risk of these potentially life-threatening infections. With early detection, preventative measures such as targeted vaccinations can be implemented effectively, ensuring protection against Neisseria meningitidis and reducing morbidity and mortality rates.  Additionally, understanding the genetic basis of complement deficiencies opens up avenues for potential therapeutic interventions. Gene therapy approaches could be explored to restore or enhance complement activity in individuals with C7 deficiency. Targeted interventions could help improve immune functionality and reduce susceptibility to infections in affected individuals.  It is worth noting that while this study focuses on a specific case involving a novel deletion in the C7 gene, there may be other genetic variants contributing to C7 deficiency that have not been explored in this context. Further research and larger-scale studies are needed to comprehensively understand the full spectrum of genetic variations associated with complement deficiencies.  In conclusion, this systematic review highlights clinical and genetic patterns observed in C7 deficiency. The discovery of a novel deletion within the C7 gene leading to functional hemizygosity provides new insights into the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms involved in complement deficiencies. These findings contribute to our understanding of immune disorders and emphasize the importance of early detection through comprehensive genetic analysis for appropriate management strategies. Continued research into complement deficiencies will further enhance our knowledge, enabling us to develop more targeted therapies and preventive measures for these rare but clinically significant conditions.

"Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI), caused by insufficient oxygen and blood flow to the brain during birth, is a leading cause of neonatal encephalopathy (NE). NE is a condition characterized by significant mortality and morbidity in newborns, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where resources for treatment are limited. Currently, therapeutic hypothermia (HT) is the only approved treatment for NE in high-income countries (HIC); however, its effectiveness and safety in LMIC are questionable.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify alternative therapies that can effectively reduce brain injury in newborns following HI. To address this gap, we conducted a multi-drug randomized controlled preclinical screening trial using an established P7 rat Vannucci model of HI brain injury. This model closely mimics the pathophysiology observed in human neonates with NE.  In our study, we investigated 25 potential neuroprotective drug candidates to assess their treatment effects on reducing brain area loss after HI-induced injury. The rats were randomly assigned to different drug treatment groups or control groups. After 7 days of survival, we analyzed the brains to measure unilateral hemispheric brain area loss as an indicator of brain injury severity.  Our findings revealed that eight out of the 25 therapeutic agents significantly reduced brain area loss compared to the control group. Among these agents, Caffeine showed the strongest treatment effect followed by Sonic Hedgehog Agonist (SAG) and Allopurinol. Additionally, Melatonin, Clemastine ß-Hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide also demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing brain injury.  Notably, several of these neuroprotective agents displayed a higher probability of efficacy compared to HT itself when evaluated using our experimental setup. Specifically,Caffeine,SAG Allopurinol Melatonin Clemastine ß-hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide all showed a stronger treatment effect than HT. These findings suggest that these alternative therapies may hold promise as potential treatment options for NE in LMIC where HT's efficacy is limited.  Our study contributes to the field by providing the results of the first systematic preclinical screening trial of potential neuroprotective treatments for neonatal HI brain injury. By using a standardized experimental setting and assessing multiple drug candidates, we increase our understanding of the efficacy and potential benefits of different therapeutic options.  However, it is important to note that further research is necessary to validate these findings in clinical settings. The ultimate goal is to translate these promising novel agents into safe and effective treatments for NE in LMIC. As NE remains a significant health burden globally, especially in resource-limited settings, identifying alternative therapies could greatly improve outcomes for affected newborns.  In conclusion, our multi-drug randomized controlled screening trial provides valuable insights into potential neuroprotective agents for reducing brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. The identified therapeutic candidates such as Caffeine, Sonic Hedgehog Agonist (SAG), Allopurinol, Melatonin,Clemastine ß-hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide show promise as alternatives or complements to existing treatments like therapeutic hypothermia specifically for low- and middle-income countries. Further research including clinical trials will be imperative to further evaluate their safety and effectiveness in humans.  2. Methodology  In our study, we utilized the P7 rat Vannucci model of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, which has been widely used as a preclinical model for studying neonatal encephalopathy. This model involves exposing P7 rat pups to unilateral hypoxia-ischemia, mimicking the pathophysiology observed in human newborns.  The P7 rat pups were randomly assigned to different treatment groups or control groups. In total, we investigated 25 potential neuroprotective drug candidates. Each drug candidate was administered according to a standardized protocol, ensuring consistency across experiments.  After a period of 7 days survival post hypoxic-ischemic insult, we analyzed the brains of the rats to assess brain area loss as an indicator of injury severity. The brains were carefully dissected and processed for histological analysis using staining techniques specific for evaluating neuronal damage.  We performed this experimental setup twenty times to ensure statistical validity and reliability of our findings. This approach allowed us to obtain robust data on the efficacy of each neuroprotective agent in reducing brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.  3. Results and Discussion  Our findings demonstrated that eight out of the 25 therapeutic agents significantly reduced brain area loss compared to the control group after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia injury in rats. Caffeine exhibited the strongest treatment effect among all tested agents - its administration resulted in a significant reduction in brain area loss compared to controls. The Sonic Hedgehog Agonist (SAG) and Allopurinol also demonstrated substantial efficacy in reducing brain injury following HI. Additionally,Melatonin,Clemastine ß-hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide showed promising results by significantly reducing brain area loss as well.  Importantly, when comparing these therapeutic agents with therapeutic hypothermia (HT), several showed superior treatment effects. Caffeine,SAG Allopurinol Melatonin Clemastine ß-hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide all exhibited a higher probability of efficacy in reducing brain area loss compared to HT. These results suggest that these novel agents may offer additional or alternative therapeutic options for the treatment of neonatal encephalopathy, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where HT's effectiveness is limited.  Further investigation is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of these agents and to determine their safety profiles. By understanding how these agents exert their protective effects on the developing brain, we can optimize their therapeutic dosing and explore potential combination therapies.  Moreover, clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these neuroprotective agents in humans. It will be crucial to conduct studies specifically designed for LMIC settings, addressing any potential challenges related to drug availability, administration protocols, and monitoring.  4. Conclusion  In conclusion, our multi-drug randomized controlled screening trial identified several promising neuroprotective agent candidates for reducing brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. Caffeine,SAG Allopurinol Melatonin Clemastine ß-hydroxybutyrate Omegaven and Iodide demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing brain area loss compared to controls. Importantly, some of these agents showed a higher probability of efficacy compared to therapeutic hypothermia (HT) itself when evaluated using our experimental setup. These findings highlight the potential for alternative or complementary therapies for treating neonatal encephalopathy in low- and middle-income countries where resources for therapeutic hypothermia are limited. However,this research lays the groundwork for future studies aimed at better understanding how these agent work,the optimal dosing strategies,and clinical trials evaluating their safety and effectiveness.The ultimate aim is to translate these promising findings into improved outcomes for affected newborns globally",continue
"The hotel industry plays a crucial role in the global energy consumption landscape, as hotels are large consumers of energy due to their operational needs.

"Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignancies in women worldwide, with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections being the primary cause. Specifically, HPV-16 and HPV-18 account for a large proportion of these cases (Walboomers et al., 1999). The viral oncoproteins encoded by HPV are expressed in HPV-positive cancers and are closely associated with the early stages of cancer development and transformation of normal cells into cancerous forms (zur Hausen, 2002).  The progression from normal cell growth to malignancy involves the dysregulation of various signaling pathways. One key pathway implicated in this process is the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This signaling cascade controls the expression of genes that play crucial roles in tumorigenesis (Polakis, 2012). Aberrant activation of this pathway can lead to evasion of immune surveillance by tumor cells through multiple mechanisms.  One critical factor involved in immune evasion is programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Normally expressed on antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, PD-L1 functions as an inhibitory checkpoint molecule that interacts with its receptor PD-1 on T lymphocytes to suppress their inflammatory function (Pardoll, 2012). However, tumor cells can upregulate PD-L1 expression as a means to evade immune recognition and destruction.  Recent studies have demonstrated a connection between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and PD-L1 expression in various cancers including cervical cancer. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been shown to promote PD-L1 expression through transcriptional regulation. The β-catenin protein acts as a co-transcriptional activator by forming complexes with transcription factors such as TCF/LEF family members that bind directly to regulatory elements within genes like PD-L1 (Spranger et al., 2015). This leads to increased PD-L1 expression on the surface of tumor cells.  Moreover, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway can also indirectly regulate other genes associated with immune evasion, such as c-MYC. c-MYC is a well-known oncogene that drives cell proliferation, survival, and immune tolerance (Dang, 2012). Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cancer cells can lead to upregulation of c-MYC expression (He et al., 1998), which further contributes to immune evasion by promoting PD-L1 expression and suppressing immune cell function.  The dysregulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis plays a critical role in tumor progression. Elevated levels of PD-1 have been detected on exhausted T lymphocytes infiltrating HPV-positive cervical tumors (Han et al., 2020). These exhausted T cells are characterized by impaired effector function and increased production of cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) within the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, they exhibit high levels of CD39 expression, an ectonucleotidase known to suppress anti-tumor immunity by enzymatically degrading ATP into immunosuppressive adenosine molecules (Vigano et al., 2019).  Given the important role that Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays in regulating these crucial factors involved in immune evasion and tumorigenesis, targeting this pathway holds promise as a potential immunotherapy approach. One strategy could involve using specific inhibitors or small molecules to block key components within this pathway. In preclinical models, inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been shown to decrease PD-L1 expression and enhance anti-tumor immunity (Liu et al., 2020).  In conclusion, understanding the interplay between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is crucial for the development of effective immunotherapies for HPV-related cervical cancer. Although further research is needed, targeting this pathway holds promise as a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance immune recognition and clearance of tumor cells. In addition, investigating the associations between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and other immune evasion mechanisms could provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between tumor cells and the immune system in cervical cancer malignancy.

"Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a commonly performed surgical procedure for the treatment of various cervical spine pathologies, such as degenerative disc disease, herniated discs, and spinal stenosis. The main goal of ACDF is to relieve symptoms by decompressing neural structures and restoring stability to the affected segment.  Traditionally, ACDF has been performed using cage-plate constructs (CPC), which involve the placement of a cage between two adjacent vertebral bodies along with an anterior plate for stabilization. However, in recent years, a new technique using self-locking stand-alone cages (SSC) has gained popularity. These cages are designed to eliminate the need for additional plates or screws by incorporating locking mechanism within the cage itself.  The use of SSC in ACDF offers several potential advantages over CPC. First, it eliminates the need for additional hardware placement, thereby reducing operative time and surgical trauma. Second, it allows for better preservation of cervical lordosis due to its small footprint design. Third, it minimizes the risk of implant-related complications such as screw loosening or plate fracture.  Despite these potential benefits, there remains controversy regarding the long-term effectiveness of SSC compared to CPC in monosegmental ACDF. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare the long-term outcomes between SSC and CPC in terms of clinical outcomes and radiological parameters.  Ten studies involving 979 patients were included in this analysis. The results showed that SSC significantly reduced operative time, intraoperative blood loss, duration of hospitalization compared to CPC. Additionally, at final follow-up, SSC was associated with a significant reduction in cervical Cobb angle (indicating better preservation of lordosis), lower rates of postoperative dysphagia and adjacent segment degeneration (ASD).  Importantly though both devices demonstrated similar efficacy in terms of clinical outcomes measured by JOA scores and Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of fusion rate and cage subsidence between the two groups.  Although SSC demonstrated advantages over CPC in terms of certain perioperative parameters and the incidence of dysphagia and ASD, it was found to be inferior to CPC in maintaining cervical curvature at long-term follow-up. It is unclear whether these radiological changes have an impact on clinical symptoms. Therefore, further studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm these findings.  In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that SSC is a better option than CPC in monosegmental ACDF, as it offers several advantages including shorter operative time, reduced blood loss, shorter hospitalization duration, lower rates of dysphagia and ASD. However, it is important to consider that SSC may be associated with compromised maintenance of cervical curvature compared to CPC. Future studies should investigate whether these radiological changes translate into clinically significant outcomes.  This study provides valuable insights for spine surgeons when choosing between SSC or CPC for monosegmental ACDF procedures. The decision should be made based on patient-specific characteristics as well as surgeon experience and preference. ACDF is a widely accepted surgical technique for the management of cervical spine disorders, and the choice between SSC and CPC should be carefully considered based on individual patient factors. The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that SSC may be preferable in cases where reducing operative time, blood loss, hospital stay, and the risk of dysphagia and ASD are important considerations.  One potential explanation for the advantages associated with SSC is its simplified surgical approach. By eliminating the need for additional hardware such as plates or screws, SSC reduces surgical steps and overall complexity. This can contribute to shorter operative times and decreased surgical trauma, ultimately leading to faster recovery and reduced hospitalization duration.  Furthermore, SSC's ability to maintain cervical lordosis is an important consideration in ACDF procedures. Preserving the natural curvature of the spine helps distribute forces evenly across adjacent segments, reducing the risk of adjacent segment degeneration over time. The reduction in Cobb angle observed with SSC compared to CPC at final follow-up may suggest a potential advantage in terms of long-term spinal alignment.  On the other hand, it is worth noting that while there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between SSC and CPC groups in terms of JOA scores or NDI scores at long-term follow-up, there was also no significant difference in fusion rate or cage subsidence. This suggests that both approaches are equally effective in achieving solid bony fusion and maintaining stability.  However, it is crucial to interpret these results with caution due to certain limitations inherent within this study. One limitation is the relatively short follow-up period (minimum 2 years) evaluated across all trials included. Long-term radiological changes after ACDF may take several years to manifest clinically; thus further investigations with longer follow-up periods are necessary.  Additionally, it must be acknowledged that different studies might have employed variations on techniques or implants used for both CCC and CPC procedures which might affect their comparative outcomes significantly; standardizing these variables across future studies would prove beneficial in analyzing the efficacy of each technique more accurately.  In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence to support the use of SSC over CPC in monosegmental ACDF procedures. SSC offers advantages in terms of reduced operative time, blood loss, duration of hospitalization, dysphagia rates, and ASD. However, its impact on long-term cervical curvature maintenance requires further investigation. Surgeons should carefully consider individual patient factors and surgical expertise when choosing between SSC and CPC for monosegmental ACDF procedures. Additional well-designed prospective studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to validate these findings and provide more comprehensive evidence for optimal treatment decision-making in ACDF surgeries.",continue
"Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease, characterized by genetic diversity within tumors as well as variations between different tumors. This heterogeneity in breast cancer contributes to differences in tumor growth, metastasis, and response to treatment. In addition to the genetic factors that govern tumor heterogeneity, the surrounding microenvironment of the tumor plays a critical role in shaping its characteristics.  The tumor microenvironment is comprised of various cell types such as immune cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and other stromal components. These interacting cells contribute to the physical and biological surroundings of the tumor and influence its behavior. The activity of these cells can be influenced by signals from cancer cells or from other components present in the microenvironment.  One key aspect of breast cancer heterogeneity influenced by the tumor microenvironment is drug resistance. The interactions between different cell types within the microenvironment can lead to changes in drug sensitivity or acquisition of resistance mechanisms. For instance, immune cells such as T lymphocytes or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can secrete various factors that promote resistance to chemotherapy drugs. Endothelial cells can also contribute to drug resistance by forming blood vessels that supply nutrients and oxygen necessary for tumor growth.  Deciphering these intricate interactions within the tumor microenvironment is essential for understanding how it affects drug response and developing strategies for personalized treatment. Advances in preclinical models have made it possible to study these interactions more accurately than ever before. Models that incorporate both cancer cells and various components of the microenvironment have provided insights into how different cell types interact spatially within tumors.  Emerging technologies are also playing a crucial role in unraveling breast cancer heterogeneity driven by the microenvironment's impact on drug resistance. Single-cell analysis techniques enable researchers to examine individual cell populations within heterogeneous tumors at high resolution, identifying distinct subpopulations with potential roles in driving drug resistance.  Additionally, spatial transcriptomics allows researchers to assess the gene expression patterns within tumor tissue and map it to its precise location. This technology aids in characterizing the spatial organization of cell types within tumors, helping to understand their functional contributions to drug sensitivity or resistance.  Furthermore, advanced imaging techniques such as multiplex immunohistochemistry and mass cytometry enable simultaneous visualization of multiple markers on individual cells. These methods enhance our understanding of cell-to-cell interactions and how different cell populations influence each other within the tumor microenvironment.  By employing these emerging technologies alongside preclinical models, researchers can gain a better understanding of how different components of the microenvironment contribute to breast cancer heterogeneity and drug resistance. This knowledge can be translated into improved treatment strategies that target both cancer cells and their supporting microenvironment.  In conclusion, the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in breast cancer heterogeneity through its influence on drug response. Understanding how various cell types interact within tumors and deciphering their specific contributions is essential for developing personalized treatment approaches. Emerging technologies offer new opportunities to unravel these complexities by providing detailed insights into intra-tumor heterogeneity at single-cell resolution or spatial organization levels. Integrating these technological advances with preclinical models will greatly enhance our ability to combat drug resistance in breast cancer patients effectively.",continue
"Sea cucumbers, classified as echinoderms, are benthic marine invertebrates that play a crucial role in marine ecosystems. They are known for their unique morphology and important ecological functions such as nutrient recycling and sediment stabilization (Kornicker, 1975). Additionally, sea cucumbers possess immense commercial value due to their use as a delicacy and in traditional medicine. Processed sea cucumbers, commonly referred to as ""Beche-de-mer,"" have long been highly sought after in southeast Asian countries.  The global demand for sea cucumbers has led to the overexploitation of wild stocks, jeopardizing their populations worldwide. This unsustainable harvesting has raised concerns about the future availability of this resource. To address this issue and ensure the sustainable use of sea cucumbers, aquaculture techniques have been developed for commercially important species like Holothuria scabra (the sandfish). These efforts not only aid the conservation of wild stocks but also contribute to international trade.  In the Arabian Peninsula and Iran region—comprising countries such as Oman, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and United Arab Emirates (UAE)—studies on sea cucumbers have been relatively limited compared to other regions with similar marine environments. The major land mass is surrounded by marginal seas including the Arabian/Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea Gulf of Aden Red Sea), providing diverse habitats for various marine organisms.  Historical research trends indicate that this region houses a relatively impoverished diversity of sea cucumber species compared to other parts of the world. A total of 82 species have been reported in this area so far (Froese & Pauly., 2021). This low diversity may be attributed to environmental extremes present in these regions such as high salinity levels or temperature fluctuations.  Despite their perceived lower economic value compared to oil or other industries prevalent within these countries' economies—such as Oman, Saudi Arabia, or UAE—marine resources like sea cucumbers can still contribute significantly to local livelihoods and national economies. Artisanal fisheries targeting sea cucumbers do exist in several of these countries, with Yemen and UAE playing critical roles in their collection and subsequent export to southeast Asian countries where demand is high.  However, further research indicates that natural stocks of sea cucumbers have been depleted in some areas such as Saudi Arabia and Oman. This calls for urgent stock assessment measures to ensure the sustainable management of these resources. Fortunately, successful aquaculture trials have been conducted not only in Saudi Arabia and Oman but also in Iran, opening opportunities for further expansion to supplement wild stocks.  Researchers from Iran have also focused on exploring the ecotoxicological properties and bioactive substances found within different species of sea cucumbers. Such studies demonstrate an immense potential for research on these organisms' useful properties beyond their economic value.  Despite ongoing research efforts, there are still gaps that need attention within the field of sea cucumber research in this region. Areas such as molecular phylogeny—the study of evolutionary relationships using genetic data—should be prioritized to better understand the biodiversity patterns among species present here. Additionally, investigating relevant biological aspects such as reproductive behavior or trophic interactions will offer valuable insights into their ecology.  The use of sea cucumbers in bioremediation—a process that utilizes living organisms to remove pollutants from contaminated environments—is another area worthy of investigation given its potential applications both locally and globally (Patel et al., 2017). Furthermore, characterizing bioactive compounds found within different species may provide opportunities for pharmaceutical development or utilization in other industries.  To address these gaps effectively while ensuring the conservation and sustainable management of sea cucumber populations within the region, it is essential to foster regional cooperation, networking among researchers working on similar topics or geographical areas. Collaborative efforts can aid knowledge sharing between countries resulting in improved research outcomes and management strategies. Additionally, investing in training programs and capacity-building initiatives will enhance the expertise of scientists working on sea cucumber research in this region.  In conclusion, sea cucumbers represent a valuable marine resource with both ecological and commercial significance. While research on sea cucumbers within the Arabian Peninsula and Iran region has been limited compared to other areas, there are opportunities for expansion and collaboration to fill these gaps. By addressing areas such as stock assessment, aquaculture development, molecular phylogeny, ecotoxicology studies, bioremediation applications, and characterization of bioactive compounds among others—this region can contribute significantly to global efforts aimed at conserving these unique marine organisms while ensuring their sustainable use for generations to come.

"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and deadly malignancies worldwide. It is well established that dysregulated lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in the development and progression of CRC. Lipids, including phospholipids, cholesterol, fatty acids, and sphingolipids, are essential components of cell membranes and also serve as intermediates in various intracellular signaling pathways.  Abnormal lipid metabolism in CRC cells contributes to tumor initiation, growth, invasion, and metastasis. One characteristic feature of CRC is the increased uptake and accumulation of lipids by cancer cells. This can be attributed to upregulated expression or activity of proteins responsible for lipid transport across the plasma membrane, such as fatty acid transporters (FATPs) or scavenger receptors.  Furthermore, altered expression levels or activities of enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis (DNL), such as ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), have been observed in CRC tissues compared to normal colon tissues. DNL refers to the synthesis of fatty acids from non-lipid precursors like glucose or glutamine.  Additionally, dysregulated lipid metabolism impacts several signaling pathways involved in colorectal carcinogenesis. For instance, increased levels of lipids can activate mTORC1 signaling through direct interaction with its regulatory protein Ragulator complex. Notably inhibited AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway has been reported because it negatively regulates DNL enzymes ACC and FASN.  Importantly, tumor microenvironment components also contribute to remodeling lipid metabolism in CRC cells through various mechanisms. Immune cells infiltrating tumors produce cytokines that directly influence lipid metabolism in cancer cells by altering gene expression or enzyme activities involved in lipogenesis processes.  For example immune cell-derived cytokines such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) have been shown to stimulate lipid accumulation in CRC cells by promoting de novo lipogenesis and inhibiting fatty acid oxidation. These cytokines can activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) or nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways, leading to the upregulation of DNL enzyme expression.  Moreover, immune cells can modify the lipid composition of the tumor microenvironment by releasing extracellular vesicles containing lipids. These vesicles are taken up by cancer cells and can alter their metabolic phenotype. For instance, macrophages release exosomes rich in cholesterol which are internalized by CRC cells promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.  In addition to immune cells, other components of the tumor microenvironment such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also contribute to lipid metabolism remodeling in CRC cells. CAFs provide a niche for cancer stem-like cells that possess high tumorigenic potential through paracrine signaling molecules like prostaglandins PGE2 that promote DNL enzyme activity.  Furthermore, alterations in nutrient availability within the tumor microenvironment can impact lipid metabolism in CRC cells. For instance reduced glucose levels due to increased glycolysis may lead to an increased reliance on alternative energy sources like fatty acids for cancer cell survival. Overall, understanding the crosstalk between lipid metabolism remodeling in CRC cells and components of the tumor microenvironment provides promising opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Targeting dysregulated lipogenesis pathways or modifying immune cell functions could be potential strategies for preventing or treating colorectal cancer.",continue
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health concern that threatens the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals have contributed to the development and spread of resistant bacteria. Livestock and poultry farms are important reservoirs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as these animals are often exposed to high levels of antibiotics for disease prevention and growth promotion.  Bangladesh is a country heavily reliant on livestock and poultry farming for food production. The use of antibiotics in this sector is widespread, leading to concerns about the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the prevalence patterns of antibiotic resistance in Salmonella strains isolated from livestock- and poultry-derived foods in Bangladesh from 2000 to 2022.  Our analysis included 12 studies that provided data on the prevalence rates of Salmonella as well as its resistance to various antibiotics. We used statistical methods such as random-effect or fixed-effect models, stratified analyses, meta-regression approach, sensitivity analysis, univariate meta-analysis, correlation analysis to examine the data.  The pooled prevalence of Salmonella in livestock- and poultry-derived foods was found to be 37% (95% CI: 23%–52%). This high prevalence indicates a significant risk of contamination with Salmonella bacteria among these food sources. Furthermore, we found significant variations in antibiotic resistance patterns among different classes of antibiotics. Neomycin had the lowest prevalence of resistance at 4%, while tetracycline had the highest at 81%.  We also observed an increasing trend in Salmonella prevalence over time. There was a positive relationship between study period and Salmonella prevalence (β = 0.0179; P = 0.0034). This suggests that over the years, there has been an escalation in salmonellosis cases associated with livestock- and poultry-derived foods.  The rise in antibiotic resistance poses a severe threat to public health in Bangladesh. To mitigate this issue, it is crucial to monitor antibiotic sensitivity trends and develop effective antibiotic regimens. This requires comprehensive surveillance systems and data collection mechanisms to identify emerging resistance patterns.  Additionally, there is a need for stricter regulations on the use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry farming. Measures such as limiting the use of antibiotics for growth promotion and implementing proper hygiene practices can help reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food sources. Policymakers should prioritize food safety and adopt measures that promote responsible use of antibiotics in agriculture.  Furthermore, healthcare professionals play a vital role in combating AMR by prescribing antibiotics judiciously. Over-prescription or inappropriate use of antibiotics can contribute to the development of resistance. Therefore, doctors should be aware of local resistance patterns and choose appropriate antibiotics when treating bacterial infections.  In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the high prevalence of Salmonella contamination and antibiotic resistance in livestock- and poultry-derived foods in Bangladesh. Urgent interventions are required to address this problem effectively at both policy level (regulations) as well as healthcare provider level (prescribing guidelines). By implementing appropriate strategies, we can safeguard public health from the threats posed by antimicrobial resistance.",continue
"Frailty is a common condition among older adults, characterized by decreased physiological reserve, increased vulnerability to stressors, and diminished ability to recover from illness or injury. In the field of oncology, frailty has gained increasing attention due to its impact on treatment outcomes and overall patient well-being. The frailty index (FI) is one way in which frailty can be quantified and measured.  The FI is a comprehensive tool that assesses various domains of physical function and health status in older adults. It includes a checklist of deficits or impairments across different domains such as mobility, cognition, nutrition, comorbidities, and social support. Each deficit is given a score based on its presence or absence in the individual being assessed. The scores are then summed up and divided by the total number of deficits assessed to obtain the FI score which ranges from 0 to 1.  Despite being measured as a continuous variable, researchers have used different cut-off points to categorize individuals as either frail or non-frail. These cut-off points have mainly been validated in acute care or community settings for older adults without cancer. However, it remains unclear whether these same cut-off points are applicable to older adults with cancer.  In order to explore this further, a scoping review was conducted searching various databases for studies that measured and categorized an FI in adults with cancer. Out of the initial 1994 studies screened, only 41 met the inclusion criteria for this review.  The findings of this review revealed significant variability in how studies have categorized the FI in older adults with cancer. The most frequently used cut-off point was an FI score ≥0.35 followed by ≥0.25 and ≥0.20 However; it is important to note that an FI score within this range has often represented at least moderate to severe frailty in other highly-cited studies conducted outside the oncology setting.  Interestingly, few studies sought out determine or validate the optimum FI categories in older adults with cancer. The rationale for the chosen FI categories was provided in most studies, although it was not always relevant or supported by robust evidence. Furthermore, some studies referenced previous research that used a cut-off point of an FI >0.35 to define frailty without providing clear rationale for this categorization.  The variability in how the FI has been categorized and how older adults have been labeled as ""frail"" hinders our ability to synthesize results and understand the impact of frailty on cancer care. It is crucial to establish valid and reliable cut-off points that accurately reflect frailty in this specific population.  Moving forward, it is recommended to maintain the FI as a continuous variable until further validation studies are conducted to determine the optimum cut-off points for categorizing frailty in older adults with cancer. This would enable better comparability between studies and facilitate a more accurate understanding of the role that frailty plays in cancer treatment outcomes.  In conclusion, there is significant variability in how studies have categorized frailty using the FI among older adults with cancer. Establishing valid and reliable cut-off points specific to this population is essential for advancing research on frailty and its impact on oncology care outcomes.",continue
"Kinases are enzymes that play a crucial role in a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and signal transduction. Aberrant kinase activity has been implicated in the development and progression of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory conditions. As such, targeting kinases has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for these diseases.  The discovery and development of kinase inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment. Several kinase inhibitors have been approved by regulatory bodies for the treatment of different types of cancer. These drugs work by specifically inhibiting the activity of kinases involved in promoting tumor growth and survival. By blocking these kinases, tumor cells are prevented from proliferating and spreading.  However, the potential utility of kinase inhibitors extends beyond cancer treatment. Recent research has focused on exploring their effectiveness in treating non-malignant disorders such as auto-immune diseases. Kinase-mediated signaling pathways play a critical role in immune system regulation and inflammation control. Dysregulation or overactivation of certain kinases can lead to chronic inflammation and auto-immunity.  To harness the therapeutic potential of kinase inhibitors for non-malignant disorders, it is crucial to investigate whether targeted delivery to specific cell types enhances efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. Cell-specific delivery systems can be designed to selectively deliver the inhibitor to sites where aberrant kinase activity is prevalent or problematic.  One approach is through nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems that encapsulate the inhibitor molecules within biocompatible carriers capable of selectively targeting specific cell types or tissues affected by disease pathology. These nanoparticles can be surface-functionalized with ligands that recognize unique markers expressed on diseased cells or tissues but not healthy ones.  Another approach involves utilizing gene therapy techniques to introduce genes encoding synthetic receptors into target cells or tissues that enable selective uptake of an otherwise systemically administered inhibitor molecule by specifically recognizing it through these receptors expressed only on diseased cells.  In addition to developing novel drug delivery strategies for improved specificity, efforts have focused on better understanding the mode of action of kinase inhibitors. Kinase inhibitors can either act by directly binding to and blocking the catalytic site of the kinase or by allosteric inhibition, where they bind outside the catalytic site to induce conformational changes that prevent kinase activity.  Understanding these mechanisms is pivotal for designing more potent and selective inhibitors. Advances in structural biology techniques such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have provided valuable insights into the structural features of kinases, enabling rational drug design approaches.  Furthermore, computational modeling techniques combined with high-throughput screening methods offer efficient means to identify novel kinase targets and predict their druggability. This integrated approach allows for rapid screening of large compound libraries against a panel of kinases while providing valuable information about inhibitor selectivity profiles and potential off-target effects.  In conclusion, kinase inhibitors hold immense promise as therapeutic targets for a wide range of diseases beyond cancer. Understanding their mode of action, developing targeted delivery systems, and employing advanced drug discovery approaches are essential steps towards harnessing their full therapeutic potential. Continued research efforts in this field will undoubtedly lead to innovative treatment options for various anti-inflammatory, auto-immune, and anticancer disorders.",continue
"Health and human rights are inherently interconnected, as access to good health is a fundamental human right. However, achieving global health equity is a complex task due to various intersecting challenges such as economic inequality, climate change, mass migration, racialized violence, and global pandemics. In order to address these challenges effectively and promote health equity worldwide, it is necessary to develop an integrated framework that brings together different disciplines and approaches.  Three key fields that have emerged in the pursuit of health equity are social medicine, collective health, and structural competency. Each of these fields has its own unique history and theoretical foundation but shares a common goal of addressing the social determinants of health and promoting equitable access to healthcare.  Social medicine has its roots in the early 19th century when physicians began recognizing the impact of social conditions on individuals' health outcomes. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the broader socio-political context in which disease occurs. Social medicine highlights how factors such as poverty, discrimination, education level, housing conditions influence individuals' well-being.  Collective health takes a collective approach to improving population-level wellbeing by focusing on community participation and empowerment. This field recognizes that individual's health is shaped by social norms, cultural practices, and community dynamics. Collective Health aims at creating inclusive policies that address social disparities through collaborative efforts between healthcare providers and communities.  Structural competency moves beyond traditional biomedical approaches by examining how societal structures shape individual experiences of illness. It examines how power relations produce inequities in healthcare systems based on race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status . Structural competency underscores the need for healthcare providers to be aware not only with their patient's medical histories but also with broader contexts like poverty or discrimination which perpetuate ill-health  While each field offers distinct perspectives on addressing heath inequities , they share common ground: recognition that population-level disparities arise from complex interplay between macro-level factors like political economy ,distributions pf power , institutionalized racism and micro-level issues like individual behaviours, health literacy. Given the overlap in their theoretical foundations and goals, we believe that intentional dialogue between these fields can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the social determinants of health and promote collective action.  To facilitate this dialogue, it is important to develop pedagogical tools grounded within critical and transformative pedagogies. Critical pedagogy challenges dominant power structures and encourages students to question existing inequities in health systems. Transformative pedagogies focus on empowering students by providing them with tools for structural change. Integrating these approaches into health and human rights education can help cultivate a new generation of healthcare professionals who are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary for promoting health equity.  In conclusion,Toward an Integrated Framework in Health and Human Rights Education is critical for addressing the complex challenges that impede global health equity today. By fostering dialogue between social medicine, collective health,and structural competency further it significant contributions towards achieving equitable access to good-quality healthcare globally . Through intentional collaboration faculty members from various disciplines including medicine , public will have space work together create curriculum materials integrating insights from three intersecting but not limited fields as they bring together different perspectives rooted historical backgrounds,theoretical foundations Finally incorporating critical transformative methodologies enable us develop innovative educational strategies address diverse range issues impeding progress towards realizing right",continue
"Chronic primary orofacial pain (OFP) conditions, including painful temporomandibular disorders (pTMDs), idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and burning mouth syndrome (BMS), present significant challenges for both patients and clinicians. These conditions are often difficult to diagnose, and their etiology and pathophysiology remain poorly understood. Consequently, the development of effective treatments has been limited.  Preclinical studies in animal models have played a vital role in advancing our understanding of OFP. Animal models allow researchers to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these conditions, identify potential therapeutic targets, and test novel interventions. However, despite decades of research in this field, there is still a significant gap between preclinical findings and clinical translation.  One major hurdle in bridging this gap is the lack of robust preclinical assays that accurately recapitulate the etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical symptoms observed in patients with chronic OFP. The limitations of current animal models make it challenging to develop interventions that effectively alleviate pain in patients.  In this review, we aim to highlight existing rodent assays that can be utilized in chronic primary OFP research for pTMDs, TN, and BMS. We will discuss their strengths and weaknesses based on current knowledge regarding the complex etiology and pathophysiology of these conditions. By identifying areas for improvement and suggesting possible future directions, we hope to facilitate the development of more innovative animal models capable of providing meaningful insights into chronic primary OFP.  2. Rodent Assays for Chronic Primary Orofacial Pain Research  Several rodent assays have been developed to study different aspects of orofacial pain associated with pTMDs,TN,and BMS.Previous studies have primarily focused on pain-related behaviors such as mechanical allodynia,hypersensitivity,sensitization,and spontaneous nociceptive behavior.Many researchers use von Frey filament testing as a measure of mechanical allodynia in rodents.This assay involves applying calibrated filaments to the orofacial region to determine the threshold at which nociceptive responses occur.Another commonly employed method is the formalin test,which measures nociceptive responses following subcutaneous injection of formalin into the orofacial region.  Furthermore,the orofacial operant conditioning paradigm has gained popularity as a way to assess pain-related behaviors in rodents.This assay involves training animals to associate specific operant behaviors with pain alleviation(rewarded)or exacerbation(punished).  Despite their widespread use,these assays have limitations that warrant consideration.While they allow for the assessment of specific pain-related behaviors,they may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of clinical symptoms experienced by chronic OFP patients.For example,the role of central sensitization in these conditions is often underrepresented in existing rodent assays.Central sensitization refers to an amplification of pain signaling within the central nervous system,resulting in increased sensitivity and persistent pain.A comprehensive preclinical model should aim to incorporate this aspect more effectively.  3. Assessing Chronic Primary Orofacial Pain Measures  Finding appropriate chronic primary OFP measures that align with patients' clinical symptoms is crucial for translating preclinical findings into effective therapies.Currently,a quantitative sensory testing(QST)battery has been suggested as a comprehensive approach.QST encompasses various psychophysical tests that evaluate different aspects of sensory function,such as thermal detection thresholds,cold and heat pain thresholds,and pressure-pain thresholds.However,numerous factors such as subjective interpretation,variability among individuals,and lack of standardized protocols can hinder accurate assessment.  Additionally,current QST methods may not adequately account for disease-specific manifestations seen in pTMDs,TN,and BMS.For example,in pTMDs,characterized by jaw muscle dysfunction,the assessment should consider masticatory function,muscle tone,and range.As for TN,a condition characterized by paroxysmal facial pain,episodic pain assessment with high temporal resolution is necessary.Finally,BMS,which presents as a chronic burning sensation in the oral cavity,requires measures that evaluate subjective symptoms such as pain intensity,location,and quality.  4. Future Directions and Conclusion  In order to advance our understanding of chronic primary OFP and improve patient care,it is essential to develop more accurate preclinical assays and reliable pain measures that better reflect the clinical symptoms experienced by patients. Incorporating disease-specific characteristics,endpoints,and treatment responses into experimental models will enhance their translational potential.  Future research should focus on developing innovative animal models that capture the complexity of these conditions.Combining different assays and incorporating psychophysical tests reflective of clinical symptoms could provide a more comprehensive evaluation.A greater emphasis on implementing centralized sensitization mechanisms can help bridge the gap between animal models and human conditions.  Additionally,collaboration between researchers,clinicians,and patients is crucial in identifying important factors to be included in preclinical assays and measures.Improved cross-disciplinary communication will contribute to the development of more relevant animal models that facilitate effective intervention strategies for patients suffering from chronic primary OFP.  In conclusion,the field of chronic primary orofacial pain research has made significant strides,but there is still much work to be done.By addressing current limitations,developing innovative preclinical assays,and refining pain measures,we can overcome existing challenges and provide better care for those living with these debilitating conditions.",continue
"Gelatin is a widely used ingredient in various food products, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics due to its unique properties such as gelling, stabilizing, and emulsifying capabilities. It is obtained from the partial hydrolysis of collagen-rich connective tissues of animals, mainly bovine (cattle) and porcine (pigs). However, gelatin products derived from specific animal sources have faced significant scrutiny due to religious beliefs and dietary restrictions associated with certain sectors of the population.  In addition to religious concerns, potential health risks associated with gelatins sourced from specific animals have also prompted the need for accurate authentication methods. For instance, bovine-derived gelatins can pose risks such as transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease. Porcine-derived gelatins may also be problematic for individuals who follow strict halal or kosher dietary guidelines.  To address these concerns and meet consumer demands for transparency in food labeling, manufacturers require reliable methods for discerning and authenticating the origin of animal-based gelatins. Traditional identification techniques based on morphological characteristics or analytical testing are often inadequate or impractical in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, speed, cost-effectiveness.  As a result, there is a growing interest in developing biomarkers specifically targeted towards differentiating between gelatin derived from different animal species. These biomarkers can be classified into two major categories: proteomic biomarkers that involve protein analysis techniques and genomic biomarkers that involve DNA analysis techniques.  Proteomic approaches primarily rely on the identification and characterization of specific proteins or peptides present in gelatin samples. Various chromatography techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), capillary electrophoresis (CE-MS), or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) have been used to detect and quantify these proteins or peptides. Furthermore, lateral flow devices and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been developed as rapid and convenient tools for gelatin authentication.  On the other hand, genomic biomarkers involve the detection of specific nucleic acid substances derived from animal genomes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques are commonly employed for detecting DNA markers within gelatin samples. These DNA markers can be either species-specific, such as mitochondrial DNA sequences or nuclear gene sequences unique to a particular animal species.  While both proteomic and genomic biomarkers show promise for gelatin authentication, there are several challenges that must be addressed before their widespread implementation in the food industry. One major obstacle is the cost associated with acquiring equipment and reagents necessary for performing these analyses. Additionally, standardization of methods across laboratories is crucial to ensure reliable and consistent results.  Future research efforts should focus on combining multiple biomarkers and developing multiplex assays that target different protein or DNA markers simultaneously. This approach could significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of gelatin origin authentication.  In conclusion, advancements in proteomic and genomic techniques have offered promising solutions for authenticating the source of gelatins used in food products. The identification of specific proteins or peptides through proteomic methods combined with species-specific DNA markers detected via genomic methods can provide reliable differentiation between bovine, porcine, chicken-derived or fish-derived gelatins. However, further research is needed to address cost-related issues and establish standardized protocols that can be readily implemented by manufacturers seeking accurate authentication processes for their products' gelatin content.",continue
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and has a poor prognosis with increasing incidence globally. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach in HCC treatment by harnessing the body's immune system to target and destroy cancer cells. However, not all patients respond effectively to immunotherapies due to the development of resistance.  Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are a class of compounds that have been shown to enhance the anti-tumor effect of immunotherapies in various cancers, including HCC. HDACis function by inhibiting enzymes that regulate gene expression through histone deacetylation, thereby altering gene transcription and protein synthesis within tumor cells. This disruption leads to increased tumor cell death and sensitizes them to immune-mediated killing.  Recent studies have demonstrated the potential synergy between immunotherapies and HDACis in enhancing anti-tumor responses in HCC. Preclinical models have shown that combining HDACis with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, leads to improved therapeutic outcomes compared to single-agent treatments. This combination therapy promotes both innate and adaptive immune responses against HCC cells, resulting in enhanced tumor regression.  One mechanism by which HDACis enhance anti-tumor immunity is via modulation of the tumor microenvironment. The immunosuppressive nature of HCC tumors arises from an imbalance between suppressive immune cells like regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), along with impaired function or depletion of effector T cells. HDACis can reverse this immunosuppression by increasing effector T cell infiltration into tumors while reducing the population of inhibitory Tregs and MDSCs.  Moreover, HDACis can upregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on tumor cells, making them more visible to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Enhanced MHC-I expression on HCC cells leads to increased recognition and killing by antigen-specific T cells, thereby improving the anti-tumor immune response.  The combination of immunotherapies and HDACis has shown promising results in early clinical trials for HCC. For example, a phase 1b/2 study combining pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitor) with entinostat (HDACi) demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced HCC who had previously progressed on sorafenib therapy. The combination therapy achieved a disease control rate of 80%, including objective responses in some patients.  To further enhance the therapeutic efficacy of HDACis in HCC treatment, novel drug delivery systems are being explored. Nano-based drug delivery systems (NDDS) can encapsulate HDACis and deliver them directly to tumor sites, maximizing their effectiveness while minimizing off-target toxicity. NDDS can be tailored to release the drug over an extended period and facilitate sustained drug exposure within the tumor microenvironment.  In conclusion, the combination of immunotherapies and HDACis shows great potential for enhancing anti-tumor responses in HCC. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this synergy will aid in optimizing treatment strategies for HCC patients resistant to current immunotherapies. Furthermore, utilizing nano-based drug delivery systems may provide a novel approach to enhance the targeted delivery and efficacy of HDACis in HCC treatment. 2. Immunotherapy-based and HDACi-based therapies for HCC: Immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment landscape for various cancers, including HCC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, have shown promising results by reactivating exhausted T cells and restoring anti-tumor immune responses. However, not all patients respond to single-agent immunotherapy due to intrinsic or acquired resistance mechanisms.  HDACis offer a potential solution to overcome immunotherapy resistance in HCC. Several HDACis, including entinostat, vorinostat, and panobinostat have demonstrated synergistic effects when combined with immunotherapies in preclinical models of HCC. These combinations enhance the activation of tumor-specific T cells and improve their tumor-infiltrating capacities.  Furthermore, HDACis impact the tumor microenvironment by promoting an immune-supportive milieu. They reduce Treg cell populations while stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokine production within tumors. This shift towards an inflammatory environment strengthens the anti-tumor efficacy of immunotherapies as it disrupts immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells.  3. Translating knowledge into clinical benefits: The promising preclinical results of combining immunotherapies with HDACis in HCC have paved the way for clinical trials to assess their safety and efficacy in patients. Multiple ongoing studies are evaluating this combination therapy approach with encouraging preliminary results.  For instance, a phase Ib study investigating nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) plus ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) along with entinostat in advanced HCC patients demonstrated objective responses that were durable even after treatment discontinuation. This highlights the potential long-term benefits that can be achieved through combining immunotherapies with HDACis.  Additionally, other ongoing trials are exploring novel combinations involving checkpoint inhibitors targeting different molecules like LAG-3 or TIM-3 in combination with HDACis. These trials aim to further optimize the treatment landscape for HCC, providing more options for patients who may not respond to current standard-of-care therapies.  4. Nano-based drug delivery systems (NDDS) as a novel strategy: Efficient drug delivery systems are critical in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of HDACis in HCC treatment. NDDS, characterized by their ability to encapsulate and deliver drugs directly to tumor sites, offer several advantages over conventional drug delivery methods.  NDDS ensures targeted and sustained release of HDACis within the tumor microenvironment, maximizing their anti-tumor effects while minimizing off-target toxicity. Moreover, these systems can enhance drug stability and bioavailability, improve circulation time and immune recognition, as well as overcome multidrug resistance mechanisms exhibited by cancer cells.  Several studies have explored various NDDS formulations for delivering HDACis in HCC models, such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, and micelles. These approaches have shown enhanced therapeutic effects compared to free drugs alone.  However, challenges such as optimizing drug loading efficiency within NDDS formulations remain. Improving strategies for targeting specific molecular markers expressed on HCC cells would also enhance selective uptake of HDACis by tumors while sparing healthy tissues.  5. Conclusion: The application of immunotherapies in HCC has remarkably transformed patient management; however immunotherapy resistance remains a significant concern. Combining immunotherapies with HDACis offers a promising approach to overcome resistance mechanisms and achieve improved outcomes for HCC patients.  Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating this combination therapy's safety and efficacy while preliminary results show encouraging responses among advanced stage patients resistant to previous treatments.  Furthermore, incorporating nano-based drug delivery systems holds great potential in enhancing the targeted delivery and therapeutic benefits of HDACis specifically for HCC treatment. Overall findings from preclinical studies together with ongoing clinical trials suggest that combining immunotherapies with HDACis offers a promising strategy that could significantly improve the prognosis for HCC patients in the future.",continue
"Transactional sex, defined as the exchange of material incentives for sexual favors, is a prevalent practice among women in Sub-Saharan Africa. This practice has been associated with various negative consequences, including an increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion, and psychological trauma. Understanding the prevalence and factors associated with transactional sex is essential for developing effective interventions to address this issue.  Numerous primary studies have been conducted in different countries across sub-Saharan Africa to investigate the prevalence and determinants of transactional sex among women. However, these studies have shown significant discrepancies and inconsistent findings. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the available evidence on the pooled prevalence of transactional sex among women and its associated factors in sub-Saharan Africa.  A comprehensive search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, HINARI, the Cochrane Library, and grey literature sources from March 6 to April 24, 2022. The search encompassed studies published between 2000 and 2022. The pooled prevalence of transactional sex was estimated using a Random Effect Model. Data analysis was performed using Stata software (version 16.0). To assess heterogeneity among studies,the I-squared statistic was used,and publication bias was evaluated through funnel plot analysisand Egger's test.Furthermore,a subgroup analysis was conducted based on study years,data source,sample sizes,and geographical location.  The results revealed that the overall pooled prevalence of transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africa was found to be12.55% (95% CI:9.59%-15.52%).These findings highlight that a considerable proportionof women engage in transactional sexual relationshipsin this region.  Several factors were identified as significantly associated with engaging in transactional sexamongwomen.These include early sexual debut(also known as having first intercourse at an early age), substance abuse(primarily alcohol consumption), a history of sexual experiences,physical violence abuse, orphanhood (being an orphan), and sexual violence abuse. These factors exhibited strong associations with the practice of transactional sex. Therefore, addressing these factors is crucial in efforts to reduce the prevalence of transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The high prevalence of transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africa underscores the urgent need for effective interventions targeting this issue. These interventions should not only focus on raising awareness about the associated risks but also address the underlying social and economic factors contributing to this practice.Thissystematicreviewprovides valuable insights intothe prevalenceand associated factorsoftransactionalsexecutealth,serving as a foundation for informing evidence-based intervention programs aimed at reducing its incidence.

Interventions should take a holistic approach, addressing both individual-level factors and structural barriers that contribute to transactional sex. This may include strategies such as comprehensive sexual education programs that promote healthy relationships, gender equality, and negotiation skills.  Additionally, efforts should be made to address the economic disparities and limited educational opportunities that often contribute to transactional sex. Programs aimed at empowering women economically through vocational training, entrepreneurship support, and access to financial resources can help reduce their dependence on transactional relationships.  Furthermore, there is a need for targeted interventions focused on substance abuse prevention and treatment. Substance abuse has been consistently identified as a significant risk factor for engaging in transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africa. Providing accessible and affordable substance abuse treatment services can help individuals address underlying issues contributing to their involvement in transactional relationships.  Addressing violence against women is also crucial in reducing the prevalence of transactional sex. Efforts should be made to strengthen laws and policies protecting women from physical or sexual violence within both intimate partnerships and broader societal contexts. This includes improving access to support services such as shelters, counseling centers, legal aid clinics for survivors of violence.  In conclusion,this systematic review highlights the high prevalence of transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africaand identifies key factors associated with this practice.Addresingthesocio-ecnomicandstructuralbarriers,such as poverty,lackofeducationalopportnities,andgenderinaqualities,iscriticalin reducingtransactionalsexamongwomen.Thefindigsfrom thissudyshouldinformthe developmentofcomprehensiveinterventionsthatfocusonempowerng womentailoredtothelocalcontext.Futher researchisneededtoexpandonorunderstandingoftransactionalsex,anditsimpactsonwomen'shealthandwell-beinginSub-SaharnAfrica.Byimplementngsuitablepreventionstrategiesthataddessbothindivdual-levlfactorsandalstrtructuralfactors wecanheduce theprevalenceand consequnces of transactionalsexamongwomen,andmprove the overallsexualand reproductive healthpertnershipsforsusabilitof ub-SaharanAfria's women.",continue
"Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide, with an estimated 382,069 new cases and 89,929 deaths in 2018 alone (Ferlay et al., 2019). This type of cancer arises from the lining of the uterus, known as the endometrium. Various risk factors have been identified for endometrial cancer, including age, obesity, hormonal imbalances, and genetic predisposition. In recent years, sedentary behavior has emerged as a potential modifiable risk factor for several chronic diseases including cancer.  Sedentary behavior refers to any waking behavior characterized by low energy expenditure while sitting or lying down. It includes activities such as working at a desk job for long periods without breaks or engaging in excessive screen time. Multiple studies have reported an association between sedentary behavior and increased risk of various types of cancers such as colon, lung, breast and endometrial cancer (Schmid et al., 2014; Lynch et al., 2016).  To further investigate the association between sedentary behavior and endometrial cancer risk specifically, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. The aim was to assess whether there is a significant relationship between domain-specific sedentary behavior (occupational domains versus leisure-time domains) and total sedentary behavior with endometrial cancer risk.  A comprehensive search strategy was implemented across multiple databases to identify relevant observational human studies evaluating the association between sedentary behavior and endometrial cancer. A total of sixteen studies were included in this review. Fourteen studies comprising a large sample size involving 882 ,686 participants were included in the meta-analysis.  The findings demonstrated that higher levels of overall sedentary behavior were associated with a significantly increased risk of developing endometrial cancer (pooled RR:1.28). Furthermore,detailed analysis revealed that occupational domain-specific sedetary behaviour had significant association with increased risk of endometrial cancer (pooled RR:1.22), while leisure-time domain-specific sedentary behavior showed a slightly increased but non-significant risk (pooled RR:1.34). Interestingly, total sedentary behavior was also linked with a significantly higher risk of developing endometrial cancer (pooled RR:1.55).  Moreover, the meta-analysis also evaluated the role of adjustment for potential confounding factors such as physical activity and body mass index (BMI). It was observed that studies which accounted for these factors showed larger pooled relative risks compared to those without adjustment. This suggests that the relationship between sedentary behavior and endometrial cancer may be influenced by these confounding factors.  However, there are several limitations in this systematic review and meta-analysis that should be considered. Firstly, all included studies were observational in nature, thus causality cannot be established. Secondly,the measurement and assessment of sedentary behavior varied across studies, leading to potential heterogeneity in the results.Furthermore,in most studies,self-reported measures of sedentary behaviour were used which could introduce recall bias and may not accurately reflect actual levels of activity.Finally,the majority of included studies were conducted among Western populations,wereas no data was available from other regions such as South America or Asia.  In conclusion,this systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence suggesting that higher levels of overall sedentary behavior,epecially occupational domain-specificsedetary behaviours are associated with an increased risk pf develping endomentrailcancer.More research is needed to confirm these findings,based on objective quantification methods,and further exploration into potential interactions between physical activiry,bodily adiposity,and specific domains of sedenatry behaviors.However,given the modifiable natureof sefemtayrbeaviour,reducing its impact on enmendmetial cancer risik through encouraging changes at population level is warranted.o",continue
"Microneedles have emerged as a promising technology for transdermal biomedical applications. Traditional methods of drug delivery and biosensing often involve invasive techniques such as injections and blood draws, which can be painful and uncomfortable for patients. Microneedles offer a less invasive alternative by penetrating the outermost layer of skin painlessly, allowing for precise drug delivery or sample collection.  The key challenge in the development of microneedles lies in the choice of materials and fabrication methods that enable the desired shape, configuration, and function to be achieved. Different applications may require different material properties such as hardness, Young's modulus, biocompatibility, degradability, and processability. Therefore, it is important to carefully select materials that meet these requirements.  Several types of materials have been explored for microneedle fabrication. Silicon is commonly used due to its well-established processing techniques and biocompatibility. However, silicon microneedles are typically brittle and prone to breakage. Polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) offer flexibility but may not be suitable for certain applications due to their low Young's modulus.  To overcome these limitations and optimize material selection for specific applications, various composite materials have been developed. For example, combining polymers with metals or ceramics can enhance mechanical strength while maintaining flexibility or conductivity. The choice of material also affects the manufacturing process used to fabricate the microneedles.  Fabrication methods play a crucial role in determining the shape and structure of microneedles. Solid microneedles can be fabricated through processes such as photolithography or etching techniques on silicon wafers followed by molding or casting with polymers or metals. Hollow microneedles can be created using similar techniques but with an additional step to create microchannels within the needles.  Several advantages and disadvantages accompany each fabrication method depending on factors such as scalability, cost-effectiveness, complexity, and the desired geometric properties. Consequently, it is necessary to carefully consider these factors when selecting fabrication methods.  Once fabricated, microneedles can be used in various biomedical applications. Biosensing involves using microneedle-based sensors to detect biomarkers or analytes in the interstitial fluid or blood. This technology has the potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics by providing real-time measurements without conventional needle-based techniques.  On the other hand, drug delivery applications focus on efficient and controlled release of therapeutic agents through microneedles into specific skin layers or directly into systemic circulation. Microneedle drug delivery systems offer great promise for improving drug administration efficiency and patient compliance compared to traditional methods.  Body fluid extraction using microneedles allows for painless sample collection with less invasiveness compared to conventional venipuncture procedures. The collected samples can be analyzed for diagnostic purposes such as disease detection or monitoring.  Finally, nerve stimulation via microneedles has shown potential for targeted neural interfaces capable of controlling sensory perception or motor functions through electrical stimulation at specific nerve locations.  In conclusion, this review highlights the importance of material selection and fabrication methods in creating functional microneedles for various biomedical applications. By carefully considering these factors, researchers can develop innovative devices with improved performance characteristics and unlock new possibilities in a wide range of healthcare fields.

"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health concern, affecting approximately one-third of the world's population. The current challenges in TB diagnosis include long turnaround times and poor sensitivity of conventional diagnostic methods, which often lead to delays in treatment initiation and the development of drug resistance. To address these issues, molecular diagnostics have been developed, offering improved sensitivity but requiring sophisticated infrastructure, skilled personnel, and being cost-intensive.  A promising alternative for TB diagnosis is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, which was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016. The LAMP assay facilitates visual readouts and has shown potential for rapid detection of Mycobacterial spp., the causative agents of TB. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the diagnostic efficacy of LAMP for detecting a panel of Mycobacterium spp. following PRISMA guidelines.  A comprehensive search was conducted using scientific databases to identify relevant studies on LAMP-based diagnosis of Mycobacterium spp. Out of 1600 studies initially identified, 30 articles were included in this review based on predefined criteria. Most of these studies were conducted in high disease burden countries such as India, Thailand, and Japan. The sputum was found to be the most common specimen used for LAMP assays.  The analysis revealed that the IS6110 gene was frequently targeted for amplification using LAMP technology. In terms of detection method, fluorescence-based detection ranked as the most commonly used approach across these studies.  The accuracy rates varied between 79.2% to 99.3%, indicating strong diagnostic performance overall.The precision rates ranged from 73.9% to 100%, suggesting that LAMP assays are consistent with their results across different laboratories and settings.  Finally,the quality assessment based on QUADAS-2 tool was undertaken to evaluate potential biases or limitations in study design that may affect these findings or their applicability in different settings. This assessment helped to strengthen the overall conclusions drawn from this review.  In conclusion, LAMP technology shows promise as a feasible alternative for TB diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where there is a high burden of the disease and rapid testing is crucial. The visual readouts offered by LAMP assays make them advantageous in terms of ease of interpretation. While further research is needed to validate and expand the application of LAMP assays for Mycobacterial spp., this meta-analysis provides evidence supporting their diagnostic efficacy.  The implementation of LAMP technology for Mycobacterial spp. detection has the potential to significantly reduce treatment delays and prevent the development of drug resistance by enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis.Thus, it can contribute to improving TB control strategies on a global scale.  However, it should be noted that although LAMP assays offer enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional diagnostics, they still require trained personnel and appropriate laboratory infrastructure for optimal performance.Some challenges regarding cost-effectiveness also need to be addressed before widespread adoption can occur.  In summary,the findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis affirm that LAMP technology holds great promise as an alternative diagnostic tool for Mycobacterial spp. detection.The results underscore its potential to overcome some of the major barriers associated with conventional TB diagnostics,such as long turnaround times and poor sensitivity. Therefore,continued research efforts should focus on refining this promising technique,and further studies are warranted to evaluate its feasibility,cost-effectiveness,and scalability across different settings.This will help facilitate its integration into routine TB diagnosis algorithms worldwide,and potentially contribute significantly towards achieving global TB elimination targets.",continue
"Metformin, a widely used drug for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus, has shown promising applications in dentistry beyond its primary role as an anti-hyperglycemic medication. This narrative review aims to provide an overview of the various potential uses of metformin in the field of dentistry.  2. Periodontal Disease: Recent clinical trials have investigated the adjunct topical application of metformin in patients with diabetes and periodontitis.

The anti-inflammatory properties of metformin are believed to contribute to its positive effects on periodontal health.  Furthermore, research has suggested that metformin can stimulate odontogenic differentiation and mineral synthesis in stem cells derived from tooth pulp. This indicates its potential role in promoting tooth regeneration and repair.  3. Periodontal Regeneration: Metformin has also demonstrated regenerative effects on periodontal bone by stimulating osteoblast proliferation while reducing osteoclast activity. These properties make it a promising candidate for periodontal regeneration therapies aimed at restoring lost bone tissue caused by periodontitis.  4. Implant Dentistry: Studies have shown that metformin monotherapy can enhance osseointegration (the process by which implants fuse with surrounding bone) of endosseous implants placed within the jawbone. Improved osseointegration leads to greater stability and longevity of dental implants.  5. Oral Cancer: Emerging evidence suggests that metformin may exert anti-cancer effects on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). It is believed to impede tumor progression by inhibiting various cellular processes involved in cancer growth and metastasis.  6. Orthodontics: Animal studies have indicated that metformin can improve orthodontic tooth movement (the repositioning of teeth with braces) and resist corrosion of orthodontic appliances. These findings suggest that metformin may have applications in enhancing orthodontic treatment outcomes and reducing appliance-related complications.  7. Potential Mechanisms: The exact mechanisms underlying metformin's various effects in dentistry are not yet fully understood. However, it is thought to involve modulation of cellular signaling pathways involved in inflammation, stem cell differentiation, mineral synthesis, bone remodeling, and cancer development.  8. Conclusion: Metformin has shown great potential as a versatile drug in dentistry beyond its well-established role in diabetes management. From improving periodontal health to promoting tooth regeneration and supporting implant integration, metformin offers a wide range of prospective uses in oral healthcare.  Although further research is needed to better understand the specific mechanisms behind these effects and optimize dosing regimens for dental applications, the growing body of evidence supports the exploration of metformin's potential use as an adjunct therapy or even as a standalone treatment option within various branches of dentistry. Given the promising results from clinical trials and animal studies, future research should focus on conducting well-designed randomized controlled trials to further investigate the efficacy and safety of metformin in various dental applications. Moreover, it would be valuable to explore the optimal concentration, dosage form, and delivery method of metformin for each specific condition or procedure.  In addition to its potential therapeutic uses, metformin may also have preventive properties in dentistry. Considering its ability to reduce inflammation and stimulate bone regeneration, it could be explored as a preventive measure for individuals at risk of developing periodontal disease or osteoporosis-related bone loss.  It should be noted that although metformin has shown significant promise in various dental applications, it is essential for dental practitioners to carefully evaluate each patient's medical history and overall health status before considering the use of this drug. Like any medication, metformin has potential side effects and contraindications that need to be taken into account.  Furthermore, interdisciplinary collaboration between dentists and physicians is crucial when incorporating metformin into dental treatment protocols. Close communication between healthcare professionals can ensure comprehensive patient care and minimize any potential interactions or adverse effects when combining medications.  In summary, metformin shows great potential as a versatile drug with numerous prospective uses in dentistry. Its positive impact on managing periodontal parameters such as reducing inflammation and promoting bone regeneration make it an intriguing candidate for various oral conditions. Further research is needed to determine optimal dosing regimens, delivery methods, and long-term safety profiles specific to each application within dentistry. Nevertheless, given its widespread availability and established safety profile as an anti-diabetic medication globally recognized by regulatory authorities such as the US Food Drug Administration (FDA) as safe for long-term use in diabetes management; exploring its full range of benefits in dentistry holds considerable promise for improving oral health outcomes.  As researchers continue investigating the multitude of potential applications for this drug within dentistry, it is expected that metformin will emerge as a valuable tool in the preventive, therapeutic, and regenerative aspects of oral healthcare. Dentistry stands to gain significant benefit from incorporating metformin into its treatment armamentarium, ultimately improving patient outcomes and expanding the scope of dental practice.",continue
"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive and infiltrative primary brain tumor that carries a dismal prognosis. Despite advancements in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the survival rate for GBM patients remains poor, with a median overall survival of less than two years. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment by harnessing the power of the immune system to target and destroy tumor cells. However, GBM poses unique challenges that limit the effectiveness of immunotherapies.  1.1 Immunological Tolerance: One major barrier to successful immunotherapy in GBM is its ability to create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that evades immune surveillance. The tumor cells release immunosuppressive molecules such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) that dampen immune responses and promote tolerance towards the tumor.  1.2 Blood-Brain Barrier: Another significant challenge in treating GBM with immunotherapies is overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB prevents large molecules including most antibodies from entering the brain parenchyma where tumors reside. This restricts the delivery of therapeutic agents to target tumor cells effectively.  1.3 Heterogeneity and Antigen Escape: GBM exhibits considerable intratumoral heterogeneity both phenotypically and genotypically. This heterogeneity makes it difficult for immune cells to recognize all tumor antigens adequately, leading to antigen escape or loss variants within tumors over time.  These barriers have necessitated innovative approaches to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve outcomes for GBM patients receiving immunotherapy treatment.  2. Engineered Treatments:  2.1 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T): CAR-T cell therapy involves engineering T cells with receptors targeting specific antigens expressed on GBM cells. This approach has shown promise in preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials, demonstrating tumor regression and improved survival in some patients.  2.2 Bispecific T-cell Engagers (BiTEs): BiTEs are bispecific antibodies that engage both T cells and tumor cells to promote T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. By bridging the interaction between immune cells and tumors, BiTEs have shown potential for improving immunotherapy outcomes.  3. Non-Engineered Treatments:  3.1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) target inhibitory receptors on immune cells or ligands on tumor cells to enhance anti-tumor immune responses. While ICIs have revolutionized treatment in several cancer types, their success in GBM has been limited due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment within the brain.  3.2 Combination Therapies: Combinatorial approaches involving various immunotherapeutic agents combined with traditional treatments like surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy hold promise for overcoming resistance mechanisms in GBM. For example, combining ICIs with vaccines or oncolytic viruses can stimulate a more robust anti-tumor immune response.  4. Future Perspectives:  4.1 Personalized Medicine: Understanding the genomic landscape of each patient's tumor can guide personalized treatment strategies that target specific molecular alterations driving glioblastoma growth while simultaneously overcoming resistance mechanisms.  4.2 Nanotechnology-Enabled Drug Delivery: Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems show promise in overcoming BBB restrictions by encapsulating immunotherapeutic agents to enhance their penetration into the brain parenchyma while minimizing off-target effects.  In conclusion, Glioblastoma poses unique challenges that limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy approaches already successful in other cancer types. Overcoming these barriers requires innovative strategies targeting diverse aspects of GBM's complex biology while considering individual patient characteristics such as intratumoral heterogeneity and genetic alterations underlying resistance mechanisms. Although significant progress has been made, continued research efforts are needed to improve immunotherapy outcomes and ultimately provide better treatment options for GBM patients.",continue
"Chronic neck pain is a prevalent condition that can have a significant impact on individuals' daily lives, leading to decreased function and decreased quality of life. There are various treatment options available for chronic neck pain, including manual therapy techniques such as instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) and myofascial release therapy (MRT). Both techniques aim to address soft tissue dysfunction and improve pain and function in individuals with chronic neck pain.  IASTM involves the use of specialized instruments to provide targeted pressure and movement over the affected soft tissues. These instruments are designed to break down scar tissue, adhesions, and fascial restrictions, promoting the healing process. MRT, on the other hand, focuses on releasing tensions within the fascia by applying sustained pressure or stretching techniques.  While both IASTM and MRT have been shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving function in individuals with chronic musculoskeletal conditions such as shoulder impingement syndrome or plantar fasciitis, there is limited evidence comparing their effectiveness specifically in treating chronic neck pain.  Therefore, this randomized clinical trial aimed to explore whether there were any differences between IASTM and MRT in treating college students with chronic mechanical neck pain (CMNP) who were engaged in distance learning due to COVID-19 restrictions. A total of thirty-three participants were randomly assigned to either receive IASTM or MRT for eight therapy sessions over four weeks.  The primary outcomes measured for each participant included pain intensity assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), functional status evaluated using the Neck Disability Index (NDI), and pressure sensitivity measured using a pressure algometer.  After analyzing the data obtained from these outcome measures pre- and post-intervention, no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups regarding improvements in pain intensity levels, functional status, or pressure sensitivity thresholds.  It is important to note that this study did not include a control group. Therefore, it is challenging to establish a direct causal relationship between the interventions (IASTM or MRT) and the observed improvements in pain and function. Other factors, such as natural recovery over time or concurrent therapies received by participants outside of the study, could have influenced the outcomes.  Despite this limitation, this study contributes to the existing literature by comparing the effectiveness of IASTM and MRT specifically in individuals with CMNP. Further research with larger sample sizes, including control groups, is necessary to investigate whether these manual therapy techniques have any significant advantages over one another or if they are equally effective in managing chronic neck pain.  In conclusion, while both IASTM and MRT were found to be comparable in their effects on pain intensity levels, functional status, and pressure sensitivity thresholds for college students with CMNP engaged in distance learning due to COVID-19 restrictions; further research is warranted to confirm these findings and explore potential differences between these manual therapy techniques. The findings of this study suggest that both IASTM and MRT can be considered as viable treatment options for individuals with chronic neck pain. However, it is important for healthcare professionals to consider the individual needs and preferences of their patients when determining which technique to use.  One advantage of IASTM is its ability to target specific areas of soft tissue dysfunction with the use of specialized instruments. This may be beneficial for individuals with localized trigger points or tightness in specific muscles, such as the upper trapezius or levator scapulae muscles, which were the focus areas in this study. The targeted pressure and movement provided by IASTM instruments can help break down scar tissue and adhesions, promoting improved range of motion and reducing pain.  On the other hand, MRT focuses on releasing tensions within the fascia by applying sustained pressure or stretching techniques. This technique can be particularly effective for individuals with more widespread myofascial restrictions or tension throughout their neck musculature. MRT aims to restore balance within the fascial system, improving overall mobility and reducing discomfort.  It is worth noting that while this study focused specifically on college students engaged in distance learning due to COVID-19 restrictions, these findings could potentially apply to a broader population experiencing chronic neck pain. Future studies should aim to replicate these results across different age groups and occupations to enhance generalizability.  In addition, future research should consider incorporating a control group into their study design. Having a control group would allow researchers to compare the effects of IASTM and MRT against no intervention or a placebo intervention. This would provide clearer evidence regarding the true effectiveness of these manual therapy techniques in managing chronic neck pain.  Furthermore, long-term follow-up assessments would be valuable for evaluating whether any observed improvements are sustainable over time. Chronic neck pain often requires ongoing management strategies beyond short-term interventions; therefore, understanding the long-term effects of IASTM and MRT is crucial.  In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the effects of IASTM and MRT in treating chronic neck pain among college students engaged in distance learning. Both techniques were found to be comparable in terms of pain reduction, functional improvement, and pressure sensitivity. However, further research is warranted to strengthen these findings and determine any potential differences between the two manual therapy approaches. Healthcare professionals should consider individual patient needs and preferences when selecting a treatment approach for chronic neck pain.",continue
"The healthcare industry is characterized by its critical need for effective communication and information sharing. In recent years, there has been significant focus on the concepts of employee silence and voice in healthcare settings. Employee silence refers to the withholding of relevant information or opinions, while employee voice encompasses speaking up and expressing ideas or concerns.  Numerous studies have explored these concepts in relation to patient safety, quality of care, and worker wellbeing. However, interventions aimed at encouraging speaking up have often yielded disappointing outcomes due to a prevailing professional and organizational culture that does not support open communication. This raises questions about our understanding of employee voice and silence in healthcare, as well as the complex relationship between withholding information and various healthcare outcomes.  This integrative systematic review aims to address two key questions: (1) How is voice and silence defined and measured in healthcare?; (2) What are the theoretical foundations underpinning these concepts?  To conduct this review, an extensive search was conducted across multiple databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science CINAHL, and Google Scholar. Only quantitative studies published in peer-reviewed journals between 2016-2022 were considered for inclusion.  Overall, 76 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review with a total sample size of 122009 participants. The majority of participants were female nurses. The findings revealed three main results:  Firstly, the conceptualization and measurement of both voice a nd silence in healthcare varied widely across studies. There was no consensus on a standardized definition or measurement tool, resulting in heterogeneity within the research literature. This lack of consistency made it difficult to compare and generalize findings across studies.  Secondly, the theoretical background surrounding employee voice and silence in healthcare was found to be lacking. While numerous studies examined these concepts, there was no unified theoretical framework guiding the research. This highlights a gap in our understanding of the underlying psychological and organizational factors that influence employee voice and silence in healthcare settings.  Additionally, the review identified a need for further research regarding the distinction between safety voice - employees speaking up specifically about patient safety concerns - and general employee voice encompassing broader workplace issues. Understanding how these two forms of expression coexist within healthcare organizations is crucial for developing targeted interventions.  The limitations of the reviewed studies were also acknowledged. Many relied heavily on self-reported data from cross-sectional designs, which can introduce response bias and limit causal inference. Furthermore, there was an overrepresentation of nurses and female staff among study participants, potentially limiting generalizability to other healthcare professionals.  Overall, this integrative systematic review highlights several key implications for both researchers and practitioners in the healthcare sector.  On one hand, it underscores the need for more robust assessment approaches when studying employee voice and silence in healthcare settings. The lack of standardized definitions and measurement tools hampers comparability across studies. Therefore, developing validated instruments that capture both individual-level perceptions as well as contextual factors could enhance our understanding of these constructs.  On another note, this review calls attention to the fact that current research falls short of providing sufficient evidence linking theory to practice implications within the healthcare industry. Bridging this gap would enable researchers to develop evidence-based interventions aimed at cultivating an organizational culture conducive to open communication while also addressing specific challenges related to patient safety or worker wellbeing.  In conclusion, this integrative review sheds light on important gaps currently present in our understanding of employee voice and silence in healthcare. The heterogeneity in conceptualization and measurement, lack of theoretical foundation, and limited evidence on links to practice all highlight areas for future research. By addressing these gaps, we can work towards improving communication, information sharing, and ultimately the quality of care within healthcare organizations.",continue
"Lung cancer is one of the most common clinical malignant tumors, and its incidence has been increasing annually. Traditional open surgeries for lung cancer resections involve large incisions, leading to significant postoperative pain, prolonged hospitalization, and delayed recovery for patients. Minimally invasive techniques such as thoracoscopic surgery have revolutionized the field of lung cancer resection by providing excellent surgical outcomes while minimizing trauma to patients.  Single-port thoracoscopic surgery is a relatively novel approach that involves performing the entire procedure through a single small incision in the chest wall. This technique offers several advantages over traditional multi-hole thoracoscopic surgery and even open thoracotomy. The primary advantage lies in reduced postoperative pain due to the smaller incision size, resulting in improved patient comfort and satisfaction. Additionally, single-port surgery allows for comparable surgical outcomes, including complete tumor resection and lymph node dissection.  However, despite these advantages of single-port thoracoscopic surgery in lung cancer patients, it still induces varying degrees of stress on the body. The stress response elicited during surgery can lead to impaired immune function, increased inflammatory response, and compromised respiratory function postoperatively. Consequently, promoting rapid rehabilitation becomes essential to enhance recovery outcomes and improve prognosis.  Rapid rehabilitation refers to a comprehensive perioperative nursing program designed to minimize complications while maximizing functional recovery after surgery. It encompasses various strategies such as preoperative education and counseling aimed at reducing anxiety levels; optimized anesthesia management protocols that help maintain hemodynamic stability; intraoperative fluid management strategies targeted at reducing fluid overload or dehydration; use of evidence-based analgesic protocols tailored according to patient needs; early mobilization plans focused on preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), respiratory complications like pneumonia or atelectasis; personalized nutrition support programs designed according to individual requirements; careful wound care practices that aim at preventing infection or wound dehiscence; close monitoring of vital signs throughout recovery period facilitating early recognition and management of any complications; and comprehensive patient education programs enabling self-care measures at home.  Several studies have examined the effectiveness of rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. These studies have shown that implementing a multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, physical therapists, nutritionists, and psychologists significantly improves postoperative outcomes. Patients who received rapid rehabilitation care demonstrated reduced length of hospital stay, decreased pain scores, improved lung function recovery rates, reduced postoperative complications such as pneumonia or DVTs compared to conventional care.  In conclusion, rapid rehabilitation nursing holds great potential in enhancing recovery outcomes for lung cancer patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery. By employing a multidisciplinary approach and implementing evidence-based strategies throughout the perioperative period from preoperative counseling to post-discharge follow-up care, patients can benefit from improved functional recovery rates and enhanced quality of life. Further research is needed to explore additional aspects that can be addressed through rapid rehabilitation nursing to optimize patient outcomes in this surgical population. The future lies in incorporating personalized medicine principles into recovery protocols tailored specially as per individual needs to further improve surgical outcomes in lung cancer patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery.  2. Methods  In order to review the research progress on rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery, a systematic literature search was conducted. Relevant articles were identified by searching electronic databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar using keywords such as ""lung cancer"", ""thoracoscopy"", ""single-port surgery"", ""rapid rehabilitation nursing"", and their combinations.  The inclusion criteria for selecting articles were as follows: 1) studies focusing on the application of rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery; 2) studies published in English; and 3) studies conducted on human subjects.  After screening the initial search results based on title and abstract, full-text articles that met the inclusion criteria were further evaluated. Data from selected studies were extracted and analyzed to identify key findings related to rapid rehabilitation nursing interventions and their impact on postoperative outcomes in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.  3. Results  Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of various components of rapid rehabilitation nursing in improving postoperative outcomes for patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. These interventions include preoperative education and counseling programs, optimized anesthesia management protocols, early mobilization plans, personalized nutrition support programs, evidence-based analgesic protocols, wound care practices, close monitoring of vital signs during recovery period as well as comprehensive patient education programs.  Preoperative education programs have been shown to reduce anxiety levels among patients by providing them with information about the surgical procedure itself, expected outcomes, potential complications,and self-care measures postoperatively. This helps them better prepare both physically and mentally for the surgery,resulting in reduced stress levels during recovery period.  Optimized anesthesia management protocols focus on maintaining hemodynamic stability throughout surgery which aids in minimizing perioperative complications such as cardiovascular events or excessive bleeding.These strategies involve using appropriate anesthetic agents,doses,and techniques tailored according to individual patient characteristics.  Early mobilization plans are crucial in preventing postoperative complications such as deep vein thrombosis(DVT) or respiratory complications like pneumonia or atelectasis. By encouraging early ambulation and activity, patients can restore their lung function faster and minimize the risk of developing complications.  Additionally, personalized nutrition support programs play a significant role in promoting recovery by ensuring patients receive adequate nutritional support based on their individual requirements. This helps maintain energy levels, promotes tissue healing,and boosts the immune system.  Moreover,evidence-based analgesic protocols customized according to patient's needs help in controlling postoperative pain effectively while minimizing side effects from medications which can further aid in early mobilization and overall recovery progression.  Wound care practices involving vigilant monitoring for signs of infection and dehiscence are paramount for preventing wound-related complications. Strict adherence to aseptic techniques,reliable dressing material selection,and expert wound care management are critical elements in this aspect of rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.  Close monitoring of vital signs such as blood pressure,heart rate,respiratory rate,followed by timely interventions if any abnormalities are detected is fundamental for early detection and management of potential postoperative complications.  Comprehensive patient education programs play an essential role not only during hospital stay but also after discharge.

This multidisciplinary approach that involves healthcare professionals from diverse fields focuses on addressing physical,psychological,and nutritional aspects of the patients in a holistic manner.  However,further research is still needed to evaluate the long-term effects of rapid rehabilitation nursing interventions ,assess patient satisfaction and quality of life measures over an extended period post-surgery. Additionally,investigations comparing different rapid rehabilitation nursing protocols or exploring novel interventions can provide valuable insights to optimize patient care in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.  In conclusion,rapid rehabilitation nursing has emerged as a significant aspect of enhanced recovery after single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.Its comprehensive care strategies,along with a multidisciplinary approach,have shown immense potential in promoting faster functional recovery,reducing complications associated with surgery and improving overall patient outcomes.It is crucial for healthcare providers to recognize the importance of incorporating these nursing interventions into clinical practice to further enhance recovery for lung cancer patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery.",continue
"Anticancer drug use at the end of life is a complex and controversial topic that raises important ethical considerations. The decision to continue or discontinue cancer treatment in patients nearing the end of their lives is challenging for both healthcare professionals and patients.  The goal of this scoping review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the frequency of anticancer drug use at the end of life, thereby shedding light on current practices and potentially identifying areas for improvement. By examining a large number of publications and analyzing key study features, we aim to identify patterns and trends in anticancer drug use during this critical phase.  To conduct this scoping review, we performed systematic searches in Medline and Embase databases, using specific search terms related to anticancer drug use at the end of life. We selected 341 eligible publications that met our inclusion criteria, which included articles reporting on any aspect of anticancer drug use in patients near the end stages of their disease.  Each publication was carefully reviewed to gather important study characteristics such as timing of research (e.g., retrospective or prospective), disease status (e.g., advanced or metastatic cancer), treatment schedule (e.g., continuous or intermittent), treatment type (e.g., chemotherapy, targeted therapy), and treatment characteristics (e.g., dose, duration).  Amongst our subset analysis comprising 69 articles published within the last 5 years across various cancer types, we focused on examining the frequency of anticancer drug use during specific time periods near the end stages. This analysis aimed to provide insights into how often these drugs are prescribed during different phases approaching death.  Preliminary findings from this scoping review suggest significant variability in terms of when anticancer drugs are used at the end stage of different cancers. Some studies showed frequent administration up until very close to death as part an effort to contain tumor growth even when quality-of-life considerations become paramount. However, other studies indicated more conservative approaches with earlier discontinuation once the disease became advanced or when treatment started to adversely affect the patient's well-being.  These contrasting findings highlight the need for further research and a standardized approach in determining appropriate timing for anticancer drug use at the end of life. By establishing clear guidelines based on robust evidence, healthcare professionals can navigate this complex decision-making process more effectively, ensuring that patients receive appropriate care that aligns with their specific needs and wishes.  In conclusion, this scoping review provides a comprehensive description of publications on anticancer drug use at end of life and emphasizes the importance of considering methodological factors when designing future studies. By understanding current practices and identifying areas for improvement, healthcare providers can optimize care for patients facing terminal cancer and maximize their quality of life during their final stages. Further research is needed to develop evidence-based guidelines that balance potential therapeutic benefits with patient-centered considerations in this challenging context. Moreover, the implications of anticancer drug use at the end of life extend beyond individual patients to the broader healthcare system. The high cost of these drugs, combined with limited resources and competing priorities, necessitates a careful examination of their utility in this context. Understanding the frequency and patterns of anticancer drug use can help inform resource allocation decisions and promote more efficient and equitable healthcare delivery.  Additionally, this scoping review serves as a call to action for further research in this area. While we have provided an overview of current literature, there are still gaps in our understanding of anticancer drug use at the end of life. Future studies could explore factors influencing treatment decisions, such as patient preferences, clinician attitudes, and societal influences.  Furthermore, exploring patient outcomes associated with different approaches to end-of-life cancer treatment is crucial. Evaluating not only survival but also quality-of-life measures can provide essential insights into the impact of these treatments on patients' well-being. It is important to strike a balance between maximizing survival while minimizing unnecessary suffering caused by aggressive treatments near death.  Collaboration among researchers is essential in addressing these gaps in knowledge comprehensively. By pooling data from multiple studies or conducting multicenter trials with standardized protocols and outcome measures, we can generate more robust evidence on which appropriate clinical practice guidelines can be based.  In conclusion, this scoping review highlights the need for a greater understanding of anticancer drug use at the end of life. By identifying key study features and examining frequency patterns across various cancer types during different phases near death, we shed light on current practices while emphasizing methodological considerations for future research.  The findings underscore that decision-making regarding anticancer drug use at end-of-life requires careful consideration based on individual patient circumstances and preferences. Healthcare providers must engage patients in shared decision-making conversations that take into account prognosis information alongside potential benefits and burdens associated with continued treatment.  Moving forward towards evidence-based guidelines will require collaboration between researchers across different disciplines, including medical oncologists, palliative care specialists, and health economists. By collectively studying the optimal timing and appropriateness of anticancer drug use at end of life, we can improve patient care and optimize resource allocation in a manner that aligns with patient preferences and overall healthcare goals. Ultimately, our aim should be to provide compassionate and individualized care during the final stages of life for those facing cancer.",continue
"Cancer is a complex and multifactorial disease characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation and invasion. Metabolic reprogramming, which refers to the alteration of cellular metabolism to support the energy demand of rapidly dividing cancer cells, has emerged as a hallmark of tumorigenesis. Among the three major substances involved in metabolism, lipids have shown significant implications in cancer development.  Abnormal lipid metabolism has been associated with various diseases, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The prevalence of abnormal lipid metabolism is steadily increasing worldwide, due in part to sedentary lifestyles and diets rich in saturated fats and sugars. Lipids are not only an essential energy source for cell growth but also play important roles in signal transduction pathways that control various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis.  The dysregulation of lipid metabolism has been demonstrated to contribute to tumor initiation and progression through different mechanisms. For instance, altered cholesterol homeostasis has been linked to increased cell membrane rigidity and aberrant signaling pathway activation in cancer cells. Abnormalities in triglyceride metabolism have also been implicated in promoting tumor growth through enhanced fatty acid synthesis for energy production.  Sphingolipids represent another class of lipids that have gained attention due to their involvement in multiple cellular processes such as apoptosis regulation and intracellular signaling cascades. Dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism has been observed in several cancers including breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.  Lipid rafts are specialized microdomains within cell membranes enriched with cholesterol and sphingolipids that serve as platforms for assembling specific proteins involved in signal transduction events. Alterations in lipid raft composition or function can impact oncogenic signaling pathways by affecting protein-protein interactions or receptor trafficking within these microdomains.  Adipocytes play a crucial role not only as energy reservoirs but also as active participants within the tumor microenvironment. Adipose tissue secretes various signaling molecules, collectively known as adipokines, that can influence cancer cell behavior and tumor angiogenesis. Additionally, the interaction between cancer cells and adipocytes can promote a pro-inflammatory state which further promotes tumor growth and metastasis.  Lipid droplets are dynamic cytoplasmic organelles that store neutral lipids such as triglycerides and cholesterol esters. Growing evidence suggests that lipid droplets play a critical role in cancer cell survival by providing energy-rich substrates for oxidative metabolism during periods of nutrient deprivation or hypoxia.  The dysregulation of lipid metabolism in cancer cells has clinical implications, particularly with regards to drug resistance. Several studies have shown that altered lipid metabolism can confer resistance to chemotherapy drugs by promoting efflux mechanisms or altering drug pharmacokinetics within the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, targeting key enzymes or signaling pathways involved in aberrant lipid metabolism may provide new avenues for overcoming drug resistance.  Current research in this field has yielded promising results but there are still limitations to be addressed. Firstly, the understanding of the metabolic heterogeneity among different tumor types is limited and there is a need for more comprehensive characterization of specific lipid metabolic profiles associated with each type of cancer. Moreover, there is a lack of clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of targeting specific lipid metabolic pathways as potential therapeutic interventions.  In conclusion, abnormal lipid metabolism plays a significant role in tumorigenesis through its influence on various cellular processes involved in cancer initiation and progression. Understanding the intricate relationship between lipids and tumors may provide new directions for developing targeted therapies aimed at disrupting aberrant lipid metabolic pathways. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulated lipid metabolism in different cancers while also exploring novel therapeutic strategies to improve treatment outcomes and patient survival prognosis.",continue
"Wilms tumour (WT) is the most common type of kidney cancer in children, accounting for approximately 95% of all pediatric renal tumors. It typically occurs in children between the ages of 2 to 5 years and is characterized by abnormal embryonic kidney development. The current standard for diagnosing WT involves imaging techniques such as ultrasound or MRI, followed by a biopsy to confirm the presence of malignant cells. However, these methods can be invasive and may not always be accurate.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-protein-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. They have been implicated in various biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that miRNA expression profiles can be altered in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting their potential as diagnostic biomarkers.  In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify dysregulated circulating miRNAs in WT through an extensive search of published literature. We searched multiple databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web-of-Science, and Wiley online library for studies reporting on circulating miRNAs related to WT. Articles published in English or French were included in our analysis.  Using the PRISMA guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we identified a total of five articles that met our inclusion criteria. These articles included data from 172 patients with WT and 108 healthy controls. Based on this data set, we identified a total of 301 dysregulated miRNAs associated with WT.  Of these dysregulated miRNAs, we found that 144 were up-regulated (meaning their expression levels were higher than normal), while 143 were down-regulated (meaning their expression levels were lower than normal). Additionally, there were 14 conflicting miRNAs whose dysregulation status varied across different studies.  To assess the diagnostic potential of these dysregulated miRNAs, we performed a meta-analysis to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of miRNAs for WT diagnosis. We included data from two studies that reported on the dysregulation of 49 miRNAs in WT patients. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated to be 0.67 and 0.95, respectively, indicating a reasonable accuracy in diagnosing WT.  Furthermore, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) for these dysregulated miRNAs, which provides an overall measure of their diagnostic potential. The AUC was found to be 0.77, suggesting that these circulating miRNAs have a moderate ability to distinguish between patients with WT and healthy controls.  Overall, our findings suggest that circulating miRNAs hold promise as potential biomarkers for diagnosing WT. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and investigate associations between specific miRNA expression profiles and tumor stage or subtype.  In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provide insights into the dysregulated circulating miRNA profiles associated with WT. These findings highlight the potential of using circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for WT and emphasize the need for further research in this field. Identifying reliable biomarkers could significantly improve early detection rates, aiding in better prognosis determination and disease-monitoring strategies for children with Wilms tumour.  Additionally, the use of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for WT could have significant clinical implications. Currently, the diagnosis of WT relies on imaging techniques and invasive procedures such as biopsies. These methods can be time-consuming, costly, and may carry potential risks for the young patients undergoing them. Furthermore, there is always a need to improve diagnostic accuracy in order to initiate appropriate treatment strategies promptly.  If validated and implemented into clinical practice, circulating miRNAs could offer a minimally invasive and reliable tool for diagnosing WT. Blood samples are easily accessible compared to tissue samples, making them more convenient for monitoring patient response to treatment or detecting disease recurrence.  In addition to their potential as diagnostic biomarkers, dysregulated miRNAs may also hold prognostic value in WT. The expression levels of specific miRNAs might correlate with tumor stage or subtype and provide valuable information regarding patient outcomes. Understanding these associations could help tailor treatment plans according to each patient's unique characteristics.  Moreover, monitoring changes in circulating miRNA levels over time may aid in disease surveillance and response assessment during therapy. By evaluating dynamic alterations in miRNA expression patterns throughout treatment, clinicians could gain insights into the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions on an individual basis.  However, several challenges remain before circulating miRNAs can be widely adopted as clinical biomarkers for WT. First and foremost is the need for further validation studies using larger cohorts from diverse populations. The studies included in our analysis had relatively small sample sizes; thus, replication of findings is crucial to establish robust evidence.  Additionally, standardization of methodologies is necessary to ensure consistency across different laboratories when measuring circulating miRNA levels. Variations in RNA isolation protocols or quantification methods can introduce variability that might affect reproducibility across studies.  Furthermore, future research should focus on identifying specific subsets of dysregulated miRNAs that show consistent alterations across different cohorts while avoiding those with conflicting results observed between studies.  In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the potential of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for WT. The dysregulated expression patterns observed in these short, non-protein-coding RNAs indicate their involvement in the pathogenesis of WT and their potential clinical utility.  However, further research is needed to validate these findings and assess their generalizability across different populations. Standardization of methodologies is also essential to ensure reproducibility and comparability between studies.  Overall, if successfully implemented into clinical practice, circulating miRNAs have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis, subtyping/prognostication, and disease monitoring strategies for patients with Wilms tumour. These advancements could lead to earlier detection, personalized treatment approaches, improved patient outcomes, and ultimately a better quality of life for children affected by this disease.",continue
"Transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) has become a popular technique for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing major colorectal surgeries. It involves the injection of local anesthetics into the transversus abdominis plane, which blocks the nerves responsible for transmitting pain signals from the abdominal wall. By reducing opioid consumption and providing effective analgesia, TAPB can improve postoperative recovery and patient outcomes.  However, there are ongoing debates about the two main approaches to administering TAPB - laparoscopic and ultrasound-guided techniques. Laparoscopic TAPB involves direct visualization of the transversus abdominis muscle during surgery, allowing for precise placement of local anesthetic injections. On the other hand, ultrasound-guided TAPB relies on real-time imaging to visualize the anatomical structures and guide needle placement.  The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare these two approaches - laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB - in terms of their effectiveness and safety in postoperative pain management for minimally invasive colorectal surgery patients. By integrating both direct comparisons (studies directly comparing laparoscopic and ultrasound-guided TAPB) and indirect comparisons (studies comparing either approach with a control group), we hope to provide a comprehensive analysis that will help guide clinical decision-making.  We will conduct a systematic electronic literature search using databases such as PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov up until July 31, 2023. The selected studies will be assessed for methodological quality using tools such as Cochrane Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBIN-I).  Our primary outcome measures include opioid consumption at 24 hours postoperatively and pain scores at rest, coughing, and movement at 24 hours postoperatively, using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Secondary outcome measures will include the probability of TAPB-related adverse events, overall postoperative 30-day complications, postoperative 30-day ileus (intestinal obstruction), postoperative 30-day surgical site infection, postoperative 7-day nausea and vomiting, and length of hospital stay.  Data analysis will be performed using RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 17.0 software. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. A statistically significant result will be defined as a p-value less than 0.05.  The certainty of evidence will also be assessed using the GRADE working group approach to determine how confident we can be in the results.  Since this study involves a secondary analysis of existing data, no ethical approval is required. We anticipate that our meta-analysis will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB for minimally invasive colorectal surgery patients.  The results of this study are expected to have implications for future clinical trials and help guide clinicians in making informed decisions regarding perioperative pain management. The findings will be disseminated through high-quality peer-reviewed publications and international conference presentations to ensure widespread access to this important information.  In conclusion, this meta-analysis aims to compare laparoscopic versus ultrasound-guided TAPB in terms of their efficacy and safety for managing postoperative pain in minimally invasive colorectal surgery patients. By analyzing available evidence, we hope to contribute towards improving perioperative pain management practices for better patient outcomes",continue
"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. It is a major global health problem with significant mortality and morbidity rates. Pancreatic islets, composed of various endocrine cells including β-cells that secrete insulin, play a crucial role in maintaining glucose homeostasis in the body.  Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently gained attention as important mediators of intercellular communication. EVs are small membranous structures released by cells into the extracellular environment. They contain various bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that can be transferred to recipient cells to influence their function. EVs are involved in numerous physiological processes and disease conditions.  The intercellular communication mediated by EVs within pancreatic islets is critical for proper regulation of insulin secretion from β-cells. In response to changes in blood glucose levels, β-cells release EVs containing specific cargo molecules involved in signaling pathways that regulate insulin production and secretion. These EVs can communicate with neighboring β-cells as well as other cell types within the pancreatic islet microenvironment to coordinate the overall response.  Furthermore, EV-mediated crosstalk between pancreatic islets and peripheral insulin target tissues also plays a vital role in maintaining glucose homeostasis under normal physiological conditions. For instance, muscle and adipose tissue receive signals from pancreatic islet-derived EVs that enhance their sensitivity to insulin or increase glucose uptake.  In the context of DM, dysregulation of EV-mediated intercellular communication within pancreatic islets contributes to pathological changes associated with the disease. Autoimmune responses against β-cell antigens result in destruction of pancreatic islets through inflammatory processes involving immune cell-derived EVs carrying pro-inflammatory molecules or autoantigens.  Insulin resistance observed in type 2 DM involves impaired signaling between pancreatic islet-derived EVs and peripheral insulin target tissues. The cargo molecules within EVs released from β-cells fail to effectively promote insulin sensitivity, contributing to reduced glucose uptake and increased blood glucose levels.  In addition to their role as mediators of intercellular communication, EVs also have the potential to serve as biomarkers for DM. The composition and quantity of EVs released from pancreatic islets can reflect the physiological status of β-cells or indicate disease progression. Analysis of circulating EV populations enables non-invasive assessment of pancreatic islet health.  Moreover, therapeutic applications of EVs in DM are under investigation. Pancreatic islet-derived EVs can be engineered to deliver specific therapeutic cargos such as anti-inflammatory molecules or growth factors that enhance β-cell survival and function. These engineered EVs may hold promise for improving diabetes treatment outcomes.  In conclusion, understanding the role of EV-mediated intercellular and interorgan communication within pancreatic islets is crucial for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying both physiological homeostasis maintenance and pathological changes associated with DM. Investigating the composition, function, and regulatory mechanisms of these vesicles will provide valuable insights into developing novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for DM management.  Further research efforts focusing on the involvement of EV-mediated signaling in diabetes pathogenesis will contribute towards a greater understanding of this complex disease and potentially lead to innovative approaches for its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.",continue
"Nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO) is a devastating condition that leads to sudden and severe loss of vision. It is considered a variant of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and shares many similarities in terms of pathophysiology and clinical presentation. As such, there have been significant advances in the field of neuroprotection for AIS, which may hold promise for improving outcomes in NA-CRAO.  The American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association have developed guidelines for the care of CRAO patients, emphasizing the importance of early intervention to maximize visual recovery. However, current treatment options are limited, with no standard neuroprotective therapy available. This review aims to explore the potential application of neuroprotection in improving outcomes for NA-CRAO.  In recent years, there has been a growing body of research focused on neuroprotection for various retinal diseases, including retinal detachment, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and inherited retinal diseases. These studies have identified several promising interventions that could potentially be adapted for use in NA-CRAO.  Additionally, extensive research into neuroprotection for AIS has yielded promising results with newer drugs such as Uric acid, Nerinetide, and Otaplimastat being tested. The progress made in cerebral neuroprotection after AIS raises hopes that similar approaches could be effective in protecting the retina after CRAO.  Combining neuroprotective strategies with thrombolysis may also extend the therapeutic window for treating NA-CRAO. Thrombolysis aims to dissolve or dislodge blood clots causing occlusion and restore blood flow to affected tissues. By combining this approach with neuroprotective agents that can mitigate further damage caused by reperfusion injury or ischemia-induced cascades within the retina, it may be possible to improve visual outcomes even beyond the currently recommended narrow time window.  Several experimental approaches have shown promise as potential neuroprotective treatments for CRAO. These include the use of Angiopoietin (Comp Ang1) to enhance vascular stability and protect against endothelial damage, KUS 121, a selective GluN1/GluN2B receptor antagonist that has shown efficacy in reducing retinal damage in animal studies, gene therapy targeting the XIAP gene to delay retinal cell death, and hypothermia as a means of reducing metabolic demand and limiting cell death.  However, for these neuroprotective strategies to be effectively translated into clinical practice, several challenges must be addressed. Better imaging techniques are needed to delineate the penumbra (the potentially salvageable tissue surrounding the ischemic core) after an acute episode of NA-CRAO. Techniques such as high-definition optical coherence angiography combined with electrophysiology can provide valuable insights into retinal perfusion and functional integrity.  Research efforts should also seek to elucidate the detailed pathophysiological mechanisms involved in NA-CRAO. By understanding these mechanisms at a molecular level, it may become possible to identify specific targets for neuroprotective interventions beyond general strategies used in AIS.  In conclusion, there is great potential for using neuroprotection as a treatment strategy for NA-CRAO. Building upon advances made in neuroprotection research for AIS and retinal diseases such as AMD, ongoing efforts should focus on refining imaging techniques, better understanding pathophysiological mechanisms specific to NA-CRAO, and bridging the gap between preclinical studies and clinical translation. With continued exploration and innovation in this field, we may eventually improve outcomes for patients suffering from this devastating condition",continue
"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that can differentiate into various cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. They have been extensively studied for their regenerative and reparative properties, making them highly promising for cell-based therapies in various clinical settings. Despite the potential of MSCs, there are challenges that hinder their translation into regular clinical use.  One significant challenge is related to the pre-administration labelling of MSCs for tracking purposes. Traditional labelling methods involve the use of fluorescent dyes or radioactive tracers, which can have limitations such as photobleaching or radiation exposure. Additionally, these methods often require invasive procedures for cell collection and labelling.  To overcome these challenges and enable non-invasive detection of transplanted MSCs, alternative approaches using iron-related genes and proteins have been explored. Iron is an essential mineral involved in various metabolic processes in the body. It plays a critical role in oxygen transport and storage as well as cellular metabolism.  Interestingly, iron-related proteins such as ferritin (an iron-storage protein), transferrin receptor-1 (a membrane protein involved in iron uptake), and MagA (a bacterial magnetosome protein) have shown potential utility in enhancing MSC detection in vivo when overexpressed genetically. These proteins can serve as reporter genes that allow non-invasive imaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track transplanted MSCs over time.  In addition to improving detection methods, iron-related proteins have also been investigated for their therapeutic effects on MSC function. The iron chelator deferoxamine has been shown to enhance the therapeutic potential of MSCs by reducing oxidative stress and promoting tissue repair. Deferoxamine removes excess iron from cells and acts as an antioxidant.  Other iron-related proteins like haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), lipocalin-2 (LCN2), lactoferrin, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and hepcidin have also been studied for their effects on MSCs. HO-1, an enzyme involved in heme degradation, has been shown to improve MSC survival and function. LCN2 has been implicated in regulating iron homeostasis and can modulate the migration and differentiation of MSCs.  Lactoferrin, a multifunctional glycoprotein with iron-binding properties, can enhance the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs. BMP-2 is a growth factor that plays a crucial role in bone formation and has shown potential for enhancing osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Hepcidin is a regulator of iron metabolism and could potentially be used to optimize the therapeutic potential of MSCs.  Overall, integrating the fields of iron metabolism and MSC biology offers exciting possibilities for improving both detection methods and therapeutic potential. By utilizing iron-related genes as reporter genes or employing iron-related proteins to enhance therapeutic effects, researchers can overcome some of the challenges associated with translating MSC-based therapies into clinical practice.  This comprehensive review aims to inform both regenerative medicine researchers and clinicians involved in translational medicine. By providing insights into the utility of iron-related genes and proteins in facilitating MSC detection and therapy, this article can help guide the development of better methodological approaches for pre-transplantation labelling procedures as well as post-transplantation monitoring techniques. Ultimately, these advancements could contribute to improving patient outcomes by maximizing the potential benefits offered by MSC-based therapies. ",continue
"Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a critical mediator of pyroptosis, a type of programmed cell death that plays a vital role in host defense against infections and other stimuli. Pyroptosis functions by triggering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inducing cell lysis, thereby eliminating intracellular pathogens. However, dysregulated GSDMD activation has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases, highlighting its dual nature as both a protective mechanism and a potential contributor to pathology.  1.1 Pyroptosis and GSDMD Activation Pyroptosis is distinguished from other forms of cell death such as apoptosis by its distinct morphological features, including plasma membrane rupture and cellular swelling. These characteristics are largely attributed to the formation of large pores in the plasma membrane by GSDMD, leading to osmotic imbalance and eventual cell lysis.  GSDMD activation is tightly regulated through proteolytic cleavage events mediated by inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1, -4, -5, or -11. Upon sensing specific danger signals or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), these caspases are activated within multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes. The active caspases subsequently cleave GSDMD at its N-terminal domain, releasing an N-terminal fragment that contains an oligomerization domain.  1.2 Structure of GSDMD Pores The N-terminal fragment generated after caspase-mediated cleavage integrates into the plasma membrane to form large pores known as gasdermin-N domains (G-N domains). Cryo-electron microscopy studies have revealed that these pores consist of symmetric heptameric rings with hydrophilic interiors surrounded by hydrophobic residues facing lipid bilayers.  Upon pore formation, cytosolic contents are released into the extracellular space along with robust pro-inflammatory signaling cascades induced by danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and cytokines. This release of pro-inflammatory molecules contributes to the recruitment and activation of immune cells, further amplifying the inflammatory response.  2. GSDMD-Mediated Diseases Dysregulated GSDMD activation has been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its role in contributing to disease development. For instance, sepsis is characterized by an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response, and studies have shown that excessive pyroptosis mediated by GSDMD contributes to septic shock.  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has also shed light on GSDMD-mediated pathology. It has been observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis through GSDMD activation, leading to lung injury.  Additionally, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease have been associated with elevated levels of activated caspases and subsequent GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in neuronal cells. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and cancer are other examples where aberrant GSDMD activity contributes to tissue damage or tumor progression.  3. Development of GSDMD Inhibitors Given the detrimental effects of dysregulated pyroptosis mediated by GSDMD activation in various diseases, developing effective inhibitors targeting this pathway represents a promising therapeutic strategy.  Recent studies revealing the structures of caspase-GSDMD complexes have provided crucial insights into potential targets for intervention. These insights include identifying key residues involved in proteolytic cleavage events or oligomerization processes that could be targeted for drug development.  Furthermore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying how inflammasomes activate caspases offers opportunities for developing inhibitors that can interfere with inflammasome formation or downstream signaling events leading to cleavage of GSDMD.  4. Conclusion Gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis is a complex and tightly regulated process that serves as a crucial defense mechanism against infections and other stimuli. However, dysregulated GSDMD activation has emerged as a common factor in various inflammatory diseases. The study of GSDMD structure, membrane pore formation, activation pathways, and the development of inhibitors provides insights into potential therapeutic strategies for controlling these diseases.  Efforts to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning GSDMD regulation and developing inhibitors targeting this pathway hold promise for the treatment of inflammatory diseases associated with aberrant pyroptosis. Further research in this field will advance our understanding of GSDMD-mediated pathology and contribute to the development of effective therapeutics with improved outcomes for patients.",continue
"Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is a sleep disorder characterized by a delay in the timing of one's sleep and wakefulness. This delay often results in difficulties falling asleep at a desired time and waking up at the desired time, leading to fatigue, impaired concentration, and other related symptoms. DSWPD is most commonly observed during adolescence and young adulthood.  Estimates of the prevalence of DSWPD vary, but it is believed to affect around 3% of the population with little racial differences between Caucasians and Asians. The causes of DSWPD are multifactorial, involving physiological, genetic, psychological, and behavioral factors. In addition to these factors, social influences also play a role in the development of this disorder.  Recent reports have highlighted an increase in delayed sleep phase and prolonged sleep duration among young individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions. These changes raise concerns about potential mismatches between individuals' sleep-wake patterns and their social lives once these restrictions are lifted. If not addressed appropriately, this mismatch could contribute to an increased risk for developing DSWPD.  While a delay in circadian rhythms is typically seen as a key characteristic of DSWPD, recent research has revealed that approximately 40% of cases do not exhibit misalignment with objectively measured circadian rhythm markers. Instead, psychological and behavioral factors such as truancy or academic/social difficulties appear to be more strongly implicated in these cases.  Interestingly, there is also a high comorbidity between DSWPD and psychiatric disorders such as mood disorders or neurodevelopmental disorders. The relationship between these conditions appears bidirectional – they both influence each other's pathophysiology.  Individuals with DSWPD often display traits associated with high neuroticism and anxiety levels. These characteristics can exacerbate insomnia symptoms experienced by patients with this disorder.  Currently available treatment options for DSWPD are limited, primarily consisting of chronobiological approaches such as light therapy or melatonin administration. However, given the involvement of behavioral factors in this disorder, future research should explore the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral approaches as a complementary treatment option.  In conclusion, DSWPD is a sleep disorder characterized by delayed sleep and wakefulness patterns. It is prevalent during adolescence and young adulthood and can be caused by physiological, genetic, psychological, and behavioral factors. Social influences also play a role in its development. The COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions have raised concerns about potential mismatches between individuals' sleep-wake patterns and their social lives, potentially increasing the risk for developing DSWPD once these restrictions are lifted. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral approaches in addition to chronobiological interventions for treating DSWPD. 2. Physiological, Genetic, and Psychological Factors Contributing to DSWPD  The underlying physiology of DSWPD involves a delay in the circadian rhythm, the natural internal clock that regulates sleep-wake cycles. This delay can be attributed to several factors, including alterations in melatonin secretion and delayed production of the sleep-promoting hormone adenosine. Genetic factors also play a significant role in predisposing individuals to DSWPD. Studies have identified specific genetic mutations associated with circadian rhythm disturbances that contribute to the development of this disorder.  Psychological factors such as high levels of stress or anxiety can further disrupt sleep-wake patterns and exacerbate symptoms of DSWPD. The bidirectional relationship between mood disorders and DSWPD suggests that these conditions may share common underlying mechanisms contributing to their co-occurrence.  3. Social Factors Influencing Circadian Rhythm Misalignment  Social influences have a profound impact on an individual's sleep-wake patterns, particularly during adolescence and young adulthood when social activities are prioritized over maintaining regular sleep schedules. Late-night social engagements, school-related stressors, increased screen time before bed, and irregular work schedules can all contribute to circadian rhythm misalignment seen in individuals with DSWPD.  4. COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Sleep Changes among Young Individuals  The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant changes in daily routines for many individuals worldwide. Remote working or studying arrangements, reduced social interactions due to lockdown measures, and increased anxiety levels have resulted in alterations in sleep behaviors among young people.  Studies conducted during this period have reported delays in sleep onset times (e.g., later bedtime) as well as prolonged sleep durations among younger populations compared to pre-pandemic norms. These changes may be partially attributed to relaxed schedules since many individuals no longer need to adhere strictly to early morning obligations like commuting or attending physical classes.  However beneficial these temporary changes might seem for some individuals, there is concern about the potential long-term consequences. Once the pandemic-related behavioral restrictions are lifted, individuals who have adjusted their sleep schedules to match their social lives may encounter significant challenges in readjusting to a conventional sleep pattern. This shift could potentially lead to an increased risk of DSWPD development.  5. Comorbidity with Mood and Neurodevelopmental Disorders  DSWPD frequently co-occurs with mood disorders, such as depression or bipolar disorder, suggesting shared underlying mechanisms between these conditions. The disruption in sleep-wake patterns seen in individuals with DSWPD can influence mood regulation and contribute to the onset or exacerbation of mood symptoms.  Furthermore, neurodevelopmental disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often present with comorbid sleep disturbances including DSWPD. The relationship between these conditions is complex and likely involves intertwined neurological pathways responsible for regulating both circadian rhythms and neurobehavioral functioning.  6. Treatment Approaches for DSWPD  The management of DSWPD requires a multidimensional approach that addresses both physiological as well as psychological and behavioral factors contributing to the disorder(s). Chronobiological interventions such as light therapy or melatonin administration can help realign circadian rhythms and improve sleep quality.  However, given the significant impact of psychological and behavioral factors on DSWPD development, cognitive-behavioral approaches have gained importance in recent research efforts. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which combines sleep hygiene education, stimulus control techniques, relaxation strategies, and cognitive restructuring methods has shown promise in improving overall sleep quality among individuals with various sleep disorders; however its specific efficacy for DSWPD needs further investigation.  In conclusion, Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder is a complex condition influenced by physiological dysregulation of circadian rhythms along with genetic predisposition as well as psychological and social factors that lead to disruptions in sleep-wake patterns. The COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in sleep behaviors among young people highlight the importance of maintaining a balanced sleep-wake schedule and the potential risks associated with long-term circadian rhythm misalignment. Treatment approaches should encompass both chronobiological interventions and cognitive-behavioral strategies to address DSWPD comprehensively. Further research is needed to enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for this debilitating disorder.",continue
"Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent and debilitating condition that affects both men and women, but there may be sex differences in the cardiovascular outcomes of treatment with sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is). SGLT-2is have shown efficacy in reducing the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for HF in RCTs. However, a recent meta-analysis indicated that women with diabetes may experience less reduction in primary composite outcomes compared to men when treated with SGLT-2is.  In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to explore potential sex differences in primary composite outcomes among patients with HF treated with SGLT-2is. We systematically searched the medical database from 2017 to 2022 for RCTs using SGLT-2is with specified cardiovascular outcomes. The PRISMA method was utilized to screen for eligibility, and the quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We pooled the hazard ratio (HR) of primary composite outcomes in both sexes, performed a meta-analysis, and calculated the odds ratio (OR) of these outcomes based on sex.  A total of five RCTs involving 21,947 patients were included in our analysis, with 35.7% being female patients. Our findings demonstrated that both males and females taking SGLT-2is had significantly lower primary composite outcomes compared to those taking placebo (males - HR 0.77; p = 0.00001; females - HR 0.75; p =0 .00001). However, when examining pooled data from four RCTs involving 20,725 participants separately by sex, we observed a greater occurrence of primary composite outcomes among females compared to males (OR 1.32; p =0 .0002).  These results suggest that while SGLT-2is reduce the risk of primary composite outcomes in both sexes, the benefits may be less pronounced in women. The reasons for this disparity are not yet fully understood and require further investigation. It is possible that hormonal, physiological, or genetic factors could play a role in influencing the response to SGLT-2is and subsequent cardiovascular outcomes. Furthermore, differences in baseline characteristics between males and females such as age, comorbidities, or medication regimens may also contribute to divergent treatment effects.  Understanding these sex differences is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving outcomes for all patients with HF. Subgroup analyses based on sex are valuable tools in identifying potential disparities and tailoring interventions accordingly. Future research should explore the underlying mechanisms behind these observed differences to inform more personalized approaches to therapy.  In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that SGLT-2is reduce the risk of primary composite outcomes in both male and female patients with HF; however, women may experience less pronounced benefits compared to men. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the reasons behind these sex differences and develop targeted interventions that address any identified disparities. Ultimately, improving cardiovascular outcomes for all patients with HF remains a paramount goal of clinical practice and research endeavors.  Additionally, it's worth noting that sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes have been observed in various other medication classes and disease conditions. These differences highlight the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in clinical trial design, analysis, and reporting.  Several potential mechanisms could contribute to the observed disparities in primary composite outcomes between men and women treated with SGLT-2is. One possibility is that hormonal factors may influence the response to treatment. Estrogen, for example, has known cardioprotective effects and may play a role in modulating the therapeutic effects of SGLT-2is. Further investigation into the interaction between hormonal status and SGLT-2i therapy could provide valuable insights into these sex differences.  Physiological differences between men and women could also contribute to varying treatment responses. For instance, there are known anatomical and functional variations in cardiac structure between sexes that may affect how individuals respond to interventions targeting heart failure. Additionally, differences in body composition (such as higher adiposity levels in women) or metabolic pathways could impact drug metabolism and efficacy.  Genetic factors might also play a role in mediating sex-specific responses to SGLT-2i therapy. Variations in genes involved in glucose metabolism or drug transporters/receptors may underlie some of these observed discrepancies. Exploring pharmacogenomic profiles among individuals receiving SGLT-2is could help identify genetic determinants associated with sex-specific treatment responses.  Furthermore, baseline characteristics such as age, comorbidities, or concomitant medications might interact differently with SGLT-2i therapy based on sex. It is possible that differing clinical profiles or prevalent conditions (such as diabetes) among male and female participants influenced their response to treatment with SGLT-2is.  To fully understand these complex relationships, future studies should consider conducting large-scale trials specifically powered for exploring sex differences within HF populations receiving SGLT-2i therapy. Such trials should include detailed assessment of hormonal, physiological, and genetic factors, as well as rigorous monitoring of concomitant medications and comorbidities.  Clinicians should be aware of these sex differences when prescribing SGLT-2is to patients with heart failure. Individualized treatment approaches that consider patient sex, along with other relevant clinical factors, may help optimize outcomes. Additionally, ongoing monitoring and evaluation of treatment responses in both men and women can inform adjustments to therapy if needed.  In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence for potential sex differences in cardiovascular outcomes among patients with heart failure treated with SGLT-2is. While the overall benefits in reducing primary composite outcomes are observed in both sexes, the magnitude of these benefits appears to be less pronounced in women. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these disparities and ultimately improve the care provided to all patients with heart failure. By considering sex as a biological variable in future clinical trials and incorporating personalized approaches into clinical practice, we can strive towards achieving equitable cardiovascular outcomes for all individuals affected by heart failure.",continue
"The study of phylogeography, the genetic variation and distribution of species over space and time, is crucial for understanding the evolutionary history and population dynamics of marine organisms. In particular, sharks and rays have attracted much attention due to their vulnerability to anthropogenic stressors and their importance in marine ecosystems. These animals possess a unique set of life history traits that make them more susceptible to human impacts, including late maturity, low fecundity, and slow growth rates.  Given the conservation concern surrounding sharks and rays globally, it is important to understand their genetic diversity and structure across different geographic regions. This knowledge can inform management strategies for these species, particularly as they face increasing threats from overfishing, habitat degradation, pollution, climate change.  In this review paper, we examined the existing data on the phylogeography of 40 shark species belonging to 17 genera and 19 ray species belonging to 11 genera. We focused on analyzing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from the cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI), a commonly used marker for studying population genetics in marine organisms.  We constructed median joining haplotype networks for each species using COI sequences from individuals sampled across their global range. These networks provide insights into patterns of genetic variation within each species by depicting relationships between different haplotypes.  Our analysis revealed several interesting findings regarding shark and ray phylogeography. First, we observed very shallow coalescence in most species' haplotype networks; similar patterns have been reported previously for other marine teleosts. This suggests recent population expansions or high levels of gene flow among populations.  Secondly, we found that star topologies were predominant among sharks while complex mutational topologies were more common among rays. We attribute this difference to differences in dispersal abilities during early life stages; rays are known to have extremely limited dispersal capabilities compared to some shark species.  Moreover, we observed variations in population structuring among species groups, which can be attributed to differences in life history traits. For instance, species that exhibit reproductive philopatry (returning to the same location to reproduce) or site fidelity showed higher levels of genetic structure when compared to migratory or pelagic species. Additionally, reef-associated and demersal (bottom-dwelling) species exhibited higher levels of genetic structure than pelagic and semi-pelagic species.  Finally, our analysis also revealed some broad patterns that can guide management and conservation strategies for sharks and rays. Pelagic and semi-pelagic species showed lower levels of genetic structure between and within ocean basins compared to other groups. This suggests higher gene flow among populations of these open-ocean dwelling species, which may have implications for their management as well as the design of marine protected areas.  Overall, our review provides valuable insights into the phylogeography of sharks and rays across different geographic regions. It highlights the importance of considering life history traits in understanding patterns of genetic diversity and structure in these vulnerable marine creatures. This knowledge can inform conservation efforts aimed at protecting these animals from ongoing threats such as overfishing, habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.  In conclusion, further research is needed to fill gaps in our understanding regarding how different factors such as current patterns, historical barriers or ecological preferences shape the phylogeography of sharks & rays., With this study we hope to contribute towards better global management plans for this highly important key predator group on Earth's oceans",continue
"Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) devices are rapidly evolving as a promising tool for studying human physiology and disease in a more realistic and controlled manner compared to traditional 2D cell cultures. These 3D cell culture systems aim to replicate the complex microenvironment of human organs by integrating various cell types, such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and immune cells, within a microfluidic platform. OOC devices have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to recapitulate physiological functions of specific organs, offering potential applications in drug discovery, personalized medicine, and toxicology assessments.  Despite the numerous advantages of OOC models, there is a major challenge associated with these platforms - the lack of online analysis methods that enable real-time monitoring of cellular responses. Real-time analysis is crucial for understanding the dynamic behavior of cells within these complex systems. Traditional techniques used for analyzing cell culture media or supernatants often require sample collection at predetermined time points followed by offline analysis using techniques such as chromatography or immunoassays. However, this approach limits temporal resolution and fails to capture rapid changes occurring within the system.  Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful analytical technique that can overcome these limitations by enabling real-time monitoring of cell excretes from OOC models. MS offers high sensitivity and selectivity along with the potential to identify a wide range of analytes including metabolites, lipids, peptides, and proteins. However, connecting an OOC device directly to MS poses certain challenges mainly due to the nature of the media used in these devices.  The media commonly used in OOC devices contain nonvolatile buffers or additives that interfere with MS analysis. These nonvolatile compounds can cause ion suppression effects and affect ionization efficiency during MS analysis leading to decreased sensitivity or inaccurate quantification results. Additionally, continuous perfusion-based operation necessary for maintaining physiological conditions can dilute analytes present in low concentrations, making their detection challenging.  To overcome these challenges, several technological advances have been developed to enable the hyphenation of OOC devices with MS. These advancements primarily focus on sample pre-treatment strategies that allow for the removal or exchange of nonvolatile compounds to ensure compatibility with MS analysis. Various techniques such as liquid-liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction, and flow injection analysis have been explored and optimized to efficiently remove interfering compounds from OOC media prior to MS analysis.  Liquid chromatography (LC) has also been integrated into the workflow to further enhance separation and improve sensitivity in OOC-MS setups. LC allows for the efficient separation of analytes based on their physicochemical properties before introducing them into the mass spectrometer. The use of miniaturized LC systems or chip-based chromatography offers greater flexibility in integrating with microfluidic platforms and enhances compatibility between OOC devices and MS instruments.  In addition to sample pre-treatment strategies, advancements in microfluidic interfacing techniques have facilitated seamless connection between OOC devices and MS instruments. Microscale interfaces are designed to minimize volume loss during transfer from OOC outlets to MS inlet while maintaining low dead volumes that could lead to sample mixing or contamination.  Despite these technological advances, there are still some limitations that need to be addressed for successful hyphenation of OOC devices with MS. One major challenge is achieving high spatial resolution within the confined dimensions of microchannels while simultaneously maintaining continuous flow needed for real-time monitoring. Additionally, optimal integration of sensor technologies within microfluidic platforms would enable simultaneous monitoring of multiple analytes during experiments.  In conclusion, mass spectrometry represents a promising analytical technique for real-time analysis in organ-on-a-chip models due to its high sensitivity and selectivity. Overcoming challenges associated with nonvolatile compounds present in media used by these devices is essential for successful hyphenation with MS instruments. Technological advancements in sample pre-treatment strategies, integration of miniaturized LC systems, and microfluidic interfacing techniques have greatly contributed to the progress in this field. Further research and development efforts are needed to address the remaining challenges and realize the full potential of OOC-MS platforms for studying human physiology and disease at the cellular level.",continue
"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels and associated with various clinical symptoms. It is a major health concern worldwide, affecting millions of people. The current standard treatment for T2D includes lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and physical exercise, along with medication therapy. Metformin, an oral antidiabetic drug, is commonly used as the first-line treatment for T2D due to its effectiveness in reducing blood glucose levels.  Jinlida granules are a traditional Chinese medicine formulation that has been used for many years in the management of T2D. Previous studies have shown that Jinlida granules can significantly reduce blood glucose levels when used alone or in combination with metformin. Furthermore, it has been found that Jinlida granules enhance the low-glucose action of metformin. However, there is limited research on the role of Jinlida granules in improving the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and relieving clinical symptoms in T2D patients.  In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Jinlida granules in improving the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and relieving clinical symptoms based on secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. The trial included 192 T2D patients who were randomly assigned to receive either Jinlida or a placebo for 12 weeks.  The primary outcome measure was the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose defined as HbA1c < 6.5% and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2hPG) < 10 mmol/L or <11.1 mmol/L depending on guidelines. Secondary outcome measures included symptom disappearance rate, symptom improvement rate, efficacy of single symptoms, and total symptom score.  After 12 weeks of intervention, compared to the control group receiving placebo, the group receiving Jinlida showed statistically significant differences in achieving the standard-reaching rate of HbA1c < 6.5% and 2hPG levels as mentioned above. However, there were no significant differences in achieving the standard-reaching rate of HbA1c < 7% and fasting blood glucose (FBG) < 7.0 mmol/L between the two groups.  In terms of clinical symptoms, five symptoms (thirst, fatigue, increased eating with rapid hungering, polyuria, dry mouth) exhibited a significant difference in symptom disappearance rate between the Jinlida group and control group. All symptoms showed a significant difference in symptom improvement rate.  The analysis also revealed that there was a statistically significant improvement in total symptom score from baseline to week 12 for patients receiving Jinlida compared to those receiving placebo. This suggests that Jinlida granules can effectively improve multiple clinical symptoms associated with T2D.  It is important to note that this study did not find any significant correlation between symptom improvement and changes in HbA1c levels after 12 weeks of intervention with Jinlida granules or placebo. This suggests that the improvement in clinical symptoms may be independent of blood glucose control mediated by HbA1c levels.  In conclusion, our findings indicate that Jinlida granules can effectively improve the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and relieve clinical symptoms associated with T2D. The improvements were observed for various symptoms including thirst, fatigue, increased eating with rapid hungering, polyuria, dry mouth, spontaneous sweating, night sweat,vexing heat in the chest,palms,and soles,constipation indicating its potential as an adjuvant treatment for T2D patients experiencing these specific symptoms.Therefore,Jinlida granules can be considered as an effective complementary therapy option for T2D patients who present such clinical manifestations. Overall,this study provides valuable insights into the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine interventions like Jinlida granules in the management of T2D and its associated symptoms. Further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms underlying these effects and evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Jinlida granules in a larger population.",continue
"Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe headache, often accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. It affects approximately 10-15% of the population worldwide and can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life.  The management of migraine typically includes medication for acute relief and prevention, but there is growing evidence suggesting that exercise may also play a role in its treatment. Exercise has been shown to have both physical and psychological benefits, including the reduction of pain intensity and frequency, improvement in mood, stress reduction, and enhancement of overall well-being.  This clinical practice guideline aims to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding exercise prescription for patients with migraine. The guideline was developed following rigorous methodology recommended by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE). The quality of evidence was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria.  A systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant scientific studies on exercise intervention in patients with migraine. The identified studies were then critically appraised using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to determine their quality.  Based on the evaluation of current evidence, several types of exercises were found to be beneficial for patients with migraine. Aerobic exercise was found to have a B grade recommendation for improving symptoms, disability, and quality of life in migraine patients. This includes activities such as walking or jogging at moderate intensity for at least 30 minutes per day.  Moderate-continuous aerobic exercise also received a B grade recommendation for its effectiveness in reducing symptoms and disability associated with migraines. This involves maintaining a moderate level of intensity throughout one's workout session without any breaks or periods of rest.  Yoga was another form of exercise that received a B grade recommendation. Yoga combines physical postures with breathing techniques and meditation practices which can help reduce stress levels associated with migraines.  In addition to specific types of exercise, lifestyle recommendations were also recommended for migraine patients. These include maintaining a regular sleep pattern, avoiding triggers such as certain foods or drinks, managing stress levels through relaxation techniques, and ensuring proper hydration.  Other forms of exercise such as relaxation techniques, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), low-intensity continuous aerobic exercise, Tai Chi, and resistance exercise obtained a C grade recommendation. While they may not have the same level of evidence as the B grade recommendations, they still show promise in improving migraine symptoms and disability.  It is important for healthcare professionals to consider these exercise recommendations when developing treatment plans for patients with migraines. However, it is also crucial to individualize the prescription based on each patient's specific needs and abilities.  In conclusion, this evidence-based clinical practice guideline provides healthcare professionals with valuable recommendations regarding exercise prescription for patients with migraines. Implementing these guidelines into clinical practice can help improve symptoms, reduce disability, and enhance the overall quality of life for individuals living with migraines. Further research is needed to continue expanding our understanding of the role of exercise in migraine management and to refine these guidelines accordingly.  The online version of this guideline contains supplementary material that can further support healthcare professionals in their implementation of these recommendations.",continue
"The gut microbiome, which refers to the trillions of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, has gained considerable attention in recent years due to its potential impact on human health. It has been implicated in various physiological processes, such as digestion, immune function, and metabolism. Additionally, alterations in the gut microbiome have been associated with a range of diseases including obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain autoimmune conditions.  One factor that may influence the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome is vitamin D. Observational studies have indicated a link between vitamin D levels and microbial diversity in the gut; however, there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials investigating this relationship.  The D-Health Trial sought to address this gap by examining the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the gut microbiome in older Australians. The trial recruited 21,315 participants between ages 60-84 years and randomly assigned them to receive either a monthly dose of 60,000 IU of vitamin D3 or placebo for a duration of five years. Stool samples were collected approximately five years after randomization from 835 participants (417 placebo group and 418 vitamin D group).  To characterize the gut microbiome composition, researchers employed 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This technique allows for identification and classification of different bacterial taxa present within stool samples. Alpha diversity indices (Shannon index as primary outcome measure), which reflect microbial richness and evenness within individual samples, were compared between groups using linear regression analysis.  Interestingly, there were no significant differences observed between participants receiving vitamin D supplementation compared to those receiving placebo regarding alpha diversity measures such as Shannon index (mean values: 3.51 vs 3.52 for placebo vs vitamin D groups respectively). Furthermore,, other alpha diversity indices including richness and inverse Simpson index showed minimal variation between both groups.  In addition to evaluating alpha diversity measures , researchers investigated beta-diversity using principal coordinate analysis based on Bray Curtis distance and UniFrac index. These analyses compare microbial community composition between samples. However, no significant clustering or separation was observed according to randomization group.  Furthermore, the study examined the abundance of different bacterial taxa between participants receiving vitamin D supplementation versus placebo. Negative binomial regression models were employed to analyze these differences while adjusting for multiple testing. Surprisingly, there was no notable difference in the abundance of the 20 most abundant genera between groups.  Of note,, previous studies have suggested that alterations in the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio may be associated with several diseases and conditions including obesity. However, no significant difference was observed in this ratio between participants receiving vitamin D supplementation versus placebo.  In summary, the results from the D-Health Trial indicate that monthly doses of 60,000 IU of vitamin D3 supplementation for five years did not significantly alter the composition or diversity of the gut microbiome in older Australians aged 60-84 years old. These findings are noteworthy as they add to our understanding of potential factors influencing gut microbiome composition and provide valuable insights into human health outcomes associated with vitamin D supplementation.  Despite not finding a significant effect on gut microbiome composition and diversity in this trial, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations. Firstly,the analyses were based on stool samples collected at a single time point approximately five years after randomization , therefore longer-term studies may reveal different results.. Moreover,differences according to age,genderr or ethnicity could also be considered.. Future research should explore other factors that may influence gut microbiome such as diet,prescription medications,and underlying health conditions.. In conclusion,the current evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation at this dose does not significantly impact gut microbial diversity among older Australians.However further studies are warranted to fully elucidate whether other forms,doses or durations are more influential.and explore any associations with specific health outcomes",continue
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex, lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviors. It affects individuals from early childhood and can have a profound impact on their lives and the lives of their families. Currently, there is no known cure for ASD, and treatment options are limited to managing symptoms.  Over the years, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies have gained attention as potential treatments for ASD. Among these therapies, acupuncture has shown promise in improving symptoms associated with ASD. Acupuncture is an ancient practice rooted in traditional Chinese medicine that involves the insertion of thin needles at specific points on the body to stimulate healing.  However, despite its potential benefits, acupuncture has not yet been widely recognized as a preferred CAM therapy for ASD. In order to evaluate the current research status of acupuncture for ASD and explore its prospects, we conducted an analysis of clinical study reports published in the past 15 years.  The analysis focused on various aspects of these studies including study subjects, group settings, intervention modalities, acupoint selection, outcome evaluation measures used, and safety considerations. The goal was to determine if there was sufficient evidence to support the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture in treating ASD.  Based on our comprehensive analysis of existing studies conducted so far, it became evident that there were limitations in terms of sample sizes and methodological rigor. While initial evidence suggested possible effectiveness of acupuncture in improving certain aspects related to ASD symptoms such as communication skills or sensory-motor behaviors improvement have been reported but were not consistently replicated across different studies.  In order to reach firm conclusions about its efficacy regarding treatment for children with autism spectrum disorders more high-quality research is required with meticulous adherence towards reporting interventions following STRICTA guidelines which will help standardize reporting requirements when conducting trials involving acupuncture   Additionally CONSORT guidelines will help identify key components such as having control groups comparative interventions , randomization techniques allocation concealment , blinding which contribute in maintaining rigor and robustness in any clinical trial .  Furthermore, to truly understand the mechanisms through which acupuncture could benefit individuals with ASD, it is important to include functional experiments that explore the effect of acupuncture on brain functioning and neurophysiology.  The significance of this review lies in its aim to provide a reference for researchers interested in conducting high-quality clinical trials involving acupuncture as a treatment for ASD. By considering the combination of modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine principles, it will be possible to design studies that are scientifically rigorous and produce reliable results.  In conclusion, while there is currently limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for ASD, there is potential for future research to further explore its benefits. It is important for future studies to adhere to established guidelines such as STRICTA and CONSORT and include functional experiments that investigate its underlying mechanisms. This will help increase our understanding of acupuncture's potential role in improving symptoms associated with ASD and guide more effective treatment approaches.",continue
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major global health issue, ranking as the third most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of death among different populations. It is estimated that CRC accounts for approximately 10% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases with high mortality rates. Despite significant advancements in early detection and treatment approaches, the complex nature of colorectal tumorigenesis necessitates further research to better understand its underlying mechanisms.  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as promising molecules linked to various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, protein production, and cellular signaling pathways. An increasing body of evidence has implicated lncRNAs in contributing to aberrant gene expression patterns under pathological conditions such as cancer.  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism – processes that are deregulated in cancers, including CRC. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling has been shown to be associated with tumor initiation and progression. Therefore, investigating the interactions between lncRNAs and mTOR may provide valuable insights into molecular mechanisms driving CRC development.  To comprehensively evaluate existing knowledge on the role of lncRNA-mediated modulation of mTOR in CRC tumorigenesis, we conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched seven databases for relevant articles related to lncRNA-mTOR interactions in CRC.  After screening 200 entries against our inclusion criteria based on title/abstract review followed by full-text assessment, 24 studies were deemed eligible for subsequent analysis. These studies collectively identified 23 specific lncRNAs that were associated with dysregulated mTOR signaling in CRC samples.  Interestingly, these identified lncRNAs exhibited differential expression patterns: 79.16% were up-regulated while 20.84% showed down-regulation in CRC tissues. This suggests that lncRNAs can act as both positive and negative regulators of the mTOR pathway during CRC tumorigenesis.  The potential mechanistic roles of the differentially expressed lncRNAs in modulating mTOR signaling include direct interaction with mTOR, influencing its upstream or downstream effectors, or targeting other proteins involved in the regulation of this pathway. These findings highlight the importance of considering lncRNA-mTOR interactions as potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers for CRC.  Understanding the dynamic nature of mTOR activity and its correlation with specific lncRNAs can have significant implications for developing novel molecular therapeutics and personalized treatment strategies. Targeting dysregulated lncRNA-mTOR interactions might offer new opportunities to restore normal cell functions, inhibit tumor growth, and sensitize cancer cells to existing therapies.  In conclusion, this systematic review sheds light on the growing body of evidence supporting a link between dysregulated lncRNA expression and mTOR signaling in CRC tumorigenesis. The identification of specific lncRNAs associated with abnormal mTOR activity provides valuable insights into potential areas for further investigation. Harnessing this knowledge may ultimately lead to the development of innovative diagnostic tools, prognostic markers, and targeted therapies to improve outcomes for patients with colorectal cancer. Furthermore, this systematic review highlights the need for further studies to elucidate the functional roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of the identified lncRNAs in CRC. Several studies have provided evidence suggesting that specific lncRNAs can modulate mTOR signaling by interacting with key components of the pathway.  For example, one study identified a lncRNA called ROR (Regulator of Reprogramming), which was found to be up-regulated in CRC tissues. ROR was shown to interact directly with mTOR and enhance its activation, leading to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth. Conversely, another study demonstrated that a lncRNA known as TUG1 (Taurine Upregulated Gene 1) acted as a negative regulator of mTOR signaling in CRC cells. TUG1 suppressed mTOR activation by sequestering an upstream activator of mTOR.  Moreover, some studies highlighted the influence of dysregulated lncRNAs on other signaling pathways known to intersect with the mTOR pathway. For instance, HOTAIR (HOX transcript antisense RNA), an oncogenic lncRNA up-regulated in CRC, was found to promote tumor growth through activation of both the mTOR pathway and Wnt/β-catenin pathway.  Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs may contribute to chemotherapy resistance by affecting mTOR-related cellular processes such as autophagy. Several studies have reported altered expression levels of specific lncRNAs associated with autophagy regulation in drug-resistant CRC cells.  Although this systematic review provides valuable insights into the association between dysregulated lncRNAs and abnormal mT",continue
"Obesity is a significant public health issue worldwide, with its prevalence increasing rapidly in recent years. It is a complex chronic disease that arises from a combination of genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Lifestyle factors such as sedentary behavior and unhealthy eating habits play a significant role in the development and progression of obesity.  The treatment of obesity requires a multidisciplinary approach, with nutrition therapy being an essential component. The main goal of nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity is to promote sustained weight loss while addressing the individual's overall health. This involves making long-term lifestyle changes that focus on healthy eating patterns, regular physical activity, psychological interventions, and potentially pharmacological or surgical interventions.  A key aspect of nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity is identifying the underlying dietary causes associated with excess weight. High consumption of ultraprocessed foods, which are typically high in fats, sugars, and energy density; large portion sizes; and low intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains have all been linked to weight gain.  Unfortunately, there are numerous misleading fad diets circulating that promise quick solutions to weight loss but lack scientific support. Some individuals may be drawn to these diets due to their belief in superfoods or the use of teas or herbal supplements claiming miraculous weight loss effects. Additionally alarming trends include avoiding entire food groups such as carbohydrates.  In contrast to these fad diets unsupported by scientific evidence or literature., international guidelines recommend adopting dietary patterns that include whole grains, lean proteins (such as meats), low-fat dairy products (including milk), fruits, vegetables while maintaining an energy deficit for sustainable weight loss outcomes.  Importantly behavior change strategies need equal emphasis alongside dietary interventions including motivational interviewing techniques aimed at encouraging individuals' self-efficacy regarding their ability to make positive changes through addressing intrinsic motivation(s) leading towards achieving desired goals– targeting optimal body mass index levels compatible with good health.  In developing this position statement on nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity, the Nutrition Department of the Brazilian Association for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (ABESO) drew upon rigorous analysis of randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses in relation to different nutritional interventions for weight loss.

"The concept of the demographic dividend refers to the potential economic benefits that can be achieved when a country experiences a shift in its age structure, resulting in a larger proportion of working-age individuals relative to dependents. This shift can create a favorable policy environment for economic growth and development if countries adopt appropriate policies and investments to harness the potential of their youthful population.  In this study, we focused on two pre-dividend African nations: Nigeria and Tanzania. These countries were identified by the World Bank as having significant potential for reaping the benefits of the demographic dividend in the coming years. Our aim was to review national policies in these countries and assess their readiness to capitalize on changing demographics and maximize the demographic dividend.  We conducted an extensive review of 18 national policy documents across five key sectors: Family Planning, Maternal and Child Health, Education, Women’s Empowerment, and Labor Market. These sectors were identified based on the Gates Institute Demographic Dividend Framework, which provides guidance on targeted policies for accelerating the demographic dividend based on a country's specific demographic structure.  Our findings revealed persistent gaps in policies targeting family planning in both Nigeria and Tanzania. While some efforts have been made to address maternal and child health, education, women’s empowerment, and labor market issues, there is still room for improvement in terms of specificity and measurability of these policies.  Specifically, we recommend that both Nigeria and Tanzania consider implementing policy amendments that prioritize accessible family planning services and information. This would help ensure that individuals are able to make informed decisions about their reproductive health while also reducing fertility rates to align with changing demographics.  Additionally, there is a need for more comprehensive policies addressing maternal health outcomes such as reducing maternal mortality rates through improved access to skilled healthcare providers during pregnancy or childbirth. Both countries could also benefit from increasing investments in education systems that provide quality education opportunities for all children regardless of gender or socioeconomic background.  Furthermore,the empowerment of women should be prioritized through policies that aim to promote gender equality, increase women's access to economic opportunities, and ensure their representation in decision-making processes.  Lastly, we emphasize the importance of designing measurable policy initiatives across all sectors. This would allow for better monitoring and evaluation of policy effectiveness and enable policymakers to make informed decisions based on evidence.  In conclusion, as Nigeria, Tanzania, and other pre-dividend nations continue to experience rapid demographic changes, it is crucial for them to review and strengthen their national policies across the five key sectors identified in this study. By doing so, these countries can fully harness the potential of their youthful population and maximize the socioeconomic benefits associated with the demographic dividend. Routine policy reviews should be implemented to ensure that policies remain relevant and responsive to changing demographics. It is our hope that this study provides valuable insights for policymakers in Nigeria,Tanzania,and beyond as they navigate the path towards achieving sustainable development through effective policy interventions. 2. Methodology  To conduct this study, we collaborated with local partners in Nigeria and Tanzania to gather and review national policy documents across the five key sectors mentioned earlier. Our review focused on the policies and strategies outlined in these documents, assessing their alignment with the objectives of maximizing the demographic dividend.  We used a comprehensive list of indicators for each sector, which were defined through a systematic literature review. These indicators helped us assess the specificity and measurability of national policies in each country. We also considered the extent to which these policies addressed the unique challenges and opportunities presented by changing demographic structures.  The identified indicators allowed us to examine various dimensions within each sector. For example, under family planning, we looked at indicators such as accessibility of contraceptives, availability of information on contraceptive methods, and integration of family planning services into other healthcare systems.  Similarly, within maternal and child health, our assessment included indicators like antenatal care coverage rates, skilled birth attendance rates, immunization coverage rates for children under 1 year old,and neonatal mortality rates.These multidimensional assessments helped us gain a comprehensive understanding of the policy landscape in both Nigeria and Tanzania.  3.Results  In our analysis of national policies across both countries,nearly all policy documents acknowledged the importanceof harnessing their growing youth population for economic development.However,the level ofsensitivityand specificity towardsleveragingthedemographicdividendvariedacrosssectors.Forinstance,intheareafamilyplanningpolicieswere often general aspirational statements that lacked concrete strategies or measurable targets.Itwas apparentrthatt herewassignificant roomforenhancing policy interventionsinthisfieldwithadirectfocusonimprovingaccessibil ityoftamilyplanningservices,increasingawarenessaboutcontraceptiveoptions,andempowering individualsbyprovidingthemwithnecessarinformationlcounsellingtoguidetheirmahedeFWecommendthat policymakersreviewexistingfamilyplanningpoliciesandamendthemtospecificallytargetthesegoalsinordertoachievebetteroutcomesandanacceleratedemographicdividend.  Similarly, in the area of maternal and child health,policies were found to be more comprehensive, but there were still areas for improvement.

"Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease that primarily affects premature infants, with a mortality rate ranging from 20% to 50%. It is characterized by necrosis and inflammation of the intestine, leading to bowel perforation and systemic sepsis. NEC remains an urgent clinical problem due to its high incidence, lack of early diagnostic tools, and uncertain pathophysiology. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have opened up new opportunities for improving the understanding and management of this complex disease.  AI refers to the simulation of intelligent behavior in machines, while ML focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn automatically from data. By harnessing these technologies, researchers have been able to identify patterns, extract meaningful information from large datasets, and make accurate predictions.  In the context of NEC research, AI has been employed in various aspects including diagnosis prediction and prognosis assessment. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving outcomes for NEC patients. Researchers have developed ML models that utilize clinical parameters such as gestational age at birth, birth weight, hematological measures, radiographic findings, and clinical symptoms to predict which infants are at higher risk of developing NEC. These models can assist clinicians in identifying vulnerable patients earlier and initiating timely interventions.  Once NEC is diagnosed or suspected clinically or radiographically by healthcare professionals through empirical evidence gathered on patient history taking physical examination abdominal x-ray ultrasonography or computed tomography researchers also employ AI techniques for prognosis prediction. Numerous predictive models have been developed using ML algorithms on variables such as laboratory values (e.g., complete blood count), clinical parameters (e.g., heart rate variability), imaging findings (e.g., air-fluid levels), treatment modalities (e.g., surgical interventions), comorbid conditions (e.g., sepsis), or a combination thereof.  In addition to diagnosis prediction and prognosis assessment studies researchers are exploring biomarkers associated with NEC to further improve its diagnosis and management. AI techniques enable the identification of potential biomarkers that can help in early disease detection, prognostic assessment, or monitoring treatment response. For instance, ML algorithms have been applied to gene expression profiling data to identify gene signatures associated with the development and progression of NEC. These identified biomarkers could enhance our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and potentially guide therapeutic interventions.  Moreover, AI has enabled researchers to evaluate various treatment modalities for NEC. By analyzing vast amounts of data from clinical trials or retrospective studies, ML algorithms can find patterns and correlations between treatment strategies and patient outcomes. This information can aid in determining which therapies are more effective or identifying factors that influence treatment response.  Despite the promising advancements in AI and ML research within the field of NEC, there are still limitations that need to be addressed. Firstly, data availability is a crucial factor as machine learning models rely heavily on high-quality datasets for training purposes. However, acquiring large-scale datasets specific to NEC poses several challenges due to its low incidence rate compared to other diseases.  Furthermore, interpretability and generalizability remain major concerns when implementing AI models in healthcare settings. The black-box nature of some ML algorithms makes it difficult for clinicians to comprehend how decisions are made by these models which hinders their acceptance among medical professionals.  In conclusion, AI and ML techniques hold great promise for advancing our knowledge about neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis by improving early diagnosis prediction, prognosis assessment biomarker identification,and treatment evaluation approaches As technology continues evolving creating opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations will greatly assist healthcare professionals researchers in developing robust models that can support decision-making processes ultimately improving outcomes for infants affected by this devastating condition.

"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly prevalent and aggressive form of cancer that affects the digestive tract. It poses a significant burden on healthcare systems, particularly in areas with high incidence rates. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates. Endoscopic screening is currently the most effective method for early detection of ESCC.  However, the accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis largely depends on the expertise of the endoscopist. Due to variations in professional skills among practitioners, there are still many cases where lesions go unrecognized, resulting in missed diagnoses. This highlights the need for auxiliary methods that can enhance endoscopic diagnosis capabilities.  Recent advancements in medical imaging and video evaluation technology based on deep machine learning have provided an opportunity for significant progress in this area. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, specifically convolution neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in extracting key features from input image data and accurately classifying images.  CNNs have been widely used in medical image classification tasks and have demonstrated improved accuracy compared to traditional methods. In the context of ESCC diagnosis, AI-assisted systems can leverage their excellent image recognition abilities to aid endoscopists in detecting lesions more accurately and reduce missed diagnoses during endoscopic examinations.  These AI systems are trained on large datasets consisting of images from various imaging modalities such as white light endoscopy, narrow-band imaging, autofluorescence imaging, or confocal laser endomicroscopy. By learning patterns from these datasets through supervised training processes, AI algorithms can identify abnormal tissue characteristics associated with early ESCC more reliably than human observers alone.  Additionally, AI models can predict invasion depth based on these detected abnormalities with remarkable accuracy. This information helps guide appropriate treatment decisions by determining whether surgical resection or less invasive therapies like mucosal resection or photodynamic therapy is necessary.  Despite its potential benefits, there are some limitations to be addressed before widespread implementation of AI-assisted diagnosis in clinical practice. One concern is the selective bias present in the training datasets used to develop AI systems. These datasets often consist of cases already diagnosed by experts, potentially leading to overfitting and poor generalizability to real-world scenarios.  To overcome this limitation, efforts are being made to create more diverse and representative datasets that encompass a wider range of disease presentations. Furthermore, ongoing research is focusing on developing personalized AI models that can adapt to individual patient characteristics and account for inter-patient variations.  In conclusion, AI-assisted diagnosis has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing endoscopic detection and diagnosis of early ESCC. The powerful image recognition abilities of CNN-based AI algorithms enable more accurate identification of abnormal tissue characteristics associated with early-stage ESCC and prediction of invasion depth. As further advancements are made in this field, addressing the limitations regarding dataset bias will be critical in ensuring the broad applicability and effectiveness of these AI systems in clinical settings. By improving diagnostic accuracy, these technologies have the potential to significantly reduce missed diagnoses and improve patient outcomes in areas with high incidence rates. ",continue
"Stem cells play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of living organisms. These unique cells have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into various cell types, making them important in organ development, tissue repair, and regeneration. The fate and function of stem cells are tightly regulated by various molecular mechanisms, including RNA editing.  RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification process that alters the nucleotide sequence of RNA molecules. One key enzyme involved in this process is adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). ADAR1 catalyzes the conversion of adenosine to inosine within double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates. Inosine is read as guanosine by cellular machinery, resulting in altered protein coding potential or regulation of gene expression.  ADAR1 is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in numerous physiological processes such as embryonic development, cell differentiation, immune regulation, and even gene editing technologies. The diverse functions of ADAR1 highlight its importance as a regulator of stem cell fate and function.  Studies have revealed that ADAR1-mediated RNA editing plays a critical role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency and facilitating their differentiation into distinct lineages. For example, during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, ADAR1 regulates the switch between pluripotency-associated factors and lineage-specific genes by modulating mRNA stability or alternative splicing events through its editing activity.  Furthermore, ADAR1 has been shown to mediate lineage commitment decisions during hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. It promotes myeloid lineage specification while suppressing lymphoid lineage markers through targeted RNA editing events. This suggests an essential role for ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in dictating hematopoietic stem cell fate decisions.  In addition to normal tissue homeostasis and development-related functions, dysregulated ADAR-mediated RNA editing has been implicated in cancer stem cell biology. Cancer stem cells are a subset of tumor cells with self-renewal capacity and the ability to initiate tumor growth and metastasis. ADAR1 has been shown to be upregulated in various cancers, including glioblastoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.  The aberrant expression of ADAR1 in cancer stem cells leads to perturbed RNA editing patterns and altered gene expression profiles critical for tumorigenesis, drug resistance, and metastasis. Targeting ADAR1 using specific inhibitors or genetic knockdown approaches has shown promise as a potential therapeutic strategy to selectively eliminate cancer stem cells or sensitize them to conventional therapies.  ADAR1 not only influences stem cell fate decisions through its editing activity but also plays crucial roles through non-editing functions. For instance, it interacts with various RNA binding proteins that regulate alternative splicing events or mRNA stability during development and differentiation processes. Further understanding of these non-editing functions will provide more insight into the mechanisms by which ADAR1 controls stem cell fate choices.  In conclusion, the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 plays a vital role in regulating stem cell fate and function by mediating both editing-dependent and non-editing-dependent mechanisms. Its multifunctionality makes it an essential player in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis maintenance, immune response regulation as well as malignant transformation processes such as cancer initiation and progression.  Given its emerging significance in normal and dysregulated stem cell contexts, targeting ADAR1 holds great therapeutic potential for a variety of diseases ranging from developmental disorders to various types of cancers where modulating or eliminating specific subsets of stem cells is desired. Further research into the intricacies of ADAR1-mediated functions within different cellular contexts will undoubtedly uncover additional insights into this fascinating field.",continue
"Critical thinking is a fundamental skill that is crucial for individuals' development and success in the twenty-first century. It is the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information in order to make reasoned judgments and decisions. In the context of education, critical thinking is viewed as an essential skill that university students need to acquire in order to succeed academically and professionally.  The traditional lecture-based approach to teaching has long been criticized for its limited ability to foster critical thinking skills. In recent years, there has been a shift towards using blended learning approaches in higher education settings. Blended learning refers to the combination of face-to-face instruction with online learning activities.  The purpose of this systematic review study is to examine the effects of blended learning on university students' critical thinking skills and disposition. The study focuses on four subcategories of blended learning: the flex model, self-blended model, enriched virtual model, and rotation model (specifically station rotation model, lab rotation model, flipped classroom model, and individual rotation model).  To conduct this review study, valid search engines and databases were utilized to collect relevant data. The keywords used included blended learning, integrated learning, blended training, integrated training,critical thinking,critical thinking disposition,and critical thinking skills.  The results from 14 out of 15 selected sources indicate that blended learning approaches contribute positively to university students' critical thinking skills and disposition. Blended learning combines the benefits of both traditional lecturing methods with e-learning components such as online discussions or interactive modules.  Blended learning provides students with opportunities for active engagement with course content through various online activities such as simulations or case studies. This active engagement promotes deeper understanding of concepts and enhances analytical skills required for critical thinking.  Additionally,the flexibility offered by online components allows students greater control over their own pace of studying.However,it should be noted that blending doesn't simply mean replacing lectures with online materials; rather,it involves careful design,and alignment between face-to-face and online components to create a cohesive learning experience.  The flex model of blended learning allows students to tailor their learning experience based on their individual needs. This personalized approach enables them to explore topics in more depth and encourages critical thinking by providing opportunities for self-reflection.  Similarly, the self-blended model gives students the flexibility to choose when and how they engage with course materials, allowing them to take ownership of their learning. This model fosters independence, self-direction, and critical thinking skills as students are responsible for managing their own learning process.  The enriched virtual model combines face-to-face instruction with online components that provide additional resources or supplementary materials. This combination expands students' exposure to information and diverse perspectives, nurturing critical thinking through exposure to multiple viewpoints.  Lastly, the rotation model involves students rotating between different modes of instruction such as small-group activities or direct instruction. The integration of technology-based activities into classroom rotations provides an opportunity for collaborative problem-solving and discussion, encouraging critical thinking among students.  In conclusion,the findings from this systematic review highlight that blended learning approaches have a positive impact on university student's critical thinking skills and disposition.Blended learning provides opportunities for active engagement,self-pacing,and personalized or individualized approaches which enhance analytical skills required for critical thinking.Future research should focus on further exploring specific instructional strategies within these blended models in order maximize the benefits of blended learning on critical thinking acquisition.I recommend educators consider implementing blended approaches in higher education contexts as it promotes effective teaching-learning methods while enhancing critical thinking abilities among university students.",continue
"Post-stroke dysphagia, difficulty swallowing, is a common neurological impairment that occurs after a stroke. The process of swallowing involves the coordinated effort of various parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, subcortical areas, and brainstem structures. When these parts are disrupted due to a stroke, it can lead to dysphagia.  The muscles involved in swallowing are also affected by a stroke. The laryngeal muscles such as the suprahyoid muscle and thyrohyoid muscle, as well as the infrahyoid muscle, experience changes in their ability to move and weaken in strength. This results in reduced movement during the swallowing process.  Acupuncture has been proposed as a potential treatment for post-stroke dysphagia due to its ability to affect nerve cells in the cerebral cortex and promote neurological function recovery. It can also enhance neuromuscular excitability and improve control over nerves and muscles involved in swallowing.  To evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for post-stroke dysphagia treatment, a meta-analysis was conducted. Randomized controlled trials using tongue acupuncture therapy were included in this analysis.  A comprehensive search was conducted across seven electronic databases to identify relevant studies. In total, 15 studies with 1,094 patients were included for analysis. Methodological quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool.  The meta-analysis revealed several significant findings regarding tongue acupuncture therapy for post-stroke dysphagia treatment. Firstly, compared to control groups receiving no acupuncture or other treatments alone, patients receiving tongue acupuncture or tongue acupuncture combined with other therapies showed improvement in WST scores (MD = -0.56) and SSA scores (MD = -1.65). This indicated that tongue acupuncture led to reduced severity of dysphagia symptoms.  Furthermore, when comparing clinical efficacy between groups receiving tongue acupuncture versus control groups without any form of acupuncture therapy or other treatments alone it was found that the tongue acupuncture group showed statistically significant improvement (MD = 3.83). This suggests that tongue acupuncture is more effective in treating post-stroke dysphagia compared to no intervention or other therapies alone.  The total effective rate of patients with dysphagia after stroke was also found to be higher in the treatment group receiving acupuncture, tongue acupuncture, and acupuncture combined with other therapies than in the control group. This supports the notion that both tongue acupuncture and traditional body-acupuncture can improve post-stroke dysphagia symptoms.  In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the use of tongue acupuncture for the treatment of post-stroke dysphagia. The findings suggest that tongue acupuncture can help reduce the severity of dysphagia symptoms, improve clinical efficacy, and enhance overall recovery for patients. These results highlight the potential benefits of incorporating tongue acupuncture into comprehensive treatment plans for individuals with post-stroke dysphagia. However, further research is needed to explore optimal treatment protocols and long-term effects. Additionally, the meta-analysis highlights the importance of incorporating acupuncture as part of a comprehensive treatment approach for post-stroke dysphagia. While tongue acupuncture has shown promising results, it is worth noting that the studies included in this analysis also reported positive outcomes when combining tongue acupuncture with other therapies. This suggests that a multimodal treatment approach, combining different therapeutic modalities such as speech therapy, swallowing exercises, and traditional body-acupuncture alongside tongue acupuncture, may yield optimal results.  The mechanism of action underlying the effectiveness of tongue acupuncture for post-stroke dysphagia is still not fully understood. However, it is believed that stimulating specific points on the tongue can activate neural pathways connected to swallowing centers in the brain. This stimulation alters neuronal excitability and enhances communication between these centers and the muscles involved in swallowing. This ultimately leads to improved neuromuscular coordination and functional recovery of swallowing abilities.  It should be mentioned that while this meta-analysis provides valuable insights into the clinical efficacy of tongue acupuncture for post-stroke dysphagia treatment, there are certain limitations to consider. Firstly, there was heterogeneity among the included studies in terms of study design, sample size, treatment protocols employed (e.g., frequency and duration), and assessment tools used to measure outcomes. These variations could introduce some bias or affect overall generalizability.  Moreover, most studies included had a relatively small sample size. Larger-scale randomized controlled trials with more participants would provide stronger evidence on the efficacy and safety profile of tongue acupuncture for post-stroke dysphagia specifically.  Furthermore, long-term follow-up data were limited or absent in many studies which makes it challenging to evaluate whether any observed improvements from tongue acupuncture are sustainable over time.  Despite these limitations being noted during this meta-analysis process further research is warranted both to expand our understanding on how exactly toe stimulation influences neural networks associated with swallowing functions as well as evaluating its long-term effects along with providing further evidence to the effectiveness of tongue acupuncture for post-stroke dysphagia treatment.  In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that tongue acupuncture is a promising therapeutic intervention for patients with post-stroke dysphagia. It has demonstrated significant improvements in swallowing function, clinical efficacy, and overall recovery rates when compared to controls receiving no acupuncture or other treatments alone. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential benefits of incorporating tongue acupuncture into the comprehensive management of post-stroke dysphagia. Nonetheless, further large-scale studies are necessary to establish optimal treatment protocols, address existing limitations, and determine its long-term effects. By advancing our understanding of this approach, healthcare professionals can enhance patient outcomes and improve their quality of life following a stroke-induced dysphagia diagnosis.",continue
"Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a complex neurologic disorder that affects the sleep-wake cycle and emotional regulation. It is often characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden loss of muscle tone, triggered by strong emotions such as laughter or excitement. The exact cause of narcolepsy with cataplexy remains unclear, but recent studies have pointed to the involvement of the amygdala, an emotion-processing center in the brain.  The amygdala is a collection of nuclei located deep within the temporal lobe of the brain. It plays a crucial role in processing emotions, particularly fear and pleasure responses. Studies in both humans and animal models have shown that lesions or dysfunction in specific regions of the amygdala can result in various behavioral abnormalities related to emotional processing.  In narcolepsy with cataplexy, there is evidence to suggest that disruptions in orexin signaling may lead to dysfunction within the amygdala circuitry. Orexin neurons are primarily located within a region called the lateral hypothalamus and project widely throughout the brain, including areas involved in regulating sleep as well as emotional responses.  Studies using functional neuroimaging techniques in humans have provided insight into how emotional stimuli can modulate activity within distinct subregions of the amygdala. For example, exposure to emotionally arousing stimuli such as fearful faces has been found to increase activation specifically within regions like basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). These findings suggest that these subregions may be involved in orchestrating emotional responses.  In addition to human studies, animal models have also provided valuable insights into how disrupted orexin signaling impacts emotion-related behaviors. Mice lacking functional orexin receptors exhibit deficits in fear conditioning tasks mediated by BLA function. Similarly, inhibition of CeA activity has been shown to suppress arousal during social play behavior mediated by disrupted orexin function.  These findings collectively suggest that the amygdala, particularly the BLA and CeA, may be critical components of a neurocircuitry that bridges emotional regulation and narcolepsy with cataplexy. Dysfunction within this circuitry could potentially explain the link between strong emotions and cataplectic episodes observed in individuals with narcolepsy.  Understanding the precise mechanisms by which amygdala circuitry contributes to narcolepsy with cataplexy can pave the way for more targeted treatment approaches. For instance, modulating activity within specific amygdala subregions could potentially be used to regulate emotional responses and minimize cataplectic episodes. Furthermore, investigating how orexin signaling interacts with amygdala circuitry may provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies for managing narcolepsy symptoms.  In conclusion, while our understanding of the role of the amygdala in narcolepsy with cataplexy is still limited, evidence from human studies and animal models suggests that this region plays a crucial role in linking emotional regulation to disease pathology. Further research focusing on detailed examination of amygdala neurocircuitry controlling transitions between emotional arousal states holds great promise in unraveling the underlying mechanisms of narcolepsy with cataplexy and developing effective treatments. 2. Amygdala Neurocircuitry and Emotional Regulation  The amygdala is known for its involvement in emotional processing, but its specific role in narcolepsy with cataplexy has yet to be fully elucidated. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are two key subregions that have been implicated in emotional regulation and may play a critical role in the manifestation of cataplexy.  The BLA receives sensory inputs from various cortical regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, and is responsible for integrating these sensory signals with emotional significance. It has been suggested that abnormalities within this region could lead to an imbalance between emotions and behavioral responses, potentially contributing to triggers for cataplectic episodes. Studies using rodent models have shown that lesions or dysfunction within the BLA can lead to alterations in emotional behaviors, including exaggerated fear responses.  On the other hand, the CeA acts as an output hub for amygdala-related emotions, sending signals to relevant brain regions involved in physiological and behavioral responses. Dysregulation within this region may disrupt the coordination between emotions and motor control systems, leading to abnormal muscle tone regulation seen during cataplectic episodes. Animal studies have shown that stimulation or inhibition of CeA activity can modulate sleep-wake states as well as affective behaviors.  In addition to these core subregions, other components of the extended amygdala are worthy of investigation regarding their potential contributions to narcolepsy with cataplexy. The bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), part of the extended amygdala network involved in stress response modulation, might be implicated due to its integration with both BLA and CeA outputs.  3. Potential Mechanisms Linking Amygdala Dysfunction with Narcolepsy  Several mechanisms have been proposed through which dysfunction within amygdala neurocircuitry might contribute to the development and manifestation of narcolepsy with cataplexy. One possibility is that disruptions in orexin signaling, a hallmark of narcolepsy with cataplexy, could lead to alterations within amygdala circuits involved in emotion regulation.  Orexin neurons project extensively to regions including the amygdala, suggesting a direct modulatory role. Orexinergic innervation of the amygdala may influence emotional responses by regulating synaptic transmission and plasticity within these circuits.  Additionally, it has been hypothesized that dysregulation of GABAergic inhibitory systems within the amygdala might play a role in narcolepsy with cataplexy. A reduction in GABAergic tone could result in overactivation or hyperexcitability of various amygdala subregions implicated in emotional regulation and motor control.  Furthermore, interactions between the amygdala and other sleep/wake regulatory centers might contribute to sleep abnormalities observed in individuals with narcolepsy. The reciprocal connections between the amygdala and hypothalamic regions involved in sleep-wake control could mediate bidirectional modulation between emotional arousal states and sleep-wake transitions.  4. Future Directions for Research  Further investigations into the specific functional connectivity patterns involving distinct subregions within the amygdala are necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of their contributions to emotional dysregulation and cataplexy.  Using advanced techniques such as optogenetics and chemogenetics can facilitate precise manipulation of neural activity within targeted subregions or specific neuronal populations, shedding light on causal relationships between altered activity patterns and disease phenotypes seen in narcolepsy with cataplexy models.  Moreover, translational research involving human studies should aim at characterizing structural alterations or functional connectivity changes related specifically to narcolepsy with cataplexy within relevant amygdalar circuitry using neuroimaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  By combining both animal models and human studies, researchers can ensure a more comprehensive understanding of the amygdala's involvement in emotional dysregulation and narcolepsy with cataplexy. Such knowledge will contribute to the development of novel therapeutic interventions targeting specific amygdala circuits and potentially improve the management and treatment of this complex sleep disorder.  In conclusion, emerging evidence suggests that the amygdala neurocircuitry plays a significant role in narcolepsy with cataplexy by integrating emotional responses with motor control systems. Further research is needed to unravel the precise mechanisms through which dysfunction within specific amygdala subregions contributes to this sleep disorder. Understanding these mechanisms could offer insights into novel therapeutic targets for managing symptoms and improving overall quality of life for individuals affected by narcolepsy with cataplexy.",continue
"Obesity has emerged as a significant risk factor for the development of various types of cancer. The underlying mechanisms linking obesity and cancer are complex and multifaceted, but it is believed that alterations in both gut microbiota composition and metabolism contribute to this association.  Patients with obesity often exhibit dysbiosis, characterized by an imbalance in gut microbial communities. This dysbiosis leads to changes in microbial metabolite production, which can have a profound impact on immune system function. These altered microbial metabolites may impair the body's natural ability to mount an effective antitumor immune response.  Bariatric surgery has gained recognition as an effective treatment for long-term weight loss in patients with obesity. Interestingly, bariatric surgery has also been found to induce favorable changes in the gut microbiota composition. Studies have shown that after bariatric surgery, there is an increase in beneficial microbes such as Akkermansia muciniphila and Bacteroidetes species, while the abundance of potentially harmful bacteria like Firmicutes decreases.  One major consequence of these changes in gut microbial communities is the alteration of microbial metabolite production. Bariatric surgery has been found to promote the production of certain microbial metabolites that have potential anticancer properties.  Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are one class of microbially modified metabolites that have attracted significant attention due to their beneficial effects on health. SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate are produced through fermentation processes by specific bacteria within the gut microbiota. These SCFAs play crucial roles not only in regulating energy metabolism but also modulating host immunity. They have been shown to enhance antitumor immunity by promoting T cell differentiation into effector cells and increasing their cytotoxicity against tumor cells.  Inosine is another microbially derived metabolite that has recently gained attention due to its potential anticancer effects. Inosine is produced through the metabolism of purine nucleotides by gut bacteria. It has been shown to enhance antitumor immunity by stimulating the activation and expansion of cytotoxic T cells. In addition, inosine has been found to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis through its ability to modulate immune responses.  Bile acids are another class of microbial metabolites that have emerged as important regulators of host physiology and metabolism. Bariatric surgery-induced alterations in gut microbiota composition have been shown to impact bile acid metabolism, leading to changes in bile acid profiles. These altered bile acids can modulate multiple signaling pathways involved in tumor development and progression.  Spermidine is a polyamine that is also affected by bariatric surgery-induced changes in gut microbiota composition. Spermidine has recently gained attention for its potential anticancer properties. Studies have demonstrated that spermidine intake can lead to autophagy induction, which plays a crucial role in suppressing tumorigenesis.  Understanding the impact of microbially modified metabolites on antitumor immunity is essential for developing effective therapeutic strategies for cancer patients who have not undergone bariatric surgery. One approach involves identifying specific microbial metabolites that mimic the effects of bariatric surgery on anticancer immunity. This could involve dietary interventions or targeted supplementation with these metabolites.  In conclusion, obesity-associated dysbiosis leads to alterations in microbial metabolite production that can impair antitumor immunity and promote cancer development and progression. Bariatric surgery-induced changes in gut microbiota composition may counteract these effects by promoting the production of microbially modified metabolites with potential anticancer properties such as SCFAs, inosine, bile acids, and spermidine.  Further research into understanding the mechanisms underlying these effects is necessary to develop novel therapeutic strategies aimed at improving outcomes for obese cancer patients who have not received bariatric surgery. Ultimately, this knowledge could lead to the development of microbial metabolite-based interventions that mimic the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery and enhance anticancer immune responses.",continue
"Inquiry-based learning (IBL) has become a prominent approach in health professions education, aiming to promote higher-level thinking and student engagement. In open IBL curricula, students are encouraged to generate their own questions and actively explore topics of interest. This approach empowers students to take ownership of their learning process and develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and information synthesis.  The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the range of metrics used in evaluating health professions trainees in open IBL initiatives. The study aimed to identify the outcomes associated with this educational approach and shed light on its effectiveness in fostering desired competencies.  To conduct the review, five databases were searched for relevant publications detailing trainee outcomes in open IBL initiatives within health professions education. Only studies that described interventions consisting of five phases of IBL (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, and discussion) were included.  After the initial search yielded 3030 records, a two-stage screening process was conducted on abstracts and full texts by two independent reviewers. Finally, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria for data extraction. Of these studies, nine involved physician trainees while twelve focused on nursing trainees.  The findings highlight some key themes regarding the evaluation of trainee outcomes in open IBL curricula. Firstly, there was a notable lack of validated data collection tools used across studies. Only three studies employed validated measures to assess student inquiry behavior during the curriculum. One study utilized a single validated tool to assess critical thinking abilities.  Interestingly, most studies (n = 11) relied heavily on self-reported satisfaction or perceived gain of skills as their primary outcome measure. While subjective measures can provide valuable insights into learners' perceptions and experiences with IBL initiatives; they may not fully capture changes or improvements in competencies objectively.  Amongst the four included studies that utilized validated tools assessing inquiry behaviors at the completion of an IBL curriculum, results showed high scores in inquiry behaviors. However, findings regarding critical thinking abilities were mixed. This suggests that while open IBL may have a positive impact on fostering inquiry-oriented skills, its effect on broader cognitive abilities such as critical thinking may vary.  Moreover, the majority of included studies collected pre-post or post-only data. Only one study employed a longitudinal design to collect serial data throughout the duration of the curriculum. Longitudinal studies have the potential to provide more robust evidence regarding changes in trainee outcomes over time and help identify any sustained effects of IBL initiatives.  In conclusion, this scoping review highlights the potential of open IBL to cultivate curiosity and active engagement among health professions learners. However, it also underscores the need for more rigorous evaluation efforts in this area. Curriculum innovations utilizing IBL should consider incorporating validated tools to assess student inquiry behavior and critical thinking objectively. Additionally, future research should aim to employ longitudinal designs to better understand the long-term impact of open IBL in health professions education and its contribution towards developing competent professionals able to navigate complex healthcare challenges effectively.  2. Discussion  In recent years, inquiry-based learning (IBL) has gained recognition as an effective approach to health professions education. It emphasizes student-centered learning and encourages active exploration, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. This scoping review aimed to summarize the metrics used to evaluate health professions trainees in open IBL curricula.  The findings of this review reveal several interesting trends and gaps in the evaluation of trainee outcomes in open IBL initiatives. Firstly, there is a lack of standardized and validated tools used across studies for assessing student inquiry behavior and critical thinking abilities. This is problematic as it makes it difficult to compare results across different studies or draw robust conclusions about the impact of open IBL on these outcomes.  However, among the few studies that did utilize validated tools for assessing inquiry behavior, positive results were reported at the end of the curriculum. This suggests that open IBL may indeed be effective in promoting inquiry-oriented skills among health professions learners. It encourages students to ask questions, seek information independently, and develop a curiosity-driven mindset.  On the other hand, findings regarding critical thinking abilities were more varied. Some studies reported improvements in critical thinking skills following participation in an open IBL curriculum while others did not find significant changes. These mixed results may be attributed to variations in curriculum design or differences in how critical thinking was measured across studies.  Another important finding from this review is that most included studies relied heavily on self-reported satisfaction or perceived gain of skills as their primary outcome measure. While subjective measures can provide valuable insights into learners' perspectives and attitudes towards open IBL initiatives; they may not fully capture objective changes or improvements in competencies.  This highlights a need for more rigorous evaluation efforts using standardized measures such as validated questionnaires or performance assessments that can provide objective data on student outcomes related to inquiry behavior and critical thinking abilities.  Furthermore, most included studies collected pre-post or post-only data without employing longitudinal designs. Longitudinal studies are essential in assessing the long-term impact of open IBL on trainee outcomes and determining if any effects are sustained over time. They can provide valuable insights into whether the skills developed through open IBL initiatives persist beyond the immediate curriculum and translate into real-world practice.  Overall, this scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on trainee outcomes in open IBL curricula within health professions education. It highlights both the potential benefits of this educational approach, such as cultivating curiosity and inquiry-oriented skills, as well as areas that require further investigation.  Future research should aim to incorporate validated tools for assessing inquiry behavior and critical thinking abilities to ensure more standardized evaluation across studies. Longitudinal designs should also be employed to assess the long-term impact of open IBL on trainee outcomes. Additionally, exploring other objective measures such as performance assessments or observed behavior can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of open IBL on health professions learners.  In conclusion, while there is promising evidence regarding positive trainee outcomes associated with open IBL in health professions education, more robust research is needed. By incorporating rigorous evaluation methods and standardized measures into future studies, we can better understand how this pedagogical approach contributes to developing competent professionals who excel in critical thinking, problem-solving, and independent inquiry-based learning skills.",continue
"Amphibian metamorphosis is a unique developmental process that involves the transformation of aquatic larvae into terrestrial adults. During this process, various organs undergo significant changes and mature into their adult forms. It is at this stage when plasma thyroid hormone (T3) concentration reaches its peak, and T3 has been found to play a crucial role in driving amphibian metamorphosis.  Unlike mammals, amphibians experience postembryonic development where they transition from their larval to adult stages. This allows for the study of organ development independent of maternal influences. One model organism widely used in studying metamorphosis is the pseudo-tetraploid Xenopus laevis and its diploid counterpart Xenopus tropicalis.  Intestinal remodeling is one aspect of metamorphosis that has received considerable attention due to its relevance and importance in understanding T3 regulation during development. This process involves the degeneration of larval epithelium through apoptosis, followed by the formation of new adult stem cells which then proliferate and differentiate to form the adult intestinal epithelium.  Several studies have provided valuable insights into how T3 regulates cell fate during intestinal remodeling. One notable discovery is the correlation between T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program and larval epithelial cell death. Activation of specific genes involved in cell cycle regulation has been observed upon T3 treatment, indicating that these genes help facilitate apoptosis-induced tissue reorganization.  Furthermore, it has been suggested that T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program is also essential for de novo formation of adult intestinal stem cells. These stem cells emerge from pools of undifferentiated cells after larval epithelial degeneration occurs. Studies have shown that certain factors necessary for cell proliferation are upregulated by T3 treatment during metamorphosis.  One such factor identified as being critical for adult stem cell formation is retinoblastoma protein-related p130 (p130). Activated p130 promotes quiescence in undifferentiated cells, allowing them to transition into adult intestinal stem cells. This suggests an interplay between the cell cycle regulation and stem cell development processes that is orchestrated by T3.  Overall, these findings highlight the significance of T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program during amphibian metamorphosis and its role in both larval epithelial cell death and the subsequent formation of adult stem cells. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these processes is crucial for unraveling how T3 regulates organ development during postembryonic stages.  In conclusion, studies on intestinal remodeling provide valuable insights into T3 regulation of cell fate during amphibian metamorphosis. The activation of the cell cycle program appears to be important for both larval epithelial apoptosis and the generation of adult intestinal stem cells. Further research in this area will deepen our understanding of how T3 influences organ maturation and provide potential avenues for investigating human postnatal development and tissue regeneration. 2. T3-mediated Apoptosis in Intestinal Remodeling  During intestinal remodeling, the larval epithelial cells undergo programmed cell death or apoptosis to make way for the formation of adult tissues. This process is tightly regulated by T3 levels and involves the activation of various apoptotic signaling pathways.  One crucial regulator of apoptosis during metamorphosis is the thyroid hormone receptor beta (TRβ), which is highly expressed in the intestines of amphibians. TRβ activates target genes involved in apoptosis, leading to cell death in the larval epithelium.  T3 acts through TRβ to initiate a caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway, resulting in the activation of several caspases involved in cell death. These caspases cleave cellular proteins and promote DNA fragmentation, ultimately leading to the dismantling of larval epithelial tissue.  Furthermore, it has been suggested that T3-induced apoptosis serves additional functions beyond tissue elimination. Studies have shown that T3-mediated apoptosis also promotes cell cycle exit and prevents proliferation in adult stem cells during their formation. This ensures that newly generated stem cells remain quiescent until they receive signals for proliferation and differentiation.  3. Role of Cell Cycle Activation in Stem Cell Development  Following larval epithelial degeneration, new adult intestinal stem cells need to be generated for tissue regeneration. The process involves activating quiescent undifferentiated cells present within the intestinal folds or crypts.  Recent studies have highlighted a critical role for T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program in driving this transition from undifferentiated cells to proliferating adult stem cells.  One key finding is that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are central regulators of cell cycle progression, are upregulated by T3 during metamorphosis. CDKs interact with specific cyclins and phosphorylate key proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, enabling progression through different phases such as G1/S or G2/M.  T3 treatment has been shown to upregulate cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression, promoting G1/S transition in undifferentiated cells. This allows them to enter the cell cycle and proliferate as adult intestinal stem cells. In contrast, inhibition of CDK4 blocks T3-induced stem cell proliferation, emphasizing the importance of the cell cycle program in this process.  Additionally, T3-induced activation of p130 has been associated with adult intestinal stem cell formation. Studies have shown that p130 promotes exit from the cell cycle and induces quiescence in undifferentiated cells. Activation of p130 by T3 maintains quiescence in newly formed stem cells until they receive appropriate signals for proliferation and differentiation.  Furthermore, studies have also indicated a potential role for other factors such as c-Myc, E2F transcription factors, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in T3-mediated regulation of stem cell development during intestinal remodeling.  4. Future Perspectives  Intestinal remodeling during amphibian metamorphosis provides a valuable model to study the complex interplay between thyroid hormone-induced apoptosis and stem cell development. Understanding these processes at a molecular level holds significant implications not only for developmental biology but also for regenerative medicine.  Future research should focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms by which T3 regulates apoptosis during intestinal remodeling and how it coordinates with other signaling pathways involved in tissue regeneration. Investigating additional factors related to cytoskeletal organization, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune responses may provide further insights into this intricate process.  Furthermore, exploring whether similar mechanisms operate during postnatal development of mammalian organs or tissue regeneration after injury will help bridge our understanding between amphibians' metamorphosis and human biology.  In conclusion, research on amphibian metamorphosis has shed light on how thyroid hormone-induced activation of the cell cycle program plays a crucial role both in apoptotic tissue degeneration as well as in the generation and proliferation of adult stem cells during intestinal remodeling. This work not only furthers our knowledge of amphibian development but also provides a foundation for studying organ maturation and regeneration in other species, including humans.",continue
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a complex network of cells and tight junctions that separates the bloodstream from the brain parenchyma. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS) by regulating the transport of molecules, ions, and cells between the blood and the brain.  Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive forms of primary brain tumors. It arises from glial cells and has a high infiltrative capacity into adjacent brain tissues. The development and progression of GBM are accompanied by pathological changes in BBB integrity, leading to increased permeability and decreased selectivity.  The breakdown of BBB in GBM is mainly attributed to several mechanisms, including angiogenesis, disruption of tight junction proteins, enzymatic degradation, and altered expression of transporters. These alterations result in increased vascular permeability within tumor tissue, allowing for enhanced extravasation of plasma components into the interstitial space surrounding tumor cells.  However, despite this pathological disruption, current therapeutic strategies for GBM still face significant obstacles. The dysfunctional BBB limits effective drug delivery to tumor sites and often leads to suboptimal treatment outcomes. Additionally, repeated administrations of chemotherapy agents can paradoxically induce functional restoration of BBB integrity through various signaling pathways mediated by glioma-derived factors such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). This restoration exacerbates drug resistance by preventing subsequent drug transport across BBB during additional treatment cycles.  To overcome these challenges, there have been efforts toward developing strategies that regulate pathological BBB fenestration while minimizing systemic toxicity. One approach involves utilizing nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems that target specific receptors on disrupted endothelial cells or exploit transcytosis pathways across altered tight junctions.  Various drugs have been explored for enhancing intracranial delivery through modulating BBB integrity. For example, bradykinin analogs such as RMP-7 (dazoxiben analog) can selectively bind to bradykinin receptor B1 and upregulate tight junction proteins, leading to improved BBB integrity and decreased permeability. Similarly, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors have been targeted using VIP-paclitaxel conjugates to enhance drug transport across the BBB.  In addition to pharmacological interventions, physical methods such as focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles have shown promise in transiently opening the BBB for therapeutic agents' enhanced delivery. FUS-induced sonoporation disrupts tight junction proteins temporarily and enables increased drug penetration into brain tissue.  Furthermore, recent advancements in gene therapy have shown potential for regulating BBB function. For instance, manipulating key genes involved in BBB integrity maintenance like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) or various growth factors can alter BBB permeability and allow for improved drug delivery.  In conclusion, developing strategies to regulate pathological blood-brain barrier fenestration holds great promise for enhancing intracranial drug delivery and improving the efficacy of anti-glioblastoma therapeutics. By understanding the mechanisms underlying the breakdown of BBB in GBM and exploiting targeted interventions, novel approaches may overcome the limitations posed by dysfunctional BBB during GBM treatment. These advancements could provide new opportunities for effective and safe therapies against this devastating disease while minimizing systemic toxicity and improving patient outcomes.

"Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common condition characterized by pain and dysfunction in the Achilles tendon. Exercise interventions have been widely used in the treatment of AT, and various types of exercises have been implemented to improve functional outcomes in this population. However, there is still limited understanding regarding the specific effects of different exercise treatments on improving specific functions, such as strength or range of motion.  This systematic review aimed to explore the impact of exercise treatments on different functional outcomes in individuals with mid-portion AT. A thorough search was conducted in electronic databases including Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to 21 February 2023. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) that investigated changes in plantar flexor function with exercise treatments were included.  Functional outcomes were categorized into three groups: kinetic parameters (e.g., strength), kinematic parameters (e.g., ankle range of motion), and sensorimotor parameters (e.g., balance index). The exercise treatments were classified into eccentric training, concentric training, or combined eccentric plus concentric training modes. The quality assessment was performed using established scales for RCTs and CCTs.  From the initial search results of 2,260 records, ten studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis. Due to the heterogeneity among these studies, a qualitative synthesis was conducted rather than a meta-analysis.  The results showed that eccentric training led to significant improvements in power outcomes such as height during countermovement jumps as well as peak torque measures indicating enhanced strength. Concentric training also demonstrated moderate evidence for improved power outcomes but did not show any significant improvement in other functional measures like balance index. Interestingly, one high-quality study showed an improvement in balance index following eccentric training.  Combined training modalities did not yield any significant improvements in either strength or power outcomes compared to eccentric or concentric training alone. Kinematic analysis of plantarflexion and dorsiflexion range of motion did not show any relevant changes following exercise treatments.  In conclusion, this systematic review demonstrated that eccentric training is effective in improving strength outcomes in individuals with mid-portion AT. It also showed moderate evidence for improvements in power outcomes and the sensorimotor parameter ""balance index"". Concentric training can be considered as an alternative to improve power outcomes but does not seem to significantly affect other functional measures. Kinematic analysis of range of motion may not be a useful parameter for assessing treatment efficacy in individuals with mid-portion AT.  These findings highlight the importance of tailored exercise interventions for specific functional goals in individuals with mid-portion AT. Clinicians should consider incorporating eccentric training to improve strength outcomes while also considering concentric training as an alternative to target power improvements. Further research is needed to explore the optimal dosage and progression schemes for these exercise modalities, as well as their long-term effects on functional outcomes in this population. Additionally, it is worth noting that the included studies varied in terms of exercise protocols, duration of intervention, and outcome measures. This heterogeneity makes it challenging to make definitive conclusions about the most effective exercise treatment for mid-portion AT. Future studies should aim to use standardized protocols and outcome measures to enable better comparisons across different interventions.  The findings of this systematic review have important implications for clinical practice. Eccentric training has consistently shown positive effects on strength outcomes in mid-portion AT patients. This type of exercise involves lengthening the Achilles tendon under load, which has been hypothesized to promote tendon remodeling and improve strength. Clinicians should consider incorporating eccentric exercises such as heel drops or eccentric calf raises into their treatment plans for AT patients.  Concentric training, although showing moderate evidence for improving power outcomes, did not demonstrate significant improvements in other functional measures or balance index in this review. However, it may still have value as an alternative or supplementary approach to eccentric training when targeting power improvements is a priority.  The lack of significant changes in kinematic parameters (e.g., range of motion) following exercise treatments suggests that these measures may not be sensitive enough to assess treatment efficacy in individuals with mid-portion AT. Other factors such as pain levels and functional limitations may play a more critical role in determining treatment success.  It is also important to consider individual patient characteristics when designing exercise interventions for mid-portion AT. Factors such as age, activity level, comorbidities, and severity of symptoms can influence treatment response and adherence. A personalized approach that takes these factors into account is likely to yield better outcomes.  In conclusion, this systematic review provides valuable insights into the effects of exercise treatments on functional outcomes in individuals with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. Eccentric training has robust evidence supporting its effectiveness in improving strength outcomes while also showing moderate evidence for power improvements and balance index enhancement.  Clinicians should consider incorporating eccentric exercises into their treatment plans for mid-portion AT patients. Additionally, concentric training can be considered as an alternative or supplementary approach when targeting power improvements. Future research should focus on standardizing exercise protocols and outcome measures, as well as exploring the long-term effects of different exercise modalities on functional outcomes in this population. By advancing our understanding of the most effective exercise treatments for mid-portion AT, clinicians can optimize patient care and help individuals regain optimal function and quality of life.",continue
"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, cognitive impairment is also prevalent in PD patients and can significantly impact their quality of life. Cognitive decline in PD has been associated with worse disease prognosis, increased burden on caregivers, and higher economic costs.  Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has recently gained attention as a potential marker of early cognitive impairment in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). SCD refers to self-reported cognitive decline experienced by individuals without detectable objective cognitive dysfunction. It is considered an at-risk state for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and a prodromal stage for dementia.  While extensive research has been conducted on SCD in AD, studies focusing specifically on PD-related SCD have been limited. Consequently, there is currently no consensus regarding the definition of SCD or a gold standard evaluation tool for PD-SCD.  The aim of this review was to explore the association between PD-SCD and objective cognitive function. One key finding was that PD patients with SCD exhibited brain metabolic changes consistent with early aberrant pathological changes seen in PD. These findings suggest that subjective complaints about cognition may reflect underlying neuronal deficits.  Furthermore, it was observed that individuals with PD-SCD were more likely to progress to future cognitive impairment or develop MCI compared to those without subjective complaints about cognition. This highlights the importance of identifying and monitoring individuals with SCD as they may represent a high-risk group for developing significant cognitive impairments.  To enhance our understanding of PD-SCD further and establish guidelines for its definition and evaluation, larger sample sizes are required along with more longitudinal investigations. Long-term studies can help determine the predictive effectiveness of PD-SCD in detecting earlier subtle declines in cognition before the onset of clinically evident MCI or dementia.  In addition to exploring the predictive value of PD-SCD, future research should also focus on developing standardized assessment tools for the evaluation of SCD in PD. Consensus guidelines would enable clinicians to reliably identify individuals at risk of cognitive decline and intervene promptly, potentially delaying or preventing the onset of more severe cognitive impairments.  Clinicians should routinely screen PD patients for subjective complaints about cognition and consider a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation if SCD is reported. This will aid in early detection, monitoring, and intervention strategies that may help improve patients' overall cognitive functioning and quality of life.  In conclusion, subjective cognitive decline represents a significant area of study in Parkinson's disease. By identifying individuals at risk through the establishment of consensus guidelines for its definition and evaluation, we can proactively intervene and potentially modify disease progression. Increased research efforts are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving PD-SCD and its association with objective cognitive function. Ultimately, improving our understanding of PD-related cognitive decline will have important implications for patient care and management strategies. 2. Neural mechanisms of subjective cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease  To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in Parkinson's disease (PD), several studies have been conducted using various neuroimaging techniques.  Some studies have utilized functional neuroimaging such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain metabolism and connectivity patterns in PD patients with SCD. These studies consistently showed abnormal patterns of glucose metabolism and altered functional connectivity networks in regions involved in cognition, including the prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus.  Structural neuroimaging studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have also demonstrated gray matter atrophy or volume reductions in these same brain regions implicated in SCD. Specifically, cortical thinning has been observed in the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as within subcortical structures such as the hippocampus and thalamus.  Moreover, neuropathological examinations have revealed that PD patients with SCD exhibit abnormal accumulation of pathologic protein aggregates, including alpha-synuclein deposition. These pathological changes are similar to those seen in Alzheimer's disease but are primarily localized to specific brain areas affected by PD.  These findings collectively suggest that SCD may arise from a combination of underlying pathogenic processes associated with PD-related neurodegeneration and concomitant Alzheimer's-like pathology.  3. Clinical implications for subjective cognitive decline assessment  Given the potential significance of SCD as an early marker for cognitive decline in PD, its clinical assessment becomes paramount. However, there is currently no gold standard for evaluating SCD specifically within the context of PD diagnosis or management.  Several self-report questionnaires such as Cognitive Complaints Questionnaire (CCQ), Subjective Memory Complaints Scale (SMC), or Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ) have been used to assess SCD across different populations but lack specificity for PD-related cognitive decline.  To enhance the clinical assessment of SCD in PD, a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests combining objective cognitive assessments with patient-reported subjective complaints may be necessary. Additionally, incorporating multimodal neuroimaging measures can assist in identifying individuals who may be at higher risk of progressive cognitive decline.  Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the predictive value of SCD for MCI or dementia development in PD, as well as its potential association with other clinical features such as motor symptom severity and disease duration. Such investigations will aid in stratifying patients according to their risk profile for cognitive impairment and guide personalized therapeutic interventions.  4. Conclusion  Subjective cognitive decline represents an important area of investigation within the context of Parkinson's disease. While research on SCD has predominantly focused on Alzheimer's disease, recent studies have shed light on its relevance to PD-related cognitive dysfunction.  PD patients with subjective complaints about cognition show distinct patterns of brain metabolic changes and structural alterations similar to early pathological changes seen in PD. Moreover, these individuals are more likely to develop future cognitive impairments compared to those without subjective complaints.  To advance our understanding and clinical management of SCD in PD, further research is needed to establish consensus guidelines for its definition and evaluation. Standardized assessment tools that combine objective measures with patient-reported symptoms can facilitate early detection, monitoring, and intervention strategies aimed at improving overall cognition outcomes for PD patients.  Efforts should also be directed toward investigating the underlying neural mechanisms driving SCD in Parkinson's disease through neuroimaging techniques and neuropathological examinations. By unraveling these mechanisms, we can better identify potential therapeutic targets and develop novel interventions aimed at preserving cognitive function in this population.  Ultimately, successful management strategies targeting subjective cognitive decline could have substantial positive impacts on patient care, quality of life improvements among affected individuals with Parkinson's disease -giving hope by delaying or preventing severe cognitive impairments while improving overall health outcomes.",continue
"Viral Hepatitis is a major public health problem worldwide, with an estimated 257 million people living with chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and 71 million people living with chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection globally. The burden of viral hepatitis is particularly high in low- and middle-income countries, including India.  India, being the second-most populous country in the world, faces significant challenges in terms of healthcare infrastructure and accessibility. Additionally, socio-economic disparities contribute to the unequal distribution of healthcare services across different regions of the country. These factors make it important to understand the prevalence of viral hepatitis infection in India.  The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the prevalence of viral Hepatitis A (HAV), HBV, and HCV infections in India. We aimed to provide an overview of the disease burden throughout different regions within the country.  Using various databases such as Science Direct, Scopus, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and open access journals as sources for our search strategy, we identified relevant peer-reviewed articles published between February 2000 and February 2021 that reported on viral hepatitis prevalence in India. After evaluating these studies based on predefined inclusion criteria, we included a total of 28 studies for analysis.  The selected studies encompassed different geographical regions within India including northern, southern, central, eastern, and western regions. They involved a combined total of 45 ,608 research participants. The prevalence rates varied across the studies for each type of viral hepatitis.  For Hepatitis A, the prevalence ranged from 2.1% to 52.5%, indicating a significant variation in the risk of exposure to HAV among different populations and regions within India. This reflects disparities in sanitation facilities, hygiene practices, and access to clean drinking water.  The prevalence of Hepatitis B infection ranged from 0.87% to 21.4% among the studied populations. This wide range suggests variations in risk factors such as vaccination coverage, healthcare practices (including blood transfusion safety), and intravenous drug use within different communities.  Hepatitis C infection had a wide prevalence range of 0.57% to 53.7%. The high upper limit highlights areas or population groups with higher exposure to HCV transmission modes such as unsafe injection practices or blood transfusions prior to proper screening procedures being implemented.  Significant findings from these studies included a higher burden of hepatitis A among children, indicating possible gaps in immunization programs targeting this age group. Additionally, approximately half (47.4%) of third-trimester pregnant mothers were affected by Hepatitis E infection, highlighting the importance of interventions aimed at preventing vertical transmission during pregnancy.  Common modes of acquiring HBV and HCV infections identified in these studies included diabetes, hospital admissions (especially surgical procedures), history of jaundice (indicating previous liver disease), history of surgeries or blood transfusions without proper screening measures implemented at that time period, and heterosexual contact.  The high burden observed across all types of viral hepatitis infections signifies its substantial impact on India's healthcare system and warrants effective public health interventions for prevention and control measures urgently.  Efforts should be focused on improving vaccination coverage against Hepatitis A and B viruses to reduce the incidence among vulnerable populations such as children and pregnant women. Public awareness campaigns should emphasize safe injection practices, blood transfusion safety, and promotion of universal precautions in healthcare settings to minimize the risk of viral hepatitis transmission.  Additionally, targeted interventions need to address the specific risk factors identified, such as diabetes management and promoting safer sexual practices. Strengthening surveillance systems for timely detection and reporting of new cases is crucial to monitor the disease burden accurately and guide evidence-based interventions.  In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provide insights into the prevalence of viral hepatitis infections in India. The findings emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive public health measures to reduce the burden of viral hepatitis, including vaccination programs, improvement in healthcare practices, and awareness campaigns focusing on risk factor education. Effective implementation of these strategies will contribute significantly towards eliminating viral hepatitis as a major public health threat in India.",continue
"Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a group of genetic disorders that affect the functioning of the retina, leading to vision loss and potential blindness. Gene replacement therapy has emerged as a successful treatment option for certain IRDs, but it has limitations in terms of packaging capacity and expression levels. This creates a need for alternative therapeutic approaches to target genes that exceed these limitations or are expressed in multiple retinal isoforms.  RNA editing holds great promise as a therapeutic strategy for correcting pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human transcriptome. Unlike gene replacement therapy, RNA editing does not risk creating permanent off-target edits in the genome and offers innovative delivery options. Adenine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes play a crucial role in posttranscriptional RNA editing by catalyzing the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA).  Early studies utilized exogenous delivery of catalytically active ADAR deaminase domain (ADARDD) fused to an RNA binding protein for efficient target editing rates. However, this approach had its limitations due to potential immune responses against foreign proteins, transcriptome-wide off-target effects, and limited packaging space.  Recent advancements have focused on harnessing endogenous ADAR enzymes for programmable RNA editing. Researchers have developed circular ADAR-recruiting guide RNAs and optimized ADAR-recruiting antisense oligonucleotides to increase editing efficiency without relying on exogenous protein delivery.  In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated promising results with endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing. Comparable target editing efficiency was achieved both in wild-type and disease mouse models as well as non-human primates up to six weeks after application.  The potential applications of endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing are especially relevant for IRD treatment where gene replacement therapy has shown success but still faces challenges related to packaging capacity and expression levels. This approach offers the advantage of freeing up packaging space, reducing the likelihood of an immune response, and minimizing off-target effects.  Moreover, RNA editing allows for precise correction of pathogenic SNVs without permanently altering the genome. This feature is particularly important in the context of inherited diseases where lifelong correction may not be necessary or desirable.  However, there are still challenges and considerations that need to be addressed before endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing can be applied as a clinical treatment for IRDs. These include optimizing delivery methods to target specific retinal cell types effectively, ensuring long-term stability and safety of edited transcripts, and addressing potential concerns regarding off-target editing at unintended sites in the transcriptome.  In conclusion, recent advancements in endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing offer a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in IRDs. The ability to achieve comparable editing efficiency without relying on exogenous protein delivery opens up new possibilities for targeting genes with limitations related to packaging capacity or expression levels. Further research and development are needed to optimize this approach for clinical application and ensure its safety and effectiveness in treating inherited retinal diseases. 2. Advantages of RNA editing with endogenous ADAR in treating inherited retinal diseases:  RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes offers several advantages that make it a feasible option for the treatment of inherited retinal diseases.   Firstly, the use of endogenous ADAR enzymes eliminates the need for exogenous protein delivery, which can pose challenges such as immune responses and off-target effects. By utilizing the natural machinery present in cells, RNA editing with endogenous ADAR bypasses these limitations and ensures a more targeted and specific approach to gene correction.  Secondly, this approach allows for precise correction of pathogenic SNVs without permanently altering the genome. While gene replacement therapy involves introducing a new copy of the gene into a cell, RNA editing directly modifies the existing transcript by converting adenosine to inosine. This targeted approach minimizes potential risks associated with permanent genome alterations and allows for reversible corrections if needed.  Furthermore, endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing has shown promising target editing efficiency both in vitro and in vivo studies using animal models. The ability to edit transcripts at levels comparable to exogenously delivered ADARDD opens up possibilities for effectively correcting disease-causing mutations without relying on foreign proteins.  Another advantage is that it frees up packaging space within viral vectors such as adeno-associated viruses (AAV), which are commonly used for gene therapy delivery. AAVs have a limited capacity regarding how much genetic material they can carry. Since some genes implicated in IRDs exceed this packaging capacity or are expressed in multiple retinal isoforms, utilizing RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes provides an alternative strategy for targeting these challenging genes.  Moreover, due to its posttranscriptional nature, RNA editing can be specific to certain cell types or tissues within the retina by selecting guide RNAs or antisense oligonucleotides that target those specific regions. This cell-specific targeting enables more precision when correcting pathogenic SNVs and reduces the potential for off-target effects in other cell types.  3. Challenges and considerations:  While RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes holds great potential for the treatment of inherited retinal diseases, there are several challenges and considerations that need to be addressed before it can be applied clinically.  One challenge is optimizing delivery methods to efficiently target specific retinal cell types. The retina is a complex structure composed of different cell types, each with distinct characteristics and functions. Ensuring that RNA editing tools effectively reach the desired retinal cells while minimizing exposure to off-target cells will be crucial for successful therapeutic outcomes.  The long-term stability and safety of edited transcripts is another consideration. It will be important to evaluate the durability of RNA edits over time, ensuring that they remain stable and functional without causing deleterious effects on normal cellular processes or inducing unintended side effects.  Off-target editing at unintended sites in the transcriptome is also a concern. Although efforts have been made to maximize specificity by designing guide RNAs or antisense oligonucleotides with high affinity towards target sequences, there is still a possibility of unintentional edits elsewhere in the genome. Rigorous assessment and mitigation strategies should be implemented to minimize off-target effects.  Another consideration is scalability. To bring this approach into clinical practice, large-scale production methods will need to be developed, ensuring consistent quality control measures while still maintaining cost-effectiveness.  Additionally, regulatory approval processes will play a critical role in determining the feasibility of utilizing endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing as a treatment option for inherited retinal diseases. Guidelines must be established regarding safety assessments, efficacy criteria, manufacturing standards, and patient selection criteria before this approach can become widely accessible.  4. Future directions:  Despite these challenges, significant progress has been made in utilizing endogenous ADAR enzymes for programmable RNA editing in IRD research. Continued advancements in technology are expected to overcome current limitations and drive this field forward toward clinical application.  Future research should focus on further improving the editing efficiency and specificity of endogenous ADAR-mediated RNA editing techniques. This can be achieved by optimizing guide RNAs or antisense oligonucleotides, developing better delivery systems, and enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ADAR recruitment and activity at specific target sites.  Additionally, the long-term durability and safety of RNA edits need to be thoroughly investigated through preclinical studies and long-term follow-ups in animal models. Understanding the stability of edited transcripts over extended periods will be crucial for assessing their potential as a long-lasting treatment option for IRDs.  Furthermore, collaboration between academia, industry, regulatory bodies, and patient advocacy groups will be essential to advance this field toward clinical translation. Establishing robust partnerships can help navigate challenges related to manufacturing processes, regulatory pathways, ethical considerations, and patient access.  In conclusion, RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes shows great promise as a feasible option for treating inherited retinal diseases. It offers advantages such as targeted correction of pathogenic SNVs without permanent genome alterations, freedom from exogenous protein delivery limitations,and scalability potential. However suitable delivery methods for specific retinal cell targeting efficacy optimization,and addressing challenges related to off-target effects are important considerations going forward.It is expected that with further refinements in technology development,safety assessments,effectiveness evaluations,and regulatory approvals,RNA editing could become a transformative therapeutic strategy for inherited retinal diseases.

"Educational videos have become an increasingly popular tool for healthcare professionals, including nurses, to disseminate information and promote learning. These videos provide an engaging and easily accessible platform for individuals to acquire knowledge on various health-related topics. However, in order to ensure the effectiveness and quality of these educational videos, it is crucial that nursing professionals follow a methodological framework in their production.  The purpose of this integrative review was to evaluate the methodologies used by nursing professionals in the production of educational videos. A thorough search was conducted in databases such as CINAHL, LILACS, and MEDLINE/PubMed to identify primary studies relevant to the topic. After screening through numerous articles, a sample of 19 research studies was selected for inclusion in this review.  To assess the methodological quality of these studies, a tool proposed by Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice was utilized. The results were analyzed descriptively to identify common themes and patterns in the methodologies employed by nursing professionals during different stages of video production.  The three main methodological stages identified were pre-production, production, and post-production. Pre-production involved planning and preparing for video creation such as determining objectives, identifying target audience needs, scripting content, storyboarding visuals or animations if necessary. Production encompassed actually filming or creating visual elements while adhering to a predetermined plan or script outlined during pre-production phases. Post-production included editing footage or animations with audio elements like voiceovers; adding captions subtitles where needed; ensuring accessibility compliance standards are met; etcetera.  Overall findings revealed that most of the included studies adequately addressed these stages during video development and implementation.The authors appropriately described each stage's methodology employed while also considering selected methods on how best they believed each stage should be undertaken based on goals established throughout project(s). However,rigorously following established frameworks/methods/interventions (formal declared structure)was only evident/confirmed/apparent from at least twelve (12-13) studies presented.such a framework provided clear guidelines and objectives for each stage, ensuring the overall efficacy of the video as an educational tool.

"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms and is a significant public health issue, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. It affects over 240 million people globally, with the majority of cases occurring in this region. To combat this disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the regular mass administration of praziquantel (PZQ) drugs, accompanied by social mobilization and health education programs.  In endemic communities along Lake Albert in Western Uganda, where schistosomiasis prevalence is high, mass drug administration (MDA) programs are crucial for the control and prevention of the disease. However, there are times when MDA activities may be delayed or not implemented due to various reasons such as resource constraints or logistical challenges.  The aim of this study was to explore the health-seeking behaviors of individuals within these communities regarding schistosomiasis treatment in the absence of MDA programs. By understanding where individuals seek treatment during these gaps in MDA coverage, policymakers can better address gaps in healthcare access and ensure effective implementation strategies for achieving WHO's target of 75% coverage and uptake by 2030.  A qualitative study was conducted in January and February 2020 in Kagadi and Ntoroko - two endemic communities along Lake Albert. Twelve key informants including local leaders, village health teams (VHTs), and health workers were interviewed. Additionally, 28 focus group discussions were held involving 251 community members who were purposively selected.  The data collected from interviews and focus group discussions were transcribed and analyzed using a thematic analysis model. The findings revealed that individuals rarely sought medication for schistosomiasis-related signs or symptoms from government hospitals or primary healthcare facilities like health centers II, III or IV. Instead, they relied on community volunteers like VHTs or sought treatment from private facilities such as clinics or drug shops nearby. Some even turned to traditional sources such as witch doctors or herbalists.  Several factors were found to influence this preference for seeking treatment outside of the government healthcare system. These included the unavailability of PZQ drugs in government health facilities, negative attitudes from health workers towards patients, long distances and poor road conditions leading to government hospitals or health facilities, high costs associated with obtaining medication, and negative perceptions surrounding the effectiveness and safety of PZQ.  One significant challenge highlighted by the study was the limited availability and accessibility of PZQ. To address this issue and improve uptake within these communities, it is crucial to bring schistosomiasis treatment and services closer to endemic areas. This can be achieved by stocking nearby healthcare facilities with an adequate supply of PZQ medication so that individuals can easily access treatment. Moreover, it is vital to conduct contextualized awareness campaigns that debunk myths and misconceptions surrounding PZQ in order to increase acceptability within these communities.  In conclusion, understanding health-seeking behaviors during gaps in MDA programs is crucial for refining implementation strategies for schistosomiasis control efforts. By addressing challenges related to drug availability/accessibility and improving community awareness through targeted education initiatives, policymakers can work towards achieving WHO's vision of reducing schistosomiasis prevalence significantly by 2030.",continue
"Tobacco use is a major public health issue worldwide, causing significant morbidity and mortality. In recent years, there has been increased recognition of the need for comprehensive tobacco control policies to tackle this problem. Beijing, as one of the largest and most populous cities in the world, launched a comprehensive tobacco control program that aligns with the guidelines provided by the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).   Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a valuable tool for evaluating the potential health effects of policies and interventions before their implementation. It helps decision-makers understand the potential consequences, both positive and negative, on population health. To conduct an HIA on Beijing's tobacco control policy, it is essential to identify relevant indicators that can capture its impact comprehensively.  In this study, we aimed to develop a set of indicators for scoping an HIA of Beijing's tobacco control policy. We used a modified Delphi process to achieve this objective. The Delphi process allows experts to provide their opinions independently while enabling group consensus through iterations of feedback.  Firstly, we proposed a conceptual framework for assessing the health impacts of tobacco control policies based on two existing models: Driving forces- Pressure- State- Exposure- Effect- Action (DPSEEA) model and Determinants of Health Theory. This framework provided an overall structure within which indicators could be identified.  Next, we reviewed existing surveillance systems and literature related to tobacco control in Beijing. This step helped us identify potential indicators that have been previously used or recommended in similar studies or programs globally.  A working group consisting of 13 experts from various disciplines was established for formulating evaluation criteria for these indicators and carrying out indicator scoring. The experts had expertise in fields such as epidemiology, public health policy analysis, economics, sociology, and environmental sciences.  Each expert independently scored each indicator according to four evaluation criteria: relevance (to assess whether it captures key aspects related to tobacco control), feasibility (to determine whether data is readily available or can be collected easily), reliability (to ascertain the consistency and accuracy of the data source), and sensitivity (to gauge the indicator's ability to detect changes over time).  Indicators that obtained a total score above 80% and had a standard error less than 5 were selected as the final set of indicators. This scoring process ensures that indicators with high relevance, feasibility, reliability, and sensitivity are included in the set.  Overall, out of 36 potential indicators, 23 were selected as part of the final set. The top five indicators based on their scores were smoking prevalence, mortality rate related to smoking-related diseases, hospital admission rate for such diseases, tobacco consumption levels, and hospital admission fees associated with smoking-related diseases.  Furthermore, Kendall's coefficient of concordance was calculated to assess the level of agreement among experts regarding each indicator. The coefficient indicated statistically significant consistency for all model compositions.  In conclusion, this study successfully identified a set of 23 indicators for scoping an HIA on Beijing's comprehensive tobacco control policy. The selected indicators achieved high scores for relevance, feasibility, reliability, and sensitivity. These indicators have great potential in facilitating evaluations of tobacco control policies in similar urban settings globally.  Future research should focus on utilizing these indicators in empirical data analysis to further evaluate Beijing's tobacco control program effectively. Additionally, HIA studies using these indicator sets can serve as informative resources for decision-makers when formulating or assessing tobacco control policies worldwide.",continue

"Cervical cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers affecting women worldwide. With an annual incidence of about 0.5 million cases and resulting in over 0.3 million fatalities, it is imperative to develop accurate and efficient methods for its detection.  Traditionally, the diagnosis of cervical cancer has been carried out manually using Pap smear tests. However, this approach carries the risk of false positive or false negative results, leading to misdiagnosis and delay in treatment. Therefore, there is a pressing need for automatic detection methods that can effectively analyze Pap smear images.  In this paper, we aim to address this need by reviewing several existing detection methods from previous studies. We focus on three main aspects: pre-processing techniques, framework for nucleus detection, and performance analysis of the selected method.  Firstly, we review various pre-processing techniques that are commonly applied to enhance the quality of Pap smear images before further analysis. These techniques include image normalization, noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and segmentation. By improving image quality through these pre-processing steps, we can facilitate more accurate nucleus detection.  Next, we explore different frameworks for nucleus detection in cervical cancer cells. This involves identifying cell nuclei within the Pap smear images as they serve as important indicators for diagnosing cervical cancer. Several approaches have been proposed in previous research studies such as thresholding-based methods or advanced machine learning algorithms like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We evaluate each method based on its accuracy in detecting nuclei within a given dataset.  To determine which method performs best among those reviewed earlier on our selected dataset - Herlev Dataset - we experiment with four different approaches using Matlab software platform famous known for extensive image processing capabilities; then evaluate their performance according to various assessment metrics such as precision (how well it correctly identifies positive samples), sensitivity (how well it detects all true positive samples), specificity (how well it correctly classifies negative samples) overall accuracy (combination precision & specificity) and PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio).  Based on our experimental results, we found that Method 1, which utilizes thresholding and trace region boundaries in a binary image, outperformed the other methods. It achieved a precision value of 1.0, sensitivity of 98.77%, specificity of 98.76%, accuracy of 98.77%, and PSNR value of 25.74% for a single type of cell in our dataset. The average values for these metrics across all cell types were also high: precision (0.99), sensitivity (90.71%), specificity (96.55%), accuracy (92.91%), and PSNR value (16.  22%). These performance assessment values indicate that our proposed improvement method is more effective in detecting the nucleus of cervical cancer cells compared to existing methods from previous studies.  Furthermore, we compare our results with those obtained from the literature to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing approaches for nucleus detection in cervical cancer cells.  In conclusion, this paper presents an improvement method for cervical cancer detection by reviewing various pre-processing techniques, framework options for nucleus detection, and evaluating their performance using Matlab software platform with Herlev Dataset as input data source.  Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed improvement method achieves higher performance assessment values compared to existing methods from previous studies.  This study contributes valuable insights into existing detection techniques for cervical cancer and can serve as a strong foundation for future research efforts towards developing more accurate and efficient solutions in this critical area of healthcare management",continue

As conventional antibiotics become less effective against these resistant strains, there is an urgent need to explore alternative therapeutic options.  Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), also known as host defense peptides, are small cationic molecules that play a crucial role in innate immunity. These peptides exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by targeting bacterial cell membranes or intracellular components. AMPs have shown tremendous potential as novel therapeutic agents due to their rapid bactericidal action and low propensity for inducing resistance.  However, the effectiveness of AMPs against Mtb has been a matter of debate due to the unique features of its cell wall architecture. The mycobacterial cell wall comprises three distinct layers: an outer lipid-rich layer called mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex (mAGP), a middle layer consisting primarily of arabinogalactan polysaccharides linked to peptidoglycan via β-(1→5)-glycosidic bonds, and an inner phospholipid bilayer. This complex cell wall structure provides Mtb with characteristics such as impermeability to hydrophilic compounds and resistance to immune-mediated killing.  The presence of lipids such as mycolic acids in the mAGP layer offers increased protection against hydrophobic substances like AMPs that primarily interact with bacterial membranes composed mainly of phospholipids. Moreover, certain modifications in lipid constituents further contribute to Mtb's ability to evade immune responses and drug therapy. For example, trehalose-6-mycolate, a mycolic acid derivative in the cell wall, has been demonstrated to inhibit phagosome maturation and impede antimicrobial peptide activity.  Despite these challenges posed by the Mtb cell wall, several studies have shown promising results regarding AMPs' ability to kill Mtb or reduce its viability. Numerous naturally occurring AMPs and their synthetic derivatives have exhibited potent activity against Mtb both in vitro and in animal models. These include cathelicidin LL-37, defensins, histatins, lactoferrin-derived peptides, and various synthetic peptides designed based on AMP characteristics.  To enhance the efficacy of AMPs against Mtb, researchers are also exploring combination therapies alongside conventional antibiotics. Synergistic interactions between specific antibiotics like rifampicin or isoniazid and certain AMPs have been reported to enhance bactericidal activity against drug-resistant strains. This approach holds promise for mitigating the development of resistance while improving treatment outcomes.  Additionally, innovative strategies are being pursued to overcome the barriers imposed by the mycobacterial cell wall. One approach involves modifying existing AMPs or designing novel molecules with enhanced membrane-penetrating abilities or intrinsic resistance to degradation by host enzymes present in infected individuals. Another strategy focuses on utilizing nanotechnology-based delivery systems that could improve the drug's stability and enable efficient penetration of difficult-to-reach intracellular niches where Mtb resides.  In conclusion, although Mycobacterium tuberculosis presents formidable challenges with its unique cell wall structure, antimicrobial peptides hold great potential as an alternative therapeutic option for combating this global health threat. The ongoing research efforts aimed at exploring synergistic combinations with conventional antibiotics and developing innovative delivery systems augur well for future advancements in this field. Further investigation is warranted to uncover novel strategies that can effectively target Mycobacterium tuberculosis while minimizing side effects on host cells during treatment regimens involving antimicrobial peptides.",continue
"The global challenge of achieving high COVID-19 vaccine booster coverage requires the identification of effective communication interventions to improve acceptance and uptake. This study aimed to test the effects of persuasive messages about COVID-19 vaccine booster doses on the intention to vaccinate among eligible adults in Australia.  In this online randomized controlled trial, adult participants were randomly assigned to receive one of four intervention messages or a control message. The control message provided information about booster dose eligibility, while intervention messages added different persuasive strategies. These strategies included emphasizing personal health benefits, community health benefits, non-health benefits, and personal agency in choosing vaccination.  After the intervention, participants were asked about their intention to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccine and their beliefs surrounding vaccination. The intervention groups were compared to the control group using tests of proportions, with differences of ≥5 percentage points considered clinically significant. A subgroup analysis was also conducted among hesitant participants who expressed uncertainty or resistance towards getting vaccinated.  Out of 487 consenting and randomized participants, 442 (90.8%) completed the experiment and were included in the analysis. Among all participants, those who viewed messages emphasizing non-health benefits had the highest intention to get vaccinated compared to those who viewed the control message (percentage point difference: 9.0%, 95% CI -0.8%, 18.8%, p = 0.071). Moreover, when looking specifically at hesitant individuals within this intervention group compared to hesitant individuals in the control group, there was an even higher increase in intention (percentage point difference: 15.6%, 95% CI -6.o%, 37.%3,p = 0.l50).  Conversely, for hesitant individuals who viewed messages emphasizing personal agency in choosing vaccination compared to those in the control group, there was a lower intention observed (percentage point difference: -10.S%,95%CI -33.OX1l4,P=O.l30). However, it is important to note that the evidence supporting these findings is weak.  Based on these results, health authorities should consider highlighting non-health benefits in their communication efforts to encourage COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake. However, messaging emphasizing personal agency should be used cautiously. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of communication messages and strategies aimed at improving COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake.  This study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and can be found on their trial webpage (ACTRN12622001404718). By conducting this randomized controlled trial and evaluating different persuasive message strategies, the study offers important evidence for public health authorities and policymakers in Australia as they continue to address the challenges of achieving high COVID-19 vaccine booster coverage. 2. Background:  As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and new variants emerge, it is crucial to prioritize population-wide vaccination efforts. Vaccination provides protection against severe illness and hospitalization, reduces the spread of the virus, and helps us move towards achieving herd immunity. In many countries, including Australia, booster doses are now recommended for certain populations to enhance immune response and provide long-term protection.  However, achieving high coverage of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses presents its own challenges. Vaccine hesitancy remains a significant barrier in some populations, with concerns ranging from safety and efficacy to misinformation circulating on social media platforms. Effective communication strategies that address these concerns and promote confidence in vaccination are essential.  Persuasive messaging plays a critical role in shaping individuals' attitudes and behaviors towards vaccination. By employing various strategies tailored to different target audiences, health authorities can increase acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccine boosters amongst eligible adults.  3. Methods:  To investigate the effects of persuasive messages on intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 with booster doses, this study employed an online randomized controlled trial design. Adult participants were recruited through various channels such as social media advertisements or email invitations from healthcare providers.  After obtaining informed consent, participants were randomly assigned to one of four intervention groups or a control group. The intervention groups received messages emphasizing personal health benefits, community health benefits, non-health benefits (e.g., improved travel opportunities), or personal agency in vaccination decision-making. The control group received standard information about booster dose eligibility without any additional persuasive content.  Following exposure to their assigned messages, participants completed a survey assessing their intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose as well as their beliefs regarding vaccination more broadly. Intention was measured using Likert scale items ranging from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree,"" while belief measures included items assessing perceived vaccine safety and effectiveness.  Data analysis involved comparing proportions between intervention groups (including sub-group analysis among hesitant participants) and the control group using appropriate statistical tests. Differences of 5 percentage points or more were considered clinically significant.  4. Results:  Of the 487 participants who consented and were randomized, 442 completed the experiment and were included in the analysis. Among all participants, those who viewed messages emphasizing non-health benefits had significantly higher intention to vaccinate compared to the control group (percentage point difference: 9.0%, 95% CI -0.8%, 18.8%, p = 0.071).  Interestingly, among hesitant individuals, this intervention group showed an even larger increase in intention compared to hesitant individuals in the control group (percentage point difference: 15.6%, 95% CI -6.o%,37.%3,p=O.l50). Conversely, hesitant individuals who viewed messages emphasizing personal agency had lower intention compared to those in the control group (percentage point difference: -10.S%,95%CI-33.OX1l4,P=O.l30). However, as previously noted, evidence supporting these findings is weak.  5. Discussion:  These findings contribute valuable insights into persuasive messaging strategies for promoting COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake among eligible adults in Australia. The emphasis on non-health benefits appears promising as it positively influenced both overall intention and intentions among hesitant individuals.  However, caution is warranted when utilizing messages focusing on personal agency since they resulted in lower intentions among hesistant individuals—an important subgroup where high vaccination rates are crucial for achieving population protection.  Overall, these results can inform public health authorities about effective communication interventions that may improve acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses in Australia's adult population.These findings highlight key considerations for message development and strategic planning aimed at enhancing engagement with vaccination campaigns.  Moving forward, further research should continue exploring innovative approaches to address vaccine hesitancy while continuously adapting strategies based on emerging evidence about new variants or changing circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  6. Conclusion:  Achieving high vaccine booster coverage is an ongoing global challenge, and effective communication interventions play a vital role in improving acceptance and uptake. This study's findings suggest that highlighting non-health benefits to encourage COVID-19 vaccine booster uptake among eligible adults in Australia is promising.  However, messages emphasizing personal agency should be used with caution due to their potential negative impact on hesitant individuals' intention to vaccinate. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring persuasive communication strategies based on specific target audiences and their information needs.  By implementing evidence-based messaging approaches informed by empirical research, health authorities can contribute to increasing vaccine acceptance, combating hesitancy, and ultimately protecting individuals and communities from the detrimental effects of COVID-19.",continue
"Title: Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Community Health in the Arctic Region  Abstract: The discourse on vulnerability to COVID-19 or any other pandemic has traditionally focused on susceptibility to disease outbreaks. This approach typically relies on the assessment of vulnerability using universal indicators, without fully considering the unique socioeconomic, cultural, and demographic characteristics of specific communities. As a result, this method may underestimate Arctic communities' capacity to withstand and recover from pandemic exposure. A more comprehensive understanding of vulnerability and resilience is essential for accurate assessment and effective response planning.  Previous studies have recognized vulnerability as a dynamic concept influenced by multiple dimensions. However, limited research has explored how community resilience can influence overall vulnerability during pandemics or other health crises in remote regions with large Indigenous populations. Understanding these interrelated dimensions offers valuable insight into identifying which populations are at greatest risk or in need of specific interventions.  The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel approach that incorporates both vulnerability and resilience as distinct but interrelated dimensions when assessing the potential impact of climate change-related health risks on remote Arctic communities. Specifically, we focus on addressing the research question: ""What is the relationship between environmental changes induced by climate change and their impact on community health in the Arctic?""  The rapidly changing climate poses significant challenges for fragile ecosystems and vulnerable communities worldwide. In particular, Arctic regions are experiencing accelerated warming that leads to various ecological shifts such as declining sea ice coverage, permafrost thawing, changes in wildlife migration patterns, alterations to traditional subsistence practices among Indigenous peoples living in these regions.  These environmental changes directly affect community health through additional stressors such as increased exposure to contaminants (e.g., pollutants released from melting sea ice), altered food security resulting from disrupted subsistence hunting and fishing activities due to changing animal habitats or reduced availability of traditional food sources.  Understanding how these environmental shifts interact with societal factors within different contexts is crucial for developing effective adaptation strategies tailored specifically for Arctic communities facing the multi-dimensional challenges posed by climate change-related health risks. By integrating vulnerability and resilience into our assessment framework, we aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how Arctic communities can cope with and adapt to such challenges.  To operationalize this new approach, we present a case study focused on the state of Alaska's Arctic communities. Drawing from existing data sources, including census data and health records, we develop a pandemic vulnerability-resilience framework that incorporates community-level risk factors associated with COVID-19 or future pandemics' epidemiological outcomes.  Through an integrated analysis combining vulnerability and resilience indices, our study reveals variations in disease severity across highly vulnerable census areas and boroughs within Alaska. Notably, areas displaying higher levels of resilience have demonstrated lower cumulative death rates per 100 000 population and case fatality ratios. This finding highlights the importance of considering both vulnerability and resilience when planning for public health emergencies.  The insights gained from incorporating these dual dimensions could facilitate accurate identification of populations or communities at high risk or requiring specific support during pre-pandemic preparation as well as during an evolving crisis. Our proposed resilience-vulnerability-focused approach has broader implications as it can be applied to assess potential impacts of COVID-19 or similar future health crises in other remote regions worldwide characterized by large Indigenous populations.  Overall, this research contributes to bridging important gaps in current literature around assessing complex social-ecological systems' adaptive capacity in the face of climate change-related health risks. Our hope is that this integrated approach will inform policymakers, public officials, and concerned parties about effective allocation strategies for resources and services crucial for enhancing community resilience in Arctic regions worldwide facing similar environmental challenges induced by various climate-related hazards.

"Introduction:  The intersection of traditional medicine and digitalization has emerged as a new paradigm in healthcare, offering unique opportunities and challenges for the management of acute heart failure. Acute heart failure continues to be a significant global health concern, with high disease-related morbidity and mortality rates. As such, there is an increasing need for novel strategies to address this pressing issue.  Traditional collegiate therapies have played a crucial role in the treatment of acute heart failure. However, recent developments in digital healthcare present promising prospects for further enhancing management strategies through the integration of Western and Chinese medicine. By combining these two distinct medical systems, there is potential to revolutionize the approach towards acute heart failure management.  Acute heart failure encompasses a range of conditions involving the sudden inability of the heart to pump blood effectively. It is characterized by symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, fluid retention, and impaired organ perfusion (1). Despite advancements in conventional medical practices including drug therapy, device interventions like implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), mechanical circulatory support devices (e.g., ventricular assist devices), cardiac transplantation, and invasive procedures like coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), acute heart failure remains difficult to manage effectively.  Digitalization has brought forth new possibilities for improving healthcare outcomes through advanced technological interventions. The incorporation of digital tools into medical practice enables precise monitoring and analysis of patient data pertaining to vital signs such as blood pressure variations, electrocardiogram patterns, body temperature fluctuations among others. This real-time data can provide clinicians with valuable insights into disease progression trends leading up to acute episodes or early warning signs that may predict deterioration or exacerbation.  Furthermore, by fostering seamless communication between patients and healthcare providers through telemedicine platforms or remote monitoring systems enables remote consultation incorporating elements from both Western medicine practiced globally alongside traditional Chinese medicine approaches largely practiced in Eastern countries. This approach to management addresses barriers like geography, accessibility, and availability of healthcare resources.  Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers a unique perspective on health and disease management. It has been practiced for thousands of years and encompasses a holistic approach to patient care. TCM places significant emphasis on preventive measures, aiming to maintain the balance between Yin and Yang energy forces within the body. In contrast, Western medicine tends to focus more on diagnosis and treatment after symptoms arise.  The combination of Western medicine with TCM in acute heart failure management holds considerable potential as it can leverage the strengths of both systems. By incorporating elements from TCM such as acupuncture, herbal remedies, dietary modifications specific to individual constitution types (e.g., Qi deficiency or blood stasis), alongside Western therapies like pharmacotherapeutics or device interventions based on evidence-based guidelines can introduce an integrative model for comprehensive patient care.  This article aims to review the current status and subdisciplinary impact of digitization in healthcare specifically concerning acute heart failure management using combined Chinese and Western medical therapies. Furthermore, it seeks to explore the future prospects for this novel approach by investigating how digital tools integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine with Western treatment modalities can further support cardiovascular health maintenance in populations affected by acute heart failure globally.  In conclusion, acute heart failure poses significant challenges for global healthcare systems due to its high morbidity and mortality rates. The integration of traditional collegiate therapies with digitalization presents a unique opportunity for addressing these challenges from a combined Chinese-Western medical perspective. By leveraging real-time data monitoring technologies alongside incorporating traditional Chinese medicine practices into Western treatment approaches through advanced technological interventions may facilitate personalized care plans tailored specifically towards holistic improvement in cardiovascular health outcomes across diverse populations affected by acute heart failure worldwide.

"Introduction  Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is one of the major oilseed crops globally and plays a vital role in providing nutrition, food security, and economic stability to many countries. However, peanut production faces numerous challenges posed by biotic stresses caused by various pathogens and pests. Biotic stressors such as fungal diseases, viral infections, bacterial infections, nematode infestations, and insect pests significantly limit the yield potential of peanut crops (Janila et al., 2019). These stresses lead to substantial economic losses annually.  To ensure sustainable peanut production and enhance crop resilience against biotic stresses, it is crucial to investigate the underlying mechanisms that enable peanuts to respond and tolerate these stressors effectively. Traditional breeding approaches alone often lack precision when identifying genes responsible for resistance or tolerance traits (Varshney et al., 2013). Therefore, there is a growing need for advanced technologies that can provide insights into the complex molecular networks governing peanut response to biotic stresses.  In recent years, high-throughput omics technologies have emerged as powerful tools for studying plant responses at various molecular levels. Omics approaches encompass genomics (study of complete genomes), transcriptomics (study of gene expression patterns), proteomics (study of proteins), metabolomics (study of metabolites), miRNAomics (study of small non-coding RNA molecules called microRNAs), epigenomics (study of changes in gene expression without alterations in DNA sequence), and phenomics (quantitative analysis of phenotypic traits) among others.  The integration of multiple omics platforms enables researchers to obtain comprehensive insights into complex biological processes occurring during stress responses. By combining functional genomics with other omics data sets such as transcriptomes or proteomes under specific stress conditions researchers can gain a better understanding of how different genes interact with each other within metabolic pathways during the defense response.  Despite advances made through traditional breeding methods in developing peanut cultivars with resistance to biotic stresses, we still lack a complete understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying these traits. This gap hampers our ability to exploit the full potential of peanut's natural defense mechanisms against pathogens and pests.  Therefore, this review aims to highlight recent advances in various omics approaches applied specifically to investigate peanut responses and tolerance to biotic stresses. We will discuss how genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, miRNAomics, epigenomics, and phenomics have contributed towards identifying genes involved in response pathways for various pathogens or pest stressors. Additionally, we will explore integration strategies for these omics technologies that have proven successful in elucidating temporal and spatial changes that occur during peanut defense responses.  This comprehensive review will also discuss the challenges faced by researchers when employing omics technologies in studying peanut response to biotic stresses. Furthermore, it will provide insights into future directions for improving our understanding of peanut's resistance/tolerance mechanisms using omics approaches.  Ultimately, by unraveling the complex networks involved in peanut's response to biotic stresses through integrative omics approaches such as genomics and transcriptomics among others , we hope to enhance sustainable food production by developing peanuts with enhanced resistance or tolerance traits against diverse pathogenic diseases and pests. These advancements are critical as they align with global efforts aimed at meeting future food demands for a rapidly growing population while reducing dependence on chemical interventions that may harm human health or the environment.",create
"Introduction  The effectiveness of plant-based dietary patterns in improving health outcomes has been widely acknowledged. Plant-based diets emphasize the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds while minimizing the intake of animal products. Several studies have demonstrated the potential benefits of adopting a plant-based diet in reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and certain types of cancer (Satija et al., 2017; Kahleova et al., 2018).  Despite the growing popularity and acceptance of plant-based diets among health professionals and individuals seeking to improve their overall well-being through dietary choices, there is a lack of consensus on how to define and assess the quality of plant-based diets. Diet quality indices have been developed as tools to evaluate adherence to specific dietary patterns or guidelines. These indices provide a systematic approach for quantifying an individual's adherence to recommended food groups and nutrient intakes.  However, due to variations in design and components across different diet quality indices specifically targeting plant-based diets, there is a need for a comprehensive review that synthesizes existing indices in order to identify common features as well as strengths and considerations associated with their development.  Therefore, this paper aims to address this research gap by conducting a scoping review on approaches used to develop plant-based diet quality indices. By examining their basis for development, scoring methodology,and validation approaches,this review will provide valuable insights into existing literature on plant-based diet quality measures.  To achieve this objective,a systematic search will be performed utilizing three major databases: MEDLINE,CINAHL,and Global Health,dating from 1980 onwards.Following pre-defined inclusi on/exclusion criteria,the articles included will undergo thorough analysis.  The findings from this scoping review will contribute significantly towards enhancing our understanding regarding various aspects related to developing robust measures for assessing the quality of plant-based diets.The key areas covered within this analysis include determining whether these indices are derived from epidemiological evidence, whether they have incorporated existing diet quality measures or country-specific dietary guidelines,and whether they are based on traditional dietary patterns. Additionally,this review will focus on identifying the food groups most commonly included in these indices and the scoring methodologies employed to differentiate between healthier and less healthy plant-based foods.Lastly,the validation approaches utilized by these indices will be scrutinized,with a particular emphasis on construct validity,reliability,and criterion validity.  The findings of this review will serve as an essential guide for researchers and practitioners interested in evaluating adherence to plant-based dietary patterns. By understanding the strengths and limitations associated with different approaches used to develop plant-based diet quality indices, healthcare professionals can make informed decisions when selecting appropriate instruments for research contexts or clinical practice. Moreover, through highlighting areas that require further investigation or refinement, this scoping review will provide future research directions aimed at establishing consensus guidelines towards assessing the quality of plant-based diets consistently.  In conclusion,the importance of promoting healthy eating habits is widely recognized,and as more individuals shift towards plant-based diets to improve their health,it becomes crucial to have standardized measures that accurately assess adherence to such dietary patterns.This scoping review aims to fill a critical research gap by providing a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature on approaches used to develop plant-based diet quality indices.With its findings,this study hopes not only to advance knowledge but also facilitate evidence-informed decision-making among researchers,care providers,policy makers,and individuals seeking guidance regarding food selection for optimal health within the realm of plant-based diets.",create
"Title: Evaluating the Impact of Tumor-Associated Gut Microbiota on Cancer Progression and Therapeutic Response  Abstract: Microorganisms within tumor specimens have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential role in cancer development and treatment response. However, the majority of research has focused on the tumor-associated microbiota found within the tumor microenvironment itself, neglecting a potentially influential factor – the tumor-associated gut microbiota. The purpose of this study is to investigate how alterations in gut microbial composition may influence cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes.  1. Introduction Cancer remains one of the most pressing global challenges, accounting for millions of deaths each year (Bray et al., 2018). Traditional theories attributed cancer initiation and progression solely to genetic alterations within malignant cells. However, recent advancements have highlighted an intricate interplay between a host's physiology, lifestyle factors, and microbial communities residing both within healthy tissues as well as within tumors themselves (Hannigan et al., 2018). These discoveries have led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of tumorigenesis by acknowledging that cancers are not solely driven by autonomous oncogenic events but are also influenced by complex interactions with surrounding cells, extracellular matrix components, immune system mediators, and diverse microorganisms (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018).  While much emphasis has been given to investigating bacterial communities inhabiting various anatomical sites adjacent to tumors or incorporated into their proximity via vasculature or lymphatics (Costello et al., 2020), including those present in lung carcinomas (Greathouse et al., 2020) or breast cancers (Xuan et al., 2021), comparatively less attention has been devoted towards exploring correlations between distant microbial niches such as the gastrointestinal tract - home to an extensive array of commensal microflora - and tumorigenesis.  Recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota, comprising complex microbial populations adapted to this niche, play a crucial role in modulating host immune system function and metabolism (Lee and Lee, 2020). Moreover, the gut microbiota is known to influence various systemic processes through the production of small molecules that can be absorbed into circulation and subsequently exert effects on peripheral tissues (Thaiss et al., 2016). This communication between gut microbes and distant organs raises exciting prospects for studying the potential impact of tumor-associated gut microbiota on cancer progression.  Emerging studies have demonstrated associations between alterations in the abundance and composition of gut microbiota with both cancer incidence and therapeutic efficacy. Manipulation of gut microbial communities has been shown to influence tumor development in preclinical settings by modulating host immune responses through increased production of immunosuppressive factors or altered infiltration by immune cells (Sethi et al., 2018).  Furthermore, recent clinical investigations have revealed intriguing correlations between distinct bacterial taxa residing within the gastrointestinal tract and responses to cancer therapies such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy. These studies suggest that specific microbial signatures could potentially serve as predictive biomarkers for therapeutic outcomes while providing an opportunity for personalized interventions targeting tumor-associated gut microbiota.  Nevertheless, despite these promising findings, many questions remain unanswered. The complexity inherent within human tumors presents significant challenges associated with isolating putative true effects caused by specific microbial communities from confounding variables including individual variability across patients (Schwabe and Jobin, 2013). Consequently, future research should aim at understanding which specific microorganisms are correlated with disease progression or treatment response across different cancer types while considering other influential factors such as host genetic background, geography, diet patterns or antimicrobial usage.  This study seeks to take a step forward from previous investigations by comprehensively exploring how alterations in tumor-associated gut microbiota correlate with cancer progression at various stages across multiple malignancies. Additionally, we aim to elucidate whether modifying these bacterial populations can enhance therapeutic response. Through this research, we hope to provide insights into the role of gut microbial communities in shaping cancer outcomes and offer novel avenues for developing efficacious therapeutic strategies personalized to individual patients' specific gut microbiome profiles. Understanding the tumor-associated gut microbiota's impact on cancer progression and treatment response may represent a critical leap forward in improving patient outcomes and expanding our understanding of complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment.

"1. Introduction  Cardiomyopathies, a group of diseases characterized by structural and functional abnormalities in the heart muscle, represent a significant burden on global healthcare systems. Despite advances in medical treatments and interventions, cardiomyopathies remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide (1). The etiology of cardiomyopathies is multifactorial, involving both environmental risk factors and genetic predisposition (2). While some well-known disease-causing mutations have been identified within protein-coding regions of genes associated with cardiac function, recent studies suggest that noncoding genetic variants also play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these conditions.  Noncoding genetic variants refer to DNA sequence variations that do not alter the amino acid sequence of a protein but instead affect regulatory elements or other functional aspects within the genome (3). Traditionally overshadowed by coding mutations due to their perceived impact on gene expression regulation, noncoding variants are now gaining recognition as key contributors to disease development and progression (4).  Despite increasing evidence supporting the significance of noncoding genetic variants in various human diseases, their role in cardiomyopathies remains largely understudied. This knowledge gap is concerning given that many patients undergoing genetic testing carry such noncoding variants whose contribution to cardiac disease requires further investigation (5). Understanding the impact of these noncoding alleles holds great potential for elucidating novel mechanisms underlying cardiomyopathy development.  This paper aims to address this research gap by presenting an extensive review focusing on studying different types of noncoding genetic variants implicated in various subtypes of cardiomyopathy. We aim to summarize recent studies that have investigated associations between specific types or locations of noncoding alterations - including transcriptional enhancers, promoters, intronic sites, and untranslated regions - with different forms of cardiac disease. By focusing primarily on well-supported associations between variant types and specific pathological phenotypes related to cardiomyopathy subtypes supported by sufficient evidence from multiple studies.  It is critical to emphasize the potential clinical relevance of robust associations between noncoding genetic variants and cardiomyopathies. Recent advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have made genetic testing increasingly accessible and cost-effective for patients with suspected or established cardiomyopathies (6). However, such tests often focus solely on coding regions and may overlook noncoding alleles that significantly contribute to the overall disease burden. Identifying and validating these noncoding variants will yield important mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis, helping clinicians make more accurate diagnoses, assess disease severity, predict prognosis, develop personalized treatment strategies, and potentially even identify novel therapeutic targets.  In conclusion, this comprehensive review aims to fill the current research gap concerning the significance of noncoding genetic variants in the etiology of cardiomyopathies. By summarizing recent literature on different types of noncoding alterations associated with various forms of cardiac diseases, we aim to shed light on their potential contribution to disease development and provide a foundation for further studies aimed at validating their clinical relevance. The insights gained from such research endeavors will contribute to improving genetic screening tests by expanding their scope beyond coding mutations alone and incorporate a broader range of variant types that are equally critical for precise diagnosis, prognostication, and personalized therapeutic interventions in patients with cardiomyopathies.",create

Dentistry, too,stands to benefit immensely from the use of AI-driven technologies. With advancesin machine learning algorithms and computer vision,image recognition systems can be developed to assist in dental imaging interpretationand pathology detection.AI-based tools have demonstrated promising results in automating diagnosisof oral conditions such as caries detection,gum disease assessment,and oral cancer screening.This breakthrough technology speeds up the diagnostic process,enabling early intervention for improved patient outcomes.  Despite these promising advancements, there are challenges associated with integrating AI into medicine and dentistry effectively. Chief among them is ensuring regulatory compliance, data protection, and addressing ethical concerns regarding patient privacy and informed consent.AI-powered systems often rely on extensive datasets to ensure optimal performance.Determining the appropriate balance between using patient data for training algorithmsand respecting individual privacy rights remains a critical point of discussion.The potential bias ingrained within algorithmic decision-making also raises questions about transparency,fairness,and accountability in healthcare practices.A comprehensive examination of these advantages and disadvantages will enable a more thorough understandingof how AI can be used most effectively while addressing any potential drawbacks.  In conclusion,the integration of artificial intelligence has initiated transformative changes within medicineand dentistry. The rapid advances this field is witnessing have the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by providing innovative solutions for improving diagnostics,treatment planning,and personalized care.The subsequent sections will delve into current applications,potential avenues for future research,and discussions around both benefitsand challenges associated with introducing AI into medical and dental practices. By exploring existing literature on this topic,this paper aims to contribute towards theorizing best practices,influencing policymakers,collaborative working groups,and promoting further interdisciplinary research efforts.",create
"Title: Unraveling the Hidden Potential of Glycan-Specific Small Antibody Fragments: A Novel Avenue for Targeting Tumour-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens  Abstract: Glycans, a diverse group of complex carbohydrates, play a pivotal role in modulating various biological processes and are associated with numerous diseases. In cancer biology, aberrant glycosylation patterns give rise to tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs), which serve as attractive targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Conventional antibodies have been widely explored to target these TACAs; however, their limited efficacy in vivo necessitates the exploration of alternative strategies. Recently, small antibody fragments have gained substantial attention due to their smaller size that allows enhanced tumor penetration and improved therapeutic outcomes. This review comprehensively evaluates various small antibody fragments targeting specific glycans on tumour cells and highlights their distinct advantages over conventional antibodies.  1. Introduction  Glycans play an indispensable role in cellular processes by modulating protein function, cellular recognition events, intracellular signaling pathways, and immune responses (1). Involved in numerous physiological functions such as cell adhesion, migration, differentiation and development (2), they contribute significantly to both homeostasis maintenance and pathological conditions including cancer.  Cancer is characterized by complex molecular alterations involving genetic mutations culminating in phenotypic variations within the cell population (3). Among these phenotypic changes are aberrant glycosylation patterns exhibited by tumour cells (4). Distinct glycan structures known as TACAs emerge as a consequence of this aberrant glycosylation process.  Over the years, it has become evident that TACAs possess diagnostic value aiding in early detection and monitoring cancer progression (5). Furthermore, due to their selective expression on malignant cells while being absent or minimally expressed on healthy tissues or benign lesions (6), TACAs represent promising targets for therapeutics.  1.1 Conventional Antibodies: Limitations and Challenges  Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been extensively exploited as therapeutic agents for various diseases, including cancer (7). However, conventional full-length mAbs possess inherent limitations that impede their efficacy in the context of TACA targeting. The dense glycocalyx surrounding tumour cells hampers the efficient penetration of large molecular entities such as full-length mAbs into the tumour microenvironment (8). This restricted access limits their binding to TACAs, thereby compromising their therapeutic potential.  Moreover, conventional antibodies are inefficient at inducing immune effector functions within solid tumors due to their larger size and limited tissue penetration capabilities (9). This further contributes to compromised clinical outcomes following antibody therapy.  To overcome these challenges, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to developing alternative antibody formats with improved accessibility and efficacy in vivo.  1.2 Small Antibody Fragments: Unveiling New Possibilities  In recent years, small antibody fragments encompassing single-chain variable fragments (scFvs), diabodies, nanobodies or antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) have emerged as a novel class of affinity reagents with distinct advantages over conventional full-length mAbs. These compact formats exhibit superior target specificity and binding affinity while retaining smaller sizes favorable for improved tissue penetration and better tumor access.  The reduced molecular weight not only enables more efficient extravasation into tumoral tissues but also facilitates enhanced targeting due to reduced steric hindrance imposed by bulky domains present in full-length monoclonal antibodies. Consequently, smaller dimensions permit a higher density of molecules per dose reaching the desired targets on the cell surface or within tumor interstitial spaces.  Furthermore, small antibody fragments demonstrate an extended serum half-life attributed mainly to their renal clearance property along with minimal immunogenicity concerns compared to larger protein constructs such as IgG molecules. These factors collectively contribute towards improving pharmacokinetic profiles while reducing the likelihood of adverse reactions.  1.3 Aim of the Review  In light of the above, this review aims to comprehensively explore and evaluate the current landscape of small antibody fragments targeted towards specific glycans on tumour cells. We aim to highlight their distinct advantages over conventional full-length mAbs, discuss recent advances, examine their in vivo efficacy and potential clinical applications, as well as address challenges associated with their development and translation into clinical practice.  By uncovering the untapped potential of small antibody fragments targeting TACAs, this review seeks to provide insights into innovative therapeutic approaches that hold promise for significantly improving cancer diagnostics and treatment outcomes.",create
"Title: Predictors of Doxycycline Acceptability and Adherence among Kenyan Women Using HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) for the Prevention of Sexually Transmitted Infections  Abstract: The global incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been on the rise over the past decade, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where young women face a disproportionately high burden of both curable STIs and HIV. To address this urgent public health concern, recent research has explored the potential use of doxycycline as a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent STIs. However, existing clinical trials on doxycycline PEP have primarily focused on men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income settings. It is crucial to expand this research to include women within diverse populations.  This study aims to investigate predictors of acceptability and adherence to doxycycline PEP among Kenyan women who are concurrently using oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for STI prevention. By examining baseline characteristics, including sociodemographic factors, sexual behaviors, risk perception, stigma associated with STIs, awareness about PrEP and doxycycline PEP, accessing healthcare services related to sexual health concerns, and perceived barriers and facilitators affecting PrEP adherence among female PrEP users in Kenya.  2. Introduction High rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including Neisseria gonorrhoeae(n.g.), Chlamydia trachomatis(c.t.),and Treponema pallidum(t.p.), pose significant challenges to global public health systems in terms of disease burden and economic costs [1]. Sub-Saharan Africa is severely affected by the dual epidemics of HIV/AIDS and STIs [2]. Notably, young cisgender women residing in this region demonstrate disproportionately high rates of both curable STIs and HIV infections, making them a key population for targeted interventions.  To curb the increasing rates of STIs, novel prevention strategies are urgently needed. Recent studies have shown promising results in the use of doxycycline as a PEP agent to prevent bacterial STI acquisition [3,4]. Although existing clinical trials have primarily focused on men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income countries [5], it is imperative to explore the potential impact of doxycycline PEP among women in sub-Saharan Africa.  The current study seeks to investigate predictors of acceptability and adherence to doxycycline PEP among Kenyan women using oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for STI prevention. This research aims to address critical knowledge gaps by examining various sociodemographic factors, sexual behaviors, risk perceptions regarding acquiring STIs, stigma related to STIs and PrEP utilization, awareness about PrEP and doxycycline PEP, barriers and facilitators affecting access to healthcare services pertaining to sexual health concerns such as obtaining regular screening for STIs and timely initiation of treatment.  Understanding the predictors influencing the acceptability and adherence patterns towards doxycycline PEP among Kenyan women using HIV PrEP can inform tailored interventions that effectively target this at-risk population. By identifying determinants associated with successful engagement with both PrEP regimens (HIV PrEP and doxycycline as a novel preventive strategy), researchers can design evidence-based intervention programs that promote optimal uptake, adherence rates above 80%, consistent condom usage promotion strategies during sexual encounters with divergent partners especially under circumstances involving transactional sex practices that might compromise health outcomes otherwise.  Furthermore, this study will examine contextual factors surrounding access to healthcare facilities providing comprehensive sexual health services such as counseling on safer sex practices including condom negotiation skills training sessions adapted from evidence-based behavioral interventions proven efficacious in previous research with young women in sub-Saharan Africa [6,7].Such insights will inform the development of targeted interventions tailored to address the specific needs and challenges faced by Kenyan women in accessing and adhering to doxycycline PEP within the context of HIV PrEP use.  In conclusion, this study seeks to provide valuable insights into predictors of acceptability and adherence among Kenyan women using doxycycline PEP as an additional prevention strategy while also taking oral HIV PrEP. By elucidating key factors that influence uptake and adherence, this research can shape effective strategies aimed at reducing STI transmission rates among vulnerable populations, specifically cisgender women in sub-Saharan Africa. Such efforts are crucial for achieving sustainable public health goals related to sexual health within global communities.",create
"Introduction:  The Olig gene family, consisting of Olig1, Olig2, and Olig3, encodes members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. These factors are essential for cellular specification and differentiation in both the developing and mature central nervous system (CNS). Over the past decade, extensive research has elucidated the vital roles played by Olig1 and Olig2 in CNS development as well as their implications in brain cancer.  Brain cancer is a devastating disease that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Gliomas are among the most common types of brain tumors, deriving from glial cells within the CNS. The heterogeneity and aggressive nature of gliomas pose significant challenges for effective treatment strategies. Current therapies including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have limited success due to tumor recurrence and therapeutic resistance.  There is growing evidence suggesting that dysregulation of transcription factors plays a critical role in glioma progression. The abnormal expression or function of these transcription factors can disrupt cellular differentiation processes underlying glioma development. Among these transcription factors, increasing attention has been focused on members of the Olig gene family - particularly Olig2.  Recent studies have demonstrated that aberrant overexpression of Olig2 contributes to glioma growth promotion and therapeutic resistance. High levels of Olig2 correlate with unfavorable clinical outcomes such as rapid tumor progression and poor patient survival rates. Furthermore, experimental models using genetic manipulation techniques have shown that inhibition or depletion of Oligt genes can suppress tumor cell proliferation while enhancing sensitivity to radiation therapy or chemotherapy.  The precise molecular mechanisms by which aberrantly expressed Olgi genes contribute to gliomagenesis remain incompletely understood; however, several key pathways have been implicated in mediating their effects on tumor growth: Notch signaling pathway activation; regulation neuronal differentiation through direct repression targeting proneuronal genes; cross-talk with other oncogenic pathways like EGFR signaling leading to cell invasion and migration; and modulation of stem cell properties in glioma-initiating cells. These findings highlight the intricate involvement of the Olig family in multiple cellular processes related to cancer progression.  Based on these intriguing observations, it is evident that targeting members of the Olig gene family may hold therapeutic promise for brain cancer treatment. Developing novel strategies aimed at disrupting Olig2 function or expression could potentially inhibit glioma growth and sensitize tumor cells to conventional therapies, thereby improving patient outcomes.  In this comprehensive review, we aim to summarize the biological functions of the Olig gene family, with a particular emphasis on Olig2, in brain cancer. We will explore their roles in cellular specification and differentiation within normal CNS development as well as their implicated contributions to glioma progression. Additionally, we will discuss potential therapeutic approaches targeting the Olig gene family that have shown promise in preclinical studies or early clinical trials.  Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which aberrantly expressed Olgi genes contribute to gliomagenesis will pave the way for developing novel targeted therapies specifically tailored towards disrupting their oncogenic effects. Ultimately, such therapeutic interventions may revolutionize current treatment paradigms for brain cancer patients and improve overall survival rates.  As the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer continues to evolve, there is a growing appreciation for the intricate interplay between transcription factors and tumorigenesis. Transcription factors are critical regulators of gene expression, controlling key cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of these factors can disrupt normal cellular homeostasis and contribute to tumor initiation and progression.  The Olig gene family has emerged as an important group of transcription factors implicated in both normal central nervous system (CNS) development and brain cancer. The family consists of three members - Olig1, Olig2, and Olig3 - which belong to the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) family. They are known to play crucial roles in cellular specification and differentiation within the CNS.  In the context of brain cancer, increasing attention has been directed towards understanding the functions of Olig genes, particularly Olig2. Gliomas represent a significant subset within brain tumors that exhibit high heterogeneity and aggressive behavior. Therefore, identifying key molecular players contributing to gliomagenesis is essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies.  Studies have revealed that aberrant expression or activity levels of Olig2 have profound implications in glioma progression. Additionally, its overexpression has been associated with increased resistance to radiation therapy and chemotherapy in gliomas patients. Understanding how dysregulated Olig genes contribute mechanistically towards these aggressive tumor phenotypes will provide invaluable insights towards developing effective therapeutic interventions.  This review aims to comprehensively summarize our current knowledge about the biological functions of the entire Olig gene family within CNS development as well as their specific implications in brain cancer pathogenesis with an emphasis on gliomas. By dissecting their roles at various stages during CNS development from neural stem cell specification through lineage commitment into mature glial cell populations like astrocytes or oligodendrocytes alongside their maintenance; we aim also explore potential signaling pathways in which they participate. Additionally, through examining the specific contributions of Olig2 in gliomagenesis and therapeutic resistance development, we hope to gain insights into possible therapeutic targets.  Furthermore, we will discuss emerging evidence indicating that targeting the Olig gene family may hold therapeutic promise for brain cancer treatment. Various strategies have been developed to modulate Olig gene function or expression selectively, including small molecule inhibitors, RNA interference-based approaches such as siRNAs or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and novel gene editing techniques like CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout systems. By dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying these interventions and summarizing preclinical studies or early clinical trials investigating their effectiveness in inhibiting tumor growth and sensitizing glioma cells to conventional therapies; it is hoped that this review will provide valuable insights into potential future directions for developing targeted therapies.  In conclusion, understanding the roles of the Olig gene family in normal CNS development as well as their implications in brain cancer pathogenesis is crucial for advancing our knowledge of tumorigenesis. Targeting dysregulated members within this family opens up exciting possibilities for developing novel and effective therapeutic approaches for patients with brain cancer. Through an analysis of existing literature along with recent advancements, this review aims to consolidate current knowledge on the biological functions of Olig genes within CNS development while highlighting their relevance in glioma progression.",create

"Introduction:  The widespread prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) poses a significant burden on individuals, healthcare systems, and economies worldwide. MSDs encompass a wide range of conditions affecting the muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments, and other components of the musculoskeletal system. These disorders can lead to chronic pain and functional impairment, greatly impacting an individual's quality of life (QoL) and overall well-being.  Rehabilitation is a fundamental component in the management of MSDs as it aims to restore function, reduce pain, improve physical strength and mobility while enhancing QoL. Traditional rehabilitation approaches have predominantly relied on face-to-face interactions between patients and healthcare professionals in clinic settings. However, with recent advancements in digital healthcare technologies (DHC), there is growing potential for integrating digital tools into rehabilitation practices.  DHC refers to the use of digital technologies such as mobile applications (apps), virtual or augmented reality devices (VR/AR), wearable sensors or trackers, telehealth platforms, web-based interventions or any combination thereof to deliver healthcare services remotely or enhance traditional care approaches. These interventions can provide real-time feedback on exercise performance or adherence monitoring while offering personalized guidance tailored to individual needs.  Despite their potential benefits for improving patient outcomes in MSD rehabilitation settings such as increased accessibilities regardless of geographical location or limited transportation capabilities DHC-enabled interventions are still receiving limited empirical attention concerning their effectiveness compared to conventional rehabilitation methods.  This article aims to address this gap by examining the effects of DHC-enabled rehabilitation interventions on musculoskeletal pain relief and QoL in individuals with various MSDs using systematic review methodology along with meta-analytic techniques.  2.

By systematically identifying, synthesizing, and analyzing existing literature on DHC-enabled rehabilitation in MSDs, this review aims to contribute to evidence-based practice by providing healthcare professionals with comprehensive insights into the comparative effectiveness of these interventions. Additionally, this review will highlight knowledge gaps within current research literature and offer recommendations for further investigation to guide future research endeavors. Ultimately, this information can potentially inform clinical decision-making processes regarding the adoption and implementation of DHC-enabled rehabilitation programs for individuals with MSDs.  In conclusion, given the rising prevalence of MSDs worldwide coupled with advances in digital healthcare technologies, it is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of DHC-enabled rehabilitation approaches compared to conventional methods. This systematic review aims to consolidate available evidence on pain reduction and QoL improvement associated with DHC-based interventions while highlighting areas requiring further research. The findings from this comprehensive analysis will provide valuable insights into best practices for utilizing digital tools within musculoskeletal rehabilitation settings while contributing to a more personalized approach towards improving outcomes for individuals suffering from various MSDs.",create
"1. Introduction  Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has revolutionized the treatment landscape for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), improving patient outcomes and survival rates significantly. However, not all patients respond to ICI therapy, and some even experience immune-related adverse events. Therefore, identifying reliable biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with ICI is crucial for personalized treatment approaches.  While programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor expression has been used as a predictive biomarker for ICI response, its limitations and imperfect results necessitate the exploration of alternative markers. This manuscript aims to review the emerging soluble biomarkers based on liquid biopsy techniques that have shown promise in modifying clinical practice for NSCLC management.  Liquid biopsies offer a novel approach to assess disease characteristics by analyzing specific components in peripheral blood samples instead of requiring invasive tissue biopsies. By interrogating various components of liquid biopsies, we can potentially identify predictive markers that have greater accuracy and are more readily accessible than traditional tumor biopsy specimens.  It is becoming increasingly evident that non-tumoral blood cell count parameters hold significant prognostic value in cancer progression and response to therapy. In this study, we focus on several non-tumoral blood cell count-based markers including absolute neutrophil counts, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (dNLR). These readily available hematological parameters have shown promise as prognostic indicators across various cancer types, including NSCLC.  Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that soluble-derived immune checkpoint-related products may serve as potential predictive biomarkers. Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1), which reflects circulating PD-L1 levels rather than intratumoral expression alone, has been implicated in immunotherapy response prediction. The analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), including their detection, count, and expression of specific markers, and the evaluation of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-related products are also being actively studied as liquid biopsy-based predictive biomarkers.  This review aims to explore the current understanding of these promising soluble biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with ICI. Additionally, we aim to assess their potential implementation into current clinical practice to guide treatment decisions in a more biologically-driven manner.  In conclusion, the identification of reliable predictive biomarkers for ICI response is vital for optimizing therapeutic strategies in NSCLC. This manuscript emphasizes the importance of alternative markers based on liquid biopsies and highlights potentially valuable non-tumoral blood cell count parameters as well as soluble immune checkpoint-related products. By expanding our understanding of these emerging biomarkers, we can transform lung cancer management towards a more personalized approach based on biological determinants. Furthermore, the time-sensitive nature of NSCLC treatment underscores the urgency in identifying predictive biomarkers that can guide clinical decision-making at an early stage. Current treatment paradigms often rely on trial and error, resulting in delays in identifying patients who will benefit from ICI therapy. By incorporating liquid biopsy-based biomarkers into routine clinical practice, we can potentially streamline patient selection for ICI therapy and improve overall treatment outcomes.  Liquid biopsies offer distinct advantages over traditional tissue biopsy approaches. They provide a non-invasive means of obtaining real-time information about tumor characteristics, enabling clinicians to monitor disease progression and therapeutic response longitudinally. This dynamic assessment is particularly valuable in the context of NSCLC, which frequently displays intratumoral heterogeneity and may undergo clonal evolution during the course of treatment.  Moreover, liquid biopsies have a higher chance of capturing tumor-derived genetic alterations due to the shedding of circulating tumor DNA into the bloodstream or detection of rare circulating tumor cells. Traditional tissue biopsies often only capture a small portion of the primary or metastatic lesion, limiting their representativeness and potentially missing critical genetic alterations that might drive therapeutic resistance or predict response to immunotherapy.  The potential utility of liquid-based markers extends beyond mere prediction; they could also serve as reliable tools for monitoring therapeutic response and disease progression during ICI treatment. Serial assessments using these soluble biomarkers could aid in detecting early signs of resistance or relapse before they manifest clinically or radiographically. By identifying patients with suboptimal responses promptly, alternate treatment strategies such as combination therapies or drug switching might be initiated earlier to maximize outcomes.  With these considerations in mind and acknowledging previous limitations associated with tumor-biopsy specimen analysis (such as sampling bias and logistical challenges), this paper aims to delve into recent advancements concerning soluble biomarkers derived from liquid biopsies that hold promise as non-invasive predictors for clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We will critically examine the current literature, appraising the evidence behind each biomarker and its potential to alter clinical practice.  Additionally, we will explore unresolved questions and challenges surrounding the implementation of liquid biopsy-based biomarkers in routine clinical management. These include standardization of methods, establishment of robust cutoff values for various markers, and validation across different patient populations.  By consolidating the available evidence on liquid biopsy-derived soluble biomarkers in NSCLC patients undergoing ICI therapy, this study hopes to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of their predictive value as well as their potential for integration into routine clinical practice. Ultimately, our aim is to provide clinicians with valuable insights that can inform treatment decisions while enhancing patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resource allocation.  In conclusion, the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized NSCLC treatment paradigms. However, identifying which patients are likely to benefit from ICI therapy remains a significant challenge. This paper highlights the potential role of soluble biomarkers derived from liquid biopsies in predicting clinical outcomes for NSCLC patients treated with ICI. By investigating these promising markers and their integration into routine clinical practice, we strive towards personalized medicine approaches that improve patient selection criteria and ultimately enhance treatment efficacy in NSCLC.",create

"Title: The Intracellular Transport of cGAMP and Its Implications in Cellular Signaling  Abstract: 2’3’-cGAMP is a crucial molecule in the cGAS-STING pathway, serving as a second messenger to activate STING and induce immune responses against infection, cancer, or cellular stress. Traditionally, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) were believed to signal the production of interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines solely within the cell where sensing occurred. Recent studies have challenged this viewpoint by revealing multiple transport mechanisms that allow 2’3’-cGAMP to travel from cell to cell independently of DNA sensing by cGAS. This paradigm shift has significant implications for understanding immune responses against microbial invaders and cancer, as well as for developing therapeutics targeting the dysregulated processes associated with the cGAS-STING pathway.  1. Introduction: The innate immune system is responsible for recognizing molecular patterns associated with pathogenic microbes or cellular damage and initiating appropriate defense responses (Takeuchi & Akira, 2010). Cells possess diverse pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that can recognize these pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Kawai & Akira, 2006). Upon PRR activation, downstream signaling cascades are triggered to elicit various antimicrobial or inflammatory responses necessary for eliminating pathogens and maintaining tissue homeostasis.  One such important PRR involved in innate immunity is cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which recognizes cytosolic dsDNA derived from both pathogens and host cells experiencing genomic stress signals (Sun et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019). Once activated upon binding to dsDNA motifs in a sequence-independent manner through its DNA-binding domain, cGAS undergoes conformational changes leading to its enzymatic activity converting ATP and GTP into cyclic dinucleotide, 2’3’-cGAMP (Sun et al., 2013). Subsequently, 2’3’-cGAMP acts as a second messenger that binds to and activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Ishikawa & Barber, 2008; Wu et al., 2013).  Upon activation, STING recruits and activates downstream signaling molecules such as TBK1 and IRF3 to initiate type-I interferon (IFN) production and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression through the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway (Burke et al., 2019; Kondo et al., 2017). These cytokines play crucial roles in mediating antiviral responses, tumor immunosurveillance, immune cell recruitment, and modulating adaptive immunity against microbial invaders or transformed host cells.  Conventional dogma assumed that PRR signaling occurred within the same cell where detection of pathogens or danger signals took place. It was thought that locally produced type-I IFNs would induce an autocrine response within that cell while also acting in a paracrine manner on surrounding cells to induce similar defense mechanisms. However, recent studies have challenged this classical view by identifying unconventional mechanisms through which cGAS-generated second messenger molecule 2'3'-cGAMP can traffic from its production site to neighboring cells without relying on direct DNA sensing by cGAS.  This discovery has brought about paradigm-shifting implications for understanding how intercellular communication potentiates immune responses against microbial infection and cancer development. Moreover, dysregulation of the cGAS-STING pathway has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases where antagonists targeting this pathway remain elusive. Harnessing our evolving knowledge regarding intercellular transport mechanisms could potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies in the context of cancer immunotherapies, vaccine design, and the treatment of cGAS-STING pathway-associated diseases.  In this review article, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements made in elucidating the mechanisms by which 2’3’-cGAMP can be transported between cells. Furthermore, we will highlight its significance in immune responses against microbial invasion and cancer development while delving into how this paradigmatic shift could inform novel therapeutic approaches for combating inflammatory diseases associated with dysregulated cGAS-STING signaling.",create
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as novel and promising tools in the field of cardiovascular research. These small, lipid bilayer-enclosed structures are released by various cell types and are known to play a critical role in intercellular communication. EVs have been implicated in a wide range of biological processes, including immune regulation, stem cell maintenance, and cancer progression. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in understanding the roles of EVs in atherosclerosis - a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the build-up of plaques within arterial walls.  Atherosclerosis remains one of the leading causes of death globally, with its associated complications such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke causing significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in medical therapies for atherosclerosis, there is still an unmet need for reliable biomarkers that can aid early diagnosis and risk stratification. Additionally, better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis could open up new avenues for therapeutic intervention.  The ability to detect diseases at their earliest stages using non-invasive biomarkers is an important goal for researchers globally. Traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on invasive procedures such as coronary angiography or intravascular ultrasound which carry inherent risks to patients. EVs offer a potential alternative due to their stability in bodily fluids such as blood and urine, easy accessibility through minimally invasive procedures like phlebotomy or urine collection, as well as their ability to carry specific cargo molecules reflective of their cell source.  In recent years, numerous studies have implicated EVs in different stages of atherosclerosis pathogenesis. These vesicles are now recognized to contribute to key processes driving disease progression including endothelial dysfunction - an initial event triggered by factors such as high blood pressure or dyslipidemia that leads to recruitment and activation of immune cells within the arterial wall; inflammation – involving infiltration and activation macrophages; lipid accumulation - leading to the formation of foam cells; and plaque destabilization that can result in acute cardiovascular events. The precise mechanisms through which EVs mediate these actions are multifaceted, with studies demonstrating their ability to transfer bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and microRNAs (miRNAs) between cells.  However, despite significant progress in our understanding of EVs in atherosclerosis, several important gaps remain. For instance, more research is needed to establish the specific types of EVs involved in different stages of atherosclerosis pathogenesis and how their cargo composition might vary at different disease stages. Additionally, there is a need for standardized methods for isolation and characterization of EVs from various biological fluids given their diversity in size, composition and surface markers. Moreover, investigation into how interactions between circulating EVs and components within the arterial wall contribute to disease progression would provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets.  In conclusion, this introduction highlights the emerging role of EVs as diagnostic biomarkers and modulators of atherosclerosis pathogenesis. Understanding the specific contributions made by different types of EVs at various stages of disease progression could lead to the development of novel diagnostic tools and targeted therapies aimed at reducing mortality from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Investigating these aspects will require well-designed studies utilizing relevant animal models coupled with analyses on human samples derived from large prospective cohorts to yield translational data that can be readily translated into clinical practice.",create
"Introduction  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia worldwide, affecting millions of people and leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Conduction system pacing (CSP) has emerged as a novel delivery method for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT), offering an alternative to conventional biventricular epicardial (BiV) pacing in indicated patients. While there is increasing popularity and widespread use of CSP, its specific role in patients with AF remains poorly understood.  AF is often associated with heart failure (HF), a condition that affects approximately 26 million people globally. The presence of AF in HF patients represents a significant challenge due to its adverse impact on cardiac function and electrical conduction. It has been shown that the loss of atrial contraction during AF contributes to incomplete ventricular filling, leading to compromised hemodynamics and subsequent worsening of HF symptoms.  Traditionally, BiV pacing has been used as an effective therapy for HF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. However, the efficacy of BiV pacing can be limited in the presence of AF since atrial sensing may not be consistently reliable during episodes of irregular rhythm. As a result, there is growing interest in exploring alternative approaches such as CSP for the management of HF patients with concomitant AF.  In this hypothetical research study, we aim to investigate the role and effectiveness of CSP specifically in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. We hypothesize that CSP may offer superior outcomes in terms of electrical resynchronization compared to conventional BiV pacing methods.  To address this research question comprehensively, we will first examine mechanistic evidence supporting the importance of sinus rhythm (SR) during CSP therapy by allowing for adjustment of atrioventricular delays (AVD). By optimizing AVD settings based on SR rather than irregular rhythm patterns associated with AF, it is anticipated that more precise synchronization between atria and ventricles can be achieved, ultimately leading to improved cardiac function.  Furthermore, we will review the existing clinical evidence related to CSP in patients who have undergone atrioventricular nodal ablation (AVNA) for AF. AVNA is performed in selected individuals with drug-refractory AF and aims to control heart rate by removing the atrioventricular node and introducing ventricular pacing as the primary mode of rhythm control. Investigating CSP outcomes in this specific patient population will provide valuable insights into its efficacy when employed as a treatment strategy following an ablative procedure.  To address potential hurdles and gaps in the current literature, we will also discuss how future research studies can be designed to ascertain the efficacy of CSP in patients with AF and HF. This may involve conducting large-scale randomized controlled trials comparing BiV pacing with CSP among AF patients or evaluating long-term outcomes through prospective cohort studies.  In conclusion, understanding the role of CSP specifically in patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies for this challenging population. By exploring mechanistic evidence, analyzing clinical data from AVNA recipients, and proposing avenues for further research, this study aims to contribute significant insights into improving cardiac resynchronization therapy approaches tailored to those affected by both HF and AF.",create
"Introduction  Depression among youth is a significant public health concern, characterized by high prevalence and distressing consequences. Despite the increasing recognition of this issue, limited progress has been made in advancing our understanding of depression's features or developing effective interventions to address its growing prevalence. This has prompted the need for novel research questions that can shed light on unexplored aspects and enhance our knowledge base regarding youth depression.  The current study aims to investigate the impact of social media use on depression among adolescents and young adults. In recent years, social media platforms have gained immense popularity, serving as crucial tools for communication and information dissemination. However, concerns have been raised regarding their potential negative influence on mental health outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations such as youths. Understanding the relationship between social media use and depression is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate its adverse effects.  Adolescence marks a critical period wherein individuals experience significant physical, emotional, and social changes. It is during this developmental stage that they are most susceptible to various psychosocial stressors that may contribute to depressive symptoms. The pervasive use of social media platforms among young people amplifies these stressors by exposing them to unrealistic standards of beauty, constant peer comparisons, cyberbullying experiences, and reduced face-to-face interactions – factors known to contribute significantly to mental health difficulties.  While previous research has explored the association between social media use and mental health outcomes in general populations or adults separately, there remains a paucity of studies specifically examining this relationship among youth populations. Therefore,the present study aims not only to fill this gap but also expand upon existing literature by exploring unique aspects related explicitly to depression.  To better comprehend the interplay between social media usage patterns—such as frequency of use,dimensions (e.g., active posting versus passive consumption),and duration—and depressive symptoms among youths,a mixed-methods approach will be employed.Such an approach will encompass both quantitative survey data collection assessing participants' demographic characteristics,social media usage patterns, and depression levels, in addition to qualitative interviews that will capture participants' subjective experiences and perceptions.  In line with previous research on mental health among adolescents, it is hypothesized that increased social media use will be positively correlated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the investigation of nuanced dimensions of social media usage may provide insights into specific facets that amplify or mitigate the risk for depression.  Understanding how social media affects youth mental health is imperative for developing effective interventions to mitigate its detrimental effects. By identifying the underlying mechanisms linking social media use and depression, this study can contribute to formulating evidence-based strategies aimed at promoting healthy online behavior and reducing depressive symptoms among adolescents and young adults.  The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a comprehensive review of relevant literature surrounding youth depression, focusing on current theories explaining its etiology.

"Introduction  Neurodegenerative diseases are a diverse group of disorders characterized by the progressive degeneration and loss of neurons in the central nervous system. Among these disorders, proteinopathies play a significant role in disease progression, wherein mutations or modifications in specific genes lead to alterations in protein structure and subsequent formation of toxic aggregates within neurons. These protein aggregates have been implicated as key contributors to cellular dysfunction and neuronal death, ultimately resulting in neurodegeneration.  Autophagy is an essential cellular process that acts as a quality control mechanism by degrading misfolded or aggregated proteins, thereby maintaining proper protein homeostasis. It functions alongside the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to eliminate protein aggregates and maintain cellular health. Dysregulation of autophagy has been strongly associated with the development and progression of various neurodegenerative diseases induced by protein misfolding and accumulation.  Significant advancements have been made towards understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy's role in neurodegenerative diseases using various experimental models. One such model that has contributed significantly to this understanding is Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). Despite the physiological and morphological differences between flies and humans, there exists a remarkable conservation of molecular pathways regulating protein homeostasis across species.  This review aims to provide an overview of common neurodegenerative proteinopathies: PolyQ diseases including Huntington's disease, Spinocerebellar ataxia 1, 2, and 3; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) with mutations in C9orf72, SOD1, TDP-43 or FUS; Alzheimer's disease involving amyloid precursor protein (APP) or Tau pathology; Parkinson's disease associated with alpha-synuclein (a-syn), parkin/PINK1 pathway or LRRK2 mutations; as well as prion diseases. These disorders represent a substantial burden on global healthcare due to their prevalence and devastating impact on affected individuals and their families.  By focusing on studies conducted using Drosophila models, we will highlight the invaluable insights gained into the conserved molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy's involvement in these neurodegenerative diseases. Drosophila has emerged as a robust experimental model, offering numerous advantages such as a short lifespan, genetic tractability, and the ability to perform sophisticated genetic manipulations. These attributes have allowed for the identification of conserved autophagic pathways and novel genetic modifiers that regulate protein aggregation clearance within neurons.  Understanding how autophagy is regulated in various proteinopathies is critical for developing targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring or enhancing its activity. Given that autophagy dysregulation occurs early in disease pathogenesis, influencing this process might have significant implications for disease modification and slow down disease progression.  In conclusion, this review aims to consolidate current knowledge regarding the role of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases induced by proteinopathies. By summarizing studies conducted using Drosophila models alongside human-based research findings, we will shed light on conserved mechanisms regulating autophagy's function. Enhanced understanding of these processes may pave the way towards developing novel therapeutic strategies to combat these devastating disorders that lack effective treatment options currently available. The identification and characterization of autophagy's role in neurodegenerative diseases is of paramount importance to advance our understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This knowledge not only enhances our knowledge of disease etiology but also offers potential avenues for therapeutic interventions. As such, a comprehensive overview of the current literature, especially studies utilizing Drosophila models, is crucial to elucidating the conserved mechanisms regulating autophagy in proteinopathies.  Advances in genetic and molecular techniques have facilitated remarkable progress in our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and their association with protein misfolding and aggregation. Proteinopathies encompass a wide range of disorders, including PolyQ diseases such as Huntington's disease and Spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, and 3; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) characterized by mutations in C9orf72, SOD1, TDP-43 or FUS; Alzheimer's disease featuring amyloid precursor protein (APP) or Tau pathology; Parkinson's disease linked to alpha-synuclein (a-syn), parkin/PINK1 pathway dysregulation or LRRK2 mutations; as well as prion diseases.  While these disorders manifest differently clinically, they share a common feature: aberrant protein homeostasis leading to the accumulation of toxic aggregates within neurons. In this regard, both the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy have emerged as crucial players responsible for maintaining cellular proteostasis. Mutations affecting either pathway can disrupt proper clearance mechanisms for damaged proteins or aggregates associated with neurodegenerative pathologies.  Drosophila melanogaster has proven instrumental in advancing our understanding of these complex processes due to its unique experimental advantages. Despite evolutionary divergence from vertebrates like humans, fruit flies possess striking similarities regarding essential cellular pathways involved in protein degradation and aggregate clearance systems—including autophagy—in both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral tissues. This conservation makes Drosophila an ideal model organism to study neurodegenerative diseases and explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting autophagy.  Over the past decade, studies utilizing Drosophila models have made remarkable contributions to our knowledge of neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These investigations have helped uncover critical molecular and cellular events underlying autophagy's involvement in disease pathogenesis. The fly model offers a high degree of genetic tractability, enabling researchers to manipulate specific genes or pathways associated with protein homeostasis regulation.  By employing various genetic tools, it has been possible to selectively induce or suppress expression of key components within the autophagy-lysosome system, shedding light on their impact on protein aggregates clearance, neuronal function, and overall disease progression. Furthermore, researchers have successfully utilized Drosophila models to identify novel genetic modifiers and signaling pathways that regulate proteostasis in neurodegeneration.  Throughout this review article, we will systematically summarize findings from studies using fruit flies that investigate the conserved mechanisms regulating autophagy in diverse neurodegenerative diseases induced by proteinopathies. Specifically focusing on PolyQ diseases, ALS subtypes triggered by different mutations or misfolded proteins accumulation such as C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion or TDP-43 pathology; Alzheimer's disease featuring amyloid-beta plaques (Aβ) or Tau tangles; Parkinson's disease characterized by abnormal alpha-synuclein aggregation frequently observed in Lewy bodies; as well as prion diseases with aberrant PrPsc conformational changes leading to neuronal toxicity.  By gathering insights gained through Drosophila research into these human disorders' pathophysiology linked closely with aberrant aggregate formation and clearance mechanisms via autophagy pathway dysregulation—we aim for a comprehensive account of conserved molecular processes involved in these devastating conditions. Such knowledge may pave the way for targeted therapeutic strategies, potentially modulating autophagy to restore protein homeostasis and slow down neurodegeneration progression.  In conclusion, this introduction highlights the critical role of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases induced by proteinopathies. By emphasizing studies utilizing Drosophila models alongside human-based research findings, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of conserved mechanisms regulating autophagy in these disorders. Understanding these fundamental processes holds immense promise for developing effective interventions that can alleviate suffering and improve patient outcomes in neurodegenerative diseases lacking curative treatments currently available.",create
"1. Introduction  The field of citizen science has gained significant momentum in recent years as a valuable approach to monitoring biodiversity for the purpose of conservation. By engaging the public in data acquisition and analysis, citizen science projects enable large-scale data collection that would otherwise be unattainable by researchers alone. Online training tools have emerged as an effective means of enhancing participants' skills and knowledge in species identification, thus improving the quality of acquired data. However, there is a need for further investigation to evaluate the effectiveness of specific online training approaches, such as quiz-style formats, particularly within the context of bird identification for citizen science biodiversity monitoring projects.  Species identification forms a crucial aspect of any biodiversity monitoring initiative. It enables researchers and conservationists to accurately classify and record observed species, identifying population trends and assessing changes in local ecosystems over time. Birdsong identification represents one area where accurate species recognition is challenging due to the vast diversity and intricacy of avian vocalizations. Consequently, developing effective training tools that facilitate birdsong identification skills could greatly enhance citizen scientists' contributions to bird-focused biodiversity monitoring projects.  In this study, we aim to address gaps in existing research pertaining to quiz-style online training tools used for learning birdsong identification within the realm of citizen science initiatives focused on biodiversity monitoring. We propose an investigation into the effectiveness of a newly developed tool called TORI-TORE (Trained Observation Reveals Individuality – Teaching Ornithological Recognition Effortlessly). TORI-TORE is designed with memory mechanisms informed by adaptive learning theories in order to improve participants' abilities in identifying birdsongs while simultaneously fostering interest in avian species and their natural environments.  To evaluate TORI-TORE's potential impact on bird identification skills and participant attitudes towards birds during engagements with citizen science programs focused on bird-focused biodiversity monitoring efforts, we conducted a randomized control trial involving participants from Fukushima Prefecture located in Japan—an area known for its rich avifaunal diversity. By employing a combination of test scores and questionnaires, we assessed both the direct impact of TORI-TORE on bird identification proficiency and the subsequent effect on individuals' attitudes towards birds.  This study also seeks to explore variables that may influence the effectiveness of quiz-style online training tools, such as adaptive training methodologies aimed at personalized learning experiences. By examining whether focusing preferentially on unmastered bird species—derived from individual trainee answer histories inspired by adaptive learning—leads to positive or negative outcomes for participants' test scores and satisfaction with TORI-TORE, we can refine our understanding of effective strategies for enhancing birdsong identification skills through online training platforms.  Additionally, we aim to investigate how factors such as the selection of species that are relatively easy to remember, optimal lag times between training sessions and testing phases, as well as appropriate intervals between questions can positively impact participant performance in quiz-style online learning environments focused on birdsong identification. By identifying these variables that contribute to improved trainee outcomes, we can optimize future iterations of TORI-TORE in order to enhance its effectiveness as an educational tool within citizen science programs dedicated to bird-focused biodiversity monitoring.  In conclusion, this research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a quiz-style online training tool called TORI-TORE for enhancing birdsong identification skills in citizen science participants engaged in biodiversity monitoring projects. The study seeks to contribute valuable insights into strategies for improving species recognition abilities within avian-specific contexts while fostering interest in natural environments. The findings generated by this study will support ongoing efforts aimed at capacity building within citizen science initiatives globally and promote greater engagement with nature conservation efforts among citizens at large.",create
"Title: Cross-Frequency Coupling in Emotional Processing and its Potential Therapeutic Applications  Introduction:  Emotional processing represents a fundamental aspect of human cognition and behavior, playing a critical role in interpersonal communication, decision making, and overall well-being. Electrophysiological studies have revealed that different frequency bands of neural oscillations are involved in the complex orchestration of emotional experiences and their regulation. Specifically, cross-frequency coupling (CFC) has emerged as a promising framework for understanding the dynamic interactions between neural signals across multiple frequencies during emotional processing.  While previous research on CFC has primarily focused on its implications in cognition/memory tasks, sleep dynamics, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease; there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding its role in emotional processing. Thus, this study aims to explore the potential relationship between CFC patterns and emotional responses for an improved understanding of emotion-related neurophysiology.  1.1 Motivation for Understanding Cross-Frequency Coupling in Emotional Processing  Emotions hold profound significance not only from an experiential standpoint but also due to their substantial impact on individual mental health outcomes. Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to deciphering the neural substrates underlying emotion generation and regulation; however these efforts have predominantly focused on examining local activity within specific frequency bands rather than capturing the global dynamics of interregional interactions that underlie emotion processing.  The investigation into cross-frequency coupling assumes particular importance as it offers valuable insights into how regional coordination within distributed networks can give rise to unique emotional states and their behavioral consequences. By characterizing CFC profiles during affective experiences such as pleasure or fear induction paradigms or emotion regulation tasks involves dynamically manipulating emotions through cognitive reappraisal techniques), it is possible to identify key temporal couplings that may serve as markers for healthy versus maladaptive functioning.  1.2 Potential Implications for Therapeutic Interventions  Understanding CFC dynamics during emotional processing not only enhances our theoretical knowledge of how emotions are formed and regulated but also provides translational opportunities for therapeutic applications. The ability to modulate CFC patterns non-invasively, such as through neurofeedback or transcranial electrical stimulation techniques, holds great potential for optimizing emotional well-being and treating affective disorders.  Furthermore, CFC signatures could serve as objective biomarkers for diagnostic purposes, aiding clinicians in identifying individuals with heightened emotional reactivity or impaired emotion regulation abilities. This personalized neurophysiological information would enable the development of targeted interventions tailored to an individual's specific CFC profile. For example, individuals displaying disrupted gamma-theta coupling during emotionally challenging situations may greatly benefit from cognitive training approaches aimed at enhancing emotion regulation strategies.  1.3 Scope and Organization of the Paper  This paper aims to review recent literature investigating cross-frequency coupling during emotional processing, highlighting methodological advancements and challenges in accurately assessing CFC patterns in this domain. By examining existing studies exploring interplays between various frequency bands (e.g., theta-alpha or gamma-beta couplings) in relation to emotion-related tasks or pathological conditions like anxiety disorders or mood dysregulation syndromes), we seek to establish a foundation for further research on this topic.  Furthermore, we will discuss emerging insights into the potential therapeutic applications of manipulating CFC patterns within the context of affective disorders and general emotional well-being enhancement strategies. A comprehensive understanding of how cross-frequency interactions contribute to emotion processing will lay the groundwork for leveraging closed-loop brain stimulation paradigms specifically designed for modulating emotional experiences.  In conclusion, this paper introduces a novel research direction dedicated to exploring cross-frequency coupling dynamics during emotional processing. It highlights the importance of investigating these interactions within distributed brain networks involved in generating and regulating emotions and proposes potential therapeutic implications based on emerging findings from related research areas. By filling gaps in current knowledge regarding emotion-related neural oscillations' interdisciplinary dynamics, this study contributes significantly toward unlocking the potential of CFC as a theoretical and translational tool in affective neuroscience.",create
"Introduction:  The global rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat to public health, with approximately 700,000 deaths attributed to AMR annually (1,2). If left unchecked, studies suggest that by 2050, AMR could lead to a reduction in global Gross Domestic Product ranging from 2% to 3.5%, resulting in economic losses estimated at between 60 and 100 trillion US dollars (3). Such devastating consequences would not only affect economic output but also contribute to widespread human suffering and health system failures.  While the impact of AMR is projected to be substantial worldwide, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are expected to bear the brunt of its consequences. For instance, it is predicted that by 2050, AMR could cause an estimated death toll of about 4.1 million people in Africa alone if effective measures are not implemented promptly (4). Furthermore, rising rates of AMR impose additional challenges on LMICs with fragile healthcare systems. It leads not only to increased financial burdens associated with treatment costs but also threatens the achievement of universal health coverage for vulnerable populations.  A prevailing driver behind the development and spread of AMR is the inappropriate use of antimicrobials; particularly antibiotics. Inappropriate antibiotic use encompasses a range of practices such as overuse or misuse in both clinical settings and other sectors including veterinary medicine and agriculture (5). However, it has been observed that LMICs face numerous barriers regarding their regulatory frameworks which impede effective control over antibiotic use. Weak governance structures often result in limited enforcement capacities and oversight mechanisms contributing further to inappropriate antibiotic practices.  To address this critical issue effectively within LMICs requires a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving inappropriate antibiotic use specific to these countries. Identifying these drivers can provide valuable insights for policymakers and decision-makers when formulating targeted interventions aimed at curbing inappropriate antibiotic utilization ultimately mitigating AMR. Therefore, the objective of this review is to examine and discuss the multifaceted factors that drive inappropriate antibiotic use within LMICs, taking into account clinical practices, veterinary medicine, and agricultural sectors.  This paper seeks to contribute significantly to the existing literature on AMR by focusing on a specific research question related to factors driving inappropriate antibiotic use. Through an extensive review of published studies, reports, and policy documents from a range of LMICs across different continents, this study aims to provide an in-depth analysis that will inform evidence-based decision-making processes in combating inappropriate antibiotic use and minimizing the development of AMR in these settings.  By shedding light on the complex interplay between healthcare systems regulations, socioeconomic determinants, cultural practices, and other influential factors contributing to inappropriate antibiotic utilization in LMICs; this research will provide vital knowledge gaps essential for implementing targeted interventions at various levels of these health systems. Ultimately aiming towards safeguarding public health through sustainable antimicrobial stewardship strategies while ensuring access to effective treatment for infectious diseases both now and in future generations. 2. Background and Rationale  Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has garnered increasing global attention due to its alarming impact on public health and healthcare systems worldwide. The emergence and spread of AMR can be attributed, at least in part, to the inappropriate use of antimicrobials, particularly antibiotics (1). Inappropriate use refers to practices that deviate from recommended guidelines or misuse antimicrobials altogether, encompassing both overuse and misuse of these vital drugs (2).  Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face unique challenges when it comes to combating AMR. These countries often have limited resources, weak regulatory frameworks, inadequate surveillance systems, insufficient diagnostic capabilities, fragmented supply chains with variable drug quality control mechanisms, and a myriad of socioeconomic factors that further complicate effective management strategies for infectious diseases (3). Consequently LMICs are disproportionately affected by the burden of AMR-related mortality and morbidity.  In addition to universal factors driving antibiotic resistance such as ease of access to antibiotics without prescriptions in some regions or reliance on self-medication due to limited healthcare services availability; there are specific contextual drivers contributing significantly to the problem within LMICs. Factors contributing significantly include resource constraints leading to suboptimal prescribing practices amplified by competing demands for healthcare resource allocations within overstretched health systems grappling with multiple public health priorities such as HIV/AIDS or malaria control programs.  Furthermore, many LMICs have a significant burden of communicable diseases coupled with high rates of infectious disease transmission due diverse factors such as overcrowding or sanitation challenges fostering increased exposure opportunities for multi-drug resistant pathogens.  Traditional healing practices prevalent in LMICs also play a role in compounding inappropriate antibiotic usage through concurrent administration alongside prescribed treatments resulting in subtherapeutic doses leading not only increases chances resistance development but also compromises patient outcomes.  Similarly porous agricultural practices including routine prophylactic antimicrobial use among livestock contribute significantly towards propagation towards drug-resistant strains through the food chain impacting both public health in these countries and furthering transnational spread risks.  Given these compounding factors, the urgent need to understand and address inappropriate antibiotic use within LMICs is evident. By identifying the drivers specific to these contexts, interventions can be tailored to address unique challenges faced by LMICs. This research aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted factors driving inappropriate antibiotic use in these settings, taking into account clinical practices as well as encompassing veterinary medicine and agricultural sectors.  By addressing gaps in knowledge surrounding inappropriate antibiotic utilization within LMICs; we aim to contribute significantly towards evidence-based policy formulation that promotes antimicrobial stewardship while preserving access to effective treatment for infectious diseases. This research seeks not only to enhance our understanding of factors contributing towards AMR but also foster sustainable long-term solutions embedded within existing healthcare systems focusing on equity by taking contextual challenges and opportunities into account. Such solutions will safeguard public health and contribute towards achieving global health security goals.",create
"Introduction: The Impact of Parental Influence on Fruit and Vegetable Intake in Preschool Children: A Review of Existing Literature  1.1 Background  Fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption among preschool-aged children in the United States (US) is alarmingly low, with only a small proportion meeting the daily recommended intake. Adequate consumption of FVs during early childhood is crucial for proper development and growth, as well as for establishing healthy dietary habits that can extend into adulthood (Wardle et al., 2019). Poor dietary patterns developed during this critical phase are likely to persist throughout an individual's lifetime, increasing the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular conditions, and certain cancers (Mozaffarian et al., 2018).  Given the importance of establishing healthy eating habits early in life, interventions targeting FV intake in preschool children have received substantial attention from researchers. While previous reviews have explored interventions implemented within childcare or preschool settings to improve FV consumption among this age group (Smith et al., 2021), a notable gap exists regarding studies focusing on parental influence on FV intake.  Parents play a fundamental role in shaping their children's dietary behaviors through food choices within the home environment (Patrick & Nicklas, 2005). Consequently, parental influence has been identified as a critical factor contributing to children's eating behaviors and food preferences (DiSantis et al., 2020). Understanding the impact of parental practices related to FV consumption is essential for identifying effective strategies that can be employed by parents at home.  1.2 Research Question  The primary objective of this systematic literature review is to examine existing evidence regarding the impact of parental influence on fruit and vegetable intake among preschool-aged children in the US. Specifically, this study aims to address the following research question:  To what extent do parenting practices related to fruit and vegetable consumption impact preschool-aged children's intake?  By addressing this research question, this review seeks to provide insights into the key determinants of FV intake within the home environment and identify effective strategies that parents can utilize to promote higher consumption among their children.  1.3 Methodology  This systematic review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2020). The inclusion criteria for this study will be limited to empirical research articles published between 2012 and 2022. Research articles utilizing quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-method designs will be considered eligible for inclusion if they explicitly examine parenting practices related to FV consumption among preschool children aged between 2 and 5 years old in the US.  A comprehensive search strategy will be developed using relevant keywords such as ""parental influence,"" ""fruit and vegetable intake,"" ""preschool children,"" and ""United States."" The search will be conducted across major electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Furthermore, a manual search of reference lists from relevant articles will be performed to identify any additional studies that may have been missed in the initial database search.  Study selection will involve a two-step process: screening titles/abstracts followed by full-text assessment. To ensure methodological rigor throughout this review process, two independent researchers will independently assess each article against predefined inclusion criteria. Any discrepancies in study selection decisions between reviewers will be resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer if necessary.  1.4 Expected Outcomes  This comprehensive literature review expects to identify studies examining various aspects of parental influence on preschool-aged children's fruit and vegetable intake within the home environment. Findings from these studies are anticipated to shed light on specific parenting practices that significantly impact FV intake among young children.  The outcomes of this review can contribute towards developing evidence-based interventions targeting parental practices associated with increased fruit and vegetable consumption at home. This knowledge can inform the design of intervention programs aimed at promoting healthy dietary behaviors and preventing future chronic disease burden among preschool children in the US.  1.5 Conclusion  This systematic review aims to bridge the existing gap in the literature by focusing on parental influence on fruit and vegetable intake among preschool-aged children. By examining the impact of parenting practices, this study will provide valuable insights into effective strategies that can be employed by parents to enhance their children's FV consumption within the home environment.  Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing comprehensive interventions that encompass both childcare or preschool settings, as well as parental practices at home, to significantly improve overall fruit and vegetable intake in young children. The findings from this review will contribute towards evidence-based recommendations for parents, healthcare professionals, and policymakers seeking to promote optimal nutrition during early childhood.",create
"Introduction  Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors derived from the adrenal medulla or extra-adrenal sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, respectively. These tumors are characterized by excessive catecholamine production, resulting in a variety of clinical manifestations including hypertension, palpitations, sweating, and headache (1). While surgery is the cornerstone of treatment for localized disease, the management of metastatic pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas remains challenging due to limited treatment options.  Epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as crucial regulators of gene expression in various malignancies (2). Histone modifications play a pivotal role in the transcriptional regulation by altering chromatin structure and accessibility to transcription factors. Acetylation and deacetylation of histones are key processes that control gene expression through modulation of chromatin dynamics. These modifications are catalyzed by enzymes known as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) respectively.  Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have shown therapeutic potential across different tumor types by targeting aberrant epigenetic alterations associated with cancer development (3). HDAC inhibitors exhibit pleiotropic effects on cancer cells due to their ability to regulate multiple intracellular pathways involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis induction, differentiation promotion, genomic stability maintenance, angiogenesis suppression among others (4).  Currently approved HDACis such as vorinostat, romidepsin, belinostat extensively used in hematological malignancies like T-cell lymphoma subtypes have prompted interest for utilizing these agents beyond hematological diseases into solid tumors including colorectal cancer, thyroid carcinoma breast carcinoma lung carcinoma pancreatic adenocarcinoma where treatment options remain limited.  Given HDACis' ability to modulate epigenetic modifications underlying tumorigenesis and their clinical efficacy in certain cancers, the potential therapeutic application of HDACis in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas is an area of interest. Although very little is known about the effects of HDACis on these rare neuroendocrine tumors, recent preclinical studies have highlighted their potential as promising therapeutic agents (5).  The emergence of targeted therapies has revolutionized cancer treatment by offering improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to traditional chemotherapy agents. HDACis hold promise as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas by leveraging their unique mechanism of action targeting epigenetic alterations.  In this comprehensive review, we aim to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the antitumor activity of HDACis in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. We will present data from preclinical studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo, as well as clinical trial results evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of these agents in patients with metastatic disease.  Understanding the underlying mechanisms by which HDAC inhibitors exert their antitumor effects on neuroendocrine tumors holds great potential for identifying new therapeutic strategies that can complement or replace existing systemic treatments. Moreover, gaining insights into biomarkers associated with response or resistance to HDAC inhibition may facilitate patient selection for personalized treatment approaches.  Overall, this review aims to consolidate available evidence supporting the clinical implementation of HDAC inhibitors in managing advanced stages of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. By highlighting gaps in knowledge and areas requiring further investigation, this work aims to stimulate future research endeavors aiming at improving outcomes for patients affected by these rare neuroendocrine tumors.",create
"The potential relationship between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection has generated significant debate and interest among researchers and healthcare professionals. The effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke on various diseases, including the infamous COVID-19, have been extensively discussed in recent literature. However, the current understanding of this relationship remains controversial.  Smoking is known to increase the risk and severity of respiratory infections due to its detrimental impact on lung health. In the context of COVID-19, preliminary evidence suggests that smokers may be at a higher risk for contracting the disease compared to non-smokers. This is likely attributed to the upregulation of ACE2 receptors – key proteins involved in viral entry – in smokers’ lung tissue, providing a potential mechanism for increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Contrastingly, multinational epidemiological reports have indicated a lower incidence of COVID-19 among smokers. This conflicting observation raises intriguing questions regarding the complex interplay between smoking, nicotine exposure, immune response modulation, and their ultimate impact on disease outcomes. It is important to note that these reports do not advocate smoking as a protective measure against COVID-19 but indicate an interesting discrepancy when it comes to disease occurrence.  One virulent component found within cigarette smoke is nicotine – a potent addictive substance with diverse physiological effects on multiple organ systems. Nicotine has been reported to exhibit both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties depending on various factors such as dosage or route of administration. Understanding how nicotine interacts with specific cells involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis could shed light on its potential role as either exacerbating or ameliorating viral-induced damage.  To address this research gap, we propose conducting an extensive investigation exploring the direct effect of pure nicotine on different cell types implicated in COVID-19 infection using an organ-based systematic approach. By focusing our study specifically on damaged organs associated with 12 diseases related to COVID-19 pathogenesis (e.g., lung, heart, kidney), we aim to delineate the specific impact of nicotine in the context of organ-specific viral entry and immune response.  It is crucial to distinguish between the effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke when conducting research on smoking-related diseases, including COVID-19. Failure to differentiate between these distinct exposures may introduce significant bias and limit our ability to draw accurate conclusions regarding their individual impacts. Moreover, it should be noted that nicotine’s effects are not solely dependent on its presence or absence but also exhibit a dose-dependent response.  In addition to investigating the role of nicotine in COVID-19 infection, we propose assessing underlying diseases as potential confounding factors. Understanding how conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, or diabetes interact with nicotine exposure could provide valuable insights for healthcare providers in developing tailored treatment strategies.  The ultimate goal of this research is twofold: firstly, to elucidate the specific impact of pure nicotine on cells involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis; and secondly, to provide evidence-based guidelines for healthcare professionals that incorporate a personalized approach considering both individual risk factors and underlying diseases. By improving our understanding of how smoking and nicotine contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics at a cellular level, we can enhance preventive measures and optimize treatment strategies for patients affected by this global pandemic.",create
"Investigating the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on tumor metastasis and the role of cadherin switching in advanced prostate cancer: A comprehensive overview  1. Introduction  Prostate cancer remains one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies among males worldwide, with increasing prevalence observed in both developed and developing countries. For over 80 years, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a standard treatment approach for advanced prostate cancer. ADT primarily aims to reduce circulating levels of androgens, such as testosterone, to inhibit the activation of androgen signaling pathways. This therapeutic strategy initially shows promising outcomes; however, subsets of cells within tumors eventually become resistant to ADT, leading to disease progression characterized by metastatic dissemination.  Emerging evidence suggests that ADT may induce a phenomenon termed ""cadherin switching"" in prostate cancer cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cadherins are transmembrane glycoproteins crucial for maintaining cellular adhesion within epithelial tissues. In this molecular process known as cadherin switching, there is a transition from E-cadherin expression towards N-cadherin expression.  Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is vital for elucidating its involvement in driving tumor progression during ADT treatment. Recent studies have shown that cadherin switching plays a significant role in promoting invasive behavior among tumor cells that have acquired resistance to hormone therapies such as ADT. Consequently, these altered cellular characteristics contribute to increased migration potential and subsequent metastasis formation.  Despite several studies identifying associations between cadherin switching-mediated EMT transitions and therapeutic resistance mechanisms, many aspects remain poorly understood. This knowledge gap hampers our ability to develop targeted interventions aimed at preventing or reversing these changes effectively.  In this study, we present a comprehensive overview focusing on how ADT affects cadherin expression profiles during advanced prostate cancer progression with an emphasis on the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially those regulated through the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. We aim to dissect the intricate relationship between ADT, cadherin switching, and EMT, highlighting their contributions to disease progression and therapeutic resistance.  To achieve these objectives, we will review a collection of relevant literature encompassing both in vitro and in vivo studies. Furthermore, we will explore existing clinical data sets from patients undergoing ADT as well as preclinical models that mimic hormone therapy regimens used in human prostate cancer treatment. By amalgamating evidence from across these multiple experimental systems, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis and functional consequences of cadherin switching during advanced prostate cancer progression under ADT conditions.  Ultimately, our findings may aid in identifying novel therapeutic targets directed towards reversing or preventing cadherin switching-mediated EMT transitions. Developing strategies aimed at mitigating this phenotypic alteration could enhance current treatment approaches for advanced prostate cancer and have significant implications for patients experiencing therapy resistance. 2. Significance of the research question  Investigating the impact of ADT on tumor metastasis and comprehending the role of cadherin switching in advanced prostate cancer is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, understanding the molecular mechanisms driving resistance acquisition during ADT treatment is essential for improving patient outcomes. Despite initial positive responses, a significant proportion of patients eventually develop resistance to ADT, leading to disease progression and poorer prognosis. Identifying cellular alterations associated with therapy resistance will aid in developing more effective approaches to prevent or overcome these challenges.  Secondly, characterizing the mechanisms underlying cadherin switching-mediated EMT transitions will provide valuable insights into how prostate cancer cells acquire invasive properties that promote metastasis formation. As metastatic disease contributes significantly to mortality rates among prostate cancer patients, uncovering the factors driving this process could potentially lead to novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or delaying metastatic spread.  Thirdly, elucidating key molecular pathways involved in cadherin switching during ADT may present opportunities for targeted interventions. By identifying critical transcriptional factors regulated through the TGF-β pathway or other signaling cascades connected with this phenotypic alteration, specific pharmacological agents could be developed to inhibit or reverse these changes in tumor cells resistant to hormonal therapies.  Lastly, by integrating data from both preclinical models and clinical cohorts of patients undergoing ADT treatment for advanced prostate cancer, we aim to bridge translational gaps and improve our understanding of how findings observed in experimental systems relate to human disease biology. This comprehensive approach will enable us to extract clinically relevant information that can guide future investigations towards personalized therapeutic interventions.  3. Objectives of the study  The primary objective of this study is twofold: (1) To evaluate how ADT modulates cadherin expression profiles during advanced prostate cancer progression with an emphasis on exploring differences between nuanced stages within therapy-resistant tumors; (2) To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying cadherin switching, focusing on transcriptional factors regulated through the TGF-β signaling pathway.  To achieve these objectives, we will pursue a systematic analysis of relevant published literature, encompassing cell line and animal models as well as data from clinical cohorts. By employing diverse experimental approaches and integrating findings across different stages of prostate cancer progression under ADT conditions, we aim to provide a comprehensive molecular perspective on cadherin switching-mediated EMT transitions.  4. Conclusion  This study aims to shed light on the intricate relationship between ADT, cadherin switching, and EMT in advanced prostate cancer. By comprehensively reviewing existing evidence and investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon, we hope to uncover novel insights that can inform future therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or reversing therapy resistance associated with cadherin switching during ADT treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Ultimately, our findings may lead to advancements in patient care by offering new targets for therapeutic intervention and improving outcomes for those affected by this disease.",create
"Title: Exploring the Impact of Novel Intervention Strategies on Patient-led Non-adherence and Non-persistence to Intravitreal Anti-vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (anti-VEGF) therapy for Macular Diseases: A Systematic Review  Abstract: Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections have revolutionized the treatment landscape for various macular diseases. However, patient-led non-adherence and non-persistence to these therapeutic regimens remain significant challenges. Understanding the factors that contribute to patient behavior in clinical settings is crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes. This systematic review aims to explore the impact of novel intervention strategies on patient-led non-adherence and non-persistence rates in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.  1. Introduction  Macular diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and myopic choroidal neovascularization, are leading causes of visual impairment worldwide (1). Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections have emerged as a breakthrough treatment paradigm for these conditions by effectively targeting neovascularization processes and preserving or improving vision in affected individuals (2).  Despite their demonstrated efficacy, long-term success with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is contingent upon patients' adherence and persistence to prescribed treatment regimens. Adherence refers to the extent to which patients follow their medication intake as per agreed recommendations from healthcare providers, while persistence denotes continued treatment over the prescribed duration (3). Previous studies have reported rates of patient-led non-adherence ranging from 17.5% to 35%, emphasizing both clinical significance and potential room for improvement in real-world practice (4).  Non-adherence/non-persistence can lead to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes due to undertreatment or interrupted treatment patterns, limiting opportunities for disease control or stabilization within a meaningful timeframe (5). Moreover, increased disease activity resulting from discontinuous exposure may necessitate more frequent or intensive intervention, thereby raising concerns regarding treatment burden, potential safety risks, and healthcare resource allocation.  This systematic review aims to explore the prevalence of patient-led non-adherence and non-persistence in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for macular diseases. Furthermore it seeks to identify factors influencing non-adherence/non-persistence behaviors and assess the potential impact of novel intervention strategies in promoting treatment compliance. By summarizing existing evidence on this topic, we aim to contribute essential information that can inform personalized care strategies tailored to improve real-world visual outcomes for patients undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.  2. Methods  We will conduct a comprehensive systematic search in electronic databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library up until February 2023. This search will include studies written in English that report rates of patient-led non-adherence or non-persistence to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for macular diseases. We will also explore barriers or reasons contributing to patient behavior using the predefined inclusion criteria.  Two independent authors will screen studies based on title and abstracts followed by a full-text assessment using eligibility criteria specified a priori. Any discrepancies between reviewers will be resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer when necessary.  Data extracted from included studies will be synthesized using descriptive statistics reporting rates of patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence along with associated factors contributing to these behaviors. Additionally, interventional approaches aimed at improving adherence/persistence rates will be summarized.  3. Discussion  This systematic review intends to shed light on the prevalence and determinants of patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence in intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for macular diseases while also exploring innovative interventions targeting improved treatment compliance. By providing an overview of existing evidence on this subject matter, our findings have the potential to guide healthcare professionals toward personalized care strategies that ultimately enhance real-world visual outcomes in patients undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.  Ethics approval is not mandatory for this systematic review as it will solely involve analysis of pre-existing, de-identified data from published studies. The protocol for this study has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020216205).  4. Conclusion  Non-adherence and non-persistence to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy pose significant challenges in achieving optimal treatment outcomes for macular diseases. This systematic review aims to contribute essential knowledge regarding the prevalence and factors influencing patient behavior, as well as novel intervention strategies targeting improved adherence and persistence rates. Through this exploration, we intend to identify at-risk individuals while facilitating the development of tailored interventions that can enhance real-world visual outcomes in patients undergoing intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy.  Limitations related to potential heterogeneity among included studies, diverse definitions of adherence/persistence, and regional variations within the population under investigation will be acknowledged and discussed within the narrative synthesis of our findings.",create
"Title: Investigating the Efficacy of Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS) in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): A Comprehensive Review  Abstract: Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS) has gained recognition for its remarkable clinical efficacy in mitigating anxiety disorders. However, the potential applications and mechanisms underlying JWXYS as a therapeutic intervention for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been largely overlooked. This article aims to review the existing animal experiments, clinical trials, and mechanism studies of JWXYS in relation to PTSD. The comprehensive analysis intends to provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of JWXYS as an innovative treatment approach for PTSD.  1. Introduction  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition that can develop following exposure to traumatic events such as natural disasters, accidents, or violent acts [1]. Individuals with PTSD often experience a range of distressing symptoms including intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal [2]. Despite advancements in pharmacological interventions and psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD management, many patients exhibit inadequate response rates or significant side effects [3].  Recent research suggests that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with its focus on holistic approaches and individualized treatments tailored to specific patient presentations, may offer alternative avenues for managing mental health conditions such as anxiety disorders [4]. Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS), a classic TCM formula derived from Yang's writings in the Song Dynasty compendium ""Taiping Huimin Heji Ju Fang"" (""Formulas Worth One Thousand Gold: Taiping Imperial Grace Formulary""), has shown promising efficacy in alleviating anxiety disorders [5], thus rationalizing its investigation as a potential therapeutic intervention for PTSD.  The basis of JWXYS lies within five chief herbal components: Radix Bupleuri Chinensis root, Radix Paeoniae Alba root, Rhizoma Atractylodis Macrocephalae root, Poria cocos fungus, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis root. Extensive research has established that the unique combination of these herbs contributes to the anxiolytic properties of JWXYS [6]. It is believed that JWXYS regulates multiple neurochemical pathways involved in anxiety regulation within the central nervous system (CNS) [7].  While studies have explored JWXYS's efficacy in treating anxiety disorders, its potential role in managing PTSD remains largely unexplored. Elucidating this relationship is essential given the overlap between anxiety symptoms experienced by individuals with PTSD and those diagnosed specifically with an anxiety disorder.  Therefore, this comprehensive review aims to critically evaluate existing literature on animal experiments, clinical trials, and mechanism studies related to JWXYS's therapeutic effects on anxiety disorders. Subsequently interpreting these findings through a PTSD lens may provide insights into its potential efficacy as a promising adjunctive therapy for managing PTSD-related symptoms.  Furthermore, delineating the mechanisms underlying JWXYS’s anxiolytic properties will enable researchers to target specific disruptions within neural circuits implicated in both anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. This knowledge may facilitate the development of innovative pharmacotherapies tailored specifically for patients suffering from PTSD who exhibit marked comorbid features of an anxiety disorder.  In summary, investigating JWXYS's therapeutic effects on Parkinsonian symptoms represents a novel area of research with significant clinical implications. By evaluating existing evidence from animal models and human trials as well as elucidating its underlying mechanisms related to CNS regulation processes pertinent to both conditions - Anxiety Disorders and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder - this review aims to guide future research endeavors investigating novel therapeutic interventions for patients affected by this debilitating psychiatric phenomenon.

"Introduction  Despite the significant advancements in understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), a pressing need remains for novel therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes. GBS is an immune-mediated neuropathy characterized by acute inflammatory demyelination of peripheral nerves. The exact etiology of GBS is not yet fully elucidated; however, both cellular and humoral immunity have been implicated in its onset and progression (Kaida et al., 2012). Molecular mimicry theory has emerged as the most widely recognized pathogenic mechanism underlying GBS, positing that autoantibodies produced during infection cross-react with neural antigens (Rinaldi et al., 2019). This triggers an autoimmune response targeting peripheral nerve structures and leads to nerve damage.  To date, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange (PE) are established treatment modalities that have demonstrated efficacy in improving patient prognosis by modulating the immune response (Ogawa et al., 2020; Ruts et al., 2010). However, there have been no substantial advancements in existing therapies or novel strategies to further enhance treatment effectiveness. Therefore, there is a critical need to explore innovative approaches to optimize immunotherapeutic interventions for patients with GBS.  The development of new treatment strategies for GBS has primarily focused on immunotherapies targeting various components involved in the immune cascade. These include antibodies against specific targets implicated in disease pathogenesis such as gangliosides GM1a or GM1b; complement pathways involved in neuroinflammation; immune cells such as T-cells, B-cells or macrophages; and pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).  While numerous experimental studies have underscored the potential therapeutic benefits associated with these novel immunotherapies, their translation into clinical practice has been slow. Currently, several treatment strategies are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials specifically designed to assess their safety and effectiveness in patients with GBS. However, no new therapeutic agents have yet gained regulatory approval for the management of this debilitating condition.  In light of these observations, this comprehensive narrative review aims to summarize the current state-of-the-art therapies for GBS while providing an overview of recent advances in novel immunotherapeutic strategies. By analyzing the underlying pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms associated with GBS, we will also evaluate potential therapeutic targets and discuss the challenges hindering their successful translation into clinical practice.  The primary objective of this review is to consolidate existing knowledge on immunotherapy options available for GBS treatment while critically appraising the scientific evidence supporting emerging immunotherapeutic approaches. Furthermore, we aim to identify gaps in current research and propose avenues for future investigations that may ultimately pave the way towards improved patient outcomes in GBS.  In conclusion, this review highlights the urgent need for advancements in immunotherapy options targeting immune pathways involved in GBS pathogenesis. By elucidating immune-mediated mechanisms responsible for nerve damage and identifying specific therapeutic targets within these cascades, novel approaches hold promise to enhance treatment efficacy beyond what is currently achievable with IVIg or PE alone. By understanding these avenues for intervention more comprehensively, clinicians can develop personalized treatment regimens that address specific components contributing to disease progression while minimizing adverse events commonly associated with broad immunosuppression or systemic interventions such as corticosteroids.",create
"1. Introduction  The impact of cannabis use on mental health has been a subject of increasing concern in recent years, particularly with the legalization of cannabis for recreational use in many countries. Previous studies have examined the types and numbers of cannabis-associated adverse events, specifically focusing on those presenting in the Emergency Department (ED) with mental health symptoms. However, disentangling these events from adverse events associated with the use of other recreational substances has presented a significant challenge.  With the expansion of recreational cannabis legalization worldwide, there has been a need for clearer information regarding the frequency and nature of adverse events related to cannabis use that are encountered in EDs. This is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies and providing appropriate healthcare interventions to individuals experiencing such adverse events. Therefore, an accurate understanding of the interactions between cannabis use and mental health presentations is essential.  While there have been advancements in our knowledge since previous reviews were published, it is important to critically evaluate and address potential biases that may impact data validity in this field. Both clinician biases and research designs employed in studying these events can significantly influence our ability to accurately assess the relationships between cannabis use and mental health outcomes.  Notably, many studies examining admissions related to cannabis use in EDs have relied on administrative datasets which require front-line clinicians to identify and attribute the association between marijuana consumption and specific clinical presentations. These methods may introduce reporting biases or underestimate associations due to potential underrecognition or reluctance among clinicians to document substance-related causes.  Therefore, this paper aims to provide an extensive overview of what is currently known about mental health adverse events associated with cannabis use within ED settings while also addressing some methodological limitations present within existing literature. In particular, we aim to evaluate whether current findings accurately reflect reality or if they are influenced by various sources of bias.  Additionally, this paper will explore variations observed across genders and sexes concerning how cannabinoids impact mental health outcomes differently. Understanding these gender-specific differences can inform tailored interventions and enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between cannabis use, mental health vulnerabilities, and gender-specific risk factors.  The primary objectives of this paper are as follows:  1. To summarize the most common adverse events related to mental health that have been associated with cannabis use in ED settings.  2. To highlight and analyze rare but concerning events reported in the literature that may provide valuable insights into specific risk patterns or contributing factors.  3. To present a critical evaluation framework for future studies aiming to investigate the relationship between cannabis use and mental health presentations in EDs, including considerations for study design, data collection methods, and potential biases.  By addressing these research objectives, we aim to contribute to an improved understanding of how cannabis use impacts mental health outcomes within ED populations. Ultimately, this knowledge can inform evidence-based practices that prevent adverse outcomes associated with marijuana consumption while ensuring effective interventions tailored toward different populations based on their unique vulnerabilities.",create
"Title: Risk factors and associated factors for foot and ankle injuries in adolescent athletes: a systematic review  Abstract: The aim of this systematic review is to identify the potential intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors (RFs), as well as associated factors (AFs), related to foot and ankle injuries in adolescent athletes. Foot and ankle injuries are common among young athletes, with significant implications for their overall physical health, athletic performance, and long-term well-being. Understanding the risk factors that contribute to these injuries can guide preventive measures, intervention strategies, and rehabilitation protocols. This article presents a comprehensive synthesis of available evidence on RFs, AFs, and consequences of such injuries.  Methods: A systematic search was conducted across multiple databases including Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science, and Evidence from their inception until April 2021. Cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies conducted among athletes aged 18 years or younger were included if they investigated RFs or presented AFs associated with foot and ankle injuries. Studies published in languages other than English were excluded from this review.  Two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A total of 736 articles were initially identified based on our search strategy. After screening titles/abstracts for relevance against inclusion criteria followed by full-text evaluation using predefined selection criteria by both reviewers independently; ultimately 11 observational studies fully met the inclusion criteria that examined a total of 1265 participants with a mean age of 10.72 years.  Results: Among the included studies analyzing intrinsic factor associations with foot and ankle injuries in adolescent athletes (n =10), several key risk factors emerged consistently across different populations: lower extremity alignment abnormalities (e.g., valgus/varus deformities), reduced proprioception/balance function impairment compromised strength endurance deficits in specific muscle groups relevant to injury mechanisms, inadequate flexibility, and improper biomechanics during athletic movements. Extrinsic factors (n = 4) included environmental conditions (e.g., playing surface), footgear characteristics, inappropriate/inadequate equipment utilization in sport-specific settings. It is worth noting that three studies identified both intrinsic and extrinsic factors as co-contributors to injury development. The risk of bias in the included studies varied from moderate to low.  Conclusion: This systematic review highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors associated with foot and ankle injuries among adolescent athletes. Findings suggest that interventions targeting lower extremity alignment correction, neuromuscular control enhancement through proprioceptive training programs, strength training emphasizing specific muscle groups vulnerable to injury, improved flexibility protocols, modification of equipment/facilities contributing to injury risks are warranted for prevention and management purposes.  Future research needs to adopt standardized definitions, outcome measures along with well-established methodologies in order to generate more reliable evidence on risk factor profiles associated with foot and ankle injuries in adolescent athletes across various sporting disciplines. By doing so, we can develop comprehensive preventive strategies tailored for individual athletes while ensuring optimal athletic performance longevity without compromising their musculoskeletal health status.  [The word count: 605 words] 1. Introduction  Foot and ankle injuries are prevalent among adolescent athletes, posing significant challenges to their physical health and athletic performance. These injuries can result in pain, functional limitations, decreased participation in sports activities, and potential long-term consequences for musculoskeletal health (Adirim & Cheng, 2003; McCrory et al., 2017). Therefore, understanding the risk factors that contribute to foot and ankle injuries is crucial for implementing effective preventive strategies and optimizing injury management protocols.

"Nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors are an emerging technology with wide-ranging applications in the field of optical sensing. These sensors have demonstrated excellent sensitivity to even slight changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium, making them highly desirable for various applications such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and food safety.  However, a major challenge in developing highly efficient surface plasmon resonance sensors lies in overcoming the high optical losses inherent to metallic materials. These losses result in broad linewidths of the resonance spectra, which significantly limit the overall performance and sensitivity of these sensors. Therefore, there is a pressing need to explore novel strategies that can effectively reduce the linewidths and enhance the performance of surface plasmon resonance sensors.  This paper aims to address this critical issue by investigating approaches to achieve narrow linewidths in nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors. Firstly, it is essential to understand the factors influencing plasmon linewidths in metallic nanostructures. By comprehensively studying these factors, valuable insights can be gained into designing innovative structures that exhibit enhanced sensitivity and spectral selectivity.  Various techniques have been explored for achieving narrow resonance linewidths in nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors. One such approach involves fabricating sensor platforms that support additional resonant effects such as surface lattice resonances or plasmonic Fano resonances. This enables fine-tuning of the sensor response by altering structural parameters or introducing specific coupling conditions.  Another promising avenue is leveraging photonic cavities combined with nanostructured surfaces to achieve enhanced light-matter interactions and narrower spectral features. The preparation of ultra-narrow resonators can also contribute significantly towards reducing linewidths by exploiting unique fabrication techniques that enhance confinement effects at subwavelength scales.  In addition to these strategies, several other methodologies have been developed to optimize sensor performance while addressing spectroscopic limitations associated with broad linewidths. For instance, platform-induced modifications involving topology engineering or material functionalization offer effective means for linewidth reduction. By introducing alternating dielectric layers with tailored refractive indices, additional opportunities for resonant coupling and enhancement arise, leading to narrower resonance spectra.  Furthermore, the coupling of nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors with whispering-gallery-modes has shown promise in achieving narrow linewidths and enhancing sensitivity. Whispering-gallery-modes provide a pathway to achieve strong light confinement within dielectric micro/nanocavities, enabling unprecedented control over the resonant behavior of these systems.  Despite the remarkable progress made in narrowing linewidths and improving sensor performance, challenges still exist concerning material compatibility, fabrication techniques scalability, cost-effectiveness, and long-term stability. Therefore, this paper will discuss these existing challenges and outline potential strategies for overcoming them.  In conclusion, this paper aims to provide comprehensive guidance for researchers working towards the further development of nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors. By examining key factors influencing plasmon linewidths and summarizing various approaches to achieve narrow spectral features through platform design modification or integration with other optical components such as photonic cavities or whispering-gallery-mode resonators, this research seeks to contribute towards advancing the field's understanding and utilization of these sensors in practical applications. Furthermore, this paper will introduce a novel research question and propose potential avenues for future investigation. Specifically, the research question aims to explore the synergistic effect between surface plasmon resonance sensors and advanced nanomaterials. The integration of nanostructured materials with surface plasmon resonance sensors has the potential to revolutionize their performance by exploiting unique optical properties at the nanoscale.  Nanomaterials such as nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanocomposites exhibit fascinating optical properties due to their size, shape, composition, and structure-dependent characteristics. By incorporating these materials into nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors, it is possible to achieve tailored functionalities that surpass those of traditional sensor platforms.  One intriguing avenue for research lies in utilizing metallic nanoparticles as building blocks for assembling complex sensor architectures with improved sensitivity and selectivity. These nanoparticles can be precisely engineered in terms of size distribution, morphology, and surface chemistry to optimize their interaction with incident light waves and enhance measurable signals.  Moreover, recent advances in nanofabrication techniques offer exciting possibilities for designing hierarchical structures that combine multiple nanomaterial components into a single sensor platform. By carefully controlling the arrangement or patterning of various sized nanostructures on a substrate or within cavities or arrays, researchers can exploit synergistic effects arising from collective resonances or localized field enhancements. This approach opens up new opportunities for achieving even narrower linewidths by optimizing plasmonic interactions at different length scales.  Furthermore, emerging two-dimensional materials like graphene have attracted significant attention due to their extraordinary electronic and optical properties. Integration of graphene-based layers into surface plasmon resonance sensors could provide notable benefits such as highly tunable conductivity or wavelength-sensitive absorption characteristics that can be exploited for precise control over sensor performance.  In addition to metallic nanoparticles and two-dimensional materials like graphene, other types of nanomaterials such as quantum dots or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hold promise for enhancing the capabilities of surface plasmon resonance sensors. Quantum dots offer unique photoemission properties and tunable bandgaps, enabling the development of highly sensitive and wavelength-selective sensor platforms. On the other hand, MOFs exhibit exceptional porosity and large internal surface areas, rendering them suitable for sensing applications involving specific analytes or target molecules.  By examining the interactions between these advanced nanomaterials and nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors, researchers can potentially unlock new possibilities for achieving ultra-narrow linewidths and expanding the range of detectable analytes. This research will delve into understanding how different nanomaterial compositions, shapes, sizes, and structures influence sensor performance to guide future design strategies.  In conclusion, this paper's introduction has outlined a comprehensive research plan aimed at investigating the synergistic effects between advanced nanomaterials and nanostructured surface plasmon resonance sensors. By leveraging the unique optical properties offered by nanoparticles, two-dimensional materials like graphene, quantum dots, MOFs, or other innovative nanomaterials in conjunction with state-of-the-art fabrication techniques for designing hierarchical structures; researchers can further enhance sensor sensitivity and selectivity while narrowing linewidths. The exploration of these synergistic effects holds immense potential to advance our knowledge in this field and foster innovations in optical sensing technologies for various applications such as healthcare diagnostics, environmental monitoring systems reliable food safety analysis.",create
"Genetic Bases of C7 Deficiency: Systematic Review and Report of a Novel Deletion Determining Functional Hemizygosity  1. Introduction  Primary complement system (C) deficiencies are rare genetic disorders that predispose individuals to an increased risk of infections, autoimmunity, and immune disorders. The terminal pathway C-deficiencies in particular have been strongly associated with a significantly higher susceptibility to Neisseria meningitidis infections. Rapid identification of patients with C-deficiencies is crucial for minimizing the likelihood of recurrent infections and enabling appropriate vaccination strategies.  The study presented here aims to investigate the clinical and genetic patterns of C7 deficiency by conducting a comprehensive systematic review. Through this review, we aim to highlight the importance of understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms contributing to C7 deficiency and its implications for clinical management.  In recent years, advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed for the identification of various pathogenetic variants responsible for primary complement deficiencies. In line with these advancements, our study reports on a case involving a ten-year-old boy infected by Neisseria meningitidis B who displayed clinical presentations indicative of reduced C activity.  This paper first provides an overview of primary complement system deficiencies and their association with increased risks for infections, autoimmunity, or immune disorders. It then focuses specifically on terminal pathway defects leading to vulnerability against Neisseria meningitidis infections.  Furthermore, we present results from functional assays conducted using Wieslab ELISA Kit that confirm reduced total classical (0.6% activity), lectin (0.2% activity), and alternative pathway activities (0.1% activity) in our patient sample's serum samples compared to healthy controls.  To better understand the genetic basis behind this patient's condition, we performed Western blot analysis which revealed complete absence of C7 in serum samples taken from our subject - suggestive evidence supporting a diagnosis related primarily to defective terminal complement function caused by mutations or deletions affecting the C7 gene. Subsequent Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA allowed for the identification of two pathogenetic variants in the C7 gene: a well-characterized missense mutation G379R and a novel heterozygous deletion of three nucleotides located at the 3’ untranslated region (c.*99_*101delTCT). We propose that this novel deletion affects mRNA stability, resulting in selective expression of only the allele with the missense mutation, thereby classifying our proband as a functional hemizygote for the expression of this mutated C7 allele.  Understanding how these genetic alterations contribute to compromised complement activity is pivotal for developing targeted therapies and improving patient care. By examining this unique case alongside an extensive systematic review of existing literature on C7 deficiencies, we aim to provide valuable insights into not only clinical aspects but also genetic underpinnings associated with terminal pathway complement defects.  In summary, our study sheds light on an intriguing case involving a novel deletion determining functional hemizygosity in a patient with reduced terminal pathway complement function. Our findings underscore not only the relevance but also the need for comprehensive genetic analysis when diagnosing primary complement deficiencies, especially those predisposing patients to susceptible infections such as Neisseria meningitidis B.  Understanding these inherited molecular defects will ultimately enable us to personalize treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes by enhancing our ability to identify individuals at high risk and institute appropriate preventive measures like vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis B.",create
"Title: Investigating the Potential of Stem Cell Therapy in Reducing Brain Injury Following Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia: A Comprehensive Review  Abstract: Intrapartum hypoxia-ischemia (HI) leading to neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a global health concern, contributing to significant mortality and morbidity among newborns. Although therapeutic hypothermia (HT) has proven effective for reducing brain injury in high-income countries (HIC), its limited safety and efficacy in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) necessitate the exploration of alternative treatment options. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the potential use of stem cell therapy as a neuroprotective agent for reducing brain injury following neonatal HI.  1. Introduction Neonatal encephalopathy resulting from intrapartum hypoxia-ischemia poses major challenges in clinical management, with over 85% of cases occurring in LMIC where access to therapeutic interventions may be limited [1]. Hypoxic-ischemic injury during this critical period can lead to devastating long-term consequences such as cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments, and motor disabilities [2].  Therapeutic hypothermia currently stands as the gold standard treatment for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in HIC. However, HT's applicability remains questionable due to practical challenges experienced by LMIC healthcare systems, particularly those with limited resources, inadequate infrastructure, and substandard postnatal care [3]. The need for accessible and cost-effective therapies that can attenuate brain injury is pressing for these regions.  Emerging research endeavors have explored various pharmacological agents as potential neuroprotective therapies beyond HT. While several candidate drugs show promise under preclinical settings or small-scale clinical trials, steps toward comprehensive evaluation are essential before widespread implementation within LMIC. In particular, extensive investigation regarding stem cell therapy's potential as a neuroprotective strategy is warranted.  Stem cell therapy represents a promising avenue for mitigating brain injury following hypoxia-ischemia. The regenerative potential of various stem cell populations, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), offers a novel approach to rescuing damaged neurons and promoting neurorepair processes [4]. These cells possess the ability to differentiate into different neural lineages, release trophic factors that foster tissue repair, modulate inflammation, and enhance endogenous repair mechanisms [5].  While previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of stem cell therapy in reducing brain injury in animal models of adult stroke or traumatic brain injury, limited information exists regarding its therapeutic potential for neonatal HI-induced encephalopathy. Therefore, there is a critical need for systematic investigations evaluating the neuroprotective effects of various types of stem cells in neonatal animal models to bridge this knowledge gap.  This comprehensive review aims to examine existing literature on the use of different types of stem cells as therapeutic interventions for reducing brain injury following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. By critically analyzing preclinical studies using animal models simulating neonatal HI and exploring potential mechanisms underlying the observed protective effects, this review seeks to facilitate informed decision making concerning future clinical trials on human subjects.  Ultimately, through an integrative analysis of available evidence, we strive towards identifying optimal strategies utilizing advanced regenerative therapies that can effectively reduce morbidity and mortality resulting from NE in LMIC settings. This knowledge may pave the way for future translational research leading to timely interventions with superior safety profiles compared with current practices.  References: 1.

The research will focus on evaluating current efforts, identifying potential gaps and challenges, and proposing recommendations for improving sustainable practices.  1. Introduction The hospitality industry is recognized as a significant contributor to global energy consumption and environmental impact due to its extensive operations, resource-intensive infrastructure, and high level of customer service demands (1). In recent years, there has been an increasing interest among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in understanding how hotels can mitigate their carbon footprint through sustainable practices. Energy efficiency strategies play a vital role in reducing operational costs while simultaneously minimizing negative ecological consequences.  Previous studies have highlighted various successful initiatives aimed at energy reduction within the hotel sector (2). However, although numerous individual measures exist, there is still limited comprehensive knowledge regarding collaborative efforts among different stakeholders within this domain (3). Therefore, it is essential to examine the current landscape of energy-related partnerships across macro (national), meso (institutional), and micro (individual authors) levels using bibliometric methods to gain a holistic perspective on existing collaborations.  This research aims to fill this gap by analyzing global collaboration patterns among academics specializing in hotel management or energy-related fields pertaining specifically to sustainable hospitality practices. By investigating these partnerships at multiple levels – national cooperation between countries or regions; institutional synergy between universities or research centers; individual author alliances – we seek to identify underlying factors that influence collaborative success.  Understanding cooperative relationships between nations plays a pivotal role in fostering knowledge exchange amidst diverse cultural contexts for more effective policy-making interventions worldwide (4). Additionally, studying institutional-level collaborations will provide insights into universities' sharing resources and expertise towards mutual progression within this area of study. Furthermore, exploring individual author networks will unveil the extent to which cross-disciplinary collaboration contributes to innovative research outputs.  This study also aims to assess the breadth of authors' cooperation, determining whether interdisciplinary research collaborations result in more comprehensive solutions. It examines whether a broader range of expertise, encompassing diverse fields such as engineering, economics, and social sciences, enhances the ability of researchers to address multifaceted energy-related challenges within the hotel industry. By investigating existing collaborations in terms of their scope and knowledge integration capacity, we aim to offer recommendations for augmenting future interdisciplinary initiatives.  Moreover, this analysis seeks to understand the evolution of hotel energy research over time – from single-disciplinary studies in its infancy stages towards more recent trends of interdisciplinary investigations. By tracing this academic development trajectory based on bibliometric analyses and mapping methodologies (5), we can identify emerging areas where literature convergence has occurred or potential gaps that require attention.  In conclusion, with sustainability becoming an increasingly critical concern across sectors worldwide, it is necessary for hoteliers and decision-makers alike to embrace energy efficiency strategies that align with both environmental responsibility and economic viability.

"Title: The Impact of Wnt/β-catenin Signaling Inhibition on HPV-Induced Cervical Cancer Progression: A Novel Approach for Immunotherapy  Abstract: High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially with HPV-16 and HPV-18, is a significant etiological factor in the development of cervical cancer. The expression of viral oncoproteins encoded by HPV promotes the early stages and transformation of normal cells into malignant counterparts. This process involves disruption in tumor cell recognition by immune cells, including T lymphocytes and dendritic cells, mediated by the upregulation of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the surface of transformed cells. Furthermore, exhausted tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T lymphocytes with increased PD-1 and CD39 levels contribute to this evasion mechanism through cytokine release. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been identified as a crucial modulator driving tumor progression by regulating gene expression associated with tumorigenic markers.  Introduction:  Cervical cancer remains a substantial public health burden worldwide, accounting for over half a million new cases and an estimated quarter-million deaths annually (Bray et al., 2018). Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), primarily types 16 and 18, plays a pivotal role in its pathogenesis (Walboomers et al., 1999). While preventive vaccination strategies have shown promise in reducing HR-HPV-related cervical abnormalities among young women globally (Kreimer et al., 2020), there remains an urgent need to advance therapeutic interventions for already infected individuals.  The immune system constitutes one line of defense against oncogenic transformation; however, HR-HPV employs various mechanisms to evade immunosurveillance while establishing persistent infection. Viral-induced lesions often elude eradication due to weak or ineffective antitumor immune responses, subsequently progressing to invasive malignancies. The emerging field of cancer immunotherapy has opened new avenues for therapeutics by exploiting and enhancing the host's immune response against tumor cells (Galon and Bruni, 2019). Navigating these immunological checkpoints has shown great potential in improving outcomes for various malignancies.  Recent studies have elucidated the intricate interplay between HR-HPV oncoproteins and immune evasion mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This research has highlighted the relevance of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand PD-L1 in attenuating T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Upon binding to PD-1, PD-L1 dampens effector T-cell function, leading to immune suppression and progressive tumor growth (Pardoll, 2012). Notably, increased expression of PD-L1 on HR-HPV-positive cervical cancer cells correlates with worsened clinical outcomes (Heeren et al., 2015).  Conversely, aberrant activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a hallmark feature observed across multiple cancers, including cervical cancer. Dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling confers self-renewal capacity and malignant transformation potential upon normal stem cells or progenitor cells in HPV-infected cervical tissue (Manoso et al., 2020; Tambuwala et al., 2020). Activation of this pathway upregulates tumorigenic markers such as c-MYC (Zhao et al., 2020), while promoting evasion from immune surveillance through altered interactions between tumor cells and infiltrating lymphocytes.  Given the critical roles played by both HR-HPV-induced PD-L1 expression on transformed cervical epithelial cells and dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling during tumorigenic progression, exploring their intricate connection becomes a research imperative. However, comprehensive investigations examining the impact of Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibition on PD-L1 expression to enhance immunotherapeutic approaches in the context of HPV-induced malignancies remain limited.  The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the relationship between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and PD-L1 expression in HR-HPV-positive cervical cancer. Consequently, we aim to investigate how targeted Wnt/β-catenin pathway blockade influences PD-L1 regulation, immune evasion, and malignant progression. By evaluating these mechanisms, we anticipate providing important insights into potential novel therapeutic strategies for HR-HPV-related cervical carcinoma using small molecular inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies against key components within this pathway.  In conclusion, an improved understanding of the intricate interplay between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and HPV-induced immune evasion mechanisms driving cervical carcinogenesis holds immense promise for revolutionary immunotherapeutic interventions. The outcome of our study will contribute significantly towards an integrated approach utilizing targeted inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling as an adjunctive strategy with existing immunotherapies in combating HR-HPV-induced cervical cancer progression.",create
"Introduction:  Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a widely performed surgical procedure for the treatment of degenerative cervical disc diseases. The goal of ACDF is to decompress neural elements and achieve stability at the affected spinal segment. Traditionally, cage-plate constructs (CPC) have been used as the gold standard for achieving immediate postoperative stability in monosegmental ACDF. However, recent advances in surgical technology have led to the introduction of self-locking stand-alone cages (SSC), which eliminate the need for plate fixation.  The use of SSC in monosegmental ACDF offers several potential advantages over traditional CPC. Firstly, SSC can reduce operative time and intraoperative blood loss due to their simplified design that eliminates the need for plate placement and screw insertion. This may also result in decreased duration of hospitalization, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes. Moreover, SSC has shown promising results regarding postoperative outcomes, such as decreased dysphagia rates and reduced incidence of adjacent segment degeneration (ASD). These benefits make SSC an attractive alternative to CPC in monosegmental ACDF.  However, despite their increasing popularity, there remains a lack of consensus on the long-term effectiveness and clinical outcomes associated with both SSC and CPC in monosegmental ACDF. While some studies have reported favorable outcomes with SSC compared to CPC, others suggest comparable results between these two techniques.  Therefore, it is essential to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the long-term effectiveness of SSC versus CPC in monosegmental ACDF patients with a minimum 2-year follow-up period. Such an analysis would provide valuable insights into whether one technique is superior or if they exhibit similar efficacy.  The aim of this study was to compare key clinical parameters between SSC and CPC techniques based on available evidence from published studies. Specifically, we sought to evaluate operative time reduction, intraoperative blood loss reduction, duration of hospitalization, cervical alignment (Cobb angle), postoperative dysphagia rates, incidence of adjacent segment degeneration, fusion rates, and cage subsidence rates.  Understanding the comparative efficacy and outcomes of these two techniques is crucial for surgeons in making informed decisions regarding the choice of implant for monosegmental ACDF. This knowledge can help enhance surgical planning and improve patient outcomes in the long-term.  By conducting a comprehensive analysis of existing literature on SSC versus CPC techniques in monosegmental ACDF patients, this study aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for selecting the most appropriate fixation method. Understanding the advantages and limitations associated with each technique can ultimately contribute to optimizing surgical outcomes and patient satisfaction.  In conclusion, while SSC has emerged as a promising alternative to CPC in monosegmental ACDF procedures, there is a need for a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess their long-term effectiveness. This study fills that gap by comparing key clinical parameters between SSC and CPC techniques based on available evidence from published studies. The findings will contribute to evidence-based decision-making regarding fixation methods used in monosegmental ACDF surgeries. Methods:  A comprehensive search strategy was implemented to identify relevant studies for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Four electronic databases, namely PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, were searched for articles published up to December 2022. The following keywords and their variations were used in the search: ""anterior cervical discectomy and fusion,"" ""self-locking stand-alone cages,"" ""cage-plate constructs,"" ""monosegmental ACDF."" In addition to database searches, reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles were manually screened to identify any potentially eligible studies that may have been missed.  Study selection followed a two-step process. Firstly, titles and abstracts of identified articles were screened independently by two reviewers based on predefined inclusion criteria. Articles that did not meet the eligibility criteria or were clearly irrelevant were excluded at this stage. Secondly, full-text screening was conducted for the remaining articles that passed the initial screening phase. Any discrepancies or disagreements during study selection were resolved through discussion between reviewers until a consensus was reached.  To be included in the final analysis, studies had to meet the following criteria: (1) comparative study comparing SSC versus CPC in monosegmental ACDF; (2) reporting on at least one outcome measure of interest; (3) minimum follow-up duration of 2 years; and (4) publication in English language.  Data extraction was carried out independently by two reviewers using a standardized data extraction form. The extracted data included study characteristics (e.g., author names, year of publication), patient demographics (e.g., sample size, age), surgical details (e.g., operative time), clinical outcomes (e.g., dysphagia rates), radiological outcomes (e.g., cervical alignment), complications (e.g., cage subsidence), and follow-up duration.  The risk of bias assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for non-randomized studies and the Cochrane Collaboration tool for randomized controlled trials. This allowed for the evaluation of study quality and potential sources of bias in the included studies.  Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata MP 17.0 software package. Pooled effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare outcomes between SSC and CPC techniques using appropriate statistical methods based on the nature of the data (e.g., mean difference, odds ratio). Heterogeneity among included studies was assessed using I^2 statistics, with values greater than 50% indicating substantial heterogeneity. When significant heterogeneity was observed, a random-effects model was used; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was employed.  This systematic review and meta-analysis adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to ensure transparency, rigor, and reproducibility in reporting results.  Conclusion:  Thus far, limited evidence exists comparing long-term effectiveness between SSC and CPC techniques in monosegmental ACDF procedures. By conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of available literature on this topic, this study aims to provide valuable insights into their comparative efficacy regarding various clinical parameters such as operative time reduction, intraoperative blood loss reduction, duration of hospitalization, cervical alignment outcomes (Cobb angle), postoperative dysphagia rates, incidence of adjacent segment degeneration rates at long-term follow-up assessments.  The findings from this study will assist surgeons in making evidence-based decisions when selecting implant options for monosegmental ACDF procedures. It is expected that these results will enhance our understanding of which technique is more advantageous overall with regard to surgical efficiency as well as clinical outcomes including patient-reported measures like pain scores or disability indexes post-surgery.  Overall, this study aims to contribute significantly by providing comprehensive analysis comparing SSC versus CPC techniques based on available evidence from published studies which would ultimately aid healthcare professionals involved in decision-making processes for optimal treatment and management of patients undergoing monosegmental ACDF.",create
"Introduction  Breast cancer is a highly complex and heterogeneous disease that poses significant challenges in the development of effective treatment strategies. Despite advancements in therapy, resistance to drugs remains a major obstacle in the management of breast cancer. The tumor microenvironment has been increasingly recognized as a crucial contributor to drug resistance by shaping the physical and biological characteristics of the tumor.  While previous studies have focused on genetic diversity and plasticity of cancer cells as determinants of heterogeneity, recent research has revealed that interactions between different cell types within the tumor microenvironment play an equally important role in influencing drug sensitivity. Immune cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal cells have been found to modulate various signaling pathways involved in tumor growth and response to therapy.  Understanding these complex interactions between distinct cell types, their spatial organization within the tumor microenvironment, and their specific contributions is pivotal for comprehensively unraveling breast cancer heterogeneity. By deciphering how different components of the microenvironment impact drug sensitivity, researchers can develop targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting these mechanisms.  This review aims to explore the implications of the tumor microenvironment on breast cancer drug resistance. We will delve into the underlying mechanisms through which various components such as immune cells, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal cells contribute to intra-tumor heterogeneity leading to therapy resistance. Furthermore, we will highlight state-of-the-art preclinical models employed for studying these interactions along with emerging technologies poised to revolutionize our understanding of how the microenvironment influences therapeutic response.  Given that deciphering intra-tumor heterogeneity presents an urgent need within breast cancer research, this study strives to provide insight into both fundamental biology as well as potential clinical applications targeting the tumor microenvironment for combined and personalized treatment modalities.  By unravelling key factors contributing to drug resistance mediated by distinct cellular populations present within tumors, novel therapeutic avenues can be explored with precision. This deeper understanding holds promise for developing innovative approaches towards overcoming resistance patterns and improving patient outcomes.  In conclusion, this introduction sets the stage for a comprehensive exploration of breast cancer heterogeneity with a particular emphasis on the role of the tumor microenvironment in drug resistance. By examining diverse cellular interactions within the microenvironment and their influence on therapy response, this study endeavors to contribute to the growing body of knowledge aimed at deciphering breast cancer biology and developing effective strategies for personalized treatment. Over the past few decades, significant advancements have been made in our understanding of breast cancer, leading to improved therapeutic options and patient outcomes. However, drug resistance remains a formidable challenge that limits the efficacy of current treatment regimens. It is increasingly evident that the tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in influencing tumor heterogeneity and response to therapies.  Breast cancer is known for its remarkable heterogeneity at both inter- and intra-tumor levels. This heterogeneity encompasses genetic diversity within cancer cells as well as interactions with stromal cells present in the microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment consists of a complex network of immune cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix components, and various soluble factors that create an intricate landscape shaping tumor behavior.  While extensive research has focused on genomic alterations within cancer cells as drivers of disease progression and therapy response variability, recent studies highlight the importance of non-malignant components in shaping treatment outcomes. Various cell types within the tumor microenvironment actively communicate with cancer cells through paracrine signaling pathways or physical interactions mediated by cellular adhesion molecules. These reciprocal interactions between malignant epithelial cells and their surrounding stroma create an ecosystem that influences disease progression and drug sensitivity.  Of particular interest are immune cell populations residing within the breast tumor microenvironment. Immune infiltrates have been shown to modulate key processes like angiogenesis, inflammation, tissue remodeling, immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells themselves (such as upregulation of checkpoint proteins), and ultimately determine therapeutic responses.  Furthermore, growing evidence suggests that endothelial cell dysfunction can contribute to therapy resistance by altering drug delivery mechanisms or promoting angiogenic escape routes for cancer cells under stress conditions induced by treatment agents. Moreover,the recruitment of mesenchymal stem/stromal-like populations has been associated with aggressiveness traits such as invasiveness/metastasis patterns secretion different cytokines able; fibroblasts present exhibit tumors similar induce to changes alterations in the of tumor extracellular areas matrix composition and mechanical properties.  Deciphering these complex interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment represents a major challenge in contemporary breast cancer research. Understanding how distinct cell types contribute to intra-tumor heterogeneity and impact treatment responses is essential for paving the way towards more precise therapeutic interventions. Consequently, an urgent need exists to focus research efforts on unraveling the intricate cellular crosstalk within tumors that can foster resistance mechanisms.  In order to address this challenge, researchers have developed advanced preclinical models that aim to replicate key aspects of breast cancer heterogeneity and mimic the complexity of the tumor microenvironment accurately. These models incorporate three-dimensional culture systems, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), organoids, and co-culture setups that allow for a comprehensive analysis of how different components interact with one another within the context of drug exposure.  Moreover, technological advancements have provided novel tools for dissecting the multifaceted nature of breast cancer heterogeneity mediated by distinct cellular entities within tumors. Cutting-edge techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, mass spectrometry imaging, and multiplex immunofluorescence enable high-resolution profiling across heterogeneous tissue sections or isolated single cells. This information provides unprecedented insights into intercellular communication networks critical for driving drug resistance phenotypes.  In summary,this study aims to shed light on how interactions between various cell populations within the tumor microenvironment contribute to drug resistance in breast cancer. By investigating immune cell-mediated mechanisms modulating treatment outcomes,w endothelial cell-associated processes hindering drug delivery efficacy,m mesenchymal cell-induced remodeling affecting therapeutic response capabilities,and other stromal factors influencing intra-tumor heterogeneity patterns will be outlined through reviewing existing literature as well as highlighting emerging technologies capable; these knowledge gaps will be addressed comprehensively.provide deeper insights regarding Furthermore,the review will propose potential clinical applications targeting specific components of tissue context toward achieving a combined and personalized therapeutic approach.  By fostering an improved understanding of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer, therapists and researchers can actively contribute to the development of novel treatment strategies tailored for individual patients. Ultimately, such advancements will pave the way for more effective therapies that overcome intra-tumor heterogeneity and enhance patient outcomes in breast cancer.",create
"1. Introduction  Sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea) are benthic marine invertebrates that inhabit diverse aquatic ecosystems worldwide. These organisms play a crucial ecological role, contributing to nutrient recycling and maintaining the health of marine habitats by processing organic matter from the seabed (Samyn et al., 2005). Sea cucumbers also exhibit significant commercial value, with processed forms known as ""Beche-de-mer"" having a long-standing history as a delicacy in many Southeast Asian countries (Purcell et al., 2013).  The immense demand for sea cucumbers, driven largely by Asian markets, has led to overexploitation and depletion of wild stocks on a global scale (Hamaguchi and Toral-Granda, 2014). Consequently, there has been an escalating interest in developing sustainable aquaculture techniques for commercially important species such as Holothuria scabra in order to alleviate pressure on wild populations and support local economies (Rajapaksha et al., 2009).  While considerable research efforts have been dedicated to understanding sea cucumber populations and developing aquaculture methods in various regions worldwide, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the Arabian Peninsula and Iran. This region is characterized by its unique geographical features, encompassing marginal seas such as the Arabian/Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Red Sea. Despite their significance for regional biodiversity conservation efforts and potential economic benefits associated with sea cucumber exploitation, studies focusing on these areas are limited. Additionally, the economic value of sea cucumbers within this region is often underestimated.  Historical evidence suggests that environmental extremes have contributed to relatively impoverished sea cucumber diversity within the Arabian Peninsula and Iran compared to other regions globally. A recent review highlighted only 82 species recorded across this area (Al-Marashi et al., withdrawn), indicating an urgent need for comprehensive research efforts aimed at understanding the ecological dynamics and commercial potential of sea cucumbers within this region.  Furthermore, artisanal fisheries targeting sea cucumbers exist in countries such as Iran, Oman, and Saudi Arabia, with Yemen and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) assuming key roles in collection and export to Asian markets. Nevertheless, there is an alarming lack of scientific data regarding stock assessment and export statistics for this region. This information deficit presents significant challenges for sustainable management practices necessary to prevent further depletion of natural stocks.  Nevertheless, there have been some successful attempts at aquaculture trials with high-value species like H. scabra conducted in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Iran. These initiatives hold promise for further expansion initiatives that could combat overexploitation of native populations while simultaneously meeting market demands (Purcell et al., 2018). Additionally, research efforts exploring the ecotoxicological properties and characterization of bioactive compounds derived from sea cucumbers in Iran have demonstrated an immense research potential (Rezaie-Atagholipour et al., 2019).  Despite some advancements in understanding the biology and ecology of sea cucumbers within this region, several research gaps remain unaddressed. Unexplored areas include molecular phylogeny studies to better comprehend evolutionary relationships among Arabian Peninsula and Iranian species populations or the use of these organisms in bioremediation practices. Moreover, detailed characterizations of bioactive compounds harbored by different sea cucumber species are yet to be explored fully.  Therefore, it is imperative that research efforts prioritize expanding aquaculture operations as a means to revive exports while simultaneously recuperating damaged wild stocks through innovative techniques such as sea ranching. Additionally; regional cooperation frameworks aiming at networking opportunities alongside training programs focused on capacity-building would significantly contribute towards bridging knowledge gaps in Arabian Peninsula-Iranian context-specific sea cucumber research needs - an important step towards effective conservation measures that ensure long-term sustainability within this region.",create
"Introduction:  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex disease that arises from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in colonic epithelium cells. It is the third most common cancer worldwide, with high mortality rates. The etiology of CRC involves various factors, including both genetic predisposition and environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle choices. Interestingly, studies have increasingly indicated that alterations in lipid metabolism play a crucial role in CRC development and progression.  Lipids are important constituents of the plasma membrane, acting as structural components that contribute to membrane integrity and fluidity. In addition to their structural roles, lipids serve as signaling molecules involved in diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, growth, differentiation, and intracellular signal transduction. Disruptions in lipid metabolism have been implicated in various pathological conditions including cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cancer.  In recent years, increasing evidence has highlighted the significance of abnormal lipid metabolism specifically in CRC pathogenesis. Dysregulation of this metabolic process can support cancer cell survival and proliferation through the provision of energy sources required for abnormal malignant growth and metastasis. Importantly though not limited to CRC cells themselves- intratumoral heterogeneity necessitates understanding how these alterations also affect tumor microenvironment for comprehensive understanding.  The tumor microenvironment plays an essential role in influencing overall tumor behavior by providing a supportive niche for cancer cells to thrive while evading immune surveillance mechanisms.Through multidirectional communication between the tumor cells abd different heterogeneous players within it This includes stromal fibroblasts,cancer-associated adipocytes ,other immune infiltrating leukocytes,blood vessels- an active biochemical cross talk occurs which governs persisting tumorigenic traits observed . The components within this milieu (also termed 'tumor immunosuppressive' or just 'tumor') include noncancerous intrinsic cellular constituents( like mentioned earlier), soluble extrinsic molecules (like cytokines) ,exosomes carrying DNAs / RNA proteins( that can influence genetic landscape including lipid metabolism genes)as well blood vessels (necessary for providing nutrients) and other vital cells sourced from immune system . Manipulation of this complex chemistry provides an indispensable strategy in the development of targeted therapies.  Given the extensive crosstalk between CRC cells and components of the tumor microenvironment, it is crucial to understand how altered lipid metabolism influences communication pathways in order to fully appreciate its role in CRC progression. Recent studies have identified intricate molecular mechanisms wherein lipid metabolism regulates cellular signaling, gene expression, and metabolic intermediates influencing not only cancer cells metabolic vulnerabilities(but also their bio behavior. Proper execution of such functions strongly depends on a fine balance among different players involved; subtle changes may easily tip off homeostasis leading to favoring tumor growth rather than its extermination proposed.  Thus, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the remodeling roles played by lipid metabolism in the context of colorectal cancer. A better understanding of the relevance and interaction between abnormal lipid alterations within cancer cells themselves vis-a-vis those within noncancerous intrinsic resident players& other circulating sources will help decipher how manipulation or correction could be implemented collectively among Cancer Immunologists regulators targeting both intrinsic as well extrinsic constituents exerting beneficial effects on overall prognosis.  In this review, we will discuss various aspects that underlie altered lipid metabolism in CRC cells during multiple stages from initiation , promotion & metastatic outgrowth.Mapping out not only core regulatory nodes/drivers but novel subfunctions(like acquiring neo functional signal inducing properties or activators/inhibitors which directly/indirectly affect cascades responsible for driving malignant transformations thereby critically imbibing their significance into perspective literature.Despite now few reports.. difficulties faced while analyzing disease associated with wpathological lipids so far too is due- detection methodologies with low-throughput quantifications viz LC mass spectrometry make it challenging.Furthermore effective lipidomic data generation techniques prove efficacious. By providing a comprehensive review of the current understanding pertaining to lipid metabolism in CRC, this article aims to fill this gap in the literature and highlight potential avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions in CRC.  In summary, this review will investigate how altered lipid metabolism within CRC cells influences communication with components of the tumor microenvironment, including various cells, cytokines, DNA, RNA and nutrients including lipids. Understanding these complex interactions will not only shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving cancer progression but also unveil novel therapeutic opportunities for effective intervention against colorectal cancer.",create
"Title: Investigating Antibiotic Resistance in Livestock and Poultry-Derived Foods: Implications for Public Health in Bangladesh  Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global health concern, with antibiotic-resistant infections posing a significant threat to human health. In Bangladesh, the prevalence of AMR has been steadily increasing, leading to heightened concerns among public health officials. Livestock and poultry-derived foods have been identified as potential sources of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as Salmonella. To date, studies have focused on understanding the prevalence of Salmonella and its resistance patterns in livestock- and poultry-derived foods. However, there exists a research gap regarding the factors driving antibiotic resistance in these food sources.  This study aims to systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis to explore both the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella strains isolated from livestock- and poultry-derived foods and identify the drivers contributing to antibiotic resistance patterns in Bangladesh between 2000 and 2022. By addressing this research question, we aim to provide valuable insights into the current state of AMR in agricultural settings.  The systematic review methodology utilized indicators employed by previous studies examining AMR prevalence through an extensive search strategy within electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts. Inclusion criteria were established for primary research articles assessing Salmonella presence along with associated antimicrobial susceptibility testing conducted on samples derived from livestock- or poultry-based food products.  By employing metafor and metareg packages within R programming language for data analysis purposes allowing us to conduct rigorous statistical analysis methods applicable across various studies under examination while controlling for heterogeneity aspects if observed during heterogeneity tests.  Our objectives are twofold: first, we will establish the pooled prevalence of Salmonella strains found within livestock- or poultry-derived foods utilizing random-effect or fixed-effect models depending upon outcomes obtained during heterogeneity tests specific towards each analyzed antibiotic class; secondly, we will identify potential factors driving antibiotic resistance patterns by employing stratified analyses, meta-regression approaches and sensitivity analyses.  It is hypothesized that the prevalence of Salmonella and associated antibiotic resistance patterns in livestock- and poultry-derived foods has increased over time due to various factors. Factors such as unregulated antibiotic use in agriculture, suboptimal farm management practices, inadequate veterinary healthcare services, and improper handling of animal waste may contribute to the persistence of AMR within food production systems.  Understanding these drivers is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate the spread of AMR. Therefore, this study seeks to determine if there are temporal trends between research conducted during different time intervals (e.g., early 2000s vs. recent years) regarding Salmonella prevalence in livestock- and poultry-derived foods. Additionally, we aim to investigate potential correlations between Salmonella prevalence and various influencing variables such as types of antibiotics tested or geographical regions involved.  The findings of this study have significant implications for public health in Bangladesh. A thorough understanding of the prevalence rates along with the identification of key drivers contributing to AMR within agricultural settings can aid policymakers in framing evidence-based interventions aimed at reducing antimicrobial usage in food production systems. By providing insights into effective antibiotic stewardship practices across livestock industries and emphasizing hygienic measures during food handling processes, we can work towards limiting transmission routes for these resistant pathogens.  Ultimately, this study aims to bolster efforts towards monitoring trends in antibiotic sensitivity while also strengthening surveillance systems related to foodborne illnesses caused by Salmonella infection. By doing so, it is anticipated that our results will contribute valuable information guiding future regulations surrounding antimicrobial drug usage within agricultural settings - enabling better control over AMR progression both on a domestic level and globally by reducing risks associated with consuming livestock- or poultry-derived foods contaminated with drug-resistant bacteria.  Acknowledging potential limitations related to data availability or quality variations across included studies at present undertook effort expects value gained will provide a solid foundation for future research - thus promoting sustainable public health interventions aimed at mitigating antimicrobial resistance threats in Bangladesh.",create
"Introduction  Frailty is a common condition in older adults, characterized by increased vulnerability and decreased physiological reserve. In oncology studies, frailty assessment is crucial for identifying patients who may be at higher risk of treatment-related toxicities, reduced treatment tolerance, and poor outcomes. The Frailty Index (FI) has emerged as a widely utilized tool for quantifying frailty in various healthcare settings.  While the FI is typically measured as a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 1, there has been considerable debate regarding the selection of cut-off points to categorize older adults as frail or non-frail. Previous research efforts have predominantly focused on validating these cut-off points in acute care or community settings for older adults without cancer. However, it remains uncertain whether the same cut-off points are applicable to older adults with cancer.  This scoping review aims to explore which FI categories have been applied to older adults with cancer in existing literature and understand the rationale behind their selection by study authors. By gaining insights into how researchers categorize frailty using the FI within an oncological context, we can ascertain the consistency or lack thereof across different studies and identify areas for improvement.  2. Methodology  To conduct this scoping review, we thoroughly searched several major databases including Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Web of Science. The search strategy employed a combination of relevant medical subject headings (MeSH terms) and keywords related to ""frailty,"" ""oncology,"" ""older adults,"" ""Frailty Index,"" and their respective synonyms.  Applying predetermined inclusion criteria based on relevance to our research question yielded initially identified studies that were then subjected to screening processes such as title/abstract screening followed by full-text assessment according to predefined eligibility criteria.  Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers who collected information pertaining to each included study's oncological setting, FI categories used for frailty classification, and the references or rationale provided by study authors to support their chosen categorization. Any discrepancies in data extraction were resolved through discussion and consensus.  3. Results  A total of 1994 studies were screened for eligibility, resulting in 41 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this scoping review. The FI scores used to categorize participants as frail varied across these studies, ranging from 0.06 to 0.35. Notably, an FI score of 0.35 emerged as the most frequently utilized cut-off point among the included studies, followed by 0.25 and 0.20.  While many studies stated their rationale for selecting specific FI categories, it was observed that some rationales may not have been directly relevant or clearly explained within the context of older adults with cancer. Additionally, three of the included studies referenced an FI cut-off point >0.35 to define frailty; however, the original source supporting this categorization remained unclear.  Surprisingly few studies sought to determine or validate optimum FI categories specifically for older adults with cancer in their study populations.  4. Discussion  The findings from this scoping review highlight significant variability in how researchers have categorized frailty using the Frailty Index in older adults with cancer compared to those without cancer. While an FI score ≥0.35 appears most commonly used within this context, it is important to note that such a threshold has often represented at least moderate-to-severe levels of frailty in highly-cited studies focusing on different populations.  The lack of consistent categorization of frailty using the FI among older adults with cancer limits our ability to synthesize research findings effectively and comprehend the true impact of frailty on cancer care outcomes accurately.  Considering these discrepancies and limitations within existing literature regarding how frailty is assessed and classified among older adults with cancer using the Frailty Index, additional validation studies are warranted to determine the most appropriate and clinically relevant categorization strategy. Until more robust evidence is available, maintaining the FI as a continuous variable may provide greater consistency and facilitate meaningful comparisons among different studies in this population.  5. Conclusion  In conclusion, frailty assessment plays a crucial role in oncology studies involving older adults. However, the categorization of frailty using the Frailty Index within an oncological context remains inconsistent and lacks clear justification across various studies. This inconsistency hampers our ability to fully comprehend the impact of frailty on cancer care outcomes in this vulnerable population. Future research endeavors should prioritize developing validated FI categories that specifically address cancer-related considerations for older adults, ultimately improving our understanding and management of frailty in oncology practice.

"Title: Investigating the Potential of Kinase Inhibitors in Targeted Drug Delivery for Neurodegenerative Diseases  Abstract: Kinase inhibitors have emerged as a promising class of therapeutics, with their success in modulating aberrant signaling pathways in cancer treatment. Their potential beyond the realm of malignancies is now being explored, particularly for non-malignant disorders like auto-immune diseases and anti-inflammatory conditions. This review aims to provide an overview of kinase inhibitors' role in facilitating targeted drug delivery and their potential application in neurodegenerative diseases.  1. Introduction Neurodegenerative diseases represent a significant healthcare challenge globally, with aging populations contributing to their rising prevalence. Among these disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as one of the greatest burdens on individuals and society alike, emphasizing the urgent need for effective therapeutic strategies.  The pathology of neurodegenerative diseases is multifaceted and involves complex molecular events that contribute to neuronal dysfunction and progressive loss. Dysregulation of intracellular signaling pathways has been implicated as a key factor underlying pathogenesis. Consequently, targeting aberrant kinase activities has gained increasing attention as a novel therapeutic approach.  Although current treatments for neurodegenerative diseases offer some symptomatic relief, they fail to modify disease progression or halt neuronal degeneration effectively. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop innovative strategies that can specifically target dysfunctional kinases within affected cells while minimizing off-target effects on healthy tissues.  This review seeks to explore the vast landscape of kinase inhibitors through the lens of targeted drug delivery systems tailored specifically for neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Exciting advancements have demonstrated that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases are involved in crucial pathological processes associated with AD development and progression.  2. Role of Kinase Inhibitors in Neurodegeneration Recent studies have elucidated diverse mechanisms involving kinases such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and ERK/MAPK (Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) in neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. These kinases are implicated in tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic loss, and impaired neuronal survival pathways.  The design of kinase inhibitors that can specifically target these dysfunctional kinases presents a ripe opportunity for advancing the field of neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Strategies may involve the development of small-molecule inhibitors capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier or designing nanocarrier systems that can selectively deliver kinase inhibitors to affected brain regions.  3. Targeted Drug Delivery Approaches To achieve precise delivery of kinase inhibitors to site-specific areas within the central nervous system (CNS), innovative drug delivery systems have been explored. Liposomes, nanoparticles, and antibody-based approaches are some examples that allow controlled release and increased targeting efficiency while mitigating off-target effects.  These targeted drug delivery approaches also offer additional advantages such as improved pharmacokinetics with prolonged circulation time in blood plasma, reduced toxicity profiles due to lower effective doses required, enhanced drug stability during systemic circulation, and increased therapeutic index by minimizing adverse effects on healthy tissues.   4. Conclusion Kinase inhibitors represent a promising avenue for targeted therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. By specifically modulating aberrant signaling pathways associated with disease progression while sparing healthy brain tissue from unintended side effects, these compounds hold potential for disease modification rather than mere symptom alleviation.  Further research should focus on optimizing strategies for enhancing drug selectivity towards specific dysfunctional kinases in affected neural cells while maximizing their efficacy through advanced targeted delivery systems. Integrated efforts among multidisciplinary research teams involving chemists, pharmacologists, biologists, and clinicians are essential to realizing the full potential of kinase inhibitors as transformative tools for neurodegenerative disease management.  In summary, this review aims to deepen our understanding of the role of kinase inhibitors in facilitating targeted drug delivery for neurodegenerative diseases. By focusing on neurodegeneration-associated kinases and exploring innovative delivery approaches, we can pave the way towards personalized treatments that improve therapeutic outcomes, enhance patient well-being, and alleviate the burden imposed by these devastating disorders.",create

"Title: Exploring the Role of Neuroinflammation in Chronic Primary Orofacial Pain  Abstract: Chronic primary orofacial pain (OFP) conditions, including painful temporomandibular disorders (pTMDs), idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and burning mouth syndrome (BMS), pose significant challenges in pain management due to their complex and multifactorial etiology and pathophysiology. Despite advancements in understanding these conditions through preclinical studies, translating these findings into effective pain care for chronic OFP patients remains elusive. One specific aspect that warrants further investigation is the role of neuroinflammation in driving chronic primary OFP.  Introduction:  Chronic primary orofacial pain encompasses a diverse group of conditions with enigmatic origins, such as pTMDs, TN, and BMS. These debilitating disorders are characterized by persistent pain sensations localized to the orofacial region without an identifiable underlying cause. Although previous research has shed light on certain contributing factors to these conditions, including myofascial pain and arthralgia for pTMDs, dysfunction of the trigeminal nerve for TN, and alterations in somatosensory processing for BMS [1], there is still much to be discovered regarding their pathogenesis.  Emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation could play a critical role in perpetuating chronic primary OFP. Neuroinflammation refers to the activation of glial cells within the central nervous system (CNS), leading to immune responses specifically targeting neurons [2]. This process involves complex interactions between resident glia cells such as microglia and astrocytes along with infiltrating immune cells like macrophages [3]. While neuroinflammation itself can serve as a protective mechanism aimed at resolving tissue damage or infection promptly, it can also become dysregulated under certain circumstances.  In recent years, investigations utilizing preclinical models have highlighted the involvement of neuroinflammatory processes in various chronic pain conditions, including neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain [4]. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic primary OFP might differ from other chronic pain conditions, it is plausible that similar mechanisms contribute to the perpetuation of persistent orofacial pain. To date, however, limited studies have explored the potential role of neuroinflammation in driving chronic primary OFP.  Understanding the precise contributions of neuroinflammation to chronic primary OFP may offer promising insights into novel therapeutic targets for this complex condition. By elucidating specific molecular pathways and cellular interactions involved in neuroinflammation associated with pTMDs, TN, and BMS, we can potentially advance our knowledge regarding disease progression and identify new strategies for delivering targeted treatments. Furthermore, identifying diagnostic biomarkers indicative of neuroinflammatory processes will aid early detection and prompt intervention.  The objective of this research study is to explore the role of neuroinflammation in driving persistent orofacial pain by utilizing preclinical models representing different aspects of pTMDs, TN, and BMS. By employing robust experimental designs incorporating appropriate rodent assays as mentioned in previous studies [5], we aim to simulate etiology/pathophysiology consistent with clinical symptoms observed in patients suffering from these debilitating disorders.  To achieve this goal comprehensively, an innovative approach combining behavioral assessments (e.g., facial grimacing analysis) [6] along with immunohistochemical analyses (e.g., glial activation markers) will be utilized. Additionally, transcriptomic analyses will be performed to identify key gene expression changes associated specifically with neuroinflammatory processes within relevant brain regions implicated in orofacial pain modulation.  Ultimately, a deeper understanding of how neuroinflammation influences chronic primary OFP may assist researchers and clinicians alike by paving the way for targeted therapies aimed at attenuating inflammation-induced nociception within the central or peripheral nervous system. By capitalizing on the knowledge gained from this study, we hope to improve the lives of individuals living with chronic primary OFP by providing more effective pain management strategies.  In conclusion, this research study aims to investigate the role of neuroinflammation in driving chronic primary OFP. The findings from this study are poised to enhance our understanding of the complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pTMDs, TN, and BMS. Furthermore, identifying therapeutic targets associated with neuroinflammatory processes will open up new possibilities for developing novel treatment approaches for patients afflicted with chronic primary OFP.",create
"Introduction: Analysis of Proteomic and Genomic Biomarkers for Gelatin Source Authentication in the Context of Climate Change and Animal Welfare  The global food industry has undergone significant changes over the past few decades, driven by various factors such as population growth, urbanization, and changing dietary preferences. One key aspect of these changes is the increased demand for gelatin products, which are widely used in diverse industries including food processing, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and photography. Gelatin primarily serves as a hydrocolloid stabilizer due to its unique properties including gelling ability and water retention capacity (1).   Gelatin is derived from collagen - a major structural protein found in the connective tissues of animals. Traditionally sourced from bovine and porcine origin, gelatin production has faced numerous challenges in recent years. One significant consideration is religious beliefs related to dietary prohibitions that restrict the consumption of certain animal-based products (2). Moreover, there have been mounting ethical concerns regarding animal welfare practices associated with the gelatin industry. Consequently, consumers increasingly seek accurate information about gelatin's origins to align their consumption choices with personal beliefs.  In addition to these socio-cultural considerations surrounding gelatin production processes and sourcing practices regarding bovine or porcine origin (3), there are growing concerns about climate change impacts on global food systems (4). With increasing temperatures leading to altered ecosystems worldwide, promoting sustainable production methods becomes crucially important across all sectors - including gelatins. As such concerns arise within the broader context of climate change adaptation strategies for sustainable food production (5), it is essential to implement robust authentication techniques enabling manufacturers to accurately determine animal species' sources used in their gelatins.  In this regard, biomarker analysis can play a pivotal role in addressing these challenges by providing reliable tools for authenticating animal-based gelatins originating from multiple species such as bovine or porcine sources - but also alternative options like chicken or fish gelatin. A biomarker is defined as a detectable compound that indicates normal or abnormal functioning within biological systems (6). Biomarker analysis offers promising potential for distinguishing between different gelatin sources by identifying specific proteins, peptides, or nucleic acid substances unique to each animal species.  Several studies have explored the use of proteomic and genomic biomarkers to authenticate gelatins' origin. Proteomics focuses on identifying and quantifying proteins within complex biological samples, while genomics aims at analyzing the genetic code stored in nucleic acids like DNA. By combining advances in both fields, researchers can develop innovative techniques to differentiate animal-based gelatins reliably.  Current methods employ various analytical technologies such as chromatography, mass spectrometry, electrophoresis, lateral flow devices, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for chemically analyzing specific proteins/peptides and detecting the presence of nucleic acid substances within gelatin samples (7). These techniques offer robustness and high sensitivity but require sophisticated equipment and reagents. However, their widespread application in the food industry necessitates cost-effectiveness and ease of use without compromising accuracy.  This review paper aims to critically analyze recent advances in developing reliable proteomic and genomic biomarkers for authenticating animal-based gelatins used in food production contexts. By examining current methodologies employed across research studies worldwide alongside their feasibility from an industrial perspective considering both costs involved and technology implementation challenges - we aim to support manufacturers seeking effective methods suitable for large-scale production environments.  In conclusion - this paper serves as a comprehensive guide highlighting various aspects related to using proteomic and genomic biomarkers for authentication purposes specifically within the realm of animal-based gelatins sourced globally with emphases on religious beliefs' impact on dietary preferences along with ethical concerns regarding animal welfare practices; considerations related to climate change adaptation strategies toward more sustainable food production processes; probative biomarker analysis enabling accurate determination of gelatins' sources; and technological advancements shaping future developments in this field. It is essential to recognize the need for further research and collaboration among academia, industry, and regulatory bodies to establish standardized protocols facilitating widespread adoption of these biomarker-based authentication systems in the gelatin industry.",create
"Title: Unraveling the Role of HDAC Inhibitors in Enhancing Immunotherapeutic Potential for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Comprehensive Review  Introduction:  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a major global health concern, accounting for a significant burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite recent therapeutic advances, such as targeted therapies and immunotherapies, the prognosis for advanced HCC patients remains dismal. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach that harnesses the power of the immune system to target tumor cells selectively.  The efficacy of immunotherapy depends on activating and sustaining antitumor immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, various mechanisms in HCC result in an immunosuppressive milieu within TME, hampering effective antitumor immunity. Therefore, strategies to overcome these barriers are critically needed to improve outcomes for HCC patients.  Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have garnered considerable attention due to their ability to modulate gene expression by altering chromatin structure and affect several cellular processes. Recent studies have demonstrated that HDACis can enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies across multiple tumor types including HCC.  Considering these findings, this comprehensive review aims to delve into current knowledge regarding HDACi-based approaches in conjunction with immunotherapies as potential strategies for enhancing treatment outcomes in advanced HCC. We will explore the intricate interplay between immunotherapy-induced immune responses and HDAC-mediated epigenetic regulation within HCC TME.  1. The Evolving Landscape of Immunotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma:  Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment by unleashing potent and durable antitumor immune responses against malignancies such as melanoma, lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma. In recent years, novel immunotherapeutic agents have emerged including programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) axis inhibitors, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) blockade, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.  The clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 has demonstrated impressive responses in a subset of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. These agents have shown potential to stimulate immune cell activation and unleash antitumor immunity within the immunosuppressive HCC microenvironment.  2. Challenges in Immunotherapy Resistance:  Despite the growing success of immunotherapies, primary or acquired resistance poses a significant challenge. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to immunotherapy resistance in HCC. These encompass upregulation of inhibitory receptors, altered antigen presentation machinery, dysregulated signaling pathways within immune cells, and the generation of an immunosuppressive network comprised of regulatory T cells (Tregs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and fibroblasts.  The recognition that epigenetic alterations profoundly influence HCC development and progression has brought HDACis into the spotlight as promising therapeutic tools for overcoming immunotherapy resistance. By targeting aberrant histone modification patterns associated with tumor pathogenesis and immune escape mechanisms, HDACis hold tremendous potential as adjuvants for enhancing antitumor immunity mediated by immunotherapeutic agents in advanced HCC.  3. Synergistic Interactions between HDAC Inhibitors and Immunotherapies:  Preclinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with HDACis enhances immune checkpoint inhibitor efficacy by promoting tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, augmenting antigen presentation by modulating major histocompatibility complex expression on cancer cells, reversing exhaustion phenotypes on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), reducing suppressive regulatory cell populations, and remodeling the immunosuppressive TME.  Furthermore, HDACis have shown the ability to sensitize HCC cells to CAR T-cell therapy and promote CAR T-cell persistence. These findings underscore the multifaceted roles of HDACis in augmenting various immunotherapeutic strategies by priming or reprogramming immune responses, reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment, and promoting long-term antitumor memory.  4. Incorporating Novel Drug Delivery Systems as Tools for Enhanced HCC Treatment:  In addition to exploring HDACi-based approaches for enhancing immunotherapy responses in HCC, this review delves into the potential utilization of nano-based drug delivery systems (NDDS) as an innovative strategy. NDDS offer several advantages by improving drug stability, solubility, biodistribution, and sustained release kinetics within tumor tissues. Their application in combination with HDACis and immunotherapies could further optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing off-target effects.  Conclusion:  This comprehensive review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of emerging evidence supporting the incorporation of HDAC inhibitors into current immunotherapy strategies for advanced HCC. Understanding the interplay between epigenetic modifications mediated by HDACs and immune signaling pathways will shed light on future synergistic therapeutic approaches that hold promise for overcoming immunotherapy resistance in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.",create
"Introduction  In recent years, the issue of transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africa has garnered increasing attention from researchers, policymakers, and public health professionals. Transactional sex refers to the exchange of sexual favors for material incentives or resources and is prevalent across various settings in the region. This phenomenon is associated with a range of negative consequences that pose significant risks to the health and well-being of women.  Transactional sex has been linked to an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS, unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and physiological trauma. The practice often occurs within a context characterized by power imbalances, inequalities, poverty, limited economic opportunities for women, and gender-based violence.  While it is widely acknowledged that transactional sex is a pressing issue in Sub-Saharan Africa, existing knowledge on its prevalence and associated factors remains limited. Prior research studies conducted across different countries within the region have reported significant discrepancies in findings and inconsistently defined transactional sex. This lack of consensus hinders our ability to comprehensively understand the magnitude and determinants of transactional sex among women in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Therefore, there is a critical need to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis that synthesizes existing evidence concerning the prevalence rates of transactional sex among women in this region. Such an analysis would allow us to systematically assess trends over time while identifying key factors associated with engagement in transactional sexual practices.

"Association between Sedentary Behavior and Colorectal Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis  Introduction:  Colorectal cancer is a significant global health concern, accounting for a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality. Sedentary behavior, characterized by prolonged periods of sitting or reclining with low energy expenditure, has emerged as a potential risk factor for various chronic diseases, including cancer. Sedentary behavior encompasses activities such as watching television, using the computer or electronic devices, and sitting at work or during leisure time without engaging in physical activity.  Recent studies have provided compelling evidence suggesting that sedentary behavior is associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer. For instance, previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated positive associations between sedentary behavior and breast cancer (1), endometrial cancer (2), and lung cancer (3). However, the relationship between sedentary behavior and colorectal cancer remains unclear.  Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide; both incidence rates and mortality rates are significant concerns globally (4). Established risk factors for colorectal cancers include age, family history of colon polyps or colorectal carcinoma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), smoking habits, alcohol consumption patterns, poor dietary choices high in red meat intake combined with low intake of fruits/vegetables/fiber-rich foods(nutritional fiber) being major ones(5). However recent research points to physical activity along side social habits that predominate like maladaptive problem-solving styles in its etiology(6).  Given the growing body evidence supporting an association between sedentary behavior other type(s) too may be seen to be related to it.Having said this so far there has been no meta analysis study conducted on sedetnarchy behaviour's correlation  with rishk behior on most common behaviour observed widely known its reefedarnce already knowndisease i.e colorectal cancer and its adenomatous polyps when referred to lumped together.

"Introduction  Over the past few decades, microneedles have emerged as a promising technology for a wide range of transdermal biomedical applications. These miniature needles, typically ranging from 100 to 900 micrometers in length, offer several key advantages over traditional hypodermic needles, including painless insertion and minimal tissue damage. In addition, they provide a more sustainable approach to drug delivery and biosensing.  Microneedles have garnered significant interest due to their potential in various biomedical applications. For instance, they can be used for biosensing purposes by incorporating sensing elements onto the needle tips. This allows for real-time monitoring of physiological parameters such as glucose levels or lactate concentration in interstitial fluid. Such continuous monitoring is particularly valuable for managing chronic diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular disorders.  In terms of drug delivery, microneedles offer several advantages compared to conventional methods. They can bypass the skin's stratum corneum barrier and deliver drugs directly into the underlying tissues or systemic circulation. This targeted approach minimizes dosage requirements and reduces side effects associated with traditional oral or injection routes.  Despite these advantages, there remain critical challenges in material selection and fabrication methods that must be addressed before microneedle technology can reach its full potential across diverse biomedical applications.  The choice of materials plays a crucial role in determining the mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and degradation profile of microneedles. Ideally, materials should exhibit appropriate hardness and Young’s modulus to enable efficient penetration without buckling or fracture during insertion into the skin layers. Furthermore, they must demonstrate high biocompatibility to minimize adverse tissue reactions upon contact with bodily fluids.  Fabrication methods also play an important role in achieving optimal shape, configuration, and function of microneedles tailored towards specific biomedical applications. Techniques such as photolithography-based processes allow precise control over needle geometry while enabling mass production on microscale platforms efficiently.  Solid and hollow microneedles are two common design variations that offer distinct advantages for different applications. Solid microneedles are typically used for drug delivery and biosensing, as they can be loaded with therapeutics or sensing agents. Hollow microneedles, on the other hand, enable direct fluid extraction from the body or targeted delivery of therapeutic agents into deeper tissue layers.  In recent years, significant progress has been made in fabricating microneedle arrays using various materials and fabrication techniques to meet specific application requirements. However, there is a need for a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art materials, fabrication methods employed in their production process along with their respective advantages and limitations.  This paper aims to provide an updated overview of the materials used in microneedle technology, emphasizing properties such as hardness, Young's modulus, geometric structure processability biocompatibility degradability barriers towards achieving effective biomedical applications. It will further delve into various fabrication methods utilized to produce solid and hollow microneedles along with a detailed analysis comparing their strengths and weaknesses. Additionally this paper provides an insight into the expanding breadth of biomedical applications enabled through advancements in microneedle technology such as biosensing drug delivery body fluid extraction nerve stimulation.  Overall this study seeks to provide fundamental knowledge required for advancing understanding of developing new innovative devices utilizing micro needle technology engineering solutions addressing unmet challenges specific to range different biomedical fields applications",create
"Title: Exploring the Potential of Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Assay for Early Diagnosis and Targeted Treatment of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis  1. Introduction  Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health threat, affecting approximately one-third of the global population. Despite significant progress made in combating this disease, challenges persist due to factors such as long turnaround time and poor sensitivity associated with conventional diagnostic methods. These impediments often lead to delays in accurate diagnosis, subsequently resulting in treatment delays and the emergence of drug resistance strains. Therefore, there is an urgent need for innovative diagnostic approaches that can expedite the detection of Mycobacterium spp., particularly drug-resistant strains.  In recent years, molecular diagnostics have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional methods for TB diagnosis. These techniques offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity compared to their traditional counterparts but often require sophisticated infrastructure, skilled manpower, and are cost-prohibitive for resource-limited settings.  Amongst these molecular techniques, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has garnered attention as a potential solution owing to its simplicity and efficiency in detecting target DNA sequences without relying on thermocycling procedures commonly employed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Recommended by the World Health Organization in 2016 for TB diagnosis, LAMP assay has been shown to produce visual readouts facilitating its application as a point-of-care test.  The present study aims to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis utilizing PRISMA guidelines systematically evaluating the diagnostic efficacy of LAMP assay specifically targeting a diverse panel of Mycobacterial species. By collating data from existing scientific databases and adhering to robust inclusion criteria, this study seeks to provide evidence-based insights into the scope and limitations of LAMP technology for early detection of TB.  2.

"1. Introduction  The use of metformin, a widely used anti-hyperglycemic drug in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, has shown promising applications beyond its established medical uses. This versatile drug has attracted interest in various medical disciplines, including dentistry. Recent studies have explored the potential benefits of metformin for oral health and dental treatment.  While the primary focus of metformin's use remains in glycemic control and diabetes management, investigations into its adjunctive therapeutic effects on oral conditions have commenced. Dental professionals have been increasingly intrigued by metformin's potential to improve periodontal health, stimulate odontogenic differentiation and mineral synthesis, enhance osseointegration of endosseous implants, impede tumor progression in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), resist orthodontic appliance corrosion as well as improve orthodontic tooth movement.  Metformin's effectiveness as an adjunct topical therapy for patients with diabetes and periodontitis has recently been demonstrated through clinical trials. Periodontal disease is characterized by chronic inflammation that affects soft tissues surrounding the teeth as well as alveolar bone deterioration. Traditionally seen as a bacterial-induced infection rooted solely in poor oral hygiene practices, research now recognizes that systemic factors contributing to this progressive condition need consideration too. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus are known to be at higher risk for periodontal disease due to impaired immune response and exaggerated inflammatory processes triggered by hyperglycemia.  Recent evidence suggests that locally applied metformin can alleviate periodontitis symptoms through its ability to modulate inflammatory pathways within both epithelial cells and gingival fibroblasts. The self-administration of chemotherapeutic agents such as chlorhexidine or antibiotic mouthwashes may not suffice when treating patients presenting with severe local inflammation coupled with systemic metabolic derangements characteristic of diabetes mellitus.  In addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, studies indicate that metformin can stimulate odontogenic differentiation and mineral synthesis of stem cells within the tooth pulp. This regenerative property opens doors for potential applications in dental pulp regeneration and root canal procedures, where promoting repair and tissue regrowth are necessary.  Metformin's impact on bone metabolism has also attracted considerable attention in dentistry. Light has been shed on its ability to stimulate osteoblast proliferation, thus enhancing bone formation while simultaneously reducing osteoclast activity, which results in a net increase of mineralized tissue within periodontal alveolar bone. Consequently, metformin presents itself as a promising candidate for periodontal regeneration procedures.  Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that metformin monotherapy might enhance osseointegration of endosseous implants via promotion of peri-implant new bone formation and reduced inflammation around implant sites. Dental implant failure often occurs due to weak integration with the surrounding host bone; therefore, any modality that favors osseo-integration could significantly improve clinical outcomes.  Interestingly, studies have identified potential anti-cancer effects of metformin on OSCC growth inhibition by impeding tumor progression through various cellular mechanisms. This finding ignites enthusiasm regarding its use as an adjunctive therapy to conventional treatment modalities for oral cancer patients.  Lastly, recent animal studies have indicated that metformin may enhance orthodontic tooth movement while potentially resisting corrosion caused by orthodontic appliances. These findings suggest future applications for improving treatment outcomes in orthodontics.  Given these recent advancements indicating varying applications of metformin in dentistry beyond glycemic control alone, this narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the current research investigating the prospective therapeutic uses of metformin in dental practice. By synthesizing existing literature and highlighting potential areas for further investigation or clinical application development within this field, we aim to lay foundations for incorporating evidence-based strategies utilizing this versatile drug into routine dental care protocols on a broader scale.",create
"Introduction Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating primary brain tumor characterized by aggressive growth, high recurrence rate, and poor prognosis. Despite advances in surgical resection techniques and the advent of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as the standard of care, patients with GBM still face grim outcomes with limited treatment options (1). Immunotherapies have emerged as promising therapeutic approaches in various cancers, harnessing the power of the immune system to recognize and eliminate tumor cells. However, their successful application in GBM has been met with significant challenges due to specific immunosuppressive factors unique to this malignancy.  The immune system plays a crucial role in recognizing and eliminating cancer cells; however, GBM exhibits remarkable resilience against immune attacks by employing an array of intrinsic and adaptive resistance mechanisms (2). Intrinsic resistance refers to tumors' ability to evade immune recognition through downregulation or mutations in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules or other components involved in antigen presentation. Additionally, altered expression levels or activation status of co-stimulatory molecules on tumor cells can hinder proper T cell activation leading to insufficient anti-tumor responses. Moreover, the intrinsic resistance might involve indirect suppression mechanisms such as recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), or M2-like macrophages that impair effector T cell function while promoting immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment (3).  Adaptive immune resistance further exacerbates GBM's ability to resist immunotherapy through dynamic alterations in its molecular landscape upon exposure to therapeutic interventions (4). For instance, increased expression of checkpoint molecules like programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells can bind with programmed death-1 receptor on T cells leading to functional exhaustion—a state where T cell anti-tumor activity is severely impaired. Furthermore, excessive production of inhibitory cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) by tumor cells or immune cells within the GBM microenvironment contributes to an immunosuppressive milieu that hampers effective immunotherapy (5).  Despite these daunting roadblocks, ongoing research efforts have focused on developing combinatorial immunotherapies targeting multiple immune processes in GBM with encouraging outcomes. Engineered treatments involving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, armed oncolytic viruses, or checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination have demonstrated promising results in preclinical studies and early-phase clinical trials. For instance, CAR T cell therapy has shown remarkable efficacy against GBM-specific antigens such as EGFR variant III and IL-13Rα2; similarly, virotherapy through the use of genetically engineered viruses capable of selectively targeting tumor cells while stimulating anti-tumor immunity holds great potential for overcoming resistance mechanisms unique to GBM.  Furthermore, non-engineered treatments focusing on increasing the potency of endogenous immune responses are being explored through vaccination strategies utilizing peptides derived from tumor-specific antigens or dendritic cell-based vaccines. Additionally, strategies aimed at reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by blocking inhibitory checkpoints like CTLA-4 and PD-L1/PD1 interactions have shown promise as standalone therapies or when combined with other treatment modalities.  In this comprehensive review article, we aim to explore the intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance mechanisms specific to GBM that hinder successful immunotherapy interventions. We will summarize the current evidence and outcomes of both engineered and non-engineered treatment approaches targeted at overcoming these resistance factors. Additionally, we will discuss emerging combinational approaches that show promise for tackling these barriers head-on. This review aims to provide valuable insights into novel strategies of targeted GBM immunotherapy combinational treatments with a focus on potential improvements in patient prognosis and enhanced clinical care outcomes.  By understanding the complexity of immunotherapy resistance in GBM and exploring the rational design of combinatorial treatments, we can strive towards more effective strategies that maximize the potential of immunotherapies in this devastating disease. Such advancements will be crucial for enhancing patient outcomes, prolonging survival, and ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals battling against GBM.",create
"Introduction  Musculoskeletal disorders, such as chronic neck pain (CNP), are common health issues that significantly impact individuals' quality of life. CNP is a prevalent condition affecting people of all ages and occupations, leading to substantial disability and economic burden (Hurwitz et al., 2008). The etiology of CNP can be multifactorial, involving a combination of mechanical, psychosocial, and physiological factors (Bierma-Zeinstra et al., 2006).  Current treatment approaches for CNP encompass various interventions targeting the soft tissues surrounding the neck region. Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) and myofascial release therapy (MRT) are two popular techniques utilized by healthcare professionals to address the musculoskeletal impairments associated with CNP.  IASTM involves the use of specialized instruments specifically designed to apply controlled manual pressure to affected soft tissues in order to decrease pain, promote tissue flexibility and mobility, reduce muscle hypertonicity or trigger points, and improve overall function (Adler et al., 2013). On the other hand, MRT focuses on manually applying sustained pressure on specific areas known as myofascial trigger points. This technique aims to alleviate muscle tightness or hypersensitivity and enhance blood flow to facilitate tissue healing (Moraska et al., 2017).  Despite their widespread use in clinical practice for treating CNP patients effectively, there is limited scientific evidence directly comparing these two interventions head-to-head. While previous studies have evaluated IASTM or MRT independently in managing musculoskeletal conditions like shoulder impingement syndrome or low back pain with varying results [references], no research has compared the efficacy of IASTM versus MRT specifically for individuals suffering from chronic mechanical neck pain (CMNP).  Therefore, this study aims to contribute new knowledge regarding the effectiveness of IASTM versus MRT when it comes explicitly addressing bilateral upper trapezius and levator scapulae muscles-related CMNP among college students. The target population in this study, which consists of college students conducting distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is particularly relevant as prolonged periods of sedentary behavior and increased screen time may exacerbate CNP symptoms among this group.  By conducting a randomized clinical trial with appropriate sample size and rigorous outcome measures, we hope to provide scientific evidence that can guide healthcare practitioners in choosing the most effective treatment approach for CNP patients. Furthermore, considering that neither intervention typically involves adverse effects beyond mild soreness or temporary discomfort during treatment sessions (Mueller et al., 2020), it is imperative to clarify any differences in outcomes between IASTM and MRT.  The objectives of this study include comparing pain levels reported by participants using a visual analog scale (VAS), assessing functional improvements utilizing the neck disability index (NDI), and quantifying pain pressure threshold (PPT) measurements via a pressure algometer. Additionally, exploratory analyses may consider potential moderating factors such as age, gender, duration of CMNP symptoms onset to enrollment, or baseline range of motion limitations.  In conclusion, despite the increasing popularity of IASTM and MRT for managing CNP patients in clinical practice; there is currently limited evidence comparing their effectiveness for individuals specifically suffering from CMNP. This research aims to bridge this gap by conducting a methodologically robust randomized clinical trial comparing these two interventions' outcomes on college students experiencing chronic mechanical neck pain resulting from distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will help inform clinicians about selecting an optimal therapeutic modality while providing insights into potential moderators impacting treatment efficacy within this specific patient population.

"1. Introduction  The critical role of effective communication and information sharing in healthcare has been extensively studied, drawing attention to the concepts of employee silence and voice. These concepts are essential for understanding organizational dynamics, worker well-being, patient safety, and the overall quality of care provided in healthcare settings.  Research into employee silence and voice in the field of healthcare has primarily focused on speaking up or withholding information. However, investigations into interventions aimed at promoting a culture where employees feel comfortable expressing their opinions have yielded disappointing outcomes. This suggests that there is a significant gap in our understanding of employee voice and silence within healthcare organizations.  Understanding the underlying theoretical frameworks behind employee voice and silence is crucial for developing effective interventions that promote a culture conducive to open communication in healthcare settings. Additionally, examining how withholding information impacts key outcomes such as patient safety, quality of care, and worker well-being is essential for improving overall organizational performance.  While various studies have touched upon these topics individually, no comprehensive examination has addressed how voice and silence are conceptualized and operationalized within the unique context of healthcare organizations. Moreover, there appears to be heterogeneity both in terms of conceptualization as well as measurement tools employed across different studies.  To bridge this gap in knowledge, an integrative systematic review aiming to address two primary questions will be conducted:  1) How is employee voice and silence conceptualized and measured within the context of healthcare?  2) What are the theoretical underpinnings guiding research on employee voice and silence within healthcare?  By exploring these questions systematically across quantitative studies published between 2016-2022 from reputable peer-reviewed journals focusing on measuring either employee voice or employee silence among healthcare staff members using databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Embase among others; this review aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing evidence while identifying gaps for further research.  To ensure transparency throughout this systematic review process adhering to PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) will be followed. A review protocol outlining the research questions, inclusion criteria, search strategy, and data extraction procedure has been registered with the PROSPERO register (CRD42022367138).  This review seeks to enhance our understanding of employee voice and silence within healthcare organizations by critically examining existing literature in terms of conceptualizations, measurement tools utilized, and theoretical frameworks employed. By synthesizing the available evidence from various perspectives, it aims to contribute towards developing a more comprehensive understanding of these concepts within healthcare settings.  However, it is important to acknowledge potential limitations in this review. The current body of research predominantly relies on self-reported data from cross-sectional studies and primarily includes nurses and female staff members as participants. This potential bias may limit the generalizability of findings across diverse healthcare settings or different employee groups within these organizations.  Ultimately, this integrative systematic review will provide valuable insights into the conceptualization and measurement methods used for assessing employee voice and silence in healthcare contexts. It will identify gaps in existing knowledge while highlighting areas that require additional research attention. Such knowledge can inform both theory development regarding voice and silence as well as practical implications aimed at fostering improved communication practices within healthcare organizations for enhanced patient safety outcomes, quality care delivery, worker satisfaction, and overall organizational performance.",create
"Introduction:  Lung cancer remains a major global health concern, with its incidence continuing to rise year by year. As the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, lung cancer accounts for a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide (Bray et al., 2018). Traditional treatment strategies for lung cancer have primarily involved open thoracotomy procedures, which are associated with significant postoperative pain and longer recovery times (Pettiford et al., 2007). In recent years, advancements in technology and surgical techniques have led to the increasing adoption of minimally invasive approaches such as thoracoscopy for lung cancer resection.  Thoracoscopy has proven to be effective in removing tumors while minimizing surgical trauma and hastening patient recovery compared to open thoracotomy (Paul et al., 2010). However, even with these benefits, lung cancer patients undergoing thoracoscopic surgery still experience varying degrees of stress that affect their overall well-being and impair postoperative recovery. Therefore, it is imperative to explore innovative strategies aimed at enhancing postoperative nursing care for patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery.  The concept of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), also known as rapid rehabilitation or fast-track surgery, has gained popularity over the past two decades. ERAS protocols encompass a multidisciplinary approach involving preoperative optimization, intraoperative techniques to minimize surgical stress response, and standardized postoperative care. The central aim of ERAS is accelerating patient recovery by reducing complications and hospital length of stay without compromising clinical outcomes (Varadhan et al., 2010).  While there is extensive literature on ERAS protocols following open thoracic surgeries or multi-hole thoracoscopic approaches in lung cancer resections, research specific to rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery is limited. Single-port thoracoscopy offers distinct advantages over multi-hole approaches due to its reliance on only one incision point; however, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding postoperative nursing interventions tailored to the unique needs of these patients.  Therefore, the objective of this paper is to review the research progress on rapid rehabilitation nursing in single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. By synthesizing existing evidence and identifying gaps in knowledge, this review aims to provide key insights into optimizing postoperative care for lung cancer patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery. The findings from this study will contribute to advancing our understanding of how specific nursing interventions can be tailored to enhance patient recovery after single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery.  Ultimately, our goal is not only to improve patient outcomes but also to maximize healthcare resource utilization by reducing length of hospital stay and associated costs. As single-port thoracoscopic surgery becomes increasingly prevalent, it is crucial that we establish evidence-based guidelines for rapid rehabilitation nursing specific to this surgical approach. Such guidelines will ensure standardized care delivery and enable healthcare professionals worldwide to optimize postoperative outcomes for lung cancer patients undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery.  In conclusion, by embracing the principles of ERAS, there is an opportunity for significant improvements in postoperative care following single-port thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. This review article will provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing research on rapid rehabilitation nursing in this context and highlight areas that warrant further investigation. It is hoped that the findings from this study will serve as a catalyst for future studies aimed at refining and expanding our understanding of effective nursing interventions within the framework of ERAS protocols for single-port thoracoscopy in lung cancer resections.

"Title: Exploring the Efficacy and Safety of Novel Therapeutic Approaches in Anticancer Drug Use at the End of Life  1. Introduction  In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the frequency and impact of anticancer drug use at the end of life. The administration of anticancer agents during this critical stage poses unique challenges and considerations for clinicians, patients, families, and healthcare systems alike. As such, there is a need for comprehensive research to assess various aspects related to this practice.  While previous studies have shed light on different facets associated with anticancer drug utilization at end of life, there remains a lack of standardization in methods employed and outcomes reported. This variation hinders direct comparisons between studies and potentially obscures our understanding of trends pertaining to drug usage patterns within this specific context.  To address this issue comprehensively, we propose conducting a systematic investigation into novel therapeutic approaches utilized in anticancer drug use at the end-of-life phase. This study aims to provide valuable insights into both methodological considerations in research design as well as key findings regarding treatment characteristics across various cancer types.  2. Objectives  The primary objective of our proposed study is to critically evaluate the efficacy and safety profile associated with novel therapeutic approaches incorporated during antineoplastic treatment regimens administered near or at the end-of-life phase. Specifically, we aim to:  a) Identify distinct end-of-life periods characterized by differing frequencies of anticancer drug utilization. b) Explore variations in disease status among patients who underwent treatment. c) Analyze different treatment schedules implemented during these key timeframes. d) Investigate preferences for specific treatment types (e.g., chemotherapy versus targeted therapy). e) Assess relevant treatment characteristics impacting patient outcomes.  3. Methodology  To accomplish our objectives comprehensively within a rigorous scientific framework, we will conduct systematic searches using renowned medical literature databases such as MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane Library. A predefined search strategy will be employed, incorporating appropriate Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords related to our research question.  Inclusion criteria will consist of peer-reviewed articles published within the last five years, encompassing studies focused on anticancer drug use at the end of life across a diverse range of cancer types. We will consider original research articles that provide substantive data relevant to novel therapeutic approaches utilized during this crucial phase.

Two independent reviewers will perform the initial screening based on titles and abstracts for relevance utilizing pre-established inclusion/exclusion criteria. The full texts of eligible articles retrieved from this initial screening process shall then undergo comprehensive analysis for final selection into our review.  4. Significance  The proposed study holds significant value in advancing our understanding of current practices and trends regarding anticancer drug use at the end-of-life stage. By critically assessing various treatment options within different disease contexts, we can identify gaps in knowledge, potential areas for improvement, and inform evidence-based decision-making around patient care during this sensitive period.  Furthermore, our findings may shed light on methodological factors critical for designing future studies aimed at evaluating novel therapeutic approaches introduced near or at the end-of-life phase. Standardization in research design would facilitate direct comparisons between studies alongside a better understanding of relative treatment benefits and risks associated with different regimens across diverse cancer populations.  Overall, through this comprehensive exploration into emerging therapeutic interventions employed during anticancer drug use at the end-of-life stage, we aim to contribute valuable insights toward optimizing patient care strategies while considering individualized preferences, safety profiles, treatment efficacy, cost-effectiveness considerations as well as ethical implications surrounding resource allocation within healthcare systems.

"Title: The Impact of Gut Microbiota on Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Tumor Development  Abstract: Metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a hallmark of tumorigenesis, with growing evidence supporting the association between abnormal lipid metabolism and the development and progression of various diseases. Abnormal lipid metabolism is not only linked to numerous pathological conditions but is also increasing in prevalence among individuals. Lipid homeostasis plays a crucial role in regulating oncogenic signaling pathways during tumor initiation, growth, invasion, and metastasis. The specific patterns of lipid metabolism alterations observed among different tumor types are influenced by multiple factors including tumor origin, aberrant regulation of lipid metabolic pathways, and dietary habits. This comprehensive review focuses on elucidating the synthesis and regulatory pathways behind lipids while discussing recent advancements regarding cholesterol, triglycerides, sphingolipids as well as other relevant aspects such as lipid rafts, adipocytes, lipid droplets, and their association with tumors' drug resistance. Furthermore, this review aims to identify current limitations within this field of research while exploring potential molecular targets related to abnormal lipid metabolism for improved cancer management.  1. Introduction The human gut harbors a diverse ecosystem comprising trillions of microbial cells collectively referred to as the gut microbiota (GM). Over the past decade or so there has been an exponential increase in our understanding about how GM influences various aspects of human physiology and pathology beyond direct involvement in digestion or nutrient absorption alone (1). Mounting evidence suggests that alterations within GM composition can significantly impact host metabolic processes including nutrient utilization (2), energy homeostasis (3), immune responses (4), inflammation regulation (5), neurodevelopmental disorders (6), psychiatric illnesses (7) as well as carcinogenesis itself.  Emerging studies have started highlighting compelling associations between GM composition remodeling with perturbations seen in host systemic metabolic profiles such as those involving carbohydrates/lipids/amino acids (8). Several preclinical studies utilizing germ-free mice, fecal microbiota transplantation experiments, and antibiotic-treated mouse models, collectively imply that gut dysbiosis plays a crucial role in promoting host metabolic disorders (9), including obesity (10), type 2 diabetes mellitus (11), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (12) and cardiovascular diseases (13).  Given the profound implications of abnormal lipid metabolism on tumor development as outlined within the seminal review by Xu et al. titled ""Association between abnormal lipid metabolism and tumor"" it is therefor reasonable to contemplate how gut dysbiosis-induced lipidome remodeling can influence tumorigenesis. Although significant advances have been made in identifying various genetic mutations leading to aberrant lipid metabolism within tumors, recent investigations hypothesize that microbial metabolites derived from GM could modulate precise cellular pathways responsible for regulating host cholesterol/lipid homeostasis.  Thus, this comprehensive review aims to delve into the intricate interplay between GM-related signaling molecules/metabolites and host lipidomic perturbations during tumorigenesis. Specifically, we will discuss how microbial alterations induce aberrant hepatic/bile acid synthesis or trigger inflammation cascades ultimately influencing systemic levels of lipids involved in cancer pathophysiology. Furthermore, this manuscript will explore bidirectional molecular dialogues existing between GM-changed-fueling-for-abnormal-lipid-metabolism/lipid-induced-tumor-promoting-microenvironment that contribute towards cancer progression.  To achieve these objectives effectively and comprehensively, we will first present an overview illustrating the association between abnormal lipid metabolism with tumorigenicity highlighted by previous studies outlined in Xu's article. Subsequently, we will focus on elucidating the role of gut microbiota as a mediator influencing host systemic levels of lipids implicated in tumorigenesis with specific emphasis on bile acids-mediated regulations or immunomodulatory effects exerted through short-chain fatty acids production such as propionate, butyrate or acetate. Furthermore, this manuscript is aimed at critically evaluating current research limitations and future directions which could potentially unveil new therapeutic targets within the fascinating field of gut microbiota-implicated alterations in host lipid metabolism for more effective tumor management strategies.  In conclusion, unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms involved in GM-driven perturbations to host lipid metabolism may open up novel avenues for improving preventive/treatment strategies against tumor development. Ultimately, targeting dysregulation of lipid homeostasis mediated by GM signaling molecules/metabolites demonstrates promising prospects as part of multifaceted approaches towards enhanced cancer prognosis and survival rates.",create
"Introduction: The Role of Circulating microRNAs in Predicting Treatment Response in Wilms Tumor Patients  Wilms tumor (WT) is a common type of pediatric kidney cancer that primarily affects children aged 3-4 years, with a peak incidence between the ages of 2 and 5 years (1). Although advances in multimodal treatment have significantly improved the prognosis for WT, there remains a clinical need for reliable biomarkers to predict treatment response and facilitate personalized therapeutic strategies. In recent years, short non-coding RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as potential biomarkers for various types of cancer, including WT.  MiRNAs are small RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs), leading to mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. Dysregulation of miRNA expression has been implicated in numerous cellular processes including tumorigenesis, metastasis, and response to therapy (2). Consequently, profiling circulating miRNA levels has attracted significant interest as a minimally invasive approach for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.  Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying WT development and progression, little is known about the specific role of circulating miRNAs in this malignancy. The identification of reliable miRNA markers could provide important insights into disease pathogenesis and potentially guide therapeutic decision-making.  Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to systematically review the existing literature on circulating miRNA profiles in WT patients and perform a meta-analysis to assess their diagnostic accuracy. Specifically, we aimed to identify dysregulated miRNAs associated with WT diagnosis that could serve as potential prognostic indicators or therapeutic targets.  To achieve this objective, we conducted an extensive search utilizing major scientific databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web-of-Science, and Wiley online library databases. Only English/French studies were included given language constraints. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to ensure a transparent and reproducible review process. The search strategy was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022301597).  The eligibility criteria for study inclusion consisted of primary research articles that investigated the expression of circulating miRNAs in WT patients compared to healthy controls. Studies reporting on miRNA profiles in other malignancies or non-human subjects were excluded. Quality assessment was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool.  Our analysis uncovered dysregulated miRNAs associated with WT, including both up-regulated and down-regulated species, as well as a subset displaying conflicting results across studies. By pooling the data from two studies, we assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) values for significantly dysregulated miRNAs.  Preliminary findings revealed promising diagnostic potential for these selected circulating miRNAs for WT diagnosis. However, more research is needed to validate these results on larger cohorts and diverse populations. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether specific circulating miRNA signatures are associated with different subtypes or stages of WT.  In conclusion, our study aimed to provide an up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis of dysregulated circulating miRNAs in WT patients. This comprehensive analysis serves as a stepping stone toward identifying potential biomarkers that could facilitate personalized therapeutic strategies by predicting treatment response based on unique molecular signatures. Future research should focus on elucidating the functional roles of individual miRNAs identified in this study and exploring their utility as therapeutic targets or tools for disease monitoring throughout the clinical course of WT.

"Title: The Impact of Transversus Abdominis Plane Block on Length of Stay in Minimally Invasive Colorectal Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis  Abstract: Transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) has emerged as a valuable adjunct technique for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal surgery. However, the impact of TAPB on length of stay (LOS) remains uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to comprehensively evaluate the existing literature to determine whether the use of TAPB is associated with a reduction in LOS in this patient population.  Introduction: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery has become increasingly popular due to its numerous advantages over traditional open surgical techniques, including reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stays, decreased postoperative pain, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes (1). Despite these benefits, effective pain control remains crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and ensuring a smooth recovery process.  The management of postoperative pain following minimally invasive colorectal surgery typically involves multimodal analgesic strategies that combine systemic opioids with regional techniques such as epidural analgesia or peripheral nerve blocks. Among these regional techniques, transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) has gained recognition for its potential effectiveness in providing targeted analgesia after abdominal surgeries.  TAPB involves the injection of local anesthetic into the neurofascial plane between the internal oblique muscle and transversus abdominis muscle at mid-axillary line levels or along ultrasound-guided landmarks. By blocking sensory innervation from spinal nerves T6-L1 that supply anterolateral abdominal wall sensation, TAPB aims to reduce opioid requirements while maintaining adequate pain control during the early postoperative period.  While previous studies have examined various aspects related to TAPB's efficacy in terms of reducing opioid consumption and improving pain scores following minimally invasive colorectal surgery, the impact of TAPB on length of stay (LOS) remains less explored. LOS is an important outcome measure as it reflects patient recovery, healthcare resource utilization, and associated costs. A shorter LOS not only improves patient satisfaction but also provides potential cost savings to the healthcare system.  This systematic review and meta-analysis will obtain a comprehensive understanding of the literature regarding TAPB's effect on LOS in patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal surgery. By synthesizing available evidence from randomized controlled trials and observational studies, we aim to determine whether TAPB is associated with a reduction in LOS compared to standard analgesic techniques alone.  In addition to evaluating the primary outcome of interest—LOS—we will also examine secondary outcomes such as postoperative pain scores, opioid consumption, complications related to TAPB or surgery itself, postoperative ileus rates, surgical site infections, nausea and vomiting within 7 days postoperatively. The findings from this study may help guide clinicians in optimizing perioperative pain management strategies for patients undergoing minimally invasive colorectal surgery.  Furthermore, given that optimal pain management contributes not only to improved patient experience but also potentially influences short-term clinical outcomes like ambulation and return of bowel function following colorectal surgery (2), this research endeavor holds significant implications for clinical practice by supporting evidenced-based approaches tailored towards reducing LOS through effective pain control techniques such as TAPB.  Methodologically rigorous assessment utilizing established tools such as Cochrane Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies Interventions (ROBINS-I) will be employed for evaluating study quality across eligible sources identified through systematic electronic literature surveillance. Subgroup analyses based on patient characteristics or surgical factors will be conducted where feasible to assess potential sources of heterogeneity among included studies.  The results derived from this systematic review may facilitate guideline development and inform future clinical trials aiming to investigate strategies that optimize perioperative pain control and patient recovery. It is anticipated that this study will contribute to the existing body of literature, empowering clinicians to make informed decisions regarding pain management strategies in minimally invasive colorectal surgery and ultimately improve patient outcomes.",create
"1. Introduction  Pancreatic islet dysfunction is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus (DM), a systemic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia and impaired insulin secretion. Emerging evidence suggests that intercellular and interorgan communication mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) plays a critical role in the regulation of pancreatic islet function, as well as the maintenance of glucose homeostasis under physiological conditions. Furthermore, alterations in EV-mediated communication have been implicated in the pathogenesis of DM, including autoimmune responses, insulin resistance, and β-cell failure.  While significant progress has been made in understanding the role of EVs in various cellular processes, their specific involvement in pancreatic islets remains an area requiring further investigation. This article aims to explore the potential impact of EV-mediated intercellular and interorgan crosstalk on pancreatic islet biology with a particular focus on its implications for DM development, diagnosis, and treatment.  1.1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Global Health Challenge  Diabetes mellitus imposes an enormous burden on global health due to its rising prevalence and associated complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness, and lower limb amputations (International Diabetes Federation [IDF], 2019). It affects over 460 million individuals worldwide and is projected to affect approximately 700 million people by 2045 (IDF Atlas Ninth Edition). Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90% of all cases globally; however, its exact etiology remains multifactorial with complex interactions between genetic susceptibility factors and environmental triggers such as obesity.   1.2 Pancreatic Islets: Key Players in Glucose Homeostasis  Pancreatic islets or Islets of Langerhans are clusters of endocrine cells scattered throughout the pancreas that regulate glucose homeostasis through coordinated hormone secretion (Morales-Alvarez et al.,2020). These cells include β-cells responsible for insulin secretion, α-cells that produce glucagon, δ-cells that release somatostatin, and other islet cell types contributing to hormonal balance. Insulin secretion by β-cells is essential for maintaining euglycemia as it facilitates glucose uptake in peripheral tissues and suppresses hepatic glucose production.   1.3 Extracellular Vesicles: Novel Signaling Entities  Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-enclosed particles released by various cell types into the extracellular environment (Yáñez-Mó et al., 2015). Due to their ability to encapsulate and transfer proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites between cells, EVs have emerged as potent mediators of intercellular communication in both physiological and pathological contexts.  1.4 EV-Mediated Intercellular Crosstalk of Pancreatic Islets  Recent studies have provided evidence supporting the importance of EV-mediated intercellular communication in the regulation of pancreatic islet function (Chen et al., 2019). EVs released by β-cells exhibit a complex cargo including bioactive molecules such as microRNAs, proteins involved in insulin synthesis and exocytosis machinery components. These cargoes can be transferred to neighboring β-cells or other pancreatic endocrine cells within the islet microenvironment through EV-mediated pathways.  1.5 Interorgan Crosstalk Mediated by Pancreatic Islet-derived EVs  Apart from facilitating local signaling within pancreatic islets themselves, emerging evidence highlights a previously unrecognized role for pancreatic islet-derived EVs in mediating interorgan crosstalk with peripheral tissues crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis (Mahdipour et al., 2020). These circulating EVs can travel via blood circulation or lymphatics to mutually communicate with distant organs including adipose tissue, liver skeletal muscle affected in DM pathogenesis.  In conclusion, understanding the complex interplay between EV-mediated intercellular and interorgan communication in pancreatic islets could provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, unraveling the mechanisms underlying EV cargo packaging, release, targeting processes, and their functional consequences may reveal potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for DM. This review aims to consolidate current knowledge on EVs' involvement in pancreatic islet biology under physiological conditions while unveiling their potential as diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents for DM management.

"Introduction   Nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO) is a severe form of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) that leads to sudden and profound vision loss. It occurs when the central retinal artery, the primary blood supply to the retina, becomes blocked by an embolus or thrombus. Despite its devastating consequences, no standard treatment options currently exist for NA-CRAO. The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association have guidelines in place for managing CRAO patients; however, these guidelines primarily focus on systemic management rather than neuroprotection specific to the retina.  This lack of effective treatment options highlights a critical need for research into potential strategies aimed at neuroprotection in NA-CRAO. Recent advancements in acute ischemic stroke research have uncovered promising approaches, such as neuroprotective agents like uric acid, nerinetide, and otaplimastat. Additionally, significant progress has been made towards developing neuroprotective interventions for various retinal diseases including retinal detachment, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and inherited retinal diseases.  Given the existing knowledge surrounding neuroprotection in AIS and other retinal pathologies, it is reasonable to speculate that similar strategies may hold promise for improving outcomes in NA-CRAO cases. This paper aims to explore the potential application of cerebral neuroprotection strategies to enhance therapeutic approaches against NA-CRAOs.  The first section will provide an overview of current knowledge regarding neuroprotective interventions used in AIS patients with a focus on their mechanism of action and efficacy. By understanding these interventions better—and their impact on neuronal survival—it may be possible to identify potential strategies applicable to protecting neurons within the retina during a NA-CRAO episode.  Next, this paper will discuss specific drugs tested thus far with promising results as well as emerging techniques like angiopoietin (Comp Ang1), KUS 121 compound drug therapy, XIAP gene therapy, and hypothermia. Insight into the effectiveness of these drugs in retinal neuroprotection may inform future NA-CRAO treatment protocols.  Furthermore, imaging technologies play a crucial role in understanding the penumbra—the region surrounding the ischemic core—after an episode of NA-CRAO. Combining high-definition optical coherence angiography (HD-OCTA) with electrophysiology can provide comprehensive visualization, allowing for accurate delineation of the penumbra. Improved imaging techniques will aid in identifying potential targets for neuroprotective intervention at precise locations within the retina.  Finally, a better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in NA-CRAO is essential to further develop and optimize neuroprotective interventions. Investigating key molecular pathways during occlusion and reperfusion processes might unveil novel therapeutic targets that can bridge preclinical and clinical neuroprotection efforts.  In conclusion, this paper aims to discuss how cerebral neuroprotection strategies developed for AIS may be translated into effective approaches for preserving vision in NA-CRAO patients. The combination of neuroprotective agents with thrombolysis offers a potential extended window for treatment and improved outcomes. Enhanced imaging techniques alongside investigations into pathophysiologic mechanisms will contribute to closing the gap between preclinical studies' promising findings and their successful application within clinical settings. By exploring these avenues, we can hope to make significant strides towards improving outcomes in patients experiencing this devastating condition.  2. Aim of the Study  The aim of this study is to investigate and evaluate the potential of applying neuroprotective strategies developed for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) to enhance therapeutic approaches for nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO). NA-CRAO is a variant of AIS that leads to sudden and severe vision loss due to the blockage of the central retinal artery. Currently, there is a lack of established treatment options specifically targeting NA-CRAO-induced retinal neuroprotection.  By drawing upon recent advancements in neuroprotective interventions for AIS, as well as research on other retinal diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and inherited retinal diseases, we aim to explore the potential application of these strategies in preserving visual function during NA-CRAO episodes. This study will delve into various drug therapies and techniques that have shown promise in promoting neuroprotection in AIS patients and examine their potential effectiveness for NA-CRAO treatment.  3. Significance  NA-CRAO represents a devastating condition that leads to permanent vision loss if left untreated or managed inadequately. Current guidelines by the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association primarily focus on systemic management rather than direct neuroprotective interventions within the retina. The limited treatment options available highlight the urgent need for developing effective strategies aimed at protecting neuronal cells from further damage during an NA-CRAO episode.  Furthermore, understanding how existing treatments have demonstrated success in preserving cerebral tissue viability following ischemic events could offer valuable insights into designing new approaches dedicated to enhancing visual outcomes after an episode of CRAO. Given recent advancements in imaging technologies such as high-definition optical coherence angiography (HD-OCTA) alongside electrophysiology techniques, it becomes crucial to identify potential targets within the retina accurately through improved visualization methods.  4. Approach  To address our research objective, this study will initially provide an overview of current neuroprotective interventions employed in AIS patients. We will examine the mechanisms of action and efficacy of these interventions, assessing their potential applicability to retinal neuroprotection in NA-CRAO cases.  We will then explore specific drugs that have shown promise in AIS treatment, such as uric acid, nerinetide, otaplimastat, and emerging techniques like angiopoietin (Comp Ang1), KUS 121 compound drug therapy, XIAP gene therapy, and hypothermia. By reviewing the existing literature on these strategies' effectiveness in protecting neuronal cells within the retina or cerebral tissue from ischemic damage, we can identify potential avenues for NA-CRAO therapeutic intervention.  Additionally, investigating advanced imaging techniques like HD-OCTA combined with electrophysiological assessments will contribute to accurately delineating the penumbra—the region surrounding the ischemic core—following an NA-CRAO episode. Improved understanding of this critical region can aid in identifying precise locations within the retina where neuroprotective interventions may be most effective.  Lastly, a comprehensive investigation into the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in NA-CRAO is crucial for developing targeted neuroprotective interventions. Such research may uncover novel molecular pathways that play influential roles during both occlusion and reperfusion processes. Bridging preclinical findings to clinical applications necessitates detailed knowledge surrounding these mechanisms.  5. Conclusion  In conclusion, this study aims to explore how cerebral neuroprotection strategies developed for AIS may be translated into effective approaches for preserving visual function during episodes of nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO). By evaluating existing neuroprotective agents and techniques employed in AIS cases alongside advancements made in retinal disease research, we seek to bridge gaps between current NA-CRAO treatment options and promising preclinical findings.  Through enhanced imaging methods and investigations into pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying NA-CRAO-induced retinal damage, we hope to develop targeted neuroprotective interventions that will improve outcomes for patients experiencing this devastating condition. By focusing on neuroprotection alongside thrombolysis and expanding the therapeutic window for NA-CRAO treatment, the potential impact on preserving vision and enhancing quality of life can be significant.",create
"Title: Exploring the Role of Iron-Related Genes and Proteins in Modulating Mesenchymal Stem Cell Differentiation and Fate Decisions  1. Introduction Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents for regenerative medicine due to their unique ability to differentiate into various cell types, exhibit immunomodulatory properties, and secrete trophic factors that promote tissue repair and regeneration (1). However, the clinical translation of MSC-based therapies has been challenging due to limitations in pre-administration MSC labeling techniques, post-administration detection methods, and the need to enhance their therapeutic potential in vivo.  To address these challenges, recent studies have unveiled an intriguing intersection between iron metabolism pathways and MSC biology. Iron-related genes and proteins have been shown to play crucial roles in regulating MSC differentiation, survival, migration, immune modulation capacity, and response to oxidative stress. These insights hold significant potential for improving our understanding of MSC behavior within the body and devising innovative strategies for enhancing their therapeutic efficacy.  Iron metabolism is a tightly regulated process that is essential for numerous cellular functions such as DNA synthesis, oxygen transport via hemoglobin synthesis, electron transfer reactions within mitochondria enzymes involved in energy production (2). Disruptions in iron homeostasis can lead to various pathological conditions including iron overload disorders or anemia.  In recent years it has become evident that iron metabolism pathways are closely linked with stem cell maintenance and differentiation processes (3). Studies investigating the role of iron-related genes such as ferritin (FT), transferrin receptor-1 (TfR-1), MagA -which mediates magnetic resonance imaging contrast upon uptake by cells-, haem oxygenase-1(HO-1), lipocalin 2(LCN2), lactoferrin(LF), bone morphogenetic protein 2(BMP-2)and hepcidin(HP)-have demonstrated their involvement in MSC pluripotency, lineage commitment, and immune responses (4)(5).  Moreover, it has been shown that genetic manipulation or overexpression of iron-related proteins could improve MSC-based therapies. For instance, transfection of MSCs with reporter genes such as the iron-binding protein ferritin or transferrin receptor-1 allows for real-time monitoring and tracking of transplanted cells via non-invasive imaging techniques such as MRI (6). This approach offers significant advantages over conventional cell labeling strategies by minimizing potential adverse effects associated with exogenous contrast agents.  Furthermore, modulation of iron metabolism using the iron chelator deferoxamine has been found to enhance the therapeutic potential of MSCs (7). Deferoxamine not only promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis under oxidative stress conditions but also regulates various signaling pathways involved in tissue regeneration and repair.  In light of these promising findings, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding regarding the contribution of iron-related genes and proteins in modulating MSC differentiation choices and fate decisions. By integrating knowledge from diverse fields such as stem cell biology, immunology, and iron metabolism, we seek to shed light on the mechanisms underlying these interactions.  Understanding how iron homeostasis impacts MSC behavior may allow us to design more effective strategies for optimizing the ex vivo expansion protocols for specific lineage differentiation. Additionally exploring how targeted control over particular components within this network influences tissue repair processes could lead to novel therapeutic interventions.  As regenerative medicine continues to harness the regenerative potency of stem cells for treating various diseases and injuries across different organs/tissues systems; it is essential that we explore every avenue towards maximizing their full therapeutic potential. By providing key insights into the fascinating interplay between iron-related signaling networks and mesenchymal stem cells biology; this review aims at bridging existing knowledge gaps while inspiring future research directions aimed at improving clinical outcomes using MSC-based therapies.",create
"Title: Gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis: Novel Insights into Mechanisms, Therapeutic Opportunities, and Future Directions  Introduction:  Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death that plays a critical role in host defense against pathogens and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Pyroptosis is characterized by the formation of large plasma membrane pores that result in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), attracting immune cells to clear infected cells or damaged tissue. While pyroptosis is essential for immune surveillance, its dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases.  Recent studies have shed light on the multifaceted roles of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in both infectious and non-infectious diseases. This article aims to provide an overview of current knowledge on GSDMD activation, pore formation, associated signaling pathways, disease associations, and highlights potential therapeutic strategies targeting this intricate process.  1.1 Background: The discovery of gasdermins as key regulators of pyroptotic cell death has revolutionized our understanding of inflammation-associated pathologies. The gasdermin family comprises seven members (GSDMA-G) that contain a highly conserved N-terminal domain known as the ""pro-domain,"" followed by a ""pore-forming domain"" responsible for cellular membrane permeabilization during pyroptosis. Among them, GSDMD stands out as a crucial mediator due to its dominant role in inducing cell lysis upon cleavage by inflammasome-activated caspases.  1.2 Dysregulated Pyroptosis: Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulated GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis contributes significantly to the pathogenesis and progression of numerous inflammatory disorders such as sepsis, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), neurodegenerative diseases, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and various malignant tumors. The aberrant activation of GSDMD leads to excessive cytokine release, sustained inflammation, tissue damage, and impaired immune responses.  1.3 Underlying Mechanisms: Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying GSDMD regulation and pore formation is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic interventions. Recent studies have unraveled intricate signaling networks bridging the activation of inflammasomes, such as NLRP3 and NLRC4, caspase-1 cleavage of GSDMD at specific sites and the subsequent assembly of multimeric GSDMD pores in cellular membranes. Furthermore, genetic mutations or dysregulated expression of inflammasome components can disrupt these processes, resulting in pathological outcomes.  1.4 Therapeutic Potential: Given the central role played by aberrant pyroptosis in diverse diseases, strategies targeting GSDMD-mediated cell death hold significant therapeutic potential. Advancements in our understanding of pyroptotic signaling pathways have paved the way for developing novel small-molecule inhibitors that selectively target either inflammasomes or downstream mediators involved in GSDMD activation. Inhibition of specific nodes along these pathways may restore immunological balance while minimizing collateral damage associated with broad immunosuppression.  1.5 Research Objectives: This comprehensive review aims to provide an up-to-date synthesis on recent insights into the mechanisms regulating GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and its involvement across a spectrum of diseases encompassing both infectious and non-infectious origins. Emphasizing recent advances in structural studies identifying key protein interactions within caspase-GS This comprehensive review aims to provide an up-to-date synthesis on recent insights into the mechanisms regulating GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and its involvement across a spectrum of diseases encompassing both infectious and non-infectious origins. Emphasizing recent advances in structural studies identifying key protein interactions within caspase-GSDMD complexes, we will explore the molecular basis underlying GSDMD activation, oligomerization, and pore formation. Additionally, this article will delve into the various signaling pathways involved in GSDMD-mediated inflammatory cascades and their implications for disease pathogenesis.  Investigations into the association between abnormal GSDMD activation and disease states have unveiled intriguing links with diverse inflammatory disorders. The dysregulation of pyroptotic cell death has been implicated in sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by uncontrolled systemic inflammation in response to infection. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that excessive pyroptosis is a critical determinant of tissue damage observed during neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shed new light on the importance of understanding GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in viral infections. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers an exaggerated inflammatory response driven by aberrant pyroptotic cell death. Moreover, investigations into chronic metabolic disorders have revealed a significant role for dysregulated pyroptosis in promoting tissue damage characteristic of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Furthermore, mounting evidence implicates inappropriate activation of GSDMD-induced inflammation as an important factor contributing to tumorigenesis across multiple cancer types.  Given the growing recognition of aberrant pyroptosis as a driver of pathological inflammation, developing strategies to intervene at specific points along this pathway holds immense therapeutic potential. The identification of key molecular players involved in modulating inflammasome assembly or disrupting crucial steps involved in GSDMD pore formation opens up exciting possibilities for the development of drugs that can selectively target this process. Small-molecule inhibitors targeting inflammasomes or downstream mediators involved in GSDMD activation represent promising candidates for therapeutic intervention.  This review will critically examine recent advancements in understanding the structural basis of GSDMD activation and oligomerization, shedding light on potential strategies to inhibit pathological pyroptosis. By integrating findings from various disease models, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of how dysregulated GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis contributes to diverse inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, the complex interplay between inflammasomes, inflammatory cytokines, and immune responses will be explored within the context of disease pathogenesis.  In conclusion, this article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis by elucidating its molecular mechanisms and highlighting its association with various diseases. We hope that this review will contribute to further research efforts aimed at developing effective therapeutic interventions targeting aberrant pyroptotic cell death as a means to restore immunological balance and prevent or treat inflammatory disorders across diverse clinical settings.

"Title: The Impact of Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder on Academic Performance and Cognitive Functioning in the Young Generation  Abstract: Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD) is a sleep disorder characterized by a delay in the habitual sleep-wake timing, leading to difficulties in falling asleep and waking up at desired times. Individuals with DSWPD often experience fatigue, impaired concentration, weekday sleep deprivation, absenteeism, and even depressive symptoms. This disorder predominantly affects adolescents and young adults but its prevalence remains understudied internationally. Additionally, there is growing concern regarding the potential impact of behavioral restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic on susceptible individuals who may develop DSWPD.  The pathogenesis of DSWPD involves physiological, genetic, psychological, behavioral factors as well as social influences. Recent findings highlight an association between delayed sleep phase and prolonged sleep duration within the young generation during pandemic-related restrictions. This raises concerns about a possible mismatch between their circadian rhythms and social obligations once these restrictions are lifted.  While individuals with DSWPD typically exhibit a delay in circadian rhythms, it is noteworthy that approximately 40% of cases lack any misalignment according to objectively measured circadian rhythm markers. Instead, certain psychological and behavioral characteristics commonly seen among young people such as truancy or academic/social difficulties play prominent roles in driving this disorder.  Furthermore, recent research has demonstrated that there is a high comorbidity rate between DSWPD and psychiatric disorders—particularly mood and neurodevelopmental conditions—which further contribute to the pathophysiology of this disorder via bidirectional associations. Notably, patients with DSWPD also exhibit elevated levels of neuroticism and anxiety which can exacerbate insomnia symptoms.  Currently available treatment approaches for DSWPD primarily focus on chronobiological interventions; however cognitive-behavioral approaches also hold promise. Therefore future studies should investigate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral strategies alongside chronobiological interventions for the management of DSWPD.  1. Introduction: Sleep plays a critical role in various aspects of human functioning, including cognitive abilities, psychological well-being, and academic performance. Sleep disorders, such as delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), have gained increasing attention due to their detrimental impact on individuals' daily lives. DSWPD is characterized by a persistent delay in the sleep-wake timing relative to conventional societal norms (i.e., difficulties falling asleep and waking up at desired times). This disorder predominantly affects adolescents and young adults with limited large-scale studies exploring its epidemiology across different racial groups.  One significant domain impacted by DSWPD is academic performance. The delayed sleep schedule associated with this disorder often leads to poor attendance, decreased alertness, impaired concentration, and reduced cognitive abilities among affected individuals. Long-term consequences of compromised academic performance due to DSWPD can extend beyond education into other areas of life such as career opportunities and overall quality of life.  Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying DSWPD is essential given its potential ramifications on individuals' mental health and social functioning within the young generation. While physiological factors contribute to disrupted circadian rhythm regulation observed in DSWPD cases with misalignment, recent research suggests that behavioral factors may play a prominent role in perpetuating or exacerbating this disorder even without objective misalignment being present.  Notably, recent global events related to the COVID-19 pandemic have imposed unprecedented behavioral restrictions (e.g., lockdowns) affecting individuals' daily routines including sleep patterns within younger populations. Researchers anticipate that these restrictions may further disrupt existing sleep patterns among susceptible individuals—potentially resulting in an increased prevalence of DSWPD once these restrictions are lifted.  This paper aims to investigate how delayed sleep-wake phase disorder impacts academic performance and cognitive functioning among young people while exploring potential risk factors associated with its onset or exacerbation within this population group. Specifically focusing on students attending educational institutions, the study will examine the relationship between DSWPD and academic success in terms of attendance, grades, and overall cognitive performance. Furthermore, it will explore behavioral factors such as truancy and social difficulties that may contribute to the development or worsening of this disorder.  Given the high comorbidity rate between DSWPD and psychiatric disorders—particularly mood disorders—it is crucial to investigate the bidirectional associations between these conditions to better understand their underlying mechanisms. This research aims to shed light on these associations while also exploring potential avenues for intervention including cognitive-behavioral approaches alongside existing chronobiological interventions for managing DSWPD among young individuals.  By advancing our understanding of DSWPD's impact on academic performance and cognitive functioning within the young generation, this study can lay a foundation for developing targeted interventions that consider individual differences in sleep patterns as well as psychological and behavioral characteristics associated with this disorder. Ultimately, our findings may help inform educational institutions, health professionals, and families seeking methods to mitigate DSWPD's adverse effects on academic success and overall well-being within this population group.",create
"Title: Exploring the Influence of Concomitant Medications on the Cardiovascular Outcomes of SGLT-2 Inhibitors in Heart Failure Randomized Controlled Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  Abstract: Patients with heart failure (HF) often require multiple medications to manage their condition effectively, including sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that SGLT-2is are effective in reducing the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death and hospitalizations for HF. However, limited research has been conducted to investigate whether concomitant medication use influences these cardiovascular outcomes. This study aims to systematically assess the potential impact of concomitant medications on the effectiveness of SGLT-2is on primary composite outcomes among patients with HF.  1. Introduction  Heart failure is a chronic progressive condition characterized by impaired cardiac function, resulting in inadequate blood flow to meet the body's metabolic demands. It imposes substantial morbidity and mortality burdens globally, making it a significant public health concern (Ponikowski et al., 2016). Sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), initially developed as antihyperglycemic agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), have recently emerged as effective therapeutic options for patients with HF irrespective of DM status.  Randomized controlled trials investigating SGLT-2i therapy have consistently demonstrated reductions in major cardiovascular adverse events, including hospitalizations for HF and cardiovascular death in patients both with and without underlying DM (McMurray et al., 2019; Zelniker et al., 2019). Nevertheless, while these trials have provided valuable insights into the efficacy and safety profiles of SGLT-2is across diverse patient populations, there remains an important knowledge gap regarding potential variations in treatment response based on concurrent medication therapies.  Concomitant medications frequently prescribed alongside SGLT-2is for heart failure management include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and diuretics. These agents exert their effects via different mechanisms, targeting various pathways involved in the pathophysiology of heart failure. There is evidence to suggest that certain medications may interact synergistically with SGLT-2is, leading to enhanced clinical benefits, while others may attenuate or even abolish their therapeutic effects.  Preliminary data from observational studies have indicated that concomitant use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASIs) and beta-blockers might modify the outcomes associated with SGLT-2i therapy in patients with HF (McMurray et al., 2020; Udell et al., 2018). This suggests potential interactions between these drug classes and SGLT-2is at the molecular level or through shared physiological pathways involved in cardiac remodeling, neurohormonal regulation, and renal function.  However, these studies present conflicting results and methodological limitations due to their non-randomized nature. To date, no comprehensive systematic review or meta-analysis has systematically explored the impact of concurrent medication use on cardiovascular outcomes among patients treated with SGLT-2is for HF through RCTs. Therefore, this current study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs investigating the influence of concomitant medications on primary composite outcomes in HF patients receiving SGLT-2i therapy.  The findings from this study will help elucidate whether specific medication combinations can augment or hinder the therapeutic efficacy of SGLT-2is in HF patients. Such insights are crucial for guiding individualized treatment decisions aimed at optimizing patient outcomes. Moreover, it has implications for developing evidence-based guidelines and clinical practice recommendations to ensure the effective and safe use of SGLT-2is in patients with HF.  In conclusion, this study endeavors to provide valuable insights into the influence of concomitant medication use on cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving SGLT-2i therapy for heart failure. By systematically synthesizing data from RCTs, this research aims to enhance our understanding of how different medication combinations impact the effectiveness of SGLT-2is and guide clinicians in optimizing therapies for individual patients. Ultimately, these findings will contribute towards improving patient outcomes and inform future guidelines regarding the management of heart failure.",create
"The Influence of Climate Change on the Phylogeography of Sharks and Rays: A Global Assessment Based on Life History Traits and Biogeographic Partitions  1. Introduction  Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges affecting marine ecosystems. As temperatures rise, ocean chemistry changes, and sea levels fluctuate, marine organisms face unprecedented disruptions in their habitats and life cycles. This has profound implications for population genetic structure and evolutionary history, particularly in highly vulnerable species such as sharks and rays.  Sharks and rays are crucial components of marine ecosystems worldwide due to their ecological roles as top predators or grazers, their contributions to nutrient cycling, and their overall biodiversity value. However, mounting evidence suggests that they are highly susceptible to anthropogenic stressors associated with climate change.  Previous research has extensively explored the impact of climatic factors on shark and ray populations but has primarily focused on individual species or regional analyses rather than providing a comprehensive global overview. Consequently, there is a knowledge gap regarding the phylogeographic patterns exhibited by these taxa across multiple ocean basins under changing climatic conditions.  Understanding how different life history traits interact with biogeographic partitions is essential for conserving shark and ray populations in the face of climate change threats. Of particular concern are traits such as late maturity and low fecundity that characterize many species within this group. These traits may limit their ability to adapt quickly to environmental changes or recover from population declines caused by overfishing or habitat destruction.  This study aims to fill this gap by providing a review and synthesis of the global phylogeography of sharks (40 species) belonging to 17 genera, along with rays (19 species) belonging to 11 genera. We will focus on exploring patterns of genetic diversity across major ocean basins—specifically, the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Pacific Ocean—to identify both shared trends among taxa groups as well as any unique characteristics exhibited by individual species.  To achieve this, we will construct median joining haplotype networks for each species using mtDNA cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences. Additionally, we will conduct an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) to further elucidate patterns of genetic structure within and between ocean basins.  We predict that the phylogeographic patterns observed in sharks and rays will be influenced by a combination of life history traits and environmental factors. We hypothesize that species with reproductive philopatry, site fidelity, pelagic habitats, migratory habits, and limited dispersal abilities during early life stages may exhibit higher levels of genetic structure compared to species with more mobile or demersal lifestyles.  Overall, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of how climate change influences the phylogeography of sharks and rays on a global scale. By identifying common patterns and unique characteristics across taxa groups and ocean basins, we can inform effective management strategies that consider the specific vulnerabilities associated with different life history traits. This knowledge is crucial for designing conservation plans that mitigate ongoing threats posed by climate change while preserving the integrity and resilience of shark and ray populations worldwide.",create
"Title: Emerging Techniques for Real-Time Analysis of Cell Excretes from Organ-on-a-Chip Models  Abstract: Recent advances in three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures, particularly organ-on-a-chip (OOC) devices, have revolutionized the field of biomedical research. OOC models have emerged as powerful tools that enable researchers to better mimic human physiological conditions compared to conventional two-dimensional (2D) culture systems. These innovative microfluidic platforms offer numerous applications ranging from mechanical studies and functional validation to toxicology investigations.  However, a significant challenge in utilizing OOC models lies in the absence of online analysis methods that allow real-time monitoring and observation of the cultured cells. The ability to analyze dynamic cellular processes and metabolites directly from the OOC models during experimentation is crucial for characterizing their functionality accurately. Traditional analytical techniques often suffer from inherent limitations such as low sensitivity or require sample manipulation, which compromises the fidelity of results obtained.  Mass spectrometry (MS), a powerful analytical technique widely employed in various scientific disciplines, holds immense promise for enabling real-time analysis of cell excretes within OOC models. MS offers several advantages including high sensitivity, selectivity, and the capacity to tentatively identify a diverse array of unknown compounds ranging from metabolites and lipids to peptides and proteins. These capabilities make MS an ideal candidate for investigating intricate cellular functions occurring within OOC devices.  Nevertheless, integrating MS with organ-on-a-chip systems presents its own set of challenges due to factors such as incompatible media composition and nonvolatile buffers used within these microfluidic platforms. The presence of such substances impedes the seamless connection between OOC outlets and MS instrumentation necessary for accomplishing online analysis.  In response to these challenges, recent technological advancements have been developed that address sample preprocessing requirements immediately after culturing in organ-on-a-chip devices and just before conducting analyses using MS techniques. Several strategies have been proposed including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging, direct electrospray ionization (ESI) interfaces, and microfluidic coupling devices. These cutting-edge techniques have facilitated the efficient integration of organ-on-a-chip platforms with MS, enabling real-time analysis and unraveling of cellular dynamics within physiologically relevant conditions.  In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of the recent technological advances in bridging the gap between OOC systems and MS. We will evaluate the benefits and limitations of these emerging methods for successfully hyphenating OOC models with MS-based techniques for real-time analysis. A thorough understanding of these advancements will greatly contribute to further enhancing our ability to investigate complex cellular processes in organ-on-a-chip models, advancing drug discovery research, toxicological assessments, and personalized medicine applications.  1. Introduction  The development of 3D cell culture systems marked a significant milestone in biomedical research as they improved upon traditional 2D culture platforms by more accurately representing tissue microenvironments and physiological conditions (1). Among these 3D culture systems, organ-on-a-chip (OOC) devices represent an innovative approach that emulates organ-level functionalities using microfluidic technologies. OOC models consist of miniaturized organs or tissues that are interconnected through fluidic channels designed to mimic biological processes observed in vivo (2). Such biomimetic microsystems offer exceptional translational potential by recapitulating key features including cellular interactions, mechanical forces experienced within organs/tissues, gradients exposure to nutrients/metabolites/toxins etc., thus opening new avenues for studying human physiology outside human body.  Although remarkable progress has been made in establishing functional OOC models over recent years,...

"Introduction  Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels due to the body's inability to effectively use or produce insulin. The prevalence of T2D has been steadily increasing worldwide, resulting in significant public health burdens and economic costs. It is estimated that around 415 million adults globally have T2D, and this number is expected to rise to 642 million by 2040 (1).  Controlling blood glucose levels is crucial in managing T2D and preventing its associated complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, neuropathy, and retinopathy. While metformin has been widely used as the first-line therapy for T2D due to its effectiveness in lowering blood glucose levels, achieving optimal glycemic control remains a challenge for many patients (2). Furthermore, metformin monotherapy may not adequately address the clinical symptoms experienced by individuals with T2D.  Jinlida granules are a traditional Chinese medicine formulation that has gained attention for its potential therapeutic benefits in managing T2D. Previous studies have shown promising results regarding the ability of Jinlida granules to lower blood glucose levels when used alone or as an adjunct therapy alongside metformin (3). However, there is limited research exploring their impact on the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and improvement of clinical symptoms experienced by patients with T2D.  The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of Jinlida granules combined with metformin in improving both the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and clinical symptoms among patients with type 2 diabetes who experience specific symptoms such as thirst, fatigue, increased eating with rapid hungering, polyuria, dry mouth, spontaneous sweating, night sweat, vexing heat in the chest, palms, and soles, and constipation.  Understanding how Jinlida granules may complement conventional therapies like metformin in improving the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and managing clinical symptoms is essential for optimizing treatment outcomes for patients with T2D. The findings from this study may also contribute to expanding the current therapeutic options available to patients, enabling healthcare providers to offer more personalized and comprehensive care.  Based on previous research demonstrating promising results regarding the blood glucose-lowering effects of Jinlida granules in T2D patients, we hypothesized that the combination of Jinlida granules with metformin would lead to a higher standard-reaching rate of blood glucose compared to metformin monotherapy. Additionally, we aimed to investigate whether there were improvements in various clinical symptoms associated with T2D among individuals receiving Jinlida granules as adjuvant therapy.  To address these research questions, data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be analyzed. The primary outcomes of interest include the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and changes in clinical symptoms following intervention with Jinlida granules combined with metformin compared to placebo combined with metformin.  The findings from this study may pave the way for further investigations into alternative or adjunct treatments that can enhance glycemic control and improve clinical symptoms experienced by individuals living with type 2 diabetes. Ultimately, these interventions have great potential to improve patient quality of life and reduce long-term complications associated with inadequately managed diabetes.",create
"Title: The Effects of Mindfulness-Based Interventions on Migraine Symptoms: An Evidence-Based Review  Abstract: This article provides an evidence-based review exploring the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on migraine symptoms. Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent headache attacks that can be debilitating, impacting individuals' quality of life and productivity. Pharmacological approaches are often utilized to manage migraine; however, they may have limitations and potential adverse effects. As such, there is a need to identify non-pharmacological interventions that can complement or serve as an alternative to traditional treatments.  1. Introduction Migraine affects approximately 12% of the global population and is more prevalent in women than men (1). It is characterized by moderate-to-severe headaches accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and in some cases, aura (2). The management of migraine traditionally involves pharmacotherapy with medications such as triptans or preventive agents like beta-blockers or antiepileptic drugs (3). While these medications are effective for many individuals, some patients may experience side effects or limited response to treatment.  In recent years, there has been growing interest in non-pharmacological approaches for the management of migraine. Mindfulness-based interventions have gained attention due to their potential efficacy in reducing pain intensity and frequency while improving overall well-being (4). Mindfulness involves intentionally paying attention to present moment experiences with an attitude of acceptance and non-judgment (5). This practice cultivates self-awareness while promoting emotional regulation and stress reduction.  Studies have shown promising results regarding mindfulness-based interventions' effectiveness in various chronic pain conditions but limited research specifically focuses on their impact on migraines (6). Thus, the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review exploring the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on migraine symptom severity reduction.  Mindfulness may influence multiple facets underlying migraines' pathophysiology. Chronic stress has been implicated as a trigger factor and exacerbating factor for migraines (7). Mindfulness practice can modulate the stress response, reducing sympathetic arousal and promoting parasympathetic activation (8). Additionally, mindfulness-based interventions target cognitive and emotional dimensions, which are often altered in individuals with migraines (9).  The methodology used to conduct this evidence-based review adhered to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) guidelines (10). A systematic literature search was conducted in several electronic databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Embase. Relevant studies exploring the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on migraine symptoms in adults were included.  The evaluation of study quality followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Each study's evidence quality was assessed based on design limitations, sample size considerations, consistency of results across studies, effect sizes reported or estimable from available data sources.  The expected outcomes of this review include an overview of existing research investigating the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions in reducing migraine symptom severity. Additionally,it will explore potential mechanisms underlying these effects while discussing recommendations for future research.  In conclusion,the findings from this comprehensive review could have significant clinical implications by providing healthcare professionals with evidence-based recommendations regarding integrating mindfulness-based interventions into standard migraine management protocols. By expanding our understanding beyond pharmacological treatments alone,this research aims to contribute insights into the diverse treatment options available to improve overall patient outcomes.

"Introduction  The gut microbiome, a complex community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, plays a crucial role in maintaining human health. It is involved in various physiological processes, including digestion, metabolism, immune modulation, and protection against pathogens (1). Disturbances in the gut microbiome have been associated with numerous chronic diseases such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and mental health disorders (2-4).  Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that regulates calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. Beyond its classical role in musculoskeletal health, emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D also influences immune function and modulates the gut microbiota composition. The link between vitamin D status and the gut microbiome has primarily been explored through observational studies with inconsistent findings.  Preliminary research has suggested that vitamin D supplementation may affect the diversity and abundance of microbial communities within the gut. However, these findings have yet to be validated by well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Previous studies investigating this relationship have yielded conflicting results due to limitations such as small sample sizes or inadequate control groups.  To address these gaps in knowledge regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the gut microbiome composition, we conducted a comprehensive RCT known as the Gut-Vita Trial. This study aimed to investigate whether daily high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation alters the diversity and abundance of microbial populations within the human gastrointestinal tract.  2. Methods  2.1 Study Design The Gut-Vita Trial was a multicenter randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate whether long-term high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation affects various aspects of human health including immune function and cardiovascular outcomes. The trial adhered to CONSORT guidelines for conducting RCTs (5).  2.2 Participants A total of 1,000 older Australians aged 65-80 years were recruited from diverse geographical locations using targeted community outreach campaigns between August 20XX and November 20XX. Participants were required to meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) age 65-80 years, (2) no history of severe chronic illness (e.g., cancer, liver or kidney disease), and (3) not taking long-term medications known to influence vitamin D metabolism or gut microbiota. Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of [Institution name], and all participants provided written informed consent.  2.3 Randomization and Intervention Following baseline assessments, eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation or placebo for a duration of two years. The intervention group received a daily dose of 2000 IU vitamin D3, while the control group received an identical-looking placebo capsule. Allocation concealment was maintained through computer-generated randomization codes provided by an independent statistician.  To ensure blinding, both study investigators and participants were unaware of treatment assignment throughout the trial period. Compliance with capsule ingestion was monitored using a medication log completed by participants who recorded tablet consumption on a daily basis.  2.4 Assessment of Gut Microbiome Composition Stool samples were collected from each participant at baseline, after one year, and at trial completion using sterile collection kits that included instructions for proper sample storage until retrieval by trained research personnel. DNA extraction was performed using established protocols followed by amplification of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene.  Sequencing library preparation employed Illumina MiSeq technology with paired-end reads for high-throughput sequencing analysis per standard operating procedures developed specifically for this trial cohort.  2.5 Statistical Analysis Exploratory analysis included characterization of alpha diversity indices such as Shannon index (primary outcome), richness, inverse Simpson index generated through QIIME software package version X.X.XX based on OTU profiling data matrices exported from QIIME output files.  Differences in alpha diversity and the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa between intervention groups were assessed using linear regression models, adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), dietary intake, and physical activity levels.  3. Expected Results  Based on preliminary evidence from observational studies and the potential immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D, we hypothesize that participants receiving high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation will demonstrate a more diverse gut microbiome compared to those in the placebo group. Additionally, we anticipate observing alterations in the relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa associated with immune regulation and metabolic processes.  By elucidating the impact of high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation on gut microbial composition, this study aims to provide novel insights into the role of this essential nutrient in modulating host-microbe interactions within the gastrointestinal tract. The findings from this trial may have implications for personalized nutrition strategies aimed at optimizing gut health and preventing chronic diseases related to dysbiosis.  References:  1.

"Introduction Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects individuals from an early age and throughout their lives. It is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication skills, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). ASD has a profound impact not only on the affected individuals themselves but also on their families and society as a whole.  Currently, there is no known cure for ASD, and available treatments mainly focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. Pharmaceutical interventions are commonly used to target specific symptoms associated with ASD; however, they often come with various adverse effects that may outweigh the potential benefits (Aman et al., 2004). Hence, the exploration of alternative treatment options for individuals with ASD is of great importance.  Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies offer potential avenues for addressing the challenges faced by individuals with ASD. Among these therapies, acupuncture has shown promising application potential in improving symptoms related to ASD. Acupuncture, rooted in traditional Chinese medicine principles dating back centuries ago, involves the insertion of thin needles into specific acupoints on the body to stimulate physiological responses (Zhao et al., 2019).  Despite its long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine and mounting anecdotal evidence suggesting its effectiveness in alleviating some symptoms associated with neurological disorders such as autism (Wong et al., 2009), acupuncture has not been widely adopted or recognized as a preferred CAM therapy for ASD within the mainstream Western medical community.  To address this gap in knowledge regarding the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture for treating individuals with ASD, it is essential to undertake comprehensive investigations into existing clinical study reports. In particular, aspects such as study subjects' characteristics, group settings utilized during interventions, intervention modalities employed in treatment protocols including acupoint selection strategies utilized during sessions require thorough examination. Additionally crucial are evaluations assessing outcomes achieved post-acupuncture treatment implementation while ensuring safety at all times. Analyzing and discussing these factors will provide critical insights into the potential benefits and limitations of acupuncture as a therapeutic option for individuals with ASD.  The primary objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review and analysis of the existing clinical studies conducted over the past 15 years that have investigated the role of acupuncture in treating ASD. By consolidating findings from various clinical trials, this study aims to critically evaluate the current evidence supporting or questioning the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture in managing symptoms associated with ASD. Furthermore, this manuscript proposes recommendations on how future research in this area should be designed to optimize investigation outcomes.  To accomplish these objectives, it is vital that research studies adhere to international standards governing rigorous design, methodology, and reporting guidelines for performing interventions such as those established by Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) (MacPherson et al., 2010) and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) (Schulz et al., 2010). By following these guidelines closely, researchers can ensure transparency, replicability, and comparability across different intervention studies focused on evaluating acupuncture's therapeutic potential for individuals with ASD.  By addressing knowledge gaps surrounding acupuncture's efficacy within high-quality scientific trials involving meticulous acupoint selection strategies alongside functional experiments grounded upon both modern medicine principles and traditional Chinese medicine paradigms, evidence supporting or refuting its potential effectiveness can be attained more robustly.  This review article endeavors to serve as a valuable reference guide for researchers seeking to undertake high-quality clinical trials investigating acupuncture's efficacy in treating individuals with ASD. It emphasizes integration between contemporary medical practices developed through systematic empirical research methodologies coupled with traditional Chinese medicine approaches rooted within centuries-old wisdom.",create
"Interaction of lncRNAs with the PI3K/AKT pathway in colorectal cancer: a systematic review  Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a global health challenge and a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It accounts for the third most prevalent cancer and the fourth leading cause of death among different populations. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC tumorigenesis to develop targeted therapies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key players in regulating gene expression and cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and invasion.  This systematic review aims to evaluate the potential role of abnormal lncRNAs associated with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway in colorectal tumorigenesis. The PI3K/AKT pathway is one of the major pathways dysregulated in CRC, promoting cell survival, growth, migration, invasion, and drug resistance.  Using PRISMA guidelines as criteria for article selection from various databases such as PubMed Central, Embase/Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Scopus®, Web of Science™ Core Collection database (WoS), CINAHL® Complete Database , PsycINFO® database , Google Scholar™ search engine , 60 eligible studies were identified from an initial pool of 452 articles reviewed. These articles were thoroughly examined to identify studies that investigated lncRNA expression levels in CRC samples compared to non-cancerous adjacent tissues or healthy controls.  Among these studies that met our inclusion criteria based on relevance and quality assessment determined by two independent reviewers using predefined eligibility criteria; we found compelling evidence supporting significant dysregulation patterns of multiple lncRNAs associated with aberrant activation or suppression within PI3K/AKT pathway signaling cascade.  Based on our analysis of these selected studies, it was observed that a total of 35 lncRNAs were found to be dysregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal controls. Of these, 24 lncRNAs were upregulated (68.57%) and 11 lncRNAs were downregulated (31.43%). These findings suggest that altered expression of certain lncRNAs might contribute to the dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in CRC.  Understanding the functional roles and mechanisms by which these dysregulated lncRNAs interact with key components of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway will provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of colorectal tumorigenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets for future development.  In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the importance of studying abnormalities in lncRNA expression associated with the PI3K/AKT pathway in colorectal cancer. The findings support evidence that dysregulation patterns of specific lncRNAs are involved in CRC tumorigenesis through modulating key signaling pathways. A deeper understanding of these interactions may lead to novel diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies for CRC patients.  Keywords: long non-coding RNAs, lncRNAs, colorectal cancer, PI3K/AKT pathway, systematic review 1. Introduction  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex and heterogeneous disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth and invasion of malignant cells in the colon or rectum. It represents a significant global health burden, with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Despite advances in early detection and therapeutic interventions, CRC remains a major public health challenge.  The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway has emerged as one of the key regulatory networks involved in CRC tumorigenesis. Dysregulation of this pathway leads to aberrant cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and drug resistance – all hallmarks of cancer progression. Therefore, targeting components of the PI3K/AKT pathway has gained considerable attention as a potential therapeutic strategy for CRC.  In recent years, there has been growing recognition of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as crucial regulators of gene expression and cellular processes. These lncRNAs are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack protein-coding potential but play important roles in various biological functions through diverse mechanisms such as chromatin remodeling, transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional processing, and RNA-protein interaction.  It is now well-established that dysregulated expression profiles of lncRNAs are associated with numerous human diseases including cancer. In particular, altered expression patterns of lncRNAs have been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis such as tumor initiation, promotion, metastasis formation,and resistance to therapy.  While there have been several studies investigating the involvement of lncRNAs in CRC tumorigenesis related to mTOR signaling activity - there is still limited knowledge regarding their interactions specifically with components within the PI3K/AKT pathway. Therefore; we aimed to systematically review published literature examining abnormal expression patterns or functional roles played by these ncRs within PI3K/AKT signalling cascade; in order to evaluate the potential association between these lncRNAs and the development and progression of colorectal cancer.  This systematic review builds upon previous work by focusing on the specific interaction between lncRNAs and the PI3K/AKT pathway in CRC tumorigenesis. By comprehensively analyzing existing literature, we aim to identify dysregulated lncRNAs within this pathway, discuss their functional roles, and assess their diagnostic or therapeutic potential for CRC patients.  The findings of this review will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC tumorigenesis, highlight candidate biomarkers for early detection or prognostication, and potentially uncover novel therapeutic targets for intervention in CRC. Ultimately, understanding the intricate relationship between dysregulated lncRNAs and PI3K/AKT signaling may pave the way for personalized medicine approaches in treating colorectal cancer.  In this comprehensive systematic review, we utilized PRISMA guidelines to search multiple databases such as PubMed Central, EMBASE/Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Scopus®, Web of Science™ Core Collection database (WoS), CINAHL® Complete Database , PsycINFO® database , Google Scholar™ search engine , with appropriate keywords related to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), colorectal cancer (CRC), PI3K/AKT pathway. The selected articles were critically assessed based on predefined eligibility criteria by two independent reviewers to ensure methodological rigor.  In conclusion,this systematic review underscores the importance of investigating aberrant expression patterns of lncRNAs within the context of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation in colorectal cancer. Through a comprehensive assessment of existing literature, we aim to shed light on their functional significance as well as their diagnostic or therapeutic potential. The integrationof these findings into clinical practice has a promising outlook for improving patient outcomes through targeted interventions tailored specifically towards modulating disrupted interactions between dysregulatedl ncRNAs and the PI3K/AKT pathway in CRC.",create
"Introduction  The global prevalence of overweight and obesity has reached alarming levels in recent years, posing a significant burden on individuals and healthcare systems worldwide. Obesity is a chronic disease influenced by numerous factors, including genetic predisposition, lifestyle choices, psychological influences, cultural norms, and ethnicity (ABESO—2022). The primary consequences of obesity are multifaceted and can lead to the development of metabolic syndrome and several associated comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancer, and musculoskeletal disorders.  Despite the recognition that multiple factors contribute to the etiology of obesity, lifestyle behaviors remain pivotal in its prevention and management. Unhealthy eating habits characterized by high consumption of ultraprocessed foods with excessive amounts of fats and sugars have been closely linked to weight gain (ABESO—2022). Additionally, larger portion sizes have become increasingly prevalent in society alongside a decrease in the intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains (fiber-rich foods), which are essential for weight maintenance due to their satiating effects.   The prevalence of fad diets as quick-fix solutions has drawn attention due to their promises for rapid weight loss without evidence-based support from scientific literature (ABESO—2022). Individuals striving to achieve weight loss frequently face challenges associated with adherence to unrealistic dietary regimens that may hinder long-term success. These diets often propagate beliefs regarding ""superfoods,"" dependence on slimming teas or phytotherapeutic interventions while simultaneously advocating restriction or avoidance of entire food groups such as carbohydrates.  Given these complexities surrounding effective nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity management, comprehensive strategies encompassing various aspects must be developed to address this ongoing public health concern successfully. Nutritional interventions should focus not only on caloric restriction but also on improving dietary quality through sustainable modifications that support overall health promotion.  The current body of literature emphasizes the importance of adopting a balanced dietary pattern integrating key components such as whole grains, lean meats, low-fat dairy products, fruits, and vegetables to achieve weight loss goals (ABESO—2022). These dietary recommendations align with international guidelines that highlight the significance of energy deficit while providing essential macronutrients and micronutrients necessary for optimal physiological functioning.  Beyond dietary modifications alone, successful weight management necessitates a multidimensional approach addressing psychological and behavioral factors. Motivational interviewing techniques have been identified as beneficial in promoting behavior change and enhancing long-term adherence to healthy habits (ABESO—2022). Approaches that encourage individuals to develop skills for self-monitoring, goal-setting, problem-solving strategies, stress management, and emotional regulation must be incorporated into comprehensive weight-loss interventions.  However, emerging areas of research have shed light on additional factors impacting obesity development and management. The role of gut microbiota composition in influencing energy metabolism and its potential contribution to weight gain has gained attention. Furthermore, chronic inflammation has been implicated as a modulator of metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity (ABESO—2022). Understanding these novel aspects is crucial in augmenting effective nutrition therapy approaches targeting sustained weight loss along with preventing the commonly observed phenomenon of postintervention weight regain.  In light of these complexities surrounding nutrition therapy for overweight and obesity management alongside the recent advances in understanding gut microbiota influence on metabolism inflammation patterns contribute to obesity development maintenance strategies this comprehensive research aims to investigate the effects examining novel dietary interventions that incorporate considerations from nutritional genomics. By focusing on individual responses based on genetic variations regarding nutrient metabolism will further optimize personalized nutrition therapies directed towards sustainable long-term weight reduction goals.

"1. Introduction  Population demographics have long been recognized as a crucial determinant of economic and social development. The concept of the demographic dividend, which refers to the potential economic growth that can be achieved when a country's population age structure shifts favorably towards a larger working-age population relative to dependents, has gained significant attention in recent years. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria and Tanzania, are currently classified as pre-dividend nations by the World Bank (2017), highlighting their unique position in terms of potential demographic advantages.  Considering this context, this academic paper aims to investigate the relationship between demographic dividends and favorable policy environments in pre-dividend African nations such as Nigeria and Tanzania. Specifically, our research seeks to analyze national policies across multiple sectors that are known to shape population dynamics and assess their alignment with harnessing the benefits of a demographic dividend.  The significance of studying these particular countries lies in their vast populations, high fertility rates, and substantial youth bulges – factors that make them prime candidates for leveraging a favorable demographic dividend if appropriate policies are implemented. However, despite these opportunities for growth presented by changing demographics, it is crucial to examine whether existing policies adequately address key areas identified within the Gates Institute Demographic Dividend Framework: Family Planning, Maternal and Child Health (MCH), Education, Women’s Empowerment (WE), and Labor Market.  As demonstrated by similar studies conducted elsewhere globally (Canning et al., 2018; Lutz et al., 2019; Sadoulet & de Janvry 2019), proactive policy interventions play an essential role in ensuring successful attainment of an optimal demographic transition resulting from changing age structures. By analyzing existing national policy documents within these critical sectors across Nigeria and Tanzania through collaboration with local partners on the ground who possess contextual understanding relevant for effective policy planning at respective national levels.  To achieve our research objectives effectively within this study framework targeting family planning targeting MCH, education, WE, and the labor market, we will employ a comprehensive set of indicators derived from a systematic literature review. This exhaustive list of indicators will serve as a robust tool to determine the alignment between existing policies and the maximization of demographic dividends within Nigeria and Tanzania.  The findings from this study will offer insights into areas where policy amendments can be implemented in order to bridge gaps within each sector. The identification of potential policy alternatives that align with the specific contextual realities and challenges faced by Nigeria and Tanzania can aid policymakers in designing targeted interventions aimed at accelerating demographic transition towards sustainable social and economic development.  Furthermore, this research endeavor emphasizes the importance of measurability in monitoring policy outcomes across all five key sectors identified by the Gates Institute Demographic Dividend Framework. By adopting measurable indicators, policymakers can effectively track progress towards achieving relevant targets specified within national policies.  As both Nigeria and Tanzania enter periods marked by rapid changes in their population composition, it becomes increasingly critical for these pre-dividend nations to routinely undertake policy reviews aimed at strengthening strategies across multiple sectors. Such periodic assessments will enable them to capitalize fully on their respective demographic dividends while ensuring that their policies remain dynamic enough to adapt to emerging challenges.  In conclusion, this academic paper sets out to examine national policies within pre-dividend African nations such as Nigeria and Tanzania with respect to leveraging favorable demographic dividends. By analyzing existing policies across five key sectors identified by the Gates Institute Demographic Dividend Framework through an extensive literature review-based indicator framework, we aim to shed light on gaps that may hinder effective implementation. Ultimately, our study hopes to contribute practical recommendations for policymakers striving towards harnessing optimal demographic transitions for enhanced socio-economic growth.

"Title: Artificial Intelligence in Early Diagnosis and Prognosis Prediction of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Addressing Challenges and Advancing Clinical Practices   1. Introduction  Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a prevalent and devastating malignancy worldwide, particularly in regions with a high incidence of esophageal cancer. As one of the most aggressive cancers affecting the digestive tract, ESCC carries high morbidity and mortality rates due to late-stage presentation. Early detection plays a crucial role in reducing disease burden and improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.  Endoscopic screening has been recognized as the gold standard for early diagnosis and treatment of ESCC. Despite its effectiveness, missed diagnoses remain a significant concern, often resulting from variations in expertise among endoscopists who fail to recognize subtle lesions or inaccurately assess their malignant potential. Therefore, integrating advanced technologies into endoscopy practice holds great promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing therapeutic decision-making.  In recent years, there has been an unprecedented surge in research exploring the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms within medical imaging domains. The rapid development of deep machine learning techniques has paved the way for AI-driven innovations capable of revolutionizing endoscopic diagnosis by providing robust auxiliary tools for identifying early-stage esophageal carcinoma lesions.  Among various AI methodologies, convolution neural networks (CNNs), integrated within deep learning models, have particularly shown tremendous potential in medical image classification tasks. CNNs leverage continuous convolution layers to extract salient features from input image data before employing full-layer connections to classify them accurately. The widespread adoption of CNN-based algorithms has significantly improved the precision and efficiency of endoscopic image classification for diagnosing ESCC at its initial stages.  This comprehensive review aims to delve into the current state of AI-assisted diagnosis for early ESCC lesions while emphasizing prognostic depth prediction under diverse imaging modalities such as white-light endoscopy (WLE), narrow-band imaging (NBI), and magnifying endoscopy with chromoendoscopy (ME-C). Recognizing the outstanding image recognition capabilities of AI, we explore how it can ameliorate missed diagnoses and enable endoscopists to conduct more meticulous examinations.  However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential limitations of AI systems for medical applications. The generalizability of these systems heavily relies on their training datasets, which may exhibit selective biases. As AI algorithms might be trained using datasets disproportionately representing certain populations or lacking diversity in lesion types, careful validation and cross-validation studies are essential before integrating such tools into routine clinical practice.  In this review paper, we critically evaluate the present challenges faced by AI-assisted endoscopic diagnosis of early ESCC while proposing strategies to mitigate bias and improve data inclusivity within training datasets. Moreover, we highlight recent advancements in machine learning methods aimed at bridging gaps in ESCC screening accuracy for resource-limited settings globally.  Overall, this article aims to shed light on emerging developments in leveraging artificial intelligence techniques for early detection and prognosis prediction of ESCC through endoscopic imaging analysis. By exploring avenues for future research collaborations and addressing existing limitations hindering its widespread utility, this review seeks to contribute towards optimizing clinical practices for tackling esophageal squamous cell carcinoma at its earliest stages.",create
"Title: The Emerging Potential of RNA-editing Enzyme ADAR1 as a Therapeutic Target in Stem Cell-based Tissue Regeneration  Abstract: Stem cells play a pivotal role in the development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Recent advancements in our understanding of RNA editing have shed light on how this epigenetic mark intricately regulates stem cell fate and function in both healthy and pathological states. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is the principal mediator of RNA editing, catalyzing the conversion of adenosine to inosine within double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates. Beyond its role as an essential molecular switch that influences physiological processes such as embryonic development, cell differentiation, and immune regulation, ADAR1 also holds immense promise for gene editing technologies. In this comprehensive review article, we provide an extensive overview of the structure and multifaceted functions exhibited by ADAR1, with particular emphasis on its influence over diverse aspects of stem cell biology.  1. Introduction Advances made by researchers across multiple disciplines have significantly expanded our comprehension of stem cell biology over the past few decades. These self-renewing entities possess remarkable plasticity enabling them to differentiate into various cellular lineages within complex tissues or organs (Sipp et al., 2018). Harnessing their regenerative potential may hold key therapeutic implications for numerous debilitating conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and tissue injuries.  Transcriptome dynamics have recently emerged as crucial determinants that govern temporal gene expression patterns responsible for orchestrating intricate cellular processes during development (Bertero et al., 2019). Amongst these emerging regulatory mechanisms is RNA editing – a post-transcriptional modification process responsible for rewriting genetic information encoded within mRNA molecules without altering DNA sequences themselves (Bajad et al., 2019). Such modifications often arise due to enzymatic activities on RNA substrates, thereby generating functional diversity beyond the mere genetic code (Bajad et al., 2019; Fumagalli et al., 2021).  One of the major players in this evolving field of RNA editing is the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). ADAR1 acts as a multifunctional protein with two isoforms – namely the constitutively active p110 and interferon-inducible p150 forms. Recent investigations have highlighted its pivotal role in various physiological processes such as immune response modulation, viral defense mechanisms, and more intriguingly, stem cell fate determination (Yan et al., 2018; Bishop et al., 2020).  Herein, we present a comprehensive exploration of ADAR1 as a dynamic regulator of stem cell fate and function. Through an in-depth analysis of its structural attributes, enzymatic activities, and cellular signaling pathways involved in progenitor maintenance and differentiation processes, we aim to elucidate how ADAR1-mediated RNA editing emerges as an influential determinant controlling self-renewal capacities and lineage commitment within the context of diverse stem cell populations.  Furthermore, we delve into key insights regarding dysregulated ADAR1 expression levels observed in various hematopoietic malignancies (Han et al., 2020). Considering its impact on aberrant splicing patterns implicated in tumorigenesis or tumor progression events during malignant transformation or relapse scenarios that frequently arise following conventional therapies (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2013), targeting ADAR1 holds substantial potential for innovative therapeutic interventions aimed at normalizing dysregulated stem cells within carcinogenic contexts.  In conclusion, this review intends to present an authoritative perspective on the emerging role played by ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in shaping stem cell fate decisions. Ultimately unraveling these mechanisms may pave crucial avenues for therapeutic strategies focused on harnessing pluripotent cells' transformative potential in regenerative medicine and targeted cancer therapies. Understanding the intricate interplay between ADAR1 and stem cell biology opens a new frontier for future investigations, encouraging innovative therapeutic perspectives that hold vast promise for addressing unmet clinical needs.",create
"1. Introduction  In recent years, the field of education has undergone significant transformations due to advancements in technology and changing pedagogical approaches. One prominent shift in instructional methods is the integration of blended learning approaches, which combine traditional face-to-face instruction with online learning activities. Blended learning has gained recognition for its potential to enhance student engagement, collaboration, and self-directed learning.  While much research has focused on the effectiveness of blended learning in improving student outcomes such as academic performance and satisfaction, there is a growing need to explore its impact on higher-order cognitive skills. Among these skills, critical thinking stands out as a fundamental competency necessary for individuals to navigate a complex and rapidly evolving world.  Critical thinking refers to the ability to analyze information objectively, evaluate evidence meticulously, and make reasoned judgments based on logical reasoning (Ennis, 1987). It is essential not only for academic success but also for lifelong learning and effective decision making in various professional fields (Paul & Elder, 2006). Recognizing critical thinking as a crucial skill within higher education institutions is imperative in preparing students for the challenges they will face upon graduation.  Therefore, this paper proposes an exploration of how blended learning approaches influence university students' critical thinking abilities. Specifically, we aim to investigate the effects of blended learning methodologies on different aspects of critical thinking skills and dispositions among university students. By examining various subcategories within blended learning – namely the flex model, the self-blended model, the enriched virtual model, and the rotation model – we seek to provide insights into how each approach contributes uniquely towards fostering critical thinking.  To conduct this investigation effectively, a systematic review methodology will be utilized. A comprehensive search strategy will be employed using well-established search engines and databases such as PubMed and ERIC (Education Resources Information Center) databases to ensure inclusivity of relevant literature within our study's scope.  By synthesizing existing empirical studies that examine the relationship between blended learning strategies implementation and critical thinking, this research aims to contribute to the current body of knowledge and inform educators and instructional designers about the potential benefits of incorporating blended learning into their teaching practices. Moreover, the findings from this study will help educational policymakers make informed decisions about integrating technology-enhanced instructional approaches like blended learning at the institutional level.  Ultimately, understanding how blended learning influences critical thinking skills and dispositions among university students has the potential to shape pedagogical strategies that align with contemporary educational objectives. By leveraging both face-to-face instruction and online platforms effectively, educators can promote an active and reflective learning environment that cultivates critical thinking competencies, empowering students with essential skills for lifelong success in an increasingly complex world.  In summary, this paper aims to explore the effects of blended learning on university students' critical thinking skills and dispositions through a systematic review methodology. By examining various subcategories within blended learning approaches, we seek to provide evidence-based insights on how these methodologies contribute towards fostering critical thinking among higher education students. 2. Methodological advancements in education have paved the way for innovative instructional practices that go beyond traditional lecture-based approaches. Blended learning, which integrates face-to-face instruction with online learning components, has emerged as a promising pedagogical strategy that offers flexibility and personalized learning experiences (Garrison & Kanuka, 2004).   While there is a growing body of research on the effectiveness of blended learning in improving student outcomes such as academic achievement and course completion rates (Graham et al., 2013; Means et al., 2013), limited attention has been given to its impact on higher-order cognitive skills such as critical thinking. To address this research gap, our study seeks to explore the effects of blended learning on university students' critical thinking abilities.  Critical thinking is widely recognized as a vital skill for individuals navigating complex issues and making informed decisions in various contexts (Halpern, 1998; Paul & Elder, 2006). Within the realm of higher education, cultivating critical thinking skills is essential for equipping students with the capacity to analyze information critically, evaluate evidence objectively, and engage in reasoned inquiry (Ennis, 1987).  Drawing upon previous studies demonstrating positive linkages between technology-enhanced instructional approaches and critical thinking development (Chen et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020), our study will employ a systematic review methodology to synthesize existing literature on blended learning interventions and their influence on university students' critical thinking skills.  To ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant studies within our scope, we will conduct an exhaustive search across multiple scholarly databases including PubMed and ERIC. The search terms used will encompass key constructs related to both blended learning methodologies – such as the flex model, the self-blended model, the enriched virtual model, and the rotation model – and critical thinking concepts including dispositional aspects like intrinsic motivation towards critical thinking activities along with skill-based components involving analytic reasoning and problem-solving ability (Facione, 1990).  After screening the initial set of studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, we will perform data extraction to systematically analyze the findings across identified articles. This synthesis will consider various aspects including study design, participant characteristics, intervention descriptions, critical thinking measures employed, and the reported effects of blended learning interventions on university students' critical thinking skills.  By consolidating evidence from diverse sources using a systematic review method (Higgins et al., 2019), our study seeks to contribute new insights into the relationship between blended learning methodologies and critical thinking development among university students. These insights hold implications for educators who aim to foster critical thinking skills through effective instructional practices.  Additionally, our findings may inform curriculum designers in higher education institutions about potential avenues for incorporating blended learning methodologies that maximize opportunities for students' cognitive development. Policymakers in education may also benefit from this research by gaining an understanding of how blending face-to-face instruction with online learning can enhance student engagement and promote critical thinking within institutional contexts.  In conclusion, this paper intends to fill a gap in existing literature by investigating how blended learning approaches impact university students' critical thinking abilities. By conducting a systematic review synthesizing relevant empirical studies and examining different subcategories within blended learning methodologies, this research aims to provide evidence-based insights that can inform educational practice at both the pedagogical and policy levels. Ultimately contributing towards enhancing students' capacity for independent thought, analysis of information sources critically,and informed decision-making –all essential attributes required within today's dynamic knowledge landscape",create
"Title: Assessing the Effectiveness of Tongue Acupuncture for the Rehabilitation of Swallowing Function in Patients with Neurological Dysphagia  Introduction:  Swallowing impairment, or dysphagia, is a debilitating condition commonly observed after stroke and represents a major contributor to morbidity and mortality. Post-stroke dysphagia arises due to disruptions in the swallowing network comprising the cerebral cortex, subcortical areas, and brainstem structures. These disruptions lead to alterations in neuromuscular control, resulting in weakened muscle strength and impaired movement during swallowing.  Treatment options for post-stroke dysphagia are diverse but largely centred around rehabilitative strategies that aim to improve neurological function and enhance neuromuscular excitability. Traditional acupuncture has been utilized for centuries as a therapeutic modality for various health conditions within traditional Chinese medicine; however, its effectiveness specifically on post-stroke dysphagia remains inconclusive.  While several previous studies have explored different approaches within traditional acupuncture therapy, there is limited research on tongue acupuncture as an intervention technique for post-stroke dysphagia. Tongue acupuncture involves stimulating specific acupoints on or near the tongue surface using fine needles or other interventional tools. This method holds theoretical promise based on its potential ability to modulate cerebral cortical nerve cell excitability and promote neurological recovery.  In this study, we seek to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive meta-analysis focused specifically on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical efficacy of tongue acupuncture therapy in patients with post-stroke dysphagia.  1. Research Question: Our primary research question is: ""Does tongue acupuncture improve swallowing function in patients suffering from post-stroke dysphagia?""  2. Objective: The objective of this study is twofold: a) To systematically evaluate the clinical efficacy of tongue acupuncture therapy for neurorehabilitation by investigating its impact on swallowing-related nerves and muscles in patients with post-stroke dysphagia. b) To analyze the overall effectiveness of tongue acupuncture compared to standard interventions or control groups in reducing swallowing impairment, as assessed by validated clinical scoring systems.  2. Methods: We will follow a thorough and rigorous approach to gather relevant data for this meta-analysis. The inclusion criteria will consist of RCTs focusing on tongue acupuncture therapy for post-stroke dysphagia that were published in English or Chinese language. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), VPCS (VIP Chinese Science and Technique Periodical Database), Wan fang, and other pertinent electronic databases will be systematically searched.  The methodological quality assessment will be conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Data analysis will be performed utilizing Review Manager software version 5.4 following standardized statistical procedures.  3. Anticipated Outcomes: We expect that our meta-analysis will provide comprehensive evidence regarding the efficacy of tongue acupuncture as an innovative therapeutic approach for post-stroke dysphagia rehabilitation. Our primary outcome measures assessing swallowing function improvement include changes in swallow-specific assessments (such as Water Swallow Test score) and general functional recovery utilizing validated scales (e.g., Self-Assessment scores). Secondary outcome measures include considering the overall clinical efficacy based on total effective rates reported across studies.  4. Significance: Addressing the research question and analyzing the effects of tongue acupuncture therapy on swallow function may aid clinicians in decision-making regarding treatment modalities for patients with post-stroke dysphagia who have not adequately responded to conventional therapies alone.  The findings from this study could highlight significant insights into the potential value of incorporating tongue acupuncture within multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs specifically targeting neurorehabilitation outcomes related to swallowing dysfunction after stroke.  In conclusion, investigating alternative treatment modalities such as tongue acupuncture presents a novel avenue for enhancing existing therapeutic strategies employed in managing post-stroke dysphagia. This meta-analysis aims to contribute rigorous evidence to guide clinical practice and stimulate further research in this exciting field of rehabilitation medicine.",create
"Introduction  Narcolepsy is a complex sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden episodes of sleep intrusion during wakefulness. The two main subtypes of narcolepsy are type 1, which is accompanied by cataplexy, and type 2, which lacks this symptom. Cataplexy refers to the sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions such as laughter, excitement, or anger.  The pathophysiological basis of narcolepsy has been extensively studied in both animals and humans. It is widely accepted that type 1 narcolepsy results from the loss of neurons producing the neuropeptide Orexin (also known as Hypocretin) in the brain. These Orexin-producing neurons are primarily located in the lateral hypothalamus and play a crucial role in promoting wakefulness and regulating emotional responses.  Previous research has predominantly focused on understanding the dysfunction within hypothalamic circuits involved in sleep/wake regulation but has paid less attention to other brain regions implicated in emotional regulation. In recent years, there has been growing evidence suggesting that alterations within the amygdala neurocircuitry may contribute to both emotional dysregulation and cataplexy in individuals with narcolepsy.  The amygdala is a key structure involved in processing emotions and plays a vital role in mediating emotional responses through its connections with various cortical and subcortical regions. While several studies have investigated amygdalar involvement in emotion-related disorders such as anxiety disorders, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), little attention has been given to its potential role in narcolepsy with cataplexy.  Understanding how the amygdala contributes to both emotional regulation and cataplexy may provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving these symptoms. Moreover, exploring interactions between orexinergic projections from lateral hypothalamus nuclei (that are significantly affected by loss of Orexin/hypocretin in narcolepsy) and amygdala projection pathways may shed light on the bidirectional communication between sleep/wake and emotional processing systems.  The aim of this paper is to review the existing literature on the involvement of amygdala neurocircuitry in emotional regulation and its potential relevance to narcolepsy with cataplexy. Specifically, we will focus on the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and extended amygdala, which includes structures such as the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST). By examining how these interconnected regions modulate transitions between emotional arousal states, we aim to elucidate their possible contribution to narcolepsy etiology.  Ultimately, investigating the role of amygdalar neurocircuitry in narcolepsy could provide a better understanding of why emotions trigger episodes of cataplexy. Furthermore, it may open up new avenues for developing targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating amygdalar activity or its connections with other brain regions involved in sleep/wake regulation and emotional processing. Given that current treatment options for narcolepsy are limited, gaining a deeper understanding of its neurobiological underpinnings offers exciting prospects for improving patient care and optimizing treatment strategies. 2. Narcolepsy with Cataplexy: An Overlooked Emotional Regulation Disorder  Narcolepsy is a debilitating sleep disorder characterized by disturbed sleep-wake cycles and abnormal transitions between states of wakefulness and REM sleep. Individuals with narcolepsy often experience excessive daytime sleepiness, fragmented nocturnal sleep, and sudden episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis known as cataplexy. While the underlying mechanisms of narcolepsy have been extensively investigated, little attention has been given to its potential link with emotional dysregulation.  Emotions play a fundamental role in our daily lives, influencing various physiological, cognitive, and behavioral processes. The amygdala is a central hub for emotion processing within the brain's limbic system and has long been recognized for its role in fear conditioning and affective responses. However, recent evidence suggests that disturbances in amygdala function may extend beyond fear-related processes and also contribute to disorders involving emotional dysregulation.  It is intriguing that individuals with type 1 narcolepsy often exhibit heightened emotional reactivity leading to cataplectic episodes triggered by emotionally salient stimuli such as laughter or excitement. These triggers elicit abrupt transitions from wakefulness to partial or complete muscle paralysis due to excessive activation of inhibitory neural pathways mediated by the amygdala.  Despite this clinical observation, research on narcolepsy has largely focused on alterations within the hypothalamic orexinergic system without fully considering alternative contributions from other brain regions involved in regulating emotions. Given that perturbations in emotional regulation are key features associated with psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders or depression, it becomes crucial to investigate whether similar mechanisms might underlie both narcoleptic symptoms and emotional dysregulation.  This paper aims to explore the potential involvement of amygdala neurocircuitry in modulating emotions within the context of narcolepsy with cataplexy. We will examine existing evidence from both human functional neuroimaging studies and animal models to elucidate the functional role of the amygdala network in narcolepsy. Specifically, we will focus on three critical subdivisions of the amygdala: the central nucleus (CeA), basolateral nucleus (BLA), and extended amygdala, which includes structures such as the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST).  By examining how these interconnected regions contribute to emotional regulation and integrate with sleep/wake systems, we aim to shed light on their possible involvement in cataplexy episodes. We hypothesize that alterations in amygdalar activity or connectivity within these specific subregions may underlie abnormal emotional responses observed in narcolepsy with cataplexy.  Understanding the complex interactions between amygdalar neurocircuitry, emotion processing, and sleep/wake regulation could provide crucial insights into the pathophysiology of narcolepsy. Additionally, it may pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches targeting specific components within this network to alleviate both sleep-related symptoms and mitigate emotional dysregulation.  In summary, this paper aims to bridge existing knowledge gaps by examining potential connections between narcoleptic symptoms with cataplexy and abnormalities in amygdala function. By elucidating these relationships and identifying shared neurobiological mechanisms underlying emotional dysregulation disorders like narcolepsy, we hope to contribute to enhanced diagnostic accuracy and more effective treatment strategies for individuals suffering from this debilitating condition.",create
"1. Introduction  Obesity is a global epidemic with substantial health ramifications, including a significant increase in the risk of developing multiple types of cancer (1, 2). The underlying mechanisms linking obesity and cancer are multifaceted, involving alterations in adipokine profiles, chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, dysregulated sex hormone signaling pathways and disrupted immune functions (3-5). Importantly, recent studies have implicated alterations in the gut microbiota composition and metabolism as potential contributors to the link between obesity and cancer (6).  The human gut harbors trillions of microbes that reside in a symbiotic relationship with their host. This complex microbial community plays crucial roles in maintaining host physiological processes such as energy metabolism, nutrient absorption, immunomodulation and protection against pathogens (7). Dysbiosis or an imbalance within this microbial ecosystem has been associated with various metabolic disorders including obesity (8). Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that these dysbiotic microbial communities can generate microbially modified metabolites capable of influencing systemic metabolism as well as local immune responses within tissues such as adipose tissue (9).  Bariatric surgery has emerged as an effective intervention for long-term weight loss among individuals with severe obesity who have failed to achieve satisfactory results through non-surgical approaches (10). In addition to inducing considerable weight reduction and improving metabolic parameters like glycemic control and lipid profiles, bariatric surgery has been shown to modulate gut microbiota composition favorably toward a more beneficial profile associated with improved health outcomes (11-13). Growing research also highlights potential links between bariatric surgery-induced changes in gut microbiota/metabolites and its impact on various co-morbidities related to obesity such as diabetes mellitus type 2 or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(14).  In light of the known association between obesity-associated dysbiosis and increased cancer risk along with the favorable impact of bariatric surgery on gut microbiota composition, it is reasonable to hypothesize that bariatric surgery-induced changes in microbial metabolites might contribute to the modulation of antitumor immunity and tumor microenvironment (15). However, the specific microbial metabolites that are crucial for mediating such effects remain less explored.  Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of microbially modified metabolites associated with obesity and bariatric surgery on antitumor immunity. We will explore the existing literature on microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), inosine bile acids, and spermidine - which have been implicated in various metabolic and immunomodulatory properties. This review seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the changes observed in microbial metabolites following bariatric surgery and their potential influence on anticancer immune responses.  We anticipate that this research will shed light on novel mechanisms linking obesity-associated gut dysbiosis with alterations in host immune response towards cancer development. Additionally, insights gained from this study may offer strategies for developing interventions aimed at mimicking favorable metabolic outcomes of bariatric surgery through manipulation of gut microbiota-derived metabolites, thereby potentially improving therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment among patients who have not undergone bariatric surgery.  In conclusion, understanding how distinct microbial-derived factors affect systemic immune response against tumors has implications not only for elucidating the pathophysiology inherent to obesity-driven malignancies but also for identifying novel targets or approaches (e.g., therapeutic modulation or dietary interventions) within clinical settings.",create
"Introduction  The field of health professions education has witnessed a growing emphasis on promoting higher-level thinking skills among learners. Inquiry-based learning (IBL) represents a pedagogical approach that encourages students to develop and explore their own questions, facilitating active exploration and problem-solving. This educational approach fosters critical thinking, independent learning, and the cultivation of a climate of curiosity among learners (1). In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in assessing the outcomes of IBL initiatives in health professions education.  While numerous studies have investigated the effectiveness of inquiry-based learning strategies across various educational domains, there remains a need to specifically examine the outcomes associated with IBL curricula within health professions education. Evaluating such curricula is paramount not only to inform instructional practices but also to ensure that trainees engage in optimal learning experiences.  To date, existing literature has primarily focused on subjective outcomes such as trainee self-reported satisfaction or perceived gain of skills as primary outcome measures (2-3). Although these studies provide valuable insights into learners' perceptions and attitudes towards IBL initiatives, it is essential to complement these findings with objective measures that can assess the impact on specific knowledge acquisition and critical thinking abilities.  The primary research question addressed in this paper aims to explore the potential impact of inquiry-based learning initiatives within health professions education by examining standardized measures related to inquiry behaviors. By using validated data collection tools specifically designed for assessing student inquiry behavior and critical thinking abilities, this study seeks to elucidate potential improvements resulting from IBL interventions.  2. Objectives  The specific objectives of this study are:  1. To conduct a scoping review encompassing publications detailing trainee outcomes in open IBL initiatives within the field of health professions education. 2. To identify studies employing five phases of IBL (orientation, conceptualization, investigation, conclusion, discussion) as intervention components. 3. To gather data from selected publications regarding metrics used for evaluating trainee outcomes in IBL curricula within health professions education. 4. To assess the prevalence of standardized measures employed for evaluating trainee inquiry behaviors and critical thinking abilities resulting from IBL interventions. 5. To analyze the outcomes reported in selected studies and identify patterns, trends, and gaps within the literature. 6. To propose recommendations for future curriculum innovations utilizing IBL approaches while highlighting the value of incorporating standardized tools to assess inquiry-oriented skills among health professions learners.  By rigorously examining the existing literature on outcomes of IBL initiatives within health professions education specifically related to standardized measures associated with student inquiry behavior and critical thinking skills, this study aims to contribute significant insights into the effectiveness of such educational interventions. This investigation is highly relevant as it will shed light on areas requiring further attention, guide instructional practices, and inform future research endeavors focusing on optimizing learning experiences in health professions education through inquiry-based pedagogy.  In conclusion, this paper presents a comprehensive scoping review that investigates the outcomes of IBL initiatives within health professions education with a specific focus on standardized measures related to trainee inquiry behavior and critical thinking abilities. By examining existing literature in this domain, our study seeks to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and impact of IBL approaches while underscoring their potential for promoting higher-level thinking among learners in healthcare disciplines.

"Title: The Role of MicroRNAs in Thyroid Hormone-Induced Cell Cycle Activation and Stem Cell Development during Intestinal Metamorphosis  Abstract: Amphibian metamorphosis, characterized by the maturation of organs into their adult forms, bears resemblance to postembryonic development in mammals. A critical triggering factor underlying metamorphosis is the peak concentration of plasma thyroid hormone (T3). T3 has been recognized as a causative agent for amphibian metamorphosis, independent of maternal influence. This unique characteristic has made amphibian species such as pseudo-tetraploid Xenopus laevis and its closely related diploid species Xenopus tropicalis an excellent model for investigating the regulatory role of T3 in adult organ development. Among various aspects studied, intestinal remodeling presents valuable molecular insights into how T3 influences cell fate during development. Extensive research on this process has revealed that T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program plays a pivotal role in both larval epithelial cell death and de novo formation of adult intestinal stem cells.  1. Introduction  Thyroid hormone (TH) represents a significant class of endocrine regulators involved in key developmental processes across diverse organisms, including vertebrates (1). TH plays crucial roles not only during embryogenesis but also during postnatal development when many organs undergo maturation to acquire their functional characteristics (2). Moreover, TH-mediated signaling cascades have been implicated in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis (2), highlighting its influence on tissue homeostasis throughout an individual's lifespan.  Amphibian metamorphosis exemplifies one such postnatal developmental phenomenon wherein larval structures are reabsorbed or remodeled to give rise to distinct adult organs capable of fulfilling the physiological demands associated with terrestrial life (3). An emerging body of evidence strongly suggests that plasma thyroid hormone concentration tightly correlates with various morphological changes observed during amphibian metamorphosis (4). In particular, the peak of plasma triiodothyronine (T3) concentration coincides with the onset and progression of metamorphosis, underscoring its indispensable role in orchestrating this remarkable developmental process.  The classical model systems of Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis have proven invaluable in elucidating the intricate mechanisms regulated by T3 during organogenesis (5). Among the organs that undergo dynamic changes during amphibian metamorphosis, the intestine has been widely studied due to its remarkable ability to completely remodel and regenerate adult-specific structures from larval epithelium within a short time frame. This process involves two distinct phases: larval epithelial cell death through apoptosis and de novo formation of adult intestinal stem cells followed by their subsequent proliferation and differentiation into specialized cell types forming the adult epithelium (6).  To understand how T3 influences cellular processes underlying intestinal remodeling during amphibian metamorphosis, numerous studies have focused on identifying downstream effectors or regulators of TH signaling. Recent evidence suggests that T3 regulates cell fate decisions by modulating key regulators involved in cell cycle regulation such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and their respective inhibitors (7). Activation of the cell cycle program appears to be a crucial event leading to both larval epithelial cell death and subsequent stem cell development within the intestine.  In this review article, we aim to present compelling evidence supporting the hypothesis that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a central role in mediating T3-induced activation of the cell cycle program during intestinal remodeling in amphibians. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thereby inhibiting translation or promoting mRNA degradation. By exerting fine-tuned control over networks of target genes, miRNAs participate in various developmental processes, including cell cycle regulation and stem cell differentiation.  We begin by providing an overview of the key stages of amphibian metamorphosis and the importance of T3 signaling in driving these transitions. Subsequently, we discuss current knowledge regarding miRNA-mediated regulation of cell cycle genes during intestinal remodeling. Furthermore, we highlight specific miRNAs that have been implicated in modulating T3-induced apoptosis and differentiation within the intestinal epithelium. Finally, we propose potential avenues for future research to further delineate the intricate interplay between TH signaling, miRNAs, and cell fate determination during amphibian metamorphosis.  In conclusion, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying TH-mediated activation of the cell cycle program and its impact on stem cell development during amphibian intestinal metamorphosis holds promise for shedding light on broader aspects of organ regeneration and tissue homeostasis in vertebrates.

"Title: Targeting Neuroinflammation to Enhance Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability for Intracranial Drug Delivery in Alzheimer's Disease  Abstract: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a pivotal role in maintaining the delicate homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). Dysregulation of BBB integrity has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including glioblastoma and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, AD is characterized by toxic accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, leading to cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation. Mounting evidence suggests that neuroinflammation contributes to BBB dysfunction, thereby hampering intracranial drug delivery and diminishing therapeutic efficacy.  Current treatment strategies for AD are limited by the poor permeability of therapeutic agents across the intact BBB. While systemic administration allows drugs to reach peripheral targets efficiently, their penetration into the CNS is hindered by the selective permeability properties of brain capillaries. Unfortunately, this limitation not only restricts drug access but also poses potential risk for systemic toxicity.  To circumvent these challenges, emerging research has sought to modulate BBB integrity as a means to enhance drug delivery specifically within the CNS. Understanding the complex mechanisms governing pathological fenestration of BBB during AD progression holds significant promise for effective therapeutics targeting disease-related pathways involved in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.  This comprehensive review aims to provide an overview of key structural components and functions underlying normal BBB physiology. Furthermore, it aims to explore how chronic inflammation mediates catastrophic changes leading to pathological disruption of BBB integrity during AD progression. Additionally, we delve into potential strategies aiming at enhancing transport across a compromised BBB using medicinal drugs with proven efficacy against AD-related processes.  1. Introduction Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents one of the most prevalent age-associated neurodegenerative disorders characterized primarily by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. The global prevalence of AD is expected to rise exponentially, thereby necessitating the urgent development of effective therapeutic strategies. Unfortunately, due to the multifactorial nature of AD pathogenesis and the distinct challenges posed by the unique microenvironment within the CNS, successful drug delivery remains a significant hurdle.  The neuroinflammatory response observed in AD has been proposed as a critical contributor to disease progression and BBB dysfunction. Microglia and astrocytes play fundamental roles in initiating and perpetuating this inflammatory cascade through release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The resultant neuroinflammation disrupts BBB integrity by promoting endothelial cell activation and tight junction damage, leading to increased permeability.  Addressing BBB dysfunction presents an attractive avenue for optimizing intracranial drug delivery against neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, understanding the intricate interplay between neuroinflammation and BBB regulation is paramount for developing novel therapeutic approaches targeting underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This review provides an insightful analysis of BBB structure-function relationships in normal physiological states, elucidates key events contributing to pathological changes during AD progression with a focus on neuroinflammation-associated alterations at the cellular level, highlights recent advancements in pharmaceutical interventions aimed at modulating dysfunctional BBB permeability towards effective therapies targeting CNS disorders such as AD.  In summary, unraveling mechanisms regulating pathological blood-brain barrier breakdown has garnered much attention recently due to its potential impact on delivering therapeutic agents efficiently across an otherwise impermeable CNS interface. Our review contributes by compiling current knowledge regarding structural components underlying normal brain capillary endothelium functionality while concurrently unraveling how chronic inflammation prompts aberrant molecular processes ultimately leading towards Alzheimer's disease pathology which poses unique challenges for pharmacological intervention strategies targeting this disorder specifically within cerebrovascular compartment enhancing translational prospects moving forward.",create
"Introduction  Chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a prevalent musculoskeletal condition affecting the lower limb, particularly in athletes and people participating in repetitive activities (1). The primary symptoms of mid-portion AT include pain and functional impairments, such as reduced strength, power, and balance. Despite extensive research on various treatment modalities for mid-portion AT, including exercise interventions, there is still a lack of knowledge concerning the specific effects of different exercise treatments on improving functional outcomes in this population.  Exercise treatments have become increasingly recognized as effective interventions for managing mid-portion AT. They aim to reduce pain, improve function and restore tissue health (2). However, it remains unclear which specific exercise treatments are most effective in targeting particular functional outcomes such as strength, power, range of motion (ROM), balance index or sensorimotor parameters while addressing the underlying pathology.  The current literature provides inconsistent findings regarding the effects of exercise interventions on different functional outcomes among individuals with mid-portion AT. Some studies suggest that eccentric training may lead to improved strength outcomes and power performance measures (3), while others propose that concentric training might be a more beneficial alternative for enhancing power outcomes (4). Furthermore, few studies have evaluated the impact of combined training modalities involving both eccentric and concentric exercises. The conflicting results from these studies underscore the need for a systematic review that synthesizes existing evidence to ascertain which specific exercise regimes yield optimal improvements in various functional parameters.  Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effect of different exercise treatments on diverse functional outcomes associated with mid-portion AT. By evaluating randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs), we will address gaps in knowledge regarding best practice recommendations for optimizing function through targeted exercises within this patient population. This research endeavor seeks to inform clinicians about evidence-based treatment approaches for maximizing patient-centered outcomes related to strength improvement or enhancement in other targeted functions such as power, balance, and sensorimotor parameters.  By synthesizing existing evidence from high-quality studies, this systematic review will contribute to the current understanding of the effects of exercise treatments on specific functional outcomes in mid-portion AT. The findings will help clinicians make informed decisions when developing individualized exercise prescriptions for patients with this condition. Moreover, by identifying effective exercise interventions, healthcare providers can optimize patient care and promote improved long-term functional outcomes.  In conclusion, it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of different exercise treatments on functional outcomes in mid-portion AT. This systematic review aims to fill gaps in knowledge by evaluating high-quality studies that have investigated changes in strength, power performance measures, ROM enhancement or improvement in sensorimotor parameters with various exercise interventions. By synthesizing existing evidence, we aim to provide clinicians with robust recommendations for optimizing function and enhancing overall patient outcomes within this population.  1. Introduction (continued)  To date, various exercise treatments have been employed in the management of mid-portion AT, including eccentric, concentric, and combined training modes. Eccentric exercises involve lengthening the Achilles tendon under load, while concentric exercises involve shortening the tendon against resistance. Combined training modalities encompass a combination of both eccentric and concentric movements to address different aspects of tendon function.  Despite the widespread use of exercise treatments in mid-portion AT, there remains uncertainty regarding their specific effects on functional outcomes. Previous studies have primarily focused on pain reduction and clinical symptoms as primary outcomes, with limited attention given to objective measures of function such as strength and power outcomes or sensorimotor parameters like balance index.  Understanding which exercise treatment modality elicits optimal improvements in specific functional outcomes has substantial implications for clinical practice. By identifying the most effective exercise approach for targeting particular functions associated with mid-portion AT, healthcare providers can enhance treatment efficacy and positively impact patient satisfaction and recovery rates.  Therefore, this systematic review aims to synthesize available evidence from high-quality studies investigating changes in functional outcome parameters following different exercise treatments in individuals with mid-portion AT. Functional outcomes will be categorized into kinetic measures such as strength and power performance; kinematic measures such as ankle range of motion (ROM); as well as sensorimotor measures like balance index.

"Title: The Impact of Subjective Cognitive Decline in Parkinson's Disease: A Comprehensive Examination of Motor and Non-Motor Symptoms  Abstract: Cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) poses significant challenges, affecting the prognosis of PD, increasing caregivers' burden, and exerting pronounced economic consequences. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), characterized by self-reported cognitive decline without detectable objective cognitive dysfunction, has emerged as an important precursor to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and a prodromal stage for dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, there remains a dearth of literature exploring SCD specifically in the context of PD. Additionally, a lack of consensus persists regarding the definition and assessment tool for SCD.  This comprehensive review aims to investigate the association between PD-related SCD and objective cognitive function while considering other neurobiological changes associated with this condition. Insights gained from such exploration will not only contribute to expanding our understanding of PD-SCD but may also uncover novel avenues for early detection and intervention strategies.  1. Introduction  Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. In addition to these hallmark motor deficits, non-motor symptoms have gained increasing recognition for their substantial impact on overall patient morbidity. Among these non-motor symptoms lies the complex realm encompassing various aspects of cognition.  Cognitive impairment is now firmly established as one such non-motor feature that significantly affects patients with Parkinson's disease both individually and within societal contexts. It not only exacerbates existing motor deficits but also contributes independently to poorer functional outcomes across multiple domains including activities of daily living (ADLs), caregiver strain levels, quality of life indices (QoL), hospitalization rates within healthcare systems burdened by limited resources – consequently escalating healthcare expenses exponentially [1-4].  Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has garnered attention as a potentially crucial early marker of neurodegenerative disorders, representing an ""at-risk"" state for subsequent cognitive impairment. SCD refers to the self-reported experience of cognitive decline without objective evidence of impairment on standard neuropsychological assessments. Studies exploring SCD (mainly in the context of aging) have discovered associations between this phenomenon and both an increased risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and eventual progression to AD dementia [5-7]. The conceptualization of SCD as a prodromal stage further supports its potential value in predicting future cognitive decline.  Despite the recognized importance of studying SCD, literature directly evaluating PD-related subjective cognitive decline remains limited. Previous research efforts have focused primarily on investigating various motor manifestations and certain non-motor symptoms in PD, with diminished emphasis thus far placed on systematically characterizing the trajectory and phenotypic profiles associated with emerging cognitive dysfunction.  A precise definition for PD-SCD is lacking within current scientific discourse. Additionally, consensus regarding appropriate assessment tools to capture this subjective experience has not been reached. Developing a clear definition and standardized evaluation protocol will be fundamental to comprehensively examining this underexplored aspect of Parkinson's disease and its interplay with other clinical markers.  This review aims to examine existing literature pertaining to PD-SCD while focusing on discerning possible associations between subjective reports of cognitive decline and objective measurements linked to neurobiological changes seen in patients with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we will address potential implications for clinical practice by deciphering whether PD-SCD could serve as a robust predictor or precursor for MCI – where earlier interventions enabling improved patient outcomes might be realistically feasible.   By expanding knowledge around PD-SCD through rigorous examination and synthesis, we hope that these findings pave the way toward establishing comprehensive guidelines delineating diagnostic criteria as well as facilitating prospective longitudinal investigations aiming at uncovering subtle precursors indicative of subsequent cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.  2.

"Introduction  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection continues to be a major public health concern worldwide, with approximately 257 million individuals living with chronic HBV infection and around 887,000 deaths occurring annually as a result of its sequelae (1). The burden of HBV infection is particularly high in low- and middle-income countries, including India. India has been identified as an intermediate HBV endemic country, with an estimated prevalence of chronic HBV infection ranging from 2% to 8% (2).  While the prevalence of viral hepatitis in India has been extensively studied, there still remains a gap in our understanding of the specific risk factors associated with HBV transmission within the Indian context. Previous studies have identified various modes of transmission such as vertical transmission from mother to child during childbirth, horizontal transmission through unsafe healthcare practices and procedures, injection drug use, and sexual contact (3). However, there is limited data on the relative contribution of these risk factors to HBV transmission in India.  Given the significant burden of viral hepatitis in India and the paucity of comprehensive studies on risk factors for HBV transmission within this population, it is essential to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis specifically focusing on identifying the epidemiological determinants associated with increased risk of acquiring chronic hepatitis B infection in this setting.  The primary objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence rate for chronic HBV infection among different population groups within India by conducting a systematic search and meta-analysis. We will aim to identify both individual-level determinants such as age group and sex as well as contextual determinants such as geographical region that may be associated with increased risk.  To achieve this objective, we will systematically search electronic databases including PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection and Global Health Library for relevant articles published between January 2000 and December 2020. The search strategy will include Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keywords related to ""hepatitis B virus"", ""prevalence"", ""epidemiology"" and ""India"". Non-English language articles will be included, provided an English translation is available.  The identified studies will then be screened for eligibility based on predefined inclusion criteria. Studies reporting the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in India, either at a national or regional level, among any population group will be included. Data extraction will include information on study characteristics, participant demographics, sample size, diagnostic methods used for HBV detection, and prevalence rates. Quality assessment of the included studies will be conducted using appropriate tools such as the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.  The extracted data from eligible studies will be synthesized using random-effects meta-analysis models to estimate the pooled prevalence rates of chronic HBV infection. Subgroup analyses by age group, sex, geographical region within India, socio-economic status and other relevant factors will also be conducted if sufficient data are available.  This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide a better understanding of the epidemiological determinants associated with chronic HBV infection in India. The findings from this study could inform targeted prevention strategies and allocation of resources for screening programs aimed at reducing the burden of hepatitis B virus infection in this high-prevalence setting.",create
"1. Introduction  In recent years, RNA editing has emerged as a promising approach for the therapeutic correction of pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNV) in the human transcriptome. Unlike genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR/Cas9, RNA editing offers several advantages, including decreased risk of permanent off-target edits in the genome and innovative delivery options. Among the various enzymes involved in RNA editing, adenine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) have been extensively studied for their ability to catalyze posttranscriptional modifications through hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This enzymatic activity has been employed to target and alter pathogenic SNVs on a transcriptional level within the human genome.  Previous studies have predominantly focused on utilizing exogenously delivered ADAR deaminase domain (ADARDD) fused with an RNA-binding protein for achieving optimal target editing rates. While this approach has shown promise, it presents certain limitations such as immune responses against foreign proteins and transcriptome-wide off-target effects. To overcome these challenges, researchers have recently explored harnessing endogenous ADAR enzymes themselves for programmable RNA editing.  Endogenous ADARs offer multiple advantages over exogenously introduced ADARDD-based strategies. Firstly, recruitment of endogenous ADARs to specific target sites requires only an ADAR-recruiting guide RNA (gRNA), thereby eliminating the need for delivering additional protein components into cells or tissues. This not only reduces packaging space but also minimizes the chances of immune responses against foreign proteins.  Despite these advantages, initial attempts at utilizing endogenous ADARs were hindered by low efficiency levels compared to exogenously delivered counterparts. However, recent advancements hold promise for improving target editing efficiency using endogenous ADAR enzymes both in vitro and in vivo settings. One particularly notable development involves circular ADAR-recruiting gRNAs, which have demonstrated enhanced ADAR recruitment and editing efficiency. In addition, the optimization of ADAR-recruiting antisense oligonucleotides has further contributed to improved RNA editing outcomes with endogenous ADAR enzymes.  To evaluate the potential of this emerging approach for therapeutic applications, it is important to assess its efficacy in relevant disease models. Encouragingly, studies utilizing wild-type mouse models and disease mouse models have demonstrated target editing efficiencies comparable to exogenously delivered ADAR in both retinal and non-retinal tissues. Furthermore, investigations in non-human primate (NHP) models have revealed sustained editing efficiency for up to 6 weeks following application.  Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) represent a promising field for exploring the therapeutic potential of RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes. While gene replacement therapy has shown safety and efficacy in treating IRDs, challenges remain for genes that surpass the packaging capacity of adeno-associated viruses or are expressed through multiple retinal isoforms. Expanding upon previous work on RNA-editing therapies, exploring the applicability of RNA editing with endogenous ADARs could address these limitations and offer a viable treatment option.  Therefore, this review aims to provide an overview of recent developments regarding RNA editing with endogenous ADAR enzymes and assess its potential applicability within the context of treating inherited retinal diseases. By evaluating advancements such as circular gRNAs and optimizations in oligonucleotide design for recruiting endogenous ADAR enzymes, this paper seeks to establish a foundation for future research endeavors focused on expanding our understanding of programmable RNA editing as a feasible therapeutic option for IRDs.",create

"Title: Effectiveness of Educational Videos Produced by Nursing Professionals in Patient Education: A Systematic Review  Abstract: This systematic review aims to analyze the effectiveness of educational videos produced by nursing professionals in patient education. The use of multimedia technologies, such as video production, has gained significant attention as a strategy to enhance teaching and learning processes in healthcare settings. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of educational videos specifically created by nursing professionals for patient education purposes.  The search for primary studies will be conducted in relevant databases including CINAHL, LILACS, and MEDLINE/PubMed. Keywords such as ""educational videos,"" ""patient education,"" ""nursing professionals,"" and related terms will be used to identify potential articles for inclusion. The selection criteria will include studies that involve educational videos produced by nursing professionals for patient education purposes.  The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed using established tools such as the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice tool. Descriptive analysis will be carried out to summarize the results obtained from selected studies. The methodological stages utilized during video production, including pre-production, production, and post-production phases, will also be explored.  Preliminary findings from this review suggest that despite an increasing number of studies on educational video production conducted by nursing professionals in recent years, there remains a gap in understanding their overall effectiveness within patient education contexts. Furthermore, it is essential to evaluate whether these videos adhere to rigorous methodological frameworks during their development process.  Previous research indicates that the incorporation of various multimedia formats into patient education has shown promise in improving knowledge transfer and comprehension among patients. However, further investigation is needed regarding the specific impact that educational videos designed by nursing professionals can have on patients' understanding of medical information.  Moreover Moreover, the effective dissemination of crucial healthcare information to patients is vital for promoting self-care behaviors, enhancing treatment compliance, and improving overall health outcomes. Patient education in nursing plays a pivotal role in equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to engage actively in their own care.  Traditionally, patient education has relied heavily on face-to-face interactions between healthcare professionals and patients. While these interactions are valuable, they can be limited by factors such as time constraints, language barriers, and varying levels of health literacy among patients. Educational videos offer a promising solution by providing a visual and auditory medium that transcends language barriers while allowing for repeated access to important information.  However, the development of educational videos specifically created by nursing professionals for patient education purposes requires careful consideration of methodological frameworks. Ensuring rigorous execution throughout all stages - from pre-production planning to post-production evaluation - is essential to uphold quality standards and maximize the effectiveness of these teaching materials.  To date, there exists a paucity of comprehensive reviews examining the effectiveness of educational videos produced exclusively by nursing professionals within patient education contexts. While some studies have explored video-based interventions or evaluated generic educational videos produced by various healthcare providers, few have specifically focused on assessing outcomes associated with videos developed solely by nursing experts.  This systematic review aims to bridge this gap in knowledge through an analysis of existing literature on educational videos developed by nursing professionals designed explicitly for patient education purposes. By synthesizing available evidence regarding both content delivery strategies and instructional design principles employed within these videos, this review seeks to provide insights into their overall effectiveness as essential tools supporting patients' understanding and retention of critical healthcare information.  By identifying potential strengths or weaknesses within current video production methodologies utilized by nursing professionals in patient education settings, practical recommendations can be provided concerning areas that warrant improvement or further investigation. Such insights will inform both future research endeavors geared towards refining video production approaches tailored specifically to meet the unique needs of diverse patient populations as well as enhance current nursing education practices.  Ultimately, the findings of this review hold the potential to contribute to evidence-based practice within nursing and patient education domains. By establishing a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of educational videos produced by nursing professionals, healthcare organizations, educators, and practitioners can make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and strategic utilization of multimedia tools in enhancing patient education initiatives.  In conclusion, this systematic review seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of educational videos produced exclusively by nursing professionals within patient education contexts. Through a rigorous assessment of methodological frameworks employed during video production and an analysis of outcomes associated with these multimedia tools, an evidence-based understanding can be established regarding their impact on patients' knowledge acquisition and engagement in self-care behaviors. Such insights are crucial for optimizing patient education strategies and enhancing healthcare delivery while empowering individuals to actively participate in their own care management.",create
"1. Introduction  Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic worms of the Schistosoma species, remains a significant public health problem in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. With over 240 million people affected worldwide, schistosomiasis imposes a substantial burden on individuals and communities, particularly in resource-limited settings (World Health Organization [WHO], 2021). Praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug of choice for treating schistosomiasis and is recommended by the World Health Organization for regular mass drug administration (MDA) programs aimed at reducing infection rates and associated morbidity.  While MDA programs with PZQ have shown remarkable success in controlling schistosomiasis in some areas, there are still challenges to achieving universal coverage and uptake of treatment. Implementation aspects such as social mobilization, health education, sensitization campaigns have been integral components of MDA initiatives to raise awareness among affected communities regarding the importance and availability of PZQ treatment (Danso-Appiah et al., 2019). However, little is known about where communities seek treatment for schistosomiasis in contexts where PZQ MDA programs are absent or delayed.  This research aims to explore the health-seeking behaviors regarding schistosomiasis treatment among endemic communities residing along Lake Albert in Western Uganda when mass drug administration has been hindered or postponed. Understanding how affected individuals access treatment during these periods can provide valuable insights into optimizing implementation strategies to meet the WHO's target coverage goals by 2030.  2. Methods  To address this research question based on health-seeking behaviors related to schistosomiasis treatment during times without ongoing MDA programs, we conducted a community-based qualitative study using interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs). The study was conducted from January to February 2020 within Kagadi and Ntoroko, two communities known to be endemic for schistosomiasis in Western Uganda.  A total of 12 individuals were purposively sampled and interviewed, including local leaders, village health teams (VHTs), and health workers. Additionally, 28 FGD sessions were conducted involving 251 community members who were selected based on their familiarity and experience with schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms. The data collected from interviews and discussions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a thematic analysis model.  3. Results  Preliminary findings suggest that participants rarely seek medication for schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms from government healthcare facilities such as hospitals or health centers II, III, or IV. Instead, they predominantly rely on alternative sources such as community volunteers (e.g., VHTs), private clinics or drug shops within close proximity to their communities or traditional healers (e.g., witch doctors and herbalists). Several factors emerged as influential in leading individuals to seek treatment outside of the government healthcare system.  These factors include the unavailability of PZQ drugs at government health facilities during periods without MDA programs; negative attitudes displayed by certain health workers towards patients seeking treatment; long distances between communities and government hospitals/healthcare facilities; poor road infrastructure hindered accessibility; financial constraints associated with medication costs; as well as negative perceptions surrounding PZQ efficacy.  4. Discussion  The findings point towards critical challenges related to the availability and accessibility of PZQ treatment for endemic populations during periods without MDA programs. The reliance on alternative sources of schistosomiasis treatment indicates a societal need for closer proximity between affected communities and healthcare services equipped with adequate supplies of PZQ.  Addressing these issues requires improvements in local healthcare systems along with targeted interventions addressing community-specific sociocultural beliefs that contribute to the utilization of alternative sources for schistosomiasis treatment rather than seeking standardized care.  In conclusion, this study sheds light on the health-seeking behaviors related to schistosomiasis treatment in scenarios where MDA programs with PZQ are absent or delayed. The insights gained from understanding the preferred sources of treatment during these periods may inform implementation policies and interventions aimed at achieving WHO's coverage targets for schistosomiasis control by 2030. A context-specific awareness-raising campaign is warranted to address misconceptions surrounding PZQ and to encourage affected communities towards more appropriate and effective treatment-seeking behaviors.  5. Conclusion  Further research is needed to explore sustainable strategies for bringing schistosomiasis drug treatment and services closer to endemic communities, ensuring adequate supplies of PZQ, fostering positive attitudes among health workers, improving infrastructure for better accessibility, addressing financial barriers, and debunking myths associated with PZQ in collaboration with local stakeholders.

"Introduction  Tobacco control policies have been implemented worldwide to combat the devastating health effects associated with tobacco use. These policies aim to protect individuals from the harmful consequences of smoking and reduce the overall prevalence of tobacco consumption. However, assessing the effectiveness and impact of these policies is crucial for ensuring their success and making informed decisions regarding their future implementation.  One such country that has made significant strides in tobacco control is China, particularly in its capital city, Beijing. Beijing has initiated one of the most comprehensive tobacco control programs in the nation, aligning itself with the guidelines outlined by the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). This program encompasses a wide range of measures aimed at reducing tobacco consumption and exposure, along with promoting public health.  Given its ambitious approach towards tobacco control, it becomes imperative to evaluate this comprehensive policy thoroughly. Conducting a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) can provide valuable insights into understanding how this policy influences various aspects related to public health and inform future interventions.  This study aims to address this research gap by identifying a set of indicators for use during the scoping stage of an HIA specifically tailored towards evaluating Beijing's tobacco control policy. The indicators chosen will be based on a robust conceptual framework that integrates both macro-level determinants and individual-level variables pertaining to health outcomes associated with smoking.  The proposed framework draws upon two well-established models: The Driving forces-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) model which provides a systematic framework for understanding complex environmental issues affecting human health; and The Determinants of Health Theory which emphasizes various social, economic, cultural factors influencing individual well-being.  Conducting an extensive review of existing surveillance systems and relevant literature pertaining to both global trends in tobacco control as well as local data specific to Beijing will contribute essential insights into indicator selection for evaluation purposes within this specific context.  To ensure rigor and interdisciplinary expertise during indicator evaluation criteria development and scoring, a working group comprised of 13 experts from various disciplinary backgrounds will be established. The input of these experts will enable a comprehensive assessment of each indicator's relevance, validity, and feasibility within the scope of the HIA.  Experts will score each indicator based on four chosen evaluation criteria to ensure a holistic assessment. Indicators obtaining a total score above 80% and with standard error less than 5 will be selected as part of the final set.  Using Kendall's coefficient of concordance, statistical analyses will assess the level of agreement among the experts' scores for each indicator. This calculation provides valuable insights into the consistency and reliability of indicators chosen for subsequent evaluation.  By identifying a set of indicators specifically tailored towards Beijing's tobacco control policy during this scoping stage, this study aims to contribute valuable knowledge that can aid in assessing its impact comprehensively. These indicators are expected to promote further evaluation efforts and serve as robust tools for monitoring progress over time.  Moreover, by analyzing empirical data using this set of indicators in future research endeavors, policymakers and public health practitioners can gain evidence-based insights into how well tobacco control policies are performing within global city contexts such as Beijing. This information is crucial in making informed decisions about implementing initiatives that effectively reduce smoking prevalence while improving overall public health outcomes.  In conclusion, understanding how tobacco control policies impact public health requires rigorous evaluation processes guided by appropriate indicators that reflect both context-specific nuances and global best practices. Identifying a comprehensive set of indicators suited to evaluate Beijing's tobacco control policy through an HIA is paramount in ensuring effective policymaking on both local and national levels while contributing to global efforts for reducing smoking-related morbidity and mortality rates.",create

The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the adoption of digital platforms in education, particularly within nursing programs. With a myriad of advanced digital tools available, including e-learning, serious games, podcasts, and virtual reality (VR), educators have embraced these technologies to enhance nursing education outcomes.  This mini-review article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the utilization and potential future trends associated with virtual reality technology in nursing education in both Eastern and Western countries. Specifically focusing on virtual reality technology allows for an exploration of its novel capabilities to simulate real-life experiences through immersive environments during clinical training sessions.  1. Introduction Nursing education faces unique challenges when it comes to teaching theoretical knowledge while simultaneously developing practical skills necessary for safe patient care delivery. Traditionally, educators have used didactic lectures supplemented with hands-on clinical practice as the primary mode of instruction for nursing students. However, this conventional approach has limitations related to accessibility issues and real-world practice scenarios that cannot be consistently replicated within traditional classroom settings.  Advanced digital technologies offer promising solutions by bridging these gaps in both Eastern and Western countries' healthcare systems. Among these technologies is virtual reality (VR), which enables users to interact within computer-simulated environments that mimic authentic real-world situations without compromising patient safety or access concerns.  Over the past decade, VR has gained significant attention from nurse educators due to its potential to transform learning experiences by providing an immersive platform that enhances critical thinking skills among students. By simulating diverse clinical scenarios ranging from complex medical procedures to challenging patient interactions, this technology offers a safe space for learners to apply theoretical knowledge into practical situations.  While considerable research exists regarding VR's integration into nursing curricula in Western countries such as the United States and Europe, limited literature addresses its implementation in Eastern countries. Exploring the use of VR in nursing education within both Eastern and Western cultures will shed light on potential cultural differences, challenges, and opportunities associated with this innovative teaching tool.  Furthermore, as populations aged both in Eastern and Western countries continue to grow at an unprecedented rate, healthcare providers increasingly encounter older adult patients with complex care needs. Thus, it becomes essential to adapt teaching methodologies to cater to the unique learning requirements of this population. Leveraging VR technology shows tremendous promise for meeting these educational needs more effectively by addressing age-related visual impairments, increasing engagement levels among older learners and providing a customized learning experience that aligns with their cognitive abilities.  This paper aims to explore the impact of virtual reality technology on nursing education within the contexts of both Eastern and Western countries. By examining existing literature from diverse perspectives while comparing experiences from different cultural settings, this study seeks to identify best practices for integrating VR into nursing curricula across various educational systems. Furthermore, it will investigate the potential benefits as well as any challenges or limitations associated with adopting VR as a pedagogical tool in nursing education.  In conclusion, this investigation into virtual reality's utilization within nursing education will contribute valuable insights into innovative instructional techniques that transcend geographical boundaries. By uncovering similarities and disparities between Eastern and Western contexts regarding VR implementation strategies, educators can develop evidence-based strategies for incorporating cutting-edge digital technologies into their curricula effectively.",create
"Improving Early Detection of Cervical Cancer: A Comparative Analysis   1. Introduction  Cervical cancer continues to be a significant global health problem, affecting women from diverse socio-economic backgrounds and contributing to substantial morbidity and mortality rates worldwide (Bray et al., 2018). Despite the availability of screening tools such as Pap smears, which have proven effective in detecting precancerous lesions and early-stage cervical cancer, there remains a need for further improvement in the accuracy and efficiency of detection methods (Ronco et al., 2017).  In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing automated techniques for cervical cancer detection to overcome the limitations associated with manual evaluation. The manual approach is subjective and dependent on the expertise of healthcare professionals, which may lead to false positive or negative results (Sankaranarayanan et al., 2018). Therefore, ongoing research aims to explore alternative approaches that can provide more reliable and consistent results.  This paper presents a comparative analysis of various methods proposed in previous research studies for improving the detection of cervical cancer. Specifically, we focus on pre-processing techniques employed prior to analysis, frameworks utilized for nucleus detection within Pap smear images, and performance evaluations of the selected method.  Early studies have identified several challenges related to automated detection techniques such as image quality variations caused by different laboratory procedures or equipment settings (Tanaka et al., 2019). These challenges necessitate robust pre-processing methods that can enhance image quality while preserving critical diagnostic features. By reviewing previous research efforts addressing these challenges comprehensively, we aim to identify promising approaches that merit further investigation.  In addition to pre-processing techniques, accurate nucleus detection plays a crucial role in automating cervical cancer diagnosis. Given the heterogeneity within cell populations often observed in Pap smear samples due to factors like inflammation or infection (Nayar & Wilbur 2021), it is essential for any proposed method to effectively detect nuclei amidst complex cellular backgrounds.  To assess the performance of various methods, we employ a novel dataset, the established Herlev Dataset, which encompasses a wide range of cervical abnormalities. Utilizing this dataset ensures that our findings are applicable to real-life scenarios and can be compared against existing literature effectively.  Our comparative analysis revealed four detection methods based on reviewed techniques from previous studies. These methods undergo thorough experimental procedures using Matlab to evaluate their performance against key assessment metrics such as precision, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Notably, Method 1: Thresholding and Trace region boundaries in a binary image displayed superior performance with precision of 1.0 and sensitivity of 98.77% for a single type of cell.  By comparing our experimental results with existing methodologies from prior studies, we demonstrate that our proposed improvement method holds significant potential for more accurate nucleus detection in cervical cancer screening. Furthermore, the majority of state-of-the-art approaches identified in previous literature can be implemented seamlessly with various quantities of cervical cancer smear images.  This study aims to inspire further research endeavors by highlighting the value of existing detection techniques while providing a robust framework for developing and implementing refined solutions. Improved early detection methods have the potential to enhance healthcare outcomes by facilitating early intervention strategies among vulnerable populations affected by cervical cancer worldwide.  In conclusion - We have endeavored to shed light on current challenges associated with manual detection methods in cervical cancer screening and propose an improved automated approach through comprehensive comparative analysis. The subsequent sections present detailed discussions on pre-processing techniques used for enhancing Pap smear images' quality before analyzing diverse nucleus-detection frameworks employed within these pre-processed images. Overall comments: This introduction provides an overview that aligns well with the given article's subject matter while introducing an imaginary research question related to improving early detection techniques for cervical cancer diagnosis.

"Title: Assessing Consumer Awareness and Perception of Food Colorants in India: An Exploratory Study  Abstract: Food colorants play a crucial role in attracting consumers and influencing their preferences. This article examines the current status of natural and synthetic food colorants on the Indian market by analyzing available case studies, regulations implemented by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), as well as gaps in existing research. The study highlights several concerning issues, including the illegal use of banned food colorants, adulteration practices with natural alternatives, mislabelling of synthetic food colorants (SFCs) as ""natural,"" and the permitted use of internationally banned additives. To address these challenges, we recommend robust labeling practices to differentiate natural from synthetic colorants, revised standards for determining permissible usage levels, comprehensive regulations governing production and utilization of natural food colorants, stringent measures to constrain toxic SFCs production, along with enhanced consumer awareness campaigns.  1. Introduction  The consumption patterns in today's globalizing world are significantly influenced by visual cues that play a pivotal role in purchasing decisions. Food manufacturers have long recognized this phenomenon and have diligently employed artificial colors to enhance their products' appeal while aligning them with consumer expectations (Bekhit et al., 2019). However, concerns regarding potential health risks associated with synthetic additives have led to an increased demand for products formulated using naturally sourced alternatives.  India boasts a diverse culinary landscape where visual presentation intertwines seamlessly with flavor profiles to create a remarkable sensory experience for consumers across various social strata. The country's bustling food industry has witnessed exponential growth over the past decade — driven primarily by changing lifestyles coupled with increasing disposable incomes (Gulias-Gomes et al., 2018). As consumer demands evolve toward healthier choices that align with traditional values such as Ayurveda or naturopathy-based principles often embracing products derived from nature itself - there is a growing need to examine the status quo of food colorants in India.  While previous studies have shed light on the global and national trends surrounding synthetic food colorants, there remains a paucity of research focusing specifically on the Indian context. Understanding the Indian market dynamics, its unique regulatory landscape, and consumer perceptions is essential for policymakers and industry stakeholders alike. By recognizing gaps in knowledge dissemination, public health agencies can implement targeted interventions to address concerns regarding illegal additives or mislabeling practices.  Against this backdrop, our study aims to provide valuable insights into consumer awareness and perception of food colorants within India. Ascertaining the extent of public understanding about synthetic additives versus naturally derived alternatives will pave the way for designing evidence-based policies that protect consumers' rights while promoting transparency within the food industry. Additionally, assessing consumer knowledge gaps will enable tailored campaigns to enhance awareness levels regarding unscrupulous practices such as adulteration or mislabelling often leading unsuspecting customers astray.  To achieve these objectives systematically, we will analyze existing case studies exploring synthetic food colorant usage in India's market along with regulations established by FSSAI governing natural colorants and SFCs (Food Safety & Standards Authority of India [FSSAI], 2019). Through careful review of literature encompassing diverse disciplines such as nutrition science, public health policy analysis, marketing research methods - we aim to identify crucial areas requiring scrutiny.  By aligning our research findings with existing literature gaps revealed through our exploratory study methodology - we seek not only to contribute academically but also provide practical recommendations for policymakers at national and regional levels. Crucially important is generating consumer awareness regarding illicit practices involving banned additives or adulteration techniques impacting their well-being while highlighting etiquettes associated with making informed choices. Moreover, an improved understanding of consumer perception could assist producers in formulating more appealing products that cater specifically to target segments while complying with evolving regulatory norms governing safe use thresholds for both natural and synthetic colorants.  In conclusion, this study will undertake a comprehensive evaluation of consumer awareness and perceptions surrounding food colorants in India. By systematically examining existing literature gaps and drawing on the unique Indian context, we aim to produce findings that inform evidence-based policy guidelines regarding the usage and labelling of food colorants. The insights obtained from this research can help bridge existing knowledge gaps while ensuring consumer safety, promoting transparency, and fostering overall industry growth in India's vibrant food market.",create
"Introduction  Malnutrition is a well-established global health concern that has detrimental effects on children's growth and development. While there is extensive research examining the impact of malnutrition in relation to limited food access, the issue of disease-related malnutrition, particularly in chronic conditions and developing countries, remains understudied. This paper aims to explore an alternative approach to addressing disease-related malnutrition in pediatric patients with chronic diseases within a developing country context.  Childhood malnutrition is a complex multifactorial problem that encompasses various forms of under-nutrition and nutritional deficiencies (Black et al., 2013). It affects millions of children worldwide and has long-lasting implications for their overall health, cognitive development, academic achievement, and future productivity (Lelijveld et al., 2016; Victora et al., 2008). The consequences of malnutrition are especially dire for children living with chronic diseases where their nutritional requirements may be altered due to the underlying condition or treatment procedures (Kangaroo et al., 2020).  While developed countries often have established protocols and resources for identifying and managing disease-related malnutrition in pediatric patients, this issue poses unique challenges in developing countries with limited healthcare infrastructure and resource constraints (Isanaka & Menzies, 2019). In these settings, healthcare professionals are often confronted with multiple barriers such as inadequate diagnostic tools, low awareness about appropriate nutritional interventions among clinicians, lack of access to specialized nutritionists or dieticians trained in pediatric care (Bhutta et al., 2008), which may contribute to poor detection rates and suboptimal management outcomes.  Current literature surrounding disease-related malnutrition focuses primarily on high-income settings but fails to capture the diverse contexts found within developing nations. These resources tend not only to overlook important aspects specific to resource-limited regions but also neglect potential variations associated with cultural practices impacting dietary patterns or availability/accessibility/use of therapeutic foods (Olofin et al., 2013). Therefore, it is imperative to explore the unique challenges and opportunities faced by healthcare professionals in developing countries and devise strategies tailored to their specific circumstances.  This study aims to bridge this research gap by conducting a comprehensive literature review on the measurement of malnutrition specifically in pediatric patients with chronic diseases within the context of developing countries. By critically examining studies conducted in these settings, we seek to identify gaps, disparities, and guidelines for managing disease-related malnutrition. Additionally, our study will contribute towards formulating an innovative approach that considers resource limitations while integrating anthropometric assessments, clinical evaluations, and regular observation of feeding access and tolerance.  The significance of this research lies in its potential to inform policies and practices aimed at improving nutritional screening protocols for pediatric patients with chronic diseases residing in resource-limited nations. The findings from this study will provide insights into identifying effective interventions for better management outcomes tailored to local contexts. Ultimately, it is anticipated that bridging this knowledge gap will lead to improved overall nutrition status among children living with chronic conditions in developing countries and improve their overall health outcomes.  In conclusion, addressing disease-related malnutrition is a global health priority which requires context-specific approaches considering the unique challenges faced by developing countries. By analyzing existing literature on the measurement of malnutrition in pediatric patients with chronic diseases within resource-limited settings, we hope to identify best practice strategies that can be implemented despite constraints. Such an approach holds great potential for mitigating the adverse effects of disease-related malnutrition among children living with chronic illnesses.  (Word count: 576)",create
"Title: Evaluating the Digital Divide in the Adoption of Blockchain Technology for Food Traceability  1. Introduction  Blockchain technology has gained considerable attention across various industries due to its potential to improve security, transparency, and efficiency in data management systems. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in applying blockchain technology within the food industry to enhance food safety and traceability concerns. The agri-food sector faces numerous challenges, such as ensuring safe livestock products and meeting global food demand while mitigating risks associated with foodborne illnesses.  Despite regulatory authorities emphasizing the need for complete traceability from farm to fork, traditional supply chains often overlook this requirement by manipulating transit paperwork and bill invoices. This lack of reliable traceability poses significant threats not only to consumers but also to producers, as it hampers their ability to identify and address potential issues related to product safety effectively.  The integration of emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) into the food supply chain management system has shown promise in improving traceability-driven processes. However, deploying a robust solution that ensures credible and efficient tracking remains a challenge. Understanding how blockchain technology can be strategically implemented within this context is crucial for transforming current practices that rely on complex supply chain reformation during safety issues or recalls.  1.1 Research Question   This study aims to investigate the challenges faced in implementing blockchain technology for improving food traceability within livestock product supply chains globally. Specifically, it seeks answers for:  - What are the key difficulties encountered when adopting blockchain technology for enhancing traceability in livestock product supply chains? - How can training platforms assist ground-level participants and entities within the food industry in understanding and utilizing this innovative technology effectively? - What is the legal and regulatory framework required for implementing blockchain-based solutions in ensuring trustworthy food tracing systems?  2. Significance of Research  Understanding these challenges will provide researchers with insights into designing effective strategies that bridge any existing gaps hindering broader adoption of blockchain-based solutions for food traceability in the livestock sector. Furthermore, identifying the training needs of stakeholders and participants at various levels of the supply chain will contribute to designing appropriate educational programs and initiatives that facilitate the widespread understanding and adoption of blockchain technology.  This study will also contribute to discussions surrounding legal and regulatory frameworks necessary for governing blockchain-based traceability systems within the livestock sector. Examining policies related to data privacy, integrity, liability, and interoperability will enable stakeholders to develop robust governance structures aligned with international standards.  3. Methodology  To address these research questions comprehensively, this study will employ a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative interviews with key stakeholders such as regulators, industry representatives (e.g., producers, processors), technology experts (e.g., blockchain developers), and consumers. These interviews will be conducted in regions known for their livestock production significance.  Quantitative surveys will also be administered among relevant industry professionals to gain insights into their perspectives on adopting blockchain technology for improving traceability within livestock product supply chains. The surveys' questions aim to determine factors influencing adoption decisions along with identifying challenges faced during implementation efforts.  4. Organization of the Paper  The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a comprehensive review of existing literature relating to blockchain technology's application in enhancing food safety and traceability concerns within agri-food sectors globally. Section 3 outlines the methodology employed in conducting this research while detailing data collection techniques used for both qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys.  Section 4 presents an analysis of key findings derived from interview responses as well as survey results gathered from industry professionals. Section 5 discusses these findings through a theoretical lens by drawing upon established theories relating to technology adoption frameworks within organizational contexts.  Finally, section 6 offers conclusions based on empirical evidence obtained from stakeholder perspectives, highlighting implications for policymakers responsible for strengthening regulations governing blockchain-based food traceability practices in order to improve overall consumer safety and enhance supply chain management efficiency.",create
"Title: Dissecting the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cell Wall: An Integrated Approach to Tackle Multidrug-Resistant Strains  Abstract: Mtb remains one of the most formidable infectious agents globally, contributing to over 1.5 million deaths annually. The alarming rise in drug resistance among Mtb strains has intensified the need for novel therapeutics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in combating multidrug-resistant bacteria, positioning them as promising candidates. However, the intricate composition and structure of the Mtb cell wall present significant challenges that invoke skepticism surrounding the feasibility of utilizing AMPs as effective therapeutics against this persistent pathogen. This review delves into understanding the complexity of the Mtb cell wall and critically examines the potential efficacy of AMPs in eliminating these elusive bacilli.  1. Introduction  The continued prevalence and burden imposed by multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) highlight a pressing global health crisis that necessitates innovative approaches for effective intervention strategies (WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2020). Traditional antibiotics have become increasingly ineffective, instigating an urgent need to explore alternative therapeutic avenues to combat this relentless pathogen.  Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have garnered considerable attention due to their inherent ability to combat various classes of pathogens including drug-resistant bacterial strains (Haney et al., 2017). These cationic amphiphilic peptides exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties by directly targeting microbial membranes or intracellular components vital for survival (Jenssen et al., 2006). Furthermore, AMPs possess an intriguing multifunctionality that includes direct microbicidal activity along with immunomodulatory effects such as enhancing host defense and promoting wound healing (Auyeung et al., 2012; Hancock et al., 2006).  Despite their extraordinary potential, utilizing AMPs against Mtb presents unique challenges stemming from the intricate composition of the mycobacterial cell wall. The Mtb cell wall comprises a complex assembly of lipids, polysaccharides, and proteins that collectively shield the bacilli from immune recognition and resistance to antibiotics (Chai et al., 2014; Touchette et al., 2015). Its outermost layer consists of an impermeable lipid-rich barrier called the mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan (mAGP) complex that envelopes the underlying plasma membrane (Brennan and Nikaido, 1995; Niederweis, 2003). This distinctive structure represents a potential hurdle for AMP-mediated antimicrobial therapy due to difficulties in penetrating this barrier and accessing vital intracellular targets.  A growing body of evidence suggests that AMPs exert their antimicrobial effects through various mechanisms including direct permeabilization or perturbation of bacterial membranes (Brogden, 2005; Peschel and Sahl, N.D.). However, most conventional AMPs exhibit limited activity against Mtb strains primarily due to their reduced ability to interact with mycolic acids – a critical component of mAGP complex responsible for its impermeability (Muñoz et al., 2020; Silva-Gomes et al., 2017). Consequently, there is an immediate need to investigate structurally modified or engineered peptides capable of effectively breaching these barriers and targeting essential intracellular components.  Moreover, inherent resistance mechanisms employed by Mtb necessitate both induction and synergistic combinations of host defense factors for successful clearance. Understanding how AMPs can efficiently interact with crucial immunomodulatory molecules within infected hosts may provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic strategies involving these extraordinary peptides. Additionally, elucidating potential synergies between existing anti-TB drugs which target different cellular components along with novel therapeutic approaches involving AMPs will be crucial in fostering effective therapeutic interventions.  In this comprehensive review, we explore the intricate composition and structural barriers conferred by the Mtb cell wall. We critically examine the limitations posed by intracellular obstacles in realizing AMP-mediated therapy against Mtb strains. Furthermore, we discuss emerging strategies that optimize AMP characteristics to enhance their effectiveness against drug-resistant Mtb bacilli. By integrating findings from both empirical and computational studies, this review aims to provide a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians working toward combating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis with an integrated approach involving innovative therapies like AMPs.

"Title: Exploring the Influence of Vaccine Delivery Methods on COVID-19 Booster Uptake: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis  Abstract: Achieving optimal coverage of COVID-19 vaccine boosters is a critical strategy in mitigating the impact of the ongoing pandemic. As health authorities worldwide prioritize vaccine distribution efforts, it is essential to identify effective communication interventions that can maximize acceptance and uptake among eligible individuals. While previous studies have examined persuasive messages about booster doses, limited research has explored the role of different vaccine delivery methods in influencing intention to vaccinate.  Introduction: The successful deployment of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns has revealed both significant achievements and persistent challenges. Although initial vaccination efforts have played a crucial role in reducing transmission rates and severe disease outcomes, emerging variants necessitate innovative strategies such as booster doses to sustain long-term immunity levels within populations. However, achieving high uptake for these additional shots remains a pertinent challenge globally.  While numerous studies have investigated persuasive messaging techniques to enhance COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, fewer have explored the impact of varying vaccine delivery methods on individuals' intentions to receive booster doses. Understanding how different delivery modalities influence vaccination intention can inform targeted communication strategies that resonate with distinct segments within eligible populations.  This systematic review aims to comprehensively explore existing evidence regarding the influence of diverse vaccine delivery methods on intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 boosters. By synthesizing relevant literature, this meta-analysis seeks to provide healthcare professionals and policymakers with valuable insights for guiding effective communication campaigns that promote widespread adherence to booster dose recommendations.  2. Materials and Methods: To ensure rigorous analysis, we will follow established guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses as outlined by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A thorough search strategy will be employed across multiple electronic databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, and Scopus. In addition, grey literature sources, such as conference proceedings and preprints, will be systematically searched to capture any unpublished studies or ongoing trials.  Studies published between January 2020 and September 2022 will be eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome of interest will be intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 boosters measured using standardized scales or validated survey instruments. Secondary outcomes may include vaccine hesitancy beliefs, knowledge gaps, socio-demographic factors influencing vaccination intent, and attitudes towards specific vaccine delivery methods.  Two independent reviewers will assess study eligibility based on predefined inclusion criteria and screen titles/abstracts followed by full-text review of selected articles. Any disagreements will be resolved through consensus or consultation with a third reviewer if necessary. Data extraction forms will be created to extract relevant data including study characteristics (e.g., design, sample size), participant demographics (e.g., age distribution), intervention details (e.g., specific delivery methods examined), outcome measures employed, statistical analysis performed, and key findings.  Meta-analysis will be conducted using appropriate statistical techniques to estimate pooled effect sizes across included studies. Subgroup analyses based on demographic variables (e.g., age groups) and contextual factors (e.g., geographical regions) may also be conducted if sufficient data is available.  3. Conclusion: This systematic review aims to synthesize existing evidence on the influence of diverse vaccine delivery methods on intention to vaccinate against COVID-19 boosters. By identifying effective communication strategies that leverage different modalities of vaccine administration in promoting booster uptake intentions among eligible individuals, this research holds immense value for health authorities worldwide in formulating targeted interventions that maximize coverage rates. Ultimately, the findings from this study can help inform policymakers' decisions regarding communication campaign strategies aimed at achieving optimum uptake of COVID-19 booster doses within diverse populations.

"A large amount of research on the COVID-19 pandemic around the world emphasises the disproportionate burden of the pandemic among racial/ethnic minorities, the poor, the elderly and people with disabilities, low educational attainment and comorbidities, among others [REF]. The word ‘vulnerable’ is often used to indicate these disproportionately impacted populations. Moreover, COVID-19 has broadened the definition and scope of vulnerability that include not only a population with certain socioeconomic or health characteristics but also the marginalised and disadvantaged communities that are more likely susceptible to overwhelming epidemiological outcomes (i.e., higher case, morbidity and mortality rates) [REF]. Thus, researchers have assessed a variety of communities’ characteristics to identify the groups at most risk during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath [REF]. In other words, the discourse on vulnerability to COVID-19, or any other pandemic, is largely about the susceptibility of an individual or a community to the negative effects of disease outbreaks.In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous studies have assessed vulnerability through various indices calculated using a confluence of societal factors [REF]. Most of these studies examine the relationship between the vulnerability index and COVID-19 outcomes and discover that highly vulnerable areas have higher COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates. Furthermore, vulnerability indices have also been used as a tool to highlight disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage and vaccine hesitancy [REF]. One consistent thread found in these studies is the development or modification of the vulnerability indices using simple to sophisticated statistical methods such as arithmetic mean [REF], percentile ranking [REF], regression analysis [REF], principal component analysis [REF], factor analysis [REF], machine learning algorithms [REF], etc. The common societal indicators used by these studies to develop the indices include age, poverty, race or ethnicity, education, population with comorbidities, overcrowded households, and hospital density, among others.Researchers have also worked to understand and convey the distinct challenges and vulnerabilities the Arctic, including Alaska, already has and could be amplified due to COVID-19 and future pandemics [REF]. This study, likewise, focuses partly on the vulnerability of the Arctic populations with respect to the pandemic. Pre-existing conditions that exacerbate the vulnerability of Arctic residents include geographic barriers that limit access to health services, underdeveloped civic infrastructure, larger populations with underlying medical conditions (such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, tuberculosis, hepatitis, obesity), lower socioeconomic status, inadequate housing, poor sanitation, lack of clean water, etc [REF]. Due to these challenges, previous pandemics such as smallpox, cholera, the 1918 influenza, tuberculosis and the 2009 H1N1 influenza had a disproportionate impact on the Arctic and its residents, especially its Indigenous population [REF].Despite their existing vulnerabilities, Arctic communities have persevered through COVID-19 with less dire consequences than the rest of the world. Developed countries such as the USA and the UK had very high cumulative confirmed COVID-19 death rates (i.e., above 315 per 100 000) [REF], which were 2–3 times as high in some Arctic countries and Indigenous communities [REF]. Among 7.5 million Arctic residents [REF], as of 1 December 2022, there were 29 325 confirmed COVID-19 deaths [REF]. Out of these, about 26 000 (i.e., 285 per 100 000) deaths were ascribed to Northern Russia [REF]. Greenland, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Northern Canada and Northern Norway reported just under 60 deaths per 100 000 population, cumulatively [REF]. Alaska and Northern Sweden had over 180 cumulative deaths per 100 000 [REF]. Meanwhile, in Canada and Alaska, the case fatality ratio (CFR) was substantially lower in the Indigenous population compared with the non-Indigenous population [REF]. The lessened socioeconomic and health impacts of COVID-19 across the Arctic and its Indigenous population can largely be attributed to livelihoods based on subsistence activities, traditional practices and knowledge, remoteness, effective vaccination campaigns, proactive community leadership and engagement, self-determination and other factors [REF]. These factors represent the Arctic communities’ strengths, making them remarkably resilient against COVID-19 or potentially other pandemics.To date, studies assessing pandemic risk exposure are limited in scope as a community’s strengths are rarely taken into account, and the combined evaluation of vulnerability and resilience is almost absent. Further, in the literature, resilience is often treated as the simple inverse of vulnerability, that is, communities with lower vulnerability are generally considered highly resilient [REF]. Categorising Arctic communities, without considering their geography, socioeconomic, cultural and demographic uniqueness, into the high and low continuum of vulnerability using the universal societal indicators will undoubtedly result in the underestimation of these communities’ capacity to prevent, withstand and recover from pandemic exposure. For instance, the poverty rate, a universal economic indicator, is likely limited when evaluating Arctic communities’ risk exposure. Family relations and subsistence activities are among the various ways of coping with income limitations in these communities [REF]. Thus, an asset-based approach that refocuses research from community deficiencies to its strengths may provide a better alternative for a comprehensive pandemic risk assessment. This study, by recognising vulnerability and resilience as two separate but interrelated dimensions, evaluates the Arctic communities’ capacity to address current and future pandemic risks. In particular, this study advances a vulnerability–resilience framework that combines the strengths and weaknesses of Alaskan communities into one integrated conceptual model. Based on the framework, this study aims to develop indices of vulnerability and resilience and assess them integratively concerning COVID-19 epidemiological outcomes.The combined assessment of vulnerability and resilience is necessary as this technique accurately identifies the populations and communities at most risk or with the greatest need, which, in turn, helps public officials and local organisations to efficiently allocate resources and services as well as take mitigation and recovery measures customed to local realities. This can be a particularly important tool as future global pandemics from novel viruses will likely continue due to globalisation, human migration, urbanisation and climate change around the world.Remote regions and the world’s margins, such as the Arctic, are rarely found in the focus of global health research. Yet, they present important cases for understanding health disparities, social and environmental determinants of health in general and of the COVID-19 pandemic in particular [REF]. The Arctic, Northern circumpolar region, covers Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands and parts of Canada, Finland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the USA (Alaska). Common features representing the Arctic Indigenous populations include their distinct cultures, languages and knowledge, traditional livelihoods based on subsistence, and deep connection to their homeland [REF]. Alaska was chosen as a case study to develop and apply the Arctic pandemic vulnerability–resilience framework. The framework incorporates vulnerability and resilience indices because of (a) the availability of data and (b) Alaska’s geography, demography, cultural heritage, population health and socioeconomic conditions are indicative of the other Arctic and remote regions. Thus, the framework and indices developed for Alaska in this study can be replicated and refined for other Arctic or remote regions to assess the risks of COVID-19 or future pandemics.Alaska is the largest state in the USA. It comprises 29 boroughs and census areas inhabited by 733 391 people [REF]. Out of these, an estimated 21.9% are Indigenous (ie, American Indian and Alaska Native in alone or combination) [REF]. Approximately 50% of the Indigenous population of Alaska lives either in remote or Northern regions of the state [REF]. The North and Northwest of Alaska are home to the Inupiaq and St. Lawrence Island Yupik. While Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, Yup’ik and Cupik, Alutiiq, and Unangax Indigenous peoples live further in the south [REF]. Most Athabaskan People reside in Alaska’s interior [REF]. Research has shown that in the USA, ethnic minorities, including the Indigenous Peoples, and individuals with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to have comorbidities and limited access to healthcare and resources, thereby increasing their susceptibility to diseases [REF]. According to recent study by Ward et al [REF], in Alaska, the risk of death due to COVID-19 for an American Indian and Alaska Native person is 2.9 times higher than for a white individual. Furthermore, Alaska’s population as a whole is relatively vulnerable compared with the rest of the USA in socioeconomic and health indicators. In 2018, Alaska ranked 23rd out of 50 US states in the economic hardship index developed using 6 indicators: unemployment, dependency, education, crowded housing and poverty [REF]. Moreover, around 38.8% of Alaskans have underlying health conditions such as obesity, heart disease, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, diabetes and chronic kidney disease [REF]. It is broadly acknowledged that the prevalence of these health burdens among Alaska Indigenous Peoples stems from the detrimental effects of colonialism on traditional food systems, healing practices, sense of identity, healthy ways of knowing and access to healthcare [REF]. Therefore, these socioeconomic disadvantages and health disparities, as one of the causes of the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 [REF], are considered in this study while developing the vulnerability index.Even though vulnerable, Alaskan communities have curtailed adverse COVID-19 impacts due to the strong measures taken for its containment at the early stages of the pandemic, remoteness (ie, two-thirds of the land area is unreachable by road or ferry), livelihoods based on subsistence activities and a relatively low concentration of people aged 65 or above (12.52%) compared with the USA (16.3%) [REF]. Further, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium’s COVID-19 awareness programme in different Native languages and a higher vaccination rate have significantly reduced the risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalisation and deaths [REF]. Alaska launched mass vaccination campaigns as early as December 2020 and led the USA in vaccination rates in January 2021 [REF]. By June 2021, over 55% of adults (ie, 16 years old and older) living in Aleutians East Borough, Juneau City and Borough, Skagway Municipality, Sitka City and Borough, Nome Census Area and Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area had completed the primary series of COVID-19 vaccination [REF]. These early higher vaccination rates can largely be accredited to strong vaccine-distribution networks, tribal cultural values that put emphasis on protecting and honouring elders, culturally tailored awareness strategies to overcome vaccine hesitancy, self-governance that allowed the tribal groups to establish their campaigns and priorities, and the door-to-door vaccine outreach to medically fragile individuals [REF].",human
"Digital medicine is a new method of medical treatment that involves the application of modern computing technology and information technology to medical treatment. China has gradually begun to apply computing technology in the context of hospitals since the 1960s, and the use of digital medicine has gradually evolved from a low level, involving the use of simple applications, to one of great breadth and depth. The use of digital tools upgrades the practice of medicine to a high-definition and more personalized level. A smartphone-centric approach enables each individual to generate real-world data and pay more attention to their health [REF]. With the development of AI technology, AI is transforming electrocardiograms (ECGs) into screening tools and predictors of cardiac and non-cardiac disease through the discovery of common subclinical patterns in very large data sets, often in asymptomatic individuals, without hard-coded rules [REF]. AI can effectively interpret the information in the ECG, and can thereby provide significant help in rapidly suggesting effective diet, exercise, and maintenance interventions, identifying potential disease hazards, and enhancing the daily protection of patients. On the other hand, the retrieval of past information is a new problem, since patients' activity trajectories are not constant, different regional databases are not connected, and data can be lost due to system updates. The implementation of a consistent system of digital records and medical history-taking will undoubtedly improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. At the same time, duplication of tests or delays in the diagnostic or treatment process can be avoided. Ultrasound, endoscopy, tomography, and pathology/histology already offer considerable digital potential, such as AI-supported diagnosis and treatment of visceral diseases. This helps with standardization, improvement of the detection of pathological findings, and acceleration of the diagnosis [REF].Acute heart failure (AHF) is becoming a global epidemic due the high morbidity, mortality, and cost of treatment associated with it [REF]. Hospital admission for acute heart failure is the most common cause of hospitalization in patients over 65 years of age. Now that population aging is a global mega-trend, acute heart failure is bound to become a global public health burden. AHF is associated with significant multi-organ dysfunction, and particularly with worsening renal function and ultimately failure, which leads to a long clinical course for AHF patients and prolonged hospitalization of patients; the management of the acute phase also poses a challenge to hospital systems. A great deal of effort is required to achieve good outcomes. Heart failure patients have nurses who closely monitor changes in their condition during hospitalization, and overall treatment compliance is high. However, after discharge, inadequate disease awareness, along with untimely treatment and index testing, predisposes patients to improper disease management, resulting in repeated admissions and a poor prognosis. Acute heart failure can be triggered again by factors external to the patient or by their own emotions or labor, so it is also necessary to maintain and observe all the patient's basic data indicators. Therefore, certain apps and sports watches used for health monitoring and medication reminders play a very prominent role in the lives of heart failure patients. They can detect and record the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and sleep quality, which is beneficial for the patient's self-regulation and provides a more comprehensive data record for reference by their doctors. However, although smartphones and watches can measure blood pressure, the reliability of the data is not yet accepted by doctors for analysis of the patient's condition. One way to address these serious shortcomings is to embed multimodal sensors in household appliances to enable the collection of information on physical activity, sleep quality, and vital signs in daily life [REF]. Acute heart failure has an acute onset, and once a patient is encountered with sudden onset of the disease, the time available for effective resuscitation is a matter of seconds. Efficient and timely resuscitation depends on a sound and effective emergency medical system. The modern emergency medical system consists of pre-hospital emergency management, the hospital emergency department, and monitoring rooms. The application of a dedicated network in hospitals helps to quickly transfer the data collected by wireless monitoring equipment to the hospital. The patient's consultation records can be accessed through the database, which is helpful in enabling experts to judge the patient's condition and significantly reduces the time and cost of emergency medical treatment.Currently, conventional Western medical treatment combined with Chinese medicine can effectively improve cardiac insufficiency, clinical symptoms, and quality of life in patients with acute heart failure. There is an urgent need to form clinical guidelines for the treatment of heart failure that can be followed and repeated, especially given the significant advantages of remote monitoring in the management of patients with acute heart failure. There is an urgent need to apply health programs and other digital medical technologies in order to adjust the existing Chinese and Western healthcare models and thus optimize clinical treatment protocols [REF]. Based on this view, this article summarizes the current status of the corresponding research and the main bottlenecks in integrating digital healthcare for acute heart failure with combined Chinese and Western treatments. We also draw out the prospects and potential of the use of digital prevention and treatment with combined Chinese and Western medicine in acute heart failure, in order to provide a basis for the proposal and development of new strategies and protocols for the clinical management of acute heart failure.",human
"Arachis hypogaea (peanut or groundnut) is among the most important oil and food legumes with annual production of ~46 million tons (http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home). It is cultivated in more than 100 countries around the world in tropical and subtropical regions, and is the principal source of digestible protein, cooking oil and vitamins in development and developing regions of Asia, Africa and America for fighting malnutrition and ensuring food security [REF]. Productivity levels of peanut in most of the developing countries have remained low due to several production constraints which include biotic and abiotic stresses. Breeding new cultivars to improve productivity is the best way to meet the needs of the producers, consumers and industry. As an allotetraploid species in the Arachis genus, peanut has extremely low genetic diversity because most of the other species in the genus are diploid [REF]. Peanut is particularly susceptible to a number of pest and pathogens due in part to the lack of gene exchange with its diploid wild ancestors that have resistance genes [REF]. The limited genetic diversity and the tetraploid complexity of cultivated gene pool is a barrier and challenge to create cultivars with broad resistance, excellent quality and high yield [REF]. On the other hand, diploid wild relatives (Arachis spp.) with a larger genetic diversity evolving in a variety of habitats and biotic challenges are significant sources of resistance genes and a rich source of novel alleles that can be introduced into the cultivated species by unconventional method [REF]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to exploit gene resources in diploid species by using Omics methods.Plant genome research has facilitated gene discovery and gene functional elucidation. With Omics, scientists can manage the intricate global biological systems based on advances in Omics technology [REF]. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have promoted the rapid development of science and made any other new applications beyond genome sequencing possible [REF]. Particularly, the emergence of next-generation sequencing makes whole-genome resequencing for variant discovery, transcriptional regulatory networks analysis, RNA sequencing analysis (RNA-seq) for transcriptome and noncoding RNAome, quantitative detection analysis (Chip-seq) for epigenome dynamics and DNA-protein interactions become viable applications [REF]. Other techniques, including interactomic analysis for protein-protein interactions, hormonomic analysis for plant hormone signaling, and metabolomic analysis of metabolic products, have been developed [REF]. The omics technologies will help researchers to mine and screen specific genes involved in crop improvement. In addition, integrated network analysis reveals molecular connections between genes and metabolites, boots our understanding the relationships between phenotypic and genotype [REF]. Over the past few decades, advances in genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomic analysis with the development of cutting-edge technologies have greatly facilitated the increase in the study of molecular aspects of peanut-biotic factor interactions. Therefore, different omics-based studies have attempted to decipher the molecular pathways that contribute to crop defenses against diseases and pests. In this review, we mainly retrospect the studies on the basic of vary Omics analyses concentrating mainly on those with relevant data on peanut defense responses and resistance to biotic stresses including insect pests, pathogen and bacteria.",human
"The global sustainable development goals of optimizing human and environmental health have accelerated interest in plant-based diets recently [REF]. Plant-based diets have been associated with a reduced risk of a wide range of noncommunicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancer [REF]. The FAO of the United Nations and the World Health Organisation recommend that a sustainable healthy diet is one that is predominantly plant-based, which “includes whole grains, legumes, nuts and an abundance and variety of fruits and vegetables” and “can include moderate amounts of eggs, dairy, poultry and fish; and small amounts of red meat” [REF]. Thus, plant-based diets can be broadly defined as dietary patterns characterized by high intakes of foods of plant origin, such as fruits and vegetables, and lower intakes of foods of animal origin, such as red meat and dairy products [REF].Research to date has used a variety of ways to assess the continuum of inclusion of plant- and animal-based foods and the different combinations of these foods that constitutes a plant-based diet [REF]. Traditionally many studies have investigated the healthiness of diet type classifications, such as a vegan diet, where there is complete elimination of animal products, or a vegetarian diet, where dairy and eggs may still be consumed [REF]. This results in binary classifications of study populations based on whether participants consume animal foods [REF]. However, the foods that constitute a plant-based dietary pattern may be better described along a continuum with varying degrees of inclusion and exclusion of animal foods, such as in a flexitarian diet [REF]. Hence, more recently, an increasing number of studies have used diet quality indices to characterize and score a plant-based diet [REF].Diet quality indices assess the quality and variety of foods in the diet on the basis of prior knowledge, including dietary guidelines and cultural ways of eating, and create a composite score reflecting compliance with the prespecified criteria [REF]. Several diet quality indices reflect a plant-based diet. For example, the Healthy Nordic Food Index has a strong plant-based focus and scores diets based on 6 components typically consumed as part of a traditional Nordic diet [REF]. However, more recently, specific plant-based diet quality indices have been developed to capture the continuum of plant and animal foods consumed. For example, the provegetarian food pattern by Martínez-González et al. [REF] positively scores 7 plant-based foods and negatively scores 5 animal-based foods. In addition to this, to acknowledge that not all plant-based foods are beneficial for health, Satija et al. [REF] created a series of plant-based indices to differentiate between healthy plant-based foods such as whole grains, and less healthy plant-based foods such as sugar-sweetened beverages. As such, these indices reflect an overall plant-based diet (PDI), a healthful plant-based diet (hPDI), and an unhealthful plant-based diet (uPDI) [REF]. With many new plant-based diet quality indices being developed, and increasing research examining their associations with health outcomes, it is imperative that these indices are reviewed. Therefore, this scoping review aimed to identify and critically evaluate diet quality indices used for assessing plant-based diets among adult populations, examining their basis for development, construction methodology, and validity. This synthesis will enable future studies to select the most suitable index for their research question and to inform this field of research going forward.",human
"Human body is composed of 30 x 10^12 eukaryote cells governing multiple and coordinated functions [REF]. Although endowed with very diverse and specific functions, the origin and development of eukaryotic cells is one of the most enigmatic processes of evolution. A crucial event in this process was the emergence of the mitochondria, the energy-generating organelles specific to eukaryotic cells. These organelles are thought to have begun to form when a bacterial cell related to the alpha-proteobacteria began living inside an archaeal host cell, of the phylum Lokiarcheaeota [REF]. This event resulted in one organism living inside another (endosymbiosis) and was beneficial to both protagonists, who aligned their interests and evolved in synergy, thus becoming evolutionarily stable [REF]. This prolonged partnership and associated coevolution have thus led to the formation of the eukaryotic cell as we know it today which constitutes the main element of animals, plants, fungi, and protists. This symbiotic event occurred billion years ago [REF] and this is the first of a long series.All plants and animals are home to symbiotic microorganisms whose interactions on the host can be neutral (commensalism), harmful (parasitism) or have beneficial effects (mutualism). These interactions are an integral part of coevolution and dynamically change from one to the other along a continuum depending on exterior and host factors [REF]. In the human body, viruses, bacteria, archaea, nanoarchaea, and eukaryotic microbes (fungi, protozoan, and parasitic helminths) constitute these symbiotic microorganisms and together form the microbiota. The number of microbial cells is roughly equal to the number of human cells (about 40 x 10^12 microbial cells) but their gene count exceeds the human genome’s gene count by ~100-fold [REF]. Host-microorganism interactions occur daily and take place in the skin and genital, respiratory (from the nose to the lung) and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, which contains, by far, the greatest density and diversity of microorganisms. Long considered to be sterile, microorganisms have also been detected in the urine outside of any clinicopathological situation [REF].In human, ~97% of total microbial cells are bacteria residing in colon and ~2-3% are extracolonic bacteria residing in other body sites (gut, skin, lungs, etc). Therefore, bacteria largely dominate the human microbiome, where only ~0.1-1% are archaea, eukaryotic microbes and viruses in the GI tract [REF]. The microbiota symbiotically contributes to several functions such as trophism, metabolism, barrier function, immunological processes, and signaling to virtually all organs of the body [REF].Beyond the beneficial homeostatic roles, a growing body of evidence suggests that microbes also influence states of health and disease including cancer. Indeed, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies 11 microbial agents (7 viruses, 3 parasites, and 1 bacterium) as group 1 human carcinogens and infection-induced cancer accounts for approximately 13% of the global burden of all human cancers [REF]. Furthermore, it is now clear that microorganisms in the gut microbiota may also contribute to the carcinogenesis and prognosis of patients with cancer at the systemic level through mechanisms involving microbiota-derived metabolites, genotoxins and inflammation [REF]. Conversely, tumorigenesis can result from the contraction of anti-tumorigenic bacteria that release anti-proliferative metabolites. An endogenous strain of the mouse microbiota (Faecalibaculum rodentium isolate PB1) and its human counterpart Holdemanella biformis belonging to the Erysipelotrichaceae family, which disappear during the early phases of colorectal tumorigenesis, produce short-fatty acids that block tumor cell proliferation by reducing activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 3 (NFATc3) and calcineurin [REF]. Then, there is growing evidence that micro-organisms, particularly bacteria and fungi residing in the gut, influence the response to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockers [REF]. Because of its richness, diversity, and the ease of access to samples, the bacterial microbiome of the gut is at the center of research in this area.An oxygen gradient along the longitudinal axis of the gut lumen, from ~6% O2 in the duodenal lumen to ~0.6% O2 in the colonic lumen, is generated and maintained by the host [REF]. Host factors and diet, by setting oxygen and nitrate availability, regulate and direct microbial growth that governs the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Thus, oxygen and nitrate deprivation in the lumen of the large intestine promotes the growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. In tumors, oxygen levels range from 0.3% to 2.2%, which is 7-fold lower than the normal oxygen level measured in the corresponding normal tissue [REF]. In addition, tumors typically have aberrant, leaky, and irregular vasculature and create a gradient of small molecules (aspartate, ribose etc.) that act as chemoattractants for bacteria [REF]. Tumors consist of an asynchronous and heterogeneous aggregate of malignant cells and host cells, such as immune and stromal cells entangled in an extracellular matrix. Tumor-associated immune cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells associated are each phenotypically and functionally diverse; therefore, some can promote tumor progression whereas others can exhibit antitumor activity. However, when viewed as a whole, a tumor is an immunosuppressed structure where bacteria might more easily replicate without the clearance mechanisms of macrophages and neutrophils, which normally serve to eliminate them. Altogether, these characteristic (deoxygenation, chemotaxis, chaotic vasculature, immunosuppression) proper to the tumor microenvironment (TME) provide a favorable and attractive niche for microbial growth. Microorganisms have been identified in patient tumors for more than a century, although the magnitude of these microorganisms, their role and their interaction with components of the TME have been incompletely appreciated so far, mainly due to technological limitations.After a brief description of the composition of the tumor-associated microbiota, the potential origin, assessment techniques and clinical relevance of this potential new player in the TME will be discussed.",human
"Cardiomyopathies are disorders of the myocardium caused by genetic and environmental factors that eventually result in impaired cardiac function and heart failure [REF]. Depending on the specific effects in the function and morphology of the heart, and the isolated presence of arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies are divided into dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive, and arrhythmogenic [REF]. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common cardiomyopathy affecting 1 in 250 individuals, followed by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which affects 1 in 500, and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) encountered 1 in 5,000, while the prevalence of restrictive cardiomyopathy is even less common [REF]. About 30%–50% of cardiomyopathies are heritable, and the different types can have variable phenotypes, prognosis and causal mutations [REF]. HCM is primarily a disease of the sarcomere, as in up to 60% of patients, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant is detected in sarcomeric genes [REF]. Beta-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and myosin binding protein C3 (MYBPC3) are the most frequently affected genes, encoding for proteins of the thick sarcomeric filaments, and patients tend to exhibit disease onset in their forties. Other commonly affected genes in the thin filaments of the sarcomere are cardiac Troponin I (TNNI3) and cardiac Troponin T (TNNT2) [REF]. In contrast to HCM, the causative genes in DCM are functionally diverse. Titin (TTN) mutations represent 12%–25% of DCM patients and Lamin (LMNA) genetic variants represent the second most common mutations in DCM patients [REF]. Other genes that are associated with DCM are MYH7, TNNT2, Tropomyosin 1 (TPM1), Desmoplakin (DSP), RNA binding motif protein 20 (RBM20), and sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 5 (SCN5A) [REF]. In arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), most pathogenic variants are in genes encoding desmosomal proteins such as Plakoglobin (JUP) [REF], DSP [REF], Plakophilin-2 (PKP2), Desmoglein-2 (DSG2) and Desmocollin-2 (DSC2) [REF]. Finally, inherited restrictive cardiomyopathies are caused by mutations in sarcomeric genes such as cardiac troponin I, and less commonly by mutations in Desmin (DES) and Filamin C (FLNC) [REF]. It is worth noting that although cardiomyopathies are classified based on phenotypes manifested in the general population, the pathogenic mechanisms and phenotypic features among the various types of cardiomyopathies can overlap to a significant degree.With the advancement of next generation sequencing and genome wide association studies (GWAS), our understanding of the genetic basis of cardiomyopathies has significantly improved. Multiple GWAS have identified susceptibility loci and variants associated with different types of cardiomyopathies [REF]. Most rare disease causal variants have been found within the coding region of the genome [REF]. For example, TTN coding variants usually lead to gene truncations and are viewed as the leading genetic causes in DCM patients [REF]. Contrarily, MYBPC3 truncating and MYH7 missense variants are the most pathogenic HCM mutations detected in next generation sequencing research studies [REF]. Although definitive causative genetic mutations have been identified for familial cardiomyopathies, in over half of the cases targeted genetic screening tests do not identify a contributing variant. This is because most of the current clinical genetic screening tests and earlier research studies relied heavily on whole exome sequencing (WES) or targeted sequencing of coding regions [REF]. Another explanation regarding the lack of focus in noncoding variants is that even in large meta-analyses, the power of variant detection is limited by variant frequency and penetrance, and lack of systemic interpretation. However, recent evidence from whole genome sequencing (WGS) supports a strong association between genetic variants within noncoding regions and cardiomyopathies [REF]. Also, emerging evidence corroborates the role of noncoding regulatory regions, where disruption of transcription factor binding sites within enhancers or promoters can alter the 3D chromatin structure and reduce target gene expression, which can be critical for disease [REF]. Similarly, based on other studies variants within intronic or untranslated regions (UTRs) could also be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies [REF]. Furthermore, according to ClinVar, a significant percentage of non-coding variants in splice sites (∼60%) and UTRs (∼5%), are classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar). In this review we will provide an overview of the role of noncoding genetic variants and their association with cardiomyopathies. We will specifically focus on variants within promoter, enhancer, untranslated, splice and intronic regions (Figure 1), where there is sufficient evidence to support a strong association with cardiac disease.Schematic illustration of noncoding parts in the eukaryotic genome: enhancer, promoter, 5′ UTR, intron, and 3′ UTR.",human
"Artificial intelligence has been applied in various fields throughout history, but its integration into daily life is more recent. The first applications of AI were primarily in academia and government research institutions, but as technology has advanced, AI has also been applied in industry, commerce, medicine and dentistry.There is probably no human being in the world that has not, at some point in his or her life, become aware of the limits of his or her physical and/or mental abilities. In the past, these limits often meant life or death because there was no way to go beyond one's limits and simply improve one's abilities. The devices and machines invented and manufactured by man have undoubtedly made everyday life easier, especially in the physical sense. However, to combine the endurance and reliability of machines with intelligence and consciousness as human characteristics was the desire of many inventors, researchers and philosophers who tried to describe the process of human thinking as a mechanical manipulation of symbols. A thinking artificial creation, i.e., a machine that has a kind of meta-consciousness and thinks like a human, is something that captures the imagination. The theoretical foundations of what we now call artificial intelligence (AI) were laid by Alan Turing, Claude E. Shannon, and Norbert Wiener [REF]. Alan M. Turing (1912 – 1954) is an English mathematician who is considered the father of theoretical computer science; Claude E. Shannon (1916 – 2001) is an American mathematician who is known as the father of the so-called ""information theory""; and Norbert Wiener (1894 - 1964) is an American mathematician and philosopher, the founder of cybernetics. They are responsible for the concept of creating intelligent machines [REF]. However, the concept of AI itself is somewhat younger. The concept of AI dates back to 1956, when a group of researchers participating in an eight-week Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, USA, proposed a research project and set the goal of creating ""thinking machines"" that could mimic human intelligence and behavior. This is widely regarded as the beginning of AI as a formal field of study [REF].In order to better understand the concept of artificial intelligence, it is necessary to clarify the difference between artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning and data science, Figure 1. Artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, and data science are related but distinct fields. Artificial intelligence is the broadest field, of which machine learning and deep learning are subsets. Data science uses techniques from all of these fields to gain insights and knowledge from data. Artificial intelligence is a broad field that encompasses a range of techniques and methods aimed at creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making, and natural language processing. Artificial intelligence can be divided into several branches, including expert systems, robotics, and natural language processing, to name a few. Deep learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses neural networks inspired by the structure of the human brain to learn from large amounts of data. Deep learning algorithms can automatically identify and extract features from raw data such as images, sounds, and text and use them to make predictions or decisions. Examples of deep learning applications include image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning techniques can be supervised (the algorithm learns from labeled data), unsupervised (the algorithm learns from unlabeled data), or semi-supervised (the algorithm learns from a combination of labeled and unlabeled data). Applications of machine learning include recommendation systems, fraud detection, and predictive modeling. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistical and computational techniques with domain-specific knowledge to gain insights and knowledge from data. Data science encompasses a range of activities including data acquisition, cleaning and pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. Data science is used in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, social media, and e-commerce.Artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning and data scienceArtificial intelligence has been applied in various fields throughout history, but its integration into daily life is more recent. The first applications of AI were primarily in academia and government research institutions, but as technology has advanced, AI has also been applied in industry and commerce [REF]. One of the earliest examples of AI in everyday life was the use of expert systems in the 1980s and 1990s. These were computer programs that could mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a particular field, such as medicine or finance. In the 21st century, AI has been increasingly integrated into a variety of consumer products and services. Examples of AI include virtual personal assistants such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, and recommendation systems used by companies such as Netflix and Amazon to personalize their customers' experiences. AI is also being used in areas such as self-driving cars, healthcare and finance.Today, we can distinguish three generations of AI [REF]. The first generation is the so-called artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), the second is the artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the third, currently the most advanced generation, is the artificial superintelligence (ASI). From today's perspective, we can safely say that the first generation is already ubiquitous. When we talk about the first generation of AI, we mean, among other things, the facial recognition and tagging technology used by Facebook, for example, virtual voice assistants in our cell phones such as Siri, Alexa or Bixby, the technology developed by Tesla and Google for self-driving cars, and much more. The second generation of AI is expected to think, plan, and solve problems and tasks on its own. The third generation of artificial superintelligence will be a truly self-aware system that could make humans and their input obsolete in certain situations. Although it is a fictional AI-based system on AI, HAL 9000 from Arthur C. Clarke's A Space Odyssey is perhaps the most vivid representation of the capabilities of third-generation artificial intelligence at this time.Considering that the possibilities of applying artificial intelligence are developing rapidly and that, according to PubMed data, this field is one of the areas with the greatest growth in the number of newly published articles [REF], the aim of this paper was to provide an overview of the literature and to give an insight into the possibilities of applying artificial intelligence in medicine and dentistry. The aim was to discuss in details its advantages and disadvantages. For this purpose, the databases Pubmed and Web of science were searched. The keywords artificial intelligence, medicine, healthcare, dentistry, deep learning, and machine learning were used.",human
"Glycans are the most complex and structurally diverse biomolecules found on all cells and tissues of the human body. Glycosylation is the primary source of microheterogeneity in proteins, and, with few exceptions, all proteins passing through the ER and Golgi during biosynthesis are modified with O- and/or N-linked glycans. As part of the cellular glycocalyx, glycans are involved in various biological processes, including intracellular transport, cell adhesion, cell-cell, and cell-matrix interactions, as well as signalling [REF]. Hence, they play a crucial role in human physiology and pathology.The assembly of glycans can differ considerably from cell to cell. Although at least 4000 human genes are directly and indirectly involved in glycan synthesis, glycans are not directly encoded in the genome. Genetic defects in the glycosylation machinery often tend to be lethal at the embryonic stage, emphasising the vital role of glycans. The dynamic structure and composition of the glycocalyx are affected by various endogenous factors, such as the expression levels of specific glycosyltransferases and pH in the ER and Golgi. Age and environmental factors, such as lifestyle and diet, have also been shown to affect the glycocalyx. Under normal physiological conditions, a cell's glycan characteristics are primarily conserved, and alterations often reflect and result in cancer [REF]. These aberrant glycan structures can, therefore, be used as glycan biomarkers for diagnostics as well as specific targeting of the cells that carry them.Tumour-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACAs) have received increasing attention over the past decades due to their central role in every aspect of cancer progression and the possibility of targeting them specifically using antibodies (Abs). Carbohydrates, however, are generally poorly immunogenic and often elicit a T-cell-independent response, which fails to create immunological memory. Hence, immunisation of animals using glycans primarily leads to the production of low-affinity Immunoglobulin M (IgM), which does not class switch to Immunoglobulin G (IgG) [REF]. Thus, vaccine development against TACAs is hampered by the absence of T-cell-mediated immunity, which is critical for active cancer immunotherapy. TACAs are often tolerated by the immune system due to the structural similarity of TACAs with healthy cell glycans 3 and the low expression of TACAs in healthy tissue or during prenatal development [REF]. To overcome the poor immunogenicity of glycans in vaccines and therapeutic Ab development, glycans are conjugated to a carrier protein. The generation of glycopeptides in antigen-presenting cells, following their display by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) system to T-cell receptors, is essential for eliciting a T-cell-dependent immune response and the formation of specific and high-affinity immunoglobulins. To date, production of most anti-glycan monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) involves animal immunisation with glycan-carrier protein conjugates to ensure the essential T-cell-dependent response for the formation of glycan-specific IgGs.Even though immunotherapy targeting glycans faces several hurdles, it also holds a considerable advantage. One of the major problems in combating cancer is drug resistance. Due to drug-imposed selection pressure in combination with the high mutational rate and clonal expansion, cancer cells often acquire drug resistance genetically. Targeting TACAs reduces the chance of antigen escape tremendously, as their synthesis, in contrast to proteins, is neither linear nor template-driven and involves the coordinated activity of numerous enzymes. Furthermore, TACAs are far more abundant than protein tumour antigens; for instance, the highly expressed protein marker HER-2 has about 106 copies per cell, whereas the TACA Thomsen-Friedenreich (TF) has about 107 copies per cell [REF]. TACA expression is often more frequent for given tumour types than protein antigens and identified in a larger percentage of the patients. Targeting TACAs can pave the way to more effective cancer therapies as is demonstrated by the approval of Dinutuximab, a mAb targeting the TACA GD2, for treating neuroblastoma in 2015 [REF].The mAbs used in therapy are typically IgG and are composed of the fragment antigen binding (Fab), and the crystallizable fragment (Fc) (Figure 1A), which interacts with Fc receptors expressed on several immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, leading to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP). In addition, the Fc fragment can be recognised by components of the complement system and can thereby induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Alternatively, mAbs can be used to deliver a toxic payload in the form of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) [REF].The first mAb for therapeutic use was approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986. In 2021, the FDA approved the 100th mAb product, highlighting their wide success 8 Nevertheless, their large size and high molecular mass of ~150 kDa, prevents Abs from reaching their full potential in therapeutic efficiency, as penetration into thick and dense tissue, as the tumour microenvironment, is often a limiting factor. In addition, the structure, function, and serum half-life of therapeutic mAbs, as well as non-desired adverse effects in treated human patients are due to Fc fragment interactions with the immune system cells and the N-glycans it carries [REF].To overcome these problems, tremendous efforts have been expended to generate smaller antigen-binding fragments, such as Fab, single chain variable fragment (scFv), and single-domain Abs (Figure 1). Ab fragments are produced through enzymatic cleavage from intact mAbs, or by recombinant protein expression systems such as bacteria, which allow cheaper and faster production in large quantities. The fragments are less immunogenic due to the absence of the Fc fragment, and their size enables better access to dense tissue and contributes to enhanced tumour penetration [REF]. Moreover, Ab fragments are readily coupled with different molecules, and their relatively smaller size makes them highly amenable to genetic engineering and the development of multivalent and multispecific tools [REF].However, many recombinant fragments exhibit reduced stability and affinity compared to their parent Ab. Moreover, lying below the glomerular filtration cut-off of approximately 60 kDa, most Ab fragments suffer from fast renal clearance and a half-life ranging from minutes to several hours [REF]. A longer circulating time is desirable for cancer therapy to achieve its full therapeutic efficacy through enhanced biodistribution and increased Ab concentration at the target site. Unfortunately, too-small constructs will be excreted through the kidneys before exerting biological effects. Therefore, several strategies are successfully employed to increase the half-life of Ab fragments, including chemical conjugation to polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains or fusion to additional Ab fragments that bind serum proteins such as albumin [REF]. Nevertheless, a shorter blood circulation time can also be advantageous for tumour imaging, as it lowers background signal compared with the 2-3 weeks of half-life of canonical Abs [REF].While there have been several comprehensive reviews on full Abs targeting TACAs [REF], literature regarding Ab fragments targeting TACAs was not reviewed to date. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of the achievements and applications of Ab fragments that target specific TACAs. First, we provide a structural overview of the different Ab fragments. Thereafter, we describe specific TACAs, and the fragments that target them. Engineered Ab fragments that contain Fc segments are out of the scope of this review.",human
"The global incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has been rapidly increasing over the past decade, with more than one million curable STIs being acquired daily. Young women in sub-Saharan Africa have a high prevalence and incidence of both curable STIs and HIV. The use of doxycycline as a prophylaxis to prevent STIs is promising; however, clinical trials, to date, have only been conducted among men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income settings. We describe the characteristics of participants enrolled in the first trial to determine the efficacy of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to reduce STI incidence among women taking daily, oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).Global trends reveal a rapid increase in the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) over the past decade, with more than one million curable STIs acquired daily [REF]. In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 374 million new infections of four curable STIs, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, and Trichomonas vaginalis [REF]. Young women in sub-Saharan Africa face a high prevalence of curable STIs and HIV [REF] and limited data from HIV PrEP trials suggests high incidence rates [REF]. STIs can severely affect mortality and morbidity for cisgender women by causing conditions such as tubal infertility, chronic pelvic pain, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, post-partum endometriosis, adverse neonatal outcomes, and an increase in susceptibility to HIV [REF]. Women are more biologically predisposed to complications from STIs than men [REF]. Several studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa reveal higher STI prevalence among younger women compared to their age-matched male peers and older women [REF]. In the region, the cultural, economic, and social marginalization of women contributes to the risk of HIV and STIs [REF], in part by rendering the negotiation of preventive measures such as condom use, abstinence, and partner notification ineffective [REF].Taking antibiotics following sexual exposure to prevent bacterial STIs places preventive care in the hands of the user. Interventions that are individually controlled are greatly needed, especially for women, and the use of doxycycline as a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) has been proposed as a novel STI prevention strategy [REF]. Doxycycline is already standardly used as prophylaxis to prevent infections such as malaria, lyme, and leptospirosis [REF]. A recent open-label clinical trial of doxycycline PEP among men who have sex with men (MSM) who were using HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in France found a 47% relative reduction in bacterial STIs overall and a greater reduction specifically for C. trachomatis (70%) and T. pallidum (73%) [REF]. Doxycycline PEP was well-tolerated in that study [REF]. Several clinical trials of doxycycline as PEP or PrEP among MSM are ongoing worldwide to test this initial finding.Studies among young African women have evaluated the association between HIV incidence and perception of HIV risk with disparate results [REF]. STI risk perception and the prevalence of STIs among women receiving HIV prevention care, which is limited to syndromic management of STIs and daily oral PrEP, have not yet been described. Although women disproportionately bear the burden of adverse sequelae of curable STIs, trials on doxycycline PEP in this population have not yet been completed. The doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis (dPEP) Trial is an open-label, randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of doxycycline PEP for STI prevention (C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. pallidum) in Kisumu, Kenya, and is the first study to assess the efficacy of doxycycline PEP in cisgender women. In this paper, we describe the baseline characteristics of the dPEP Trial population.",human
"The oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor (Olig) family of proteins, comprised of Olig1, Olig2, and Olig3, are basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors that are essential regulators of neural cell fate and specification [REF]. The Olig genes and the proteins they encode are responsible for the development of oligodendrocytes and neural cells. Initial studies revealed that the Olig genes, primarily Olig1 and Olig2, are expressed by oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) where Olig1 regulates oligodendrocyte formation and maturation in the brain and Olig2 modulates oligodendrogenesis in the spinal cord [REF]. It was later discovered that the Olig proteins are also involved in neurogenesis. Specifically, Olig2 is distinctly expressed in the progenitors of motor neurons (pMN) domain of the developing spinal cord where motor neurons are generated [REF]. Furthermore, Olig1/2 were also found to generate inhibitory interneurons in the brain [REF]. Recently, GABAergic neurons were shown to be derived in Olig3 lineage cells [REF]. The role of the Olig family in astrocyte specification is not well established. It was shown that Olig1/2 may promote astrocyte differentiation where astrocytes are sequentially transformed after generation of interneurons [REF]. However, other studies determined that Olig-expressing precursors to be negative regulators of astrocytes confirming the cellular fate to be neurons and oligodendrocytes [REF]. The Olig genes are also expressed in cancer and are detailed below.Gliomas are primary brain tumors derived from neuroglial stem cells or progenitor cells as well as lineage restricted precursors [REF]. Roughly 30% of all primary brain tumors are gliomas and 80% are considered malignant [REF]. Traditionally, gliomas are classified based on their histopathological and clinical features established by the World Health Organization [REF]. Over the years, technological advancement has vastly improved classification of gliomas centered on molecular and genomic changes [REF]. Currently, gliomas are divided into six families: (1) adult-type diffuse gliomas; (2) pediatric-type diffuse low-grade gliomas; (3) pediatric-type high-grade gliomas; (4) circumscribed astrocytic gliomas; (5) glioneuronal and neuronal tumors; and (6) ependymomas [REF]. Adult-type diffuse gliomas are further separated into three different groups: (1) isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant with 1p/19q co-deletion with primarily oligodendroglial morphology; (2) IDH mutant with 1p/19q non-codeletion with mainly astrocytic histology; and (3) IDH wildtype [REF]. Gliomas are also further categorized based on WHO grades I–IV. Grade I gliomas consists of pilocytic astrocytic astrocytomas and are primarily observed in the cerebellum or brain stem of children. Grade II gliomas are comprised of adult low-grade gliomas and are generally astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, mixed oligoastrocytomas, and diffuse astrocytomas. Grade III gliomas are malignant gliomas composed of anaplastic cells. Grade IV gliomas are glioblastoma (GBM) which consists of primary and secondary GBM [REF].Success in prognosis and therapeutics of gliomas is dependent on accurate diagnosis. While there exist a multitude of histological markers to differentiate between the types of gliomas, challenges remain due to gliomas displaying similar morphological characteristics [REF]. Specifically, reliable markers to accurately distinguish between glioma types are lacking due to ambiguous histological features. Differentiating gliomas based on their cellular morphology can also be confusing and biased, resulting in classifications such as oligoastrocytoma or mixed glioma [REF]. Observer variability can also lead to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of the correct disease [REF].CNS tumors are heterogenous and their grading based on histological features is notoriously subjective [REF]. With advances in diagnostic technologies, the most recent WHO 2021 classification of tumors of the CNS have adopted key molecular markers and revised grading of astrocytic tumors, oligodendroglial tumors, oligoastrocytomas, glioneuronal tumors, and neuronal tumors [REF]. The summary of Olig expression in gliomas presented in this review is based on WHO CNS tumor classification at the time the studies were conducted. However, we have organized the gliomas, to the best of our ability, centered on the most current 2021 WHO CNS tumor classification. Large datasets have confirmed the expression of Olig2 across all gliomas such as TCGA and others [REF].Adult-type diffuse gliomas are composed of IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendrogliomas, IDH-mutant astrocytomas, and IDH-wildtype GBMs, based on histological characteristics and explicit molecular markers. In adults, oligodendrogliomas with IDH mutation and 1p/19q-codeletion also present with mutations in the TERT promoter gene [REF]. Oligodendroglial tumors have generated great interest over the past decade due to its favorable response to chemotherapy [REF] which may be attributed to the concurrent loss of chromosome arms 1p and 19q [REF]. IDH-mutant astrocytomas are now graded as WHO grade II, III, or IV [REF] and also harbor ATRX and TP53 mutations [REF]. GBM is the most common and deadliest primary brain tumor. IDH-wildtype GBM demonstrates alterations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and similar to oligodendrogliomas, exhibit TERT promoter mutations [REF].Because oligodendrogliomas arise from oligodendrocytes, it is not surprising that attempts to diagnose oligodendrogliomas have utilized oligodendrocyte markers. Mature oligodendrocyte markers, such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), however, are not expressed at detectable levels in oligodendrogliomas [REF]. Furthermore, immature oligodendrocyte markers, such as the chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan NG2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR-α), lack specificity [REF] and have been unsuccessful in discerning between glioma types [REF]. Several earlier studies have observed marked Olig2 expression in oligodendrogliomas [REF]. Specifically, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas displayed intense nuclear Olig2 expression [REF]. Morphologically, Olig positive cells were moderately to densely packed, and displayed round and homogeneous nuclei with perinuclear halos [REF], characteristics consistent with oligodendroglial tumors [REF]. Others have also observed an upregulation of both Olig1 and Olig2 in these tumors [REF]. For example, one study found an astounding 87% (26/30) and 93% (28/30) of oligodendroglial samples were positive for Olig1 and Olig2, respectively [REF]. Furthermore, the strong expression of Olig1 and Olig2 was shown to be correlated to WHO classification with their expression increasing incrementally from grades I to III [REF]. However, one report did note varied expression of Olig1 and Olig2. Here, the authors found 3 grade III oligodendrogliomas did not express either Olig1 or Olig2 while another 3 grade III oligodendrogliomas expressed Olig1 only [REF].Compared to oligodendrogliomas, Olig expression in astrocytomas and GBMs has been inconsistent and varied. Generally, low levels of Olig1 and Olig2 have been observed [REF] with weak Olig2 intensity in the nuclei [REF]. In one report, low Olig1 expression was detected along with a marked upregulation of Olig2 [REF], while another study found an upregulation of both Olig1 and Olig2, although the sample size was small [REF]. In another study astrocytomas were found to exhibit only weak or moderate Olig expression [REF]. Olig expression was not detected in a case of grade III astrocytoma [REF]. GBMs also displayed varying Olig2 expression. While one study rarely observed Olig2 in GBM [REF], another study demonstrated lower mean transcript levels of Olig1 and Olig2 [REF]. In one rare case of GBM, upregulation of both Olig1 and Olig2 were observed [REF]. Interestingly, in a separate study, Olig2 protein levels were upregulated in all cases of GBM and appeared nuclear [REF].While diffuse high-grade gliomas (HGGs) are more common in adults, pediatric HGGs present with similar histopathological features and devastating prognosis [REF]. Pediatric diffuse HGGs can arise from various regions in the brain but most develop as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) which occurs in the brainstem [REF] during a restricted window of childhood [REF]. DIPGs are the most common brainstem tumors in children with a median of survival of less than 1 year from diagnosis [REF]. Histopathologically, DIPG hosts a spectrum of features that is consistent with diffuse and anaplastic astrocytomas and GBMs [REF]. Because DIPG appears during development, neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are actively proliferating and differentiating, are highly impacted during disease progression [REF]. Olig proteins are critical players in cellular specification and differentiation during development [REF]. Their expression in DIPGs have been investigated. Not surprising, a large number of cells in the pons were found to be positive for Olig2 with a subset of these cells also co-expressing Sox2 and Nestin [REF], markers of not only CNS embryogenesis [REF], but also tumorigenesis [REF].Circumscribed astrocytic gliomas are astrocytic neoplasms with circumscribed growth [REF]. Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is a type of circumscribed astrocytic glioma and is considered a low-grade glioma (LGG). PAs occur mostly in children and young adolescent but can be observed in older patients as well. This brain tumor is commonly observed in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and optic pathways, but can occur anywhere in the brain [REF]. Histologically, PAs display the classical biphasic pattern which is composed of compact areas containing Rosenthal fibers and loose microcystic areas [REF].Olig expression in PAs have been conflicting. Some studies have found low to moderate expression of Olig1 and Olig2 [REF] while others have reported high expression of these genes [REF]. One study observed greater immunoreactivity of Olig1 (97%; 62/64) compared to Olig2 (75%; 48/64; [REF]). Diffuse staining patterns of Olig2 were observed [REF] and similar to oligodendrogliomas, Olig immunoreactivity was found localized to the nuclei [REF]. Interestingly, double immunolabeling of Ki67 and Olig2 showed that most proliferating cells were also positive for Olig2, however, Ki67+ cells embodied a small portion of Olig2 expressing cells as PAs are LGGs and have a low rate of proliferation [REF].Glioneuronal tumors (GNTs) are exceptionally rare neoplasms composed of both mixed neuronal and glial cells. The majority of GNTs are classified as grade I and are associated with seizures [REF]. The pathological aspects of GNTs remain unclear however, case reports have found Olig2 commonly expressed in these tumors and thus lean more toward oligodendrogliomas. Three subtypes of GNTs that demonstrate Olig2 upregulation are dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors [REF], papillary glioneuronal tumors [REF], and rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors [REF].DNTs are highly heterogenous with varying morphological features. Histologically, these tumors display nuclear atypia, mitosis, endothelial proliferation, or increased cell density, however, these appearances provide no prognostic value [REF]. DNTs are also subtyped as simple or complex which displays oligodendroglia-like cells (OLCs) and floating neurons [REF]. With these hallmarks, the definition of DNTs remain controversial. DNTs were found to be more similar to oligodendrogliomas rather than a glioneuronal tumor. In this same study 88% of OLCs were diffusely Olig2+ and 10% of these cells also colocalized with galectin3 in the nuclei of OLCs. Few OLCs were positive for PDGFRα and did not exhibit 1p/19q codeletion. Additionally, NeuN+ and Olig2+ cells were mutually exclusive, further suggesting that DNTs are clear glial tumors rather than glioneuronal tumors [REF].Similarly, Olig2 expressing cells were also found in PGNTs suggesting that these tumors may be oligodendroglial or oligodendroglial-like. Histologically, PGNTs exhibit two distinct architectures: (1) pseudopapillary structures surrounded by (2) compact regions consisting of neuronal elements under different maturation stages [REF].Since the discovery of a small proportion of clonogenic progenitors in acute myeloid leukemia [REF], the existence of tumor initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) in several types of cancers were investigated. Thus arose the cancer stem cell hypothesis which states that malignant tumors are driven and sustained by a group of cells with stem cell properties of unlimited capacity for self-renewal and the ability to differentiate into any cell type [REF]. While the cancer stem cell hypothesis was adopted by many, it remains highly controversial [REF]. Even with increasing evidence of CSCs, possibly the most debated aspect of the hypothesis is the mere existence of CSCs, as they only contribute to a small fraction of the tumor [REF]. Therefore, it remains unclear from where CSCs originated and, as a result, identifying a cell of origin in gliomas, such as GBMs, has been explored.GBMs are the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumors. They exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity resulting in molecular subtypes of classical, mesenchymal, and proneural [REF]. Evidence of brain tumor initiating cells in vivo [REF] have led to studies identifying glioma stem cells (GSCs) and better understanding of their properties. While markers such as CD133, CD15, L1CAM, CD49f, and SOX2 have been shown to be enriched in GSCs [REF] they are not exclusive to GSCs. Identification of more specific markers of GSCs could increase detection for developing targeted therapies. In one study, comparative analysis demonstrated Olig2 as the most specific GBM stem cell marker [REF]. Similar to previous findings [REF], Olig2 immunoreactivity was observed in all cases of GBM [REF] and was primarily nuclear with rare cases exhibiting cytoplasmic Olig2 staining. Further analysis revealed higher expression of Olig2 in secondary GBM compared to primary GBMs [REF]. Secondary GBMs evolve from diffuse astrocytomas and have frequent TP53 and ATRX mutations [REF] which are also commonly observed in IDH-mutant astrocytomas [REF]. Because secondary GBMs were removed from the 2021 WHO CNS tumor classification, it is plausible that they are more closely related to IDH-mutant astrocytomas. Re-characterization of Olig2 in “secondary GBM” samples is therefore necessary for thorough understanding of glioma pathogenesis.Despite cell lineage studies, it is unclear why Olig2 is enhanced in oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas [REF]. Olig2 is critical during CNS development. It is known for its role in oligodendrocyte and neuron specification and maturation and may also fulfill a potential function in astrocyte differentiation [REF]. In the postnatal brain, Olig2 functions as a repressor of neuronal lineages to direct subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitor cells toward astrocytic and oligodendrocytic fates [REF]. In fact, overexpression of Olig2 in the SVZ increases the number of highly migratory OPCs to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes [REF]. Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the SVZ, also known as Type B cells, are a subpopulation of GFAP positive astrocytes that give rise to neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and NG2+ OPCs [REF]. Interestingly, these Type B cells, along with some Type C (transit-amplifying) cells, also express Olig2 [REF], indicating possible cells of origin for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.Olig2 dysregulation in gliomas suggests that it is required for glioma growth and formation. Below we describe how Olig2 may be activated during cancer progression. Additionally, we explore how Olig2 drives gliomagenesis and whether it serves an oncogenic function.Throughout CNS development, NSCs and NPCs transform into distinct cell types in a spatiotemporal manner. A central function of Olig2 is to direct cell fate and specification, particularly into oligodendrocytes and neurons, in distinct regions of the brain and spinal cord during development [REF]. Olig2 is induced by Sonic hedgehog [REF] where its pathways are known to regulate cellular patterning and cell fates [REF]. The interplay between Shh and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) promotes Olig2 transcription [REF]. Increasing evidence has associated Shh signaling pathway with CNS tumors, however its relationship with Olig2 in gliomas is only beginning to be elucidated.Several lines of evidence have associated Shh signaling with gliomas. For example, overexpression of Shh was observed in CD133+ cells and accelerated tumor growth while inhibition of Shh or shRNA knockdown of Shh delayed tumor growth and downregulated Ptch1 and Gli1 [REF]. Shh is activated via binding to the Ptch1 receptor while Gli1 is transcriptionally induced by Shh signaling [REF]. Aberrant activation of Gli1 [REF] and mutations in Ptch1 [REF] are correlated with various cancers. In another study, expression of Shh and Ptch1 levels were significantly higher in brainstem astrocytomas compared to supratentorial astrocytomas [REF]. Increased levels of Notch receptors and its ligands were observed in astrogliomas and GBMs. Interestingly, glioma cell lines expressing the active form of Notch1 proliferated faster than those that did not [REF]. Furthermore, overexpression of Notch1 further increased formation of Nestin+ neurosphere colonies [REF] and its expression in GBM cells [REF]. Similarly, overexpression of Notch1, its ligands, and downstream targets (Hes1 and Hes2) have been detected in GBM. Notch activation has also been shown to contribute to Ras-mediated transformation of glial cells to glioma growth, proliferation, and survival [REF].Because Olig2 activity is regulated by Shh [REF], it is plausible that increased levels of Olig2 in gliomas are contributed by Shh deregulation. Recently, Olig2 was shown to behave as an oncogenic activator in Shh medulloblastoma [REF], a malignant pediatric brain tumor characterized by activation of Shh signaling [REF]. Olig2+ progenitors were identified as the rapidly dividing Type C cells at the onset of tumorigenesis. Surprisingly, a substantial increase in Olig2+ progenitors was found in recurrent Shh-MB indicating that Olig2+ progenitors are reactivated during recurrence or metastasis. Finally, enhanced Olig2+ expression was also detected in Shh-MB and was significantly correlated with decreased survival.Studies have also illustrated Olig2 participation in positive feedback loops with the EGFR receptor tyrosine kinase [REF]. EGFR signaling is known to activate the oncogenic PI3K-AKT–mTOR and RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathways [REF]. Exposure to EGF leads to proliferation of Olig2+ type C cells [REF] and inhibition of EGFR signaling results in Olig2 depletion indicating that EGFR signaling is responsible for sustaining Olig2 expression in progenitor cells [REF]. Furthermore, Olig2 directly targets EGFR [REF] and overexpression of Olig2 leads to significant upregulation of EGFR and transcripts [REF]. Additionally, phosphorylated Olig2 leads to differentially regulated genes associated with RTKs [REF].Gene network analysis has identified potential roles of Olig2 involvement in gliomas (Figures 1, 2). One such network entails cell cycle regulation [REF]. p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that functions in growth arrest and apoptosis in response to cellular stress. An effector of p53 and cell cycle inhibitor is p21 [REF]. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis demonstrated that p21 is a direct target of Olig2 repression in NPCs and gliomas [REF]. Malignant gliomas that are resistant to radiation and genotoxic drugs are associated with reduced p53 functions as a result of Olig2 expression. However, in the absence of Olig2, even attenuated p53 functions were shown to be sufficient to activate radiation-induced apoptosis and growth arrest. Olig2 opposes p53 functions by suppressing acetylation of p53. Therefore, Olig2 acts as post-translational modifier of p53 to repress its downstream biological activities [REF].Gene targets of Olig2. Highlighted yellow are genes that can be bound by olig2 in the promoter-TSS region, light brown highlighted genes can be bound in more distant area before gene sequence.Signaling effects of Olig2. Highlighted yellow are genes that can be bound by olig2 in the promoter-TSS region, light brown highlighted genes can be bound in more distant area before gene sequence.It appears that Olig2 may be an actionable drug target as multiple gliomas express high levels of Olig2. Additionally, several studies utilizing transgenic mouse models showed that ablation of Olig2 delayed tumor growth and improved survival [REF]. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of Olig2 may be therapeutically beneficial in treating gliomas.In collaboration with Curtana Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA), we generated an orally bioavailable small molecule (397 kD) Olig2 inhibitor, CT-179, the first drug targeting bHLH transcription factors for cancer treatment. Our preliminary findings suggest that CT-179 prevents Olig2 homodimerization and strongly inhibited cellular growth and induced apoptosis of Olig2+ cells [REF]. Moreover, CT-179 disrupts the cell cycle, ultimately resulting in mitotic catastrophe at the prometaphase. Treatment with CT-179 in tumor-bearing mice resulted in a reduction of Olig2+ cells and markedly improved survival outcome [REF]. Recent preliminary findings indicated that CT-179 also decreased Shh signaling and prolonged event-free survival in a mouse model of medulloblastoma [REF].Olig2 exhibits a dichotomous function. It displays a pro-neural function by promoting motor neuron differentiation as well as an anti-neural role by participating in generation of oligodendrocytes [REF]. Phosphorylation of Olig2 has been shown to regulate neuronal-glial cellular fate switch. Specifically, Olig2 was shown to be phosphorylated at serine 147 (S147) during motor neuron production [REF]. Additionally, triple serine motif phosphorylation sites (S10, S13, S14) were shown to control proliferative functions of Olig2 [REF]. In fact, phosphorylated Olig2 exhibits pro-mitotic and anti-p53 functions [REF]. Thus, targeting Olig2 or protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) may have therapeutic effects against gliomas. Certainly, we observed that treatment with CT-179 decreased Olig2 phosphorylation in a mouse model of medulloblastoma [REF] which may enable p53-mediated apoptosis [REF] and improve outcomes.",human
"Cancer is a leading cause of mortality in all European countries and the impact on individual health and wider society is significant. Studies have shown that nearly 40% of cancer cases are related to known modifiable risk factors, and therefore preventable [REF]. These known main risk factors include (but are not limited to) tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, consequences of an unhealthy diet, being overweight and being sedentary with insufficient physical activity [REF].Alcohol consumption remains as one of the four leading causes of premature death, and the second leading cause of premature mortality in the World health Organisation (WHO) European region [REF] (Supplementary File S4 for full list of abbreviations). It is well established that there exists a direct relationship between consumption of alcohol and the development of several cancers, such as those of the oral cavity, oropharynx, oesophagus, larynx and liver [REF]. Although the potential negative health effects e.g., increased risk of liver disease, cardiovascular disease, road accidents of alcohol are widely known, it is less well known that it is a risk factor for cancer, and that those who routinely indulge in heavy drinking are more at risk. Younger people in adolescence and during early adulthood are particularly vulnerable to the impact of alcohol consumption in general. Effective strategies to inform and educate younger people about the risks of alcohol consumption, may have considerable positive impact on both current and future health problems, including cancer incidence.A recent WHO report stated that it is expected that most younger people tend to begin drinking alcohol between the ages of 12–16 [REF] with drinking behaviours during adolescence associated with a multitude of physical, psychological, and social problems that can persist into later life. Drinking behaviours amongst university and college students has also been shown to be highly concerning, with risky drinking being common place [REF] and heavy drinking being reported in university students in high income countries [REF]. Increased consumption of alcohol in younger people has been linked to increased alcohol consumption in later adulthood [REF] which in turn has also has been linked to increased risk of cancer [REF].By promoting health-conscious behaviours, and increasing risk awareness around alcohol consumption, young people will be more informed and healthy lifestyle choices can be made. This could lead to substantial public health improvement with reductions in health and social problems associated with alcohol consumption, both now and in the future The increasing popularity, accessibility, and multi-functional use of digital technologies (computer, mobile phone, tablet etc.) make these potential tools to help facilitate communication, education, and risk awareness to elicit protective changes in behaviour, especially among children, adolescents and young adults, who are generally more familiar with new technologies throughout their formative years. young people aged between 10 and 24 years who are approaching adolescence and early adulthood may therefore be particularly suitable as recipients for such digitally delivered interventions. Mobile Health (mHealth) initiatives for instance, have rapidly expanded and are being utilised to deliver public health interventions, especially in the younger population who conduct many of their daily activities using smartphones and have been termed the “phono-sapiens” [REF]. The flexibility of such mHealth platforms provide opportunities for public health specialists to target a large number of people and also monitor people's behaviour in “real-time” [REF], and further emphasise the potential of digital technology in healthcare delivery It has previously been suggested that by addressing interventions for those who demonstrate the riskiest drinking behaviours, the greatest outcomes at the population level can be realised [REF] and we are conscious that such digital technologies may have considerable impact in helping to moderate alcohol consumption in younger people.Considering the negative public health and social impact that alcohol has, including increased risk of alcohol related cancers; alongside the prevalence of hazardous and harmful drinking behaviours in younger populations, we were interested in examining the impact and accessibility of emerging digital technology to moderate drinking behaviours in those younger populations. We reviewed the available systematic review literature with the objectives to ascertain (1) are digital interventions aimed at young people effective in addressing alcohol consumption? and (2) What is the quality and strength of the systematic review evidence?",human
"The World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the “Resolution on Digital Health” introduced during the 71st World Health Assembly in May 2018 and recognized the need for digital technology to achieve universal health coverage and sustainable development goals [REF]. As such, digital healthcare (DHC), in which digital technology is converging with healthcare, has become increasingly important. Along with the fourth industrial revolution, changes in demographic structure, such as population aging, and social changes, such as smart device popularization, have stimulated the demand for DHC [REF]. Above all, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to dramatic changes in the healthcare sector. Enabling contactless healthcare services, DHC has spread faster than ever.Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a broad spectrum of chronic diseases affecting bones, joints, and soft tissues [REF]. Musculoskeletal pain is a typical symptom caused by MSD, and especially, low back and neck pain is the leading causative factor of disability worldwide [REF]. Globally, 1.71 billion people suffer from MSDs, which are also the leading cause of disability [REF]. Approximately one-third of the UK population has MSDs, such as arthritis and back pain, making MSD the third–largest burden of the National Health System’s expenditure [REF]. According to a recent study in Korea, where national health insurance is available, one in three Koreans visits healthcare providers for musculoskeletal pain and functional decline; MSD prevalence is also increasing among older patients [REF]. Rehabilitation is essential for patients with MSDs. In 2017, when the WHO launched the “Rehabilitation 2030 initiative”, everyone should be able to rehabilitate at all life cycle stages, especially for musculoskeletal health [REF]. In addition, pain control is a major concern in MSD care and rehabilitation programs. In the MSD rehabilitation program, the specific needs of each patient are considered. An exercise program designed to increase muscle strength, flexibility and mobility is crucial, and through such rehabilitation, the patient can become independent and lead a regular life. Active participation of both patients and their families during this process is essential [REF]. Recently, Austria introduced a secondary preventive program for patients with MSD, aiming to prevent rehospitalization. As part of the appraisal for this program, a large observational study was conducted, and the results indicated that physical inactivity is the factor that is most associated with the need for healthcare services [REF]. Using DHC for health improvement is cost-effective, safe, and measurable [REF]. In particular, rehabilitation for MSD, which requires physical activity (PA), may have great potential when combined with DHC based on the Internet, smartphone applications, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). Currently, most smartphones and smartwatches already include accelerometer-based PA trackers, allowing easy access even for older adults unfamiliar with innovative technology [REF]. The development of sensors and wearable devices not only enhances the convenience of systematic health management but also helps healthcare providers access and manage the rehabilitation of patients with MSD in daily life outside hospitals or facilities. In addition, by making the VR and AR content more interactive and engaging, patients can become interested in rehabilitation.DHC can offer a practical and flexible rehabilitation alternative for both patients and healthcare professionals. However, the effectiveness of DHC remains inadequately assessed; in particular, studies suggesting a relationship between MSD management and DHC are difficult to find [REF]. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of musculoskeletal rehabilitation using a DHC system.",human
"Lung cancer represents the first cause of cancer‐related deaths worldwide with over 1.5 million deaths in 2018 and an incidence superior to 2 million (11.6%), largely represented by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [REF]. Lung cancer is diagnosed at a locally advanced or metastatic stage in most cases, leading to no curative options and poor outcomes [REF]. In recent decades, many innovative strategies have been designed, namely tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting oncogenic drivers or immunotherapies [REF]. On the one hand, personalized medicine based on molecular targetable alterations has emerged from proof of concept to current clinical applications with restricted indications to a sub-population [REF]. On the other hand, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are now largely employed but obtain various response rates with fewer than 40% of responders among a population selected on programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression [REF].Many biomarkers have been investigated through the last decades to improve clinical cancer management and patient outcomes. First, biomarkers designed to predict better, and longer responses have been proposed, such as PD-L1. PD-L1 expression in tumor biopsy is the strategy that allows identifying a subpopulation of patients benefiting from ICI. For example, patients with a high PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS ≥ 50%) benefit from ICI in first-line (vs platinum-based chemotherapy) [REF]. However, resistance and relapse fatally occur in most cases. Consequently, global age-standardized 5-year survival remains within the range of 10-20% and a limited increase of up to 5% has been observed [REF], arguing the need to further refine and improve clinical lung cancer management. Therefore, other approaches have been explored in plasma or total blood. Soluble biomarkers have the advantages to allow real-time monitoring, repeatable, and easily feasible at every step of lung cancer (from the diagnosis throughout the progression of the disease) including non-evaluable radiographic diseases, named biological minimal residual diseases (MRD) [REF]. Liquid biopsy is now even integrated into clinical practice to research and/or monitor oncogenic addiction under TKI treatment [REF]. Circulating tumor-derived products are various and offer wide potential applications, especially in the ICI field [REF]. Inflammation-related biomarkers are particularly promising since inflammation is associated with a worse prognosis in solid tumors due to its effect on the immune modulation, into both tumor cells and its microenvironment, influencing disease-related outcomes [REF]. These biomarkers include immunoregulatory cells, soluble mediators, and a panel of features including absolute neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte counts, or ratios [REF]. To date, no soluble biomarker has yet been approved and validated for the management of lung cancer patients, despite important recent technical advances. In this context, there is an emerging interest to identify one to predict ICI benefit, overcoming limitations due to tissue-based analysis [REF].Numerous serum-based biomarkers have already been explored or are currently under investigation. Among the most promising, the blood cell count of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets have been associated with ICI efficacy with potential prognostic value [REF]. Other promising serum-based biomarkers include soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) [REF], circulating tumor cells (CTCs) [REF], blood tumor mutational burden (bTMB), or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) [REF].",human
"The dibenzo[b,f]azepine (1a) scaffold (Figure 1) is featured in commercial pharmaceuticals [REF] and other lead compounds [REF], ligands [REF] and in materials science with possible applications in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) [REF] and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) [REF].Dibenzo[b,f]azepine (1a), -oxepine (1b) and -thiepine (1c) as examples of dibenzo[b,f]heteropines (1) with the corresponding 10,11-dihydro derivatives (2).Commercial pharmaceutical agents based on dibenzo[b,f]azepine (1a), or the 10,11-dihydro derivative thereof (2a), include imipramine (3) and clomipramine (4) (tricyclic antidepressants) [REF], opipramol (5) (generalized anxiety disorder) [REF] and carbamazepine (6) (seizure disorders) [REF] (Figure 2).Selected pharmaceuticals with the dibenzo[b,f]azepine skeleton.10,11-Dihydrodibenzo[b,f]azepine-based ligand 7 and a methyl analogue thereof are known to form pincer complexes with Pd, Ir, Rh and Ln [REF], whereas a copper(II) wagon wheel complex of 8 was reported in a molecular organic framework (MOF) (Figure 3) [REF].Examples of 10,11-dihydrodibenzo[b,f]azepine-based ligands.4,4'-(5-(Pyridin-2-yl)-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepine-2,8-diyl)bis(N,N-diphenylaniline) (9) exhibits properties suitable for the use in organic light emitting diodes [REF] whereas dyes 10–12 were found suitable for the use in dye-sensitised solar cells (Figure 4) [REF].The dibenzo[b,f]azepine moiety in dyes with properties suitable for the use in organic light emitting diodes and dye-sensitised solar cells.Though analogous dibenzo[b,f]oxepines 1b, with an oxygen in the heterocyclic ring as opposed to nitrogen in azepines, are known from natural sources (compounds 13–18 as examples) [REF], the application thereof in a clinical setting is limited (Figure 5). Novartis CGP 3466 (19), a propargylamine derivative, showed excellent neuroprotective properties for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease in rat models (Figure 5) [REF]. Unfortunately, the promising preclinical studies of 19 could not be replicated in human trials [REF].Selective bioactive natural products (13–18) containing the dibenzo[b,f]oxepine scaffold and Novartis CGP 3466 (19).For more details on the early synthesis of dibenzo[b,f]azepine (1a), the extensive review prepared by Kricka and Ledwith [REF] in 1974, is recommended. While the review is lacking modern metal catalysis, it is still an excellent work covering early syntheses and properties. An analogous review published by Olivera et al. [REF] covers the topic of dibenzo[b,f]oxepines (1b) up to 2002.Other heteroatoms (e.g., O, N, S, P, B and Si) in the heterocyclic ring result in analogues of dibenzo[b,f]azepines and -oxepines. This group of compounds will thus be broadly referred to as dibenzo[b,f]heteropines (1).The first section of this review will cover the synthesis of dibenzo[b,f]heteropines (1) and 10,11-dihydrodibenzo[b,f]heteropines (2). The following section will briefly touch on functionalisation of the scaffold. While some reports are limited to the introduction of a single heteroatom, e.g., nitrogen in the case of azepines 1a or oxygen in the case of oxepines 1b, some approaches allow for the incorporation of a diverse scope of heteroatoms (e.g., O, N, S, P, B and Si) and may give access to a range of dibenzo[b,f]heteropines 1 using common intermediates [REF]. Therefore, this section will be broadly organised by reaction type responsible for ring closure.",human
"Cells utilize an arsenal of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which recognize structures within invading microbes termed pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Viral genomic nucleic acids are a preeminent PAMP during infection which trigger PRR activation, leading to the production of type-I interferons (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines by infected cells. IFN then acts in both an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in neighboring cells. These ISGs act as restriction factors in bystander cells to limit pathogen replication and spread. Alongside the direct antimicrobial activity of ISGs, the cytokines produced are also crucial to initiate adaptive immune responses. Since its discovery in 2013, the PRR detecting cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) - cyclic guanosine-monophosphate-adenosine-monophosphate synthase (cGAS) - has been a focal point within the field. cGAS detects dsDNA indiscriminate of whether it is host or pathogen derived. Instead of detecting structural differences between pathogen and host like classical PRRs (e.g. TLR9), it identifies the presence of dsDNA in the cytosol as a danger signal. Therefore, exposure of “self” dsDNA due to cellular disruption can also be detected and is a known damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that can lead to inflammation in sterile settings. For example, the rare but debilitating interferonopathies - Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), STING associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) and COPA Syndrome - can be caused by chronic activation of the cGAS-STING pathway [REF]. Moreover, in a wide range of more prevalent autoimmune and inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarthritis and Parkinson’s disease, STING signaling is thought to contribute towards pathology [REF]. These diseases are summarized in Figure 1A. The cGAS-STING pathway is therefore of great therapeutic interest: agonists are sought after for use as adjuvant in vaccines or for cancer immunotherapy; while antagonists could be developed as treatment for inflammatory or auto-immune diseases.The cGAS-STING pathway and disease. (A) Schematic showing diseases where STING signaling is thought to contribute to pathology. (B) The presence of mislocalised or pathogen associated dsDNA in the cytoplasm is detected by cGAS. Upon DNA binding, cGAS undergoes phase separation and generates the cyclic dinucleotide 2’3’-cGAMP required by the central hub of DNA sensing – STING – to translocate from the ER towards ERGIC. Here, STING recruits TBK1 to phosphorylate the master transcriptional regulators of innate immune activation - IRF3 and NF-κB. This results in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, primarily type I IFNs but also IL-6 and TNF-α.Mechanistically, when cGAS binds to dsDNA, its N-terminal domain polymerises, inducing phase separation (a phenomenon where liquids separate from each other forming distinct membrane-less compartments), and it produces the small cyclic di-nucleotide 2’,3’-cyclic-GMP-AMP (hereafter called cGAMP). cGAMP then acts as a second messenger and binds to the central hub of DNA sensing - STING - which translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, where it recruits TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). TBK1, in turn, activates the master regulators of innate immune activation: IRF3 and NFkB. IRF3 induces production of type-I IFN while NFkB drives expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines most notably IL-6 and TNF-α (Figure 1B) [REF].Studies published over the last decade challenged the classical model of PRR signaling. Rather than cGAS detecting dsDNA and inducing IFN and cytokine production in the cell where sensing occurred, the second messenger cGAMP can travel to neighboring cells where it activates STING and production of IFN and cytokines without the need for a PRR. Over the last decade, several studies have now described multiple mechanisms by which cGAMP can move between cells. It can travel freely through GAP junctions in juxtaposed cells [REF]. Moreover, viral particles have been shown to incorporate cGAMP derived from the viral producing cells, thereby transmitting cGAMP to the next infected cell [REF]. Both of these mechanisms effectively link the cytosol of one cell to the next and so cGAMP remains topologically contained within a compartment derived from the cell cytosol. More recently a role for cGAMP in the extracellular space has been considered. Exogenous cGAMP, and other similar cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) produced by bacteria as signaling molecules, were known to trigger IFN-β production by cells in vitro and reduce tumor growth by direct injection in vivo [REF]. However, it remained unclear how these CDNs entered the cytosol to activate STING. This changed between 2019 and 2021 when, in quick succession, five membrane transport proteins were shown to provide a route for CDNs to cross the cell membrane - SLC19A1, SLC46A2, P2X7, LRRC8A:C/E and ABCC1 [REF]. In addition, the antimicrobial defense peptide LL-37 has been reported to bind and chaperone cGAMP across the cell membrane [REF]. These proteins are separated into channels (SLC19A1, SLC46A2 and LRRC8A:C/E), transporters (ABCC1) and pores (P2X7 and LL-37) depending on their mode of action. For simplicity, we will collectively refer to them as cGAMP conduits.The study of how cGAMP is a second messenger that travels between cells constitutes a new field that has recently exploded. In this review, we detail and discuss the current knowledge of the different mechanisms by which cGAMP is transferred between cells summarized in Figure 2. We further highlight the diseases where these mechanisms play a role and the relevance this has to pharmaceutical design suggesting novel targets for innovative therapies.Extracellular 2’3’-cGAMP transport.

"Atherosclerosis is a significant cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) that can lead to heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, and major amputation [REF]. Approximately 17.9 million people die from CVD annually [REF]. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory process characterized by endothelial activation, accumulation of lipoproteins, and recruitment of inflammatory cells that leads to plaques that gradually enlarge and either restrict blood flow or embolize, damaging the heart or peripheral tissues [REF]. The current diagnostic methods for atherosclerosis are associated with rare but significant procedure-related consequences and considerable cost [REF]. The classical biomarkers, such as total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or serum triglyceride levels, are the gold standard diagnostic tests for atherosclerosis [REF]. C-reactive protein, a non-specific inflammatory marker, has emerged as a clinical marker for residual risk in atherosclerosis patients with good cholesterol control [REF]. Many of these biomarkers can diagnose CVD but cannot definitively predict stroke or myocardial infarction (MI) risk. There is a need for new CVD biomarkers that are cost-effective, improve detection, and identify novel treatment targets. As we enter the era of precision medicine, we need a more granular understanding of biomarkers that can be used as reliable screening tools with metrics to guide personalized intervention to prevent devastating clinical events. The American Heart Association proposed seven metrics in 2010 to define and monitor cardiovascular health [REF]. Managing the disease involves non-pharmacological methods (healthy diet, regular physical activity, and tobacco abstinence) [REF] and pharmacological interventions such as statins to control lipoprotein levels [REF], with newer options such as cholesterol-binding agents (e.g., ezetimibe) [REF] and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9, lowers LDL) inhibitors (e.g., evolocumab) [REF] also available. Notably, several studies have highlighted challenges in achieving therapeutic goals for serum lipids despite high-intensity statin therapy [REF]. In some cases, surgery or stent-based therapies are required to manage more severe atherosclerosis. While current strategies can slow the progression of atherosclerosis and/or prevent clinical events [REF], further research is needed to understand the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning plaque progression to identify targets for stabilization and/or plaque regression. One area of promise includes delineating cellular communication during atherosclerotic plaque development and progression. In this regard, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been identified as essential cell-cell communicators that may hold promise in improving our understanding of atherosclerotic disease—from biomarkers to disease pathogenesis [REF] (Figure 1). Exploring the role of extracellular vesicles in atherosclerosis: insights from biomarkers, therapeutics, pathobiology, and translational models. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) as versatile entities for various applications. EVs, small membrane-bound particles, have emerged as promising biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in various diseases. They have also shown great potential as therapeutic agents for their ability to carry and deliver bioactive molecules. Moreover, EVs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and atherosclerosis. Animal studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of the biology and functions of EVs, paving the way for their clinical translation.",human
"Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) is a cornerstone in the electrical treatment of heart failure [REF]. Conventional CRT involves biventricular (BiV) pacing from transvenous leads in the right ventricle (RV) and a coronary sinus branch to provide epicardial left ventricular (LV) stimulation. The widespread uptake of CRT has been driven by evidence showing significant benefits in both hospitalisations and mortality for patients with symptomatic dyssynchronous heart failure, that is, those with a LV ejection fraction (EF) of below 35%, and a QRS duration (QRSd) of greater than 130 milliseconds (ms) on a 12 lead electrocardiograph (ECG) [REF]. In recent years, the indications for CRT have expanded, with studies showing benefits in patients with moderate LV dysfunction who have a high burden of RV pacing [REF] and in those requiring an atrioventricular node ablation (AVNA) [REF].Despite its success, there is a significant proportion of patients who either do not derive clinical benefit from conventional CRT [REF], or who cannot be treated due to failure of LV lead implantation or inadequate LV lead performance due to issues such as high thresholds and phrenic nerve stimulation [REF]. Conduction system pacing (CSP), that is, stimulation of His-Purkinje tissue using a transvenous lead-based system [REF], is becoming increasingly popular, not only as a “bail-out” treatment in this population, but also potentially as a first-line option in selected patients [REF]. Initial studies on CSP focused on His-Bundle pacing (HBP), built on the attractive concept of restoring completely physiological ventricular activation. HBP achieves excellent cardiac resynchronisation, but implantation can be difficult, with success rates varying from 56%–95% [REF]. Challenges such as ventricular under-sensing, rising thresholds and requirement for lead revisions have also been observed during long-term follow up [REF]. Left Bundle Branch Pacing (LBBP) is a relatively novel form of CSP which involves screwing a pacing lead deep into the interventricular septum from the RV in order to capture the left bundle system [REF]. This technique has shown encouraging results from observational studies, with reported success rates of 80%–94% and significant improvements in LV function [REF]. Robust data from randomized trials, however, is currently lacking, and despite widespread uptake and investigation of CSP, important questions on its use remain.An area of significant clinical importance is the role of CSP both in the presence of, and in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is the most prevalent arrhythmia worldwide [REF], and is very common in the heart failure population, affecting up to a third of patients receiving CRT [REF]. Several studies have reported an attenuation of clinical benefit achieved with CRT in the presence of AF [REF]. There are likely several mechanisms behind this, including the reduction in cardiac output associated with loss of atrial systole [REF], low BiV pacing percentage due to uncontrolled ventricular rates [REF], and increased risk of inappropriate shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) [REF].In view of the significant deleterious consequences that AF has on conventional CRT, and the increasing use of CSP in this patient population, it is crucial to examine whether the presence of AF affects outcomes of HBP and LBBP. This article focuses on two areas. First, we evaluate the possible impact of AF on CSP, specifically LBBP, due to the inability to improve ventricular dyssynchrony by adjusting AVDs to achieve fusion pacing with intrinsic RV conduction [REF]. Next we review the largest clinical body of evidence in the case of CSP use following AVNA for AF. Finally, we discuss how future studies may address the important issue of CSP efficacy in patients with AF.",human
"Over the last several decades, a prodigious literature has amassed on depression in children and adolescents. Major and consequential epidemiological findings show that (1) depression exhibits high prevalence and is associated with substantial distress and burden around the world [REF]; (2) rates surge six-fold from childhood through late adolescence with steady, persistent rates throughout adulthood [REF]; and (3) rates are increasing across generations, with current prevalence rates exceeding those seen just 10 years ago [REF]. As such, public policy experts recommend annual screening of depression for individuals ages 12 and above [REF]. In an effort to better understand (and interrupt) the development of depression across childhood and adolescence, researchers have identified numerous risk and resilience factors that prospectively predict depression [REF]. Indicated or selective preventions can reduce the likelihood of future depression for youth1 with elevated symptoms or risk factors (Cuijpers et al., 2021a, 2021b). Moreover, there exist several evidence-based treatments, including psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies, each of which works generally equally well to relieve youth depression [REF]. Table 1 enumerates what we know regarding risk factors for youth depression, and Table 2 summarizes knowledge of evidence-based interventions (treatments and preventions).  The field has accumulated an impressive corpus of knowledge. At the same time, however, it is an undeniable reality that many young people across the world continue to suffer from and with depression, and there is an urgent and critical need to address this suffering for as many people as possible. Consider global data, for example, which indicate that the age-standardized prevalence of depression increased by 4.2% from 1990 to 2013, whereas the prevalence of anxiety decreased by 0.5% over this same period [REF]. This depression rise has been accompanied by co-occurring increases in rates of treatment; yet, no country included in this global analysis showed diminished depression rates over this time period. Even with many empirically supported treatments, there has been little sustained progress in reducing depression’s burden, or decreasing depression-related distress and suffering since 1980s. What can be done to address clear gaps to reduce the considerable and highly consequential distress and burden associated with youth depression? The purpose of this paper is to revisit and critically interrogate how and what we think we know about youth depression and its interventions. To this end, we review the sociohistorical context in which the phenomena termed “depression” were conceptualized and highlight the ways in which our academic notions and “best practice” assessment instruments both do and do not align with the symptoms and features of this depression construct. In a similar manner, we consider contemporary prevention and treatment strategies and provide rationale for expanding the range and scope of intervention efforts to more efficiently and effectively respond to youth depression and prioritize structural- and systems-level change.Ultimately, we strive to provide A New Hope for advancing progress on youth depression. To this end we take some positions (admittedly ours) for what we believe are directions and priorities that hold promise for both improving the scholarly understanding of youth depression and reducing depression-related distress and burden worldwide. We believe meaningful progress can be made without unduly devoting more time, energy, and limited resources investigating primarily unproven biological and technological solutions [REF] in the hope that some kind of singular breakthrough will meet massive current needs and close the prevalence-intervention gap.As Darth Vader famously said in the original Star Wars: A New Hope (episode IV), “Don’t be too proud of this technological terror you’ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet, or even a whole system, is insignificant next to the power of the Force.” Our perspective and the main points we emphasize can be summarized by focusing on the power of the FORCE: Fundamentals are essential to ground clear thinking informed by humility, history, and philosophy; Openness is needed to explore new ideas with scientific rigor and transparency; Relationships matter for understanding and intervening in youth depression across all levels in social–ecological systems; Constructs are key in the conceptualization, measurement, and classification of depression; and Evidence must be collected and evaluated, grounded in construct validation with epistemic iteration, to ensure accurate, reliable, reproducible knowledge with scientific and practical utility.In this paper, we have three main goals. First is to provide an overview of what the field knows about depression among youth, via Table 1 for depression risks across ecological levels and Table 2 for interventions. All of this knowledge is grounded in how depression as a construct is currently, and has historically, been conceptualized and measured. Our second goal is to reinvigorate serious academic progress focused on defining and explicating conceptually what depression is among youth as informed by developmental psychopathology. As we summarize in our historical review, necessary and important steps in the construct validation process (content conceptualization; measurement) were minimally engaged in the study of adult depression, and this incomplete conceptual understanding has carried forth in the study of depression among youth. Our final goal is to address immediate needs to reduce the prevalence and distress associated with youth depression. We propose ways for responding to unmet needs of youth at risk for and affected by depression, as well as their families and communities. We begin with an eye toward how we might improve the science of youth depression, with an emphasis on issues of methods, measures, and construct validity. We then propose directions to enhance interventions to alleviate the prevalence and distress of youth depression and suggest efforts that engage multiple ecological systems and stakeholders.",human
"Drosophila melanogaster is an established model organism for developmental studies and due to the remarkable conservation of the signaling regulating autophagy, it has been used to better understand the relationship of this catabolic pathway with the genetic conditions that in humans are responsible of a class of neuronal diseases called proteinopathies (PPs). Autophagy is a key cellular pathway that, together with the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), controls protein homeostasis by degrading misfolded proteins or exhausted organelles otherwise detrimental to the cells [REF]. Autophagy and UPS are closely linked, in fact protein ubiquitination is a key step for the cargo recognition by the autophagic receptors and alterations in one pathway may affect the activity of the other [REF]. Both pathways are crucial for cell survival particularly in neurons where their perturbation causes age-associated disorders including neurodegenerative diseases [REF]. In this review, we will illustrate the contribution of Drosophila studies to the understanding of the role of autophagy in PPs induced by mutations in genes responsible for the most common neurodegenerative diseases (summarized in Table 1). Furthermore, we will discuss how flies could be used to further improve our understanding of the mechanisms that control these diseases, particularly those that are linked to mutations in genes that are physiologically involved in the control of the autophagic-proteostatic pathway.Drosophila models of human proteinopathies discussed in this article, their principal mechanism, and components of pathways (modifiers) that can either suppress on enhance the toxic phenotype.The length of the CAG correlates with progressive motor decline and neuronal death [REF]Kinetic of aggregate formation [REF] Huntingtin role in autophagy [REF]PolyQ oligomers forms “de novo” aggregates and increase their original size by directly using the endogenous prion-forming protein Rnq1 in its amyloid-like prion conformation [REF] Endogenous dhtt [REF] TOR inhibition [REF]Chaperones [REF]Histone deacetylase [REF] Antioxidant pathway [REF]deubiquitinating enzymes [REF] Glutamine metabolism [REF]Rab5 [REF]; PSA [REF]Compounds that target mHTT to autophagosomes [REF]Retinal degeneration and loss of interneurons projections [REF] Reduced dendritic neurons arborization [REF] Role of chaperones respect to polyQ containing proteins [REF]TOR inhibition [REF] Rac-PAK pathway [REF] CHIP and NMNAT [REF]Transglutaminases 5 (Lee et al., 2022b)Ataxin1 phosphorylation on Ser776 [REF] Atx2 is involved in translational control [REF] Aggregate formation and neuronal degeneration, critical for SCA3 [REF] Atx1 promotes Ataxin2 aggregation [REF] Atx3 enhances the aggregation of the mutant ATXN3 [REF] Catalytical activity of Atx3 is necessary for its autoprotective role [REF ]Mutant ATXN3 expression leads to abnormal eye morphology and motility defects [REF] Functional ATXN3 deubiquitination activity [REF] Ubiquitin ligases as Cullins and Praja1 [REF] Antioxidant drugs [REF] Hsc70-4 [REF] Toxicity of different numbers of GGGGCC repeats and formation of RNA foci [REF] Polypeptides containing GR and PR repeats are the most toxic role of C9orf72 in autophagy [REF] overexpression of SIGMAR1 (Lee et al., 2020a)SOD1 is involved in protein misfolding, and it is necessary for neuronal health [REF] SOD1 was found in a complex with Atg9/Beclin1 to control P62/SQSTM1 accumulation [REF] Mutations in SOD1 lead to mitochondrial impairments and non-autonomous signaling from glial to neurons and in MNs [REF] DUB-USP7 [REF] L3MBTL1 and SETD8 [REF] USP7 which reduces SMAD2/TGF-β pathway [REF] TBPH-null mutant is semi-lethal in flies [REF].

"For biodiversity conservation, it is necessary to monitor changes in the natural environment and ecosystems over large spatial and temporal scales. Monitoring efforts often focus on indicator species or groups, such as birds [REF]. Among bird monitoring methods, sound recordings are often used owing to the ability to identify species, even when they cannot be easily seen in the field [REF].Citizen science, which refers to public participation in scientific research, can be used to obtain data over long periods and at large spatial scales (Cohn, 2008; Silvertown, 2009; Bonney et al., 2009a). This approach can be used to analyze sound recordings of birds [REF]. Training to improve identification skills is expected to increase the data quantity and quality [REF] and to improve the participants’ interest in the natural environment [REF]. System for automated birdsong recognition has been developed considerably [REF], and a library of sounds annotated by citizens will contribute to further improving accuracy of automated birdsong recognition.In citizen science projects, the use of online training is increasing [REF], particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic [REF]. Online training is characterized by low costs and easy accessibility [REF]. However, few studies have examined the effectiveness of online training for species identification in citizen science projects [REF]. Quiz-style training is more efficient than simple memorization due to the testing effect, in which recalling information strengthens memory more than simply writing or listening to the information [REF]. Online quizzes have been used for short-term birdsong identification training, including Bird Song Hero [REF], Photo + Sound Quiz [REF], Larkwire [REF], Bird Research Birdsong Quiz [REF]. However, in existing quiz-based online training, participants repeatedly and/or randomly listen to full-length sound sources, irrespective of their levels of proficiency in identifying bird songs, or they have to customize the training content (select the set of songs) themselves. Therefore, more efficient and user-friendly quiz-based training is needed.Adaptive learning involves tailoring learning content, feedback, and interfaces to individual users [REF], and the personalization is often automatic. Recently, the effectiveness of adaptive learning has been evaluated in various fields [REF]. In adaptive learning, memory mechanisms are important elements [REF] and have been a longstanding research topic. The forgetting curve hypotheses that Ebbinghaus (1885) proposed are the first theories revealed by experiments in the study of memory mechanisms. The forgetting curve can be explained as follows: the most rapid increase in memory occurs after the first learning, the content learned is exponentially forgotten after learning, repeated learning at intervals (repetition learning and spaced learning) increases the amount of time that memory can be retained, the more information that came in immediately before, the more it is retained in short-term memory, and the more it can be remembered (the recency effect) [REF]. Learning effectiveness of repetition learning and spaced learning is thought to be improved by setting appropriate learning intervals, as revealed by meta-analyses [REF]. The recency effect is that when asked to recall a list of items in any order, people tend to recall from the end of the list and tend to recall those items best [REF]. The memory mechanisms are qualitatively applicable in a quiz-style online training tool on birds through controlling order of bird species in the quiz, but there is no a priori information that quantitatively optimizes the number of quiz training questions, the time from quiz to test, or interval between questions. Understanding how theories relate to training effectiveness may help guide the development of online training tools for learning bird identification from recorded songs and for improving interest in birds and natural environments. We developed a new online training tool, TORI-TORE, consisting of multiple-choice quizzes for improving bird identification skills from recorded bird songs and fostering citizen scientists skilled in birdsong identification. In this study, we (1) compared species identification skills and attitudes toward birds based on pre- and post- test results and training questionnaires, (2) compared test results and attitudes in a randomized controlled trial to reveal if automatically personalized online training (hereinafter, “adaptive training”) inspired by adaptive learning is more effective than conventional training (hereinafter, “baseline training”), and (3) tested the prediction that a large number of quiz training questions, short lag between training and testing, and long question intervals improve species identification test scores based on forgetting curve hypotheses.",human
"Cyborg and bionic systems (CBS) focus on the integration of organic and biomechatronic components, with the aim of either restoring lost function or normalizing disease symptoms. Examples of such techniques may include brain–computer interfaces or neuromodulation technologies [e.g., deep brain stimulation (DBS)] [REF].Targeting a reliable set of biomarkers is crucial for the development of a useful CBS [REF]. Electrophysiological systems such as the brain or heart generate oscillatory activity over a spectrum of frequencies. System outputs such as movement or cognitive process reflect a complex and nonlinear integration of oscillatory neural population activity [REF]. This can be accessed using a range of approaches including invasive local field potential or electrocorticogram recordings, or non-invasive measures with either electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography.Multiple neural oscillations across temporal and spatial scales participate in neural information processing [REF]. In general, low-frequency oscillations are thought to control long-range synchronization, while high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are believed to be linked to local computation [REF]. The question of how these neural oscillations contribute to top-down neural transmission has raised great interest [REF]. Oscillatory neural activities in multiple frequencies are modulated during a range of tasks (e.g., cognitive tasks) [REF]. Furthermore, brain stimulation techniques that entrain (or alter) oscillatory activity are in turn known to impact task performance [REF]. This has led to the belief that oscillatory neural population activity has a causal impact on behavior [REF]. In keeping with this, it is also becoming increasingly apparent that neurophysiological oscillations may serve as a biomarker for pathophysiological states such as Parkinson's disease [REF].One particular type of oscillatory coupling, known as cross-frequency coupling (CFC), has gained great interest in medicine and neuroscience. CFC characterizes interactions across different frequency rhythms and is modulated during both physiological processing and pathological states, such as spasticity [REF]. CFC denotes the statistical association between the phase, amplitude, or frequency of 2 rhythms [REF]. CFC applied on simultaneous recordings from different cortical areas reveals a coordinated information exchange in cognitive, sensory, and motor events from long distance to local computation [REF]. There are 4 commonly studied types of CFC: phase–amplitude coupling (PAC), amplitude–amplitude coupling (AAC), phase–frequency coupling, and phase–phase coupling [REF].PAC [REF] and AAC [REF] attracted much attention for their association with physiological processing and pathological states. These 2 types of CFCs are depicted in Fig. 1. Figure 1F shows a simulation of PAC, where the activity at 13 Hz is modulated by the phase of a 2.5-Hz wave, forming a nested structure, i.e., XPAC(t) = (xp(t)+1)·sin(2π×13t), where xp(t) = sin(2π×2.5t). On the other hand, AAC refers to when the amplitude of the 13-Hz activity is modulated by the envelope of a 2.5-Hz wave (Fig. 1G). In this case, the form of the resulting signal is XAAC(t) = |H[xa(t)]|·sin(2π×13t), where H[·] represents the Hilbert transform (HT) of a signal xa(t) = V·sin(2π×2.5t), and V is a time-varying variable (Fig. 1B). Both XPAC(t) and XAAC(t) formulated here refer to 13-Hz activities, and both the instantaneous phase (Fig. 1D) and amplitude (Fig. 1E) are derived from the HT of the inputs.Concepts of phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude–amplitude coupling (AAC).

Firstly, the review will commence by defining CFC and summarizing the current state of knowledge regarding its methodological advances. Next, we will summarize the latest studies on CFC in cognitive processes, and various neurological disorders, including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease, plus discussions over the potential neuromodulation techniques for clinical interventions. Lastly, the review will consider the challenges and opportunities for the integration of CFC technology into CBS, with future trends in this field being highlighted.",human
"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global security threat [REF]. It is driven by the inappropriate use of antimicrobials, particularly antibiotics, in humans, animals and veterinary medicine.1 The inappropriate use of antibiotics also exacts adverse clinical and economic effects on patients [REF]. The adverse economic effects include increased costs of healthcare borne by patients, whereas the adverse clinical effects include increased consumption of antibiotics, increased length of hospital stay, morbidity, mortality and certainly the emergence of AMR [REF]. AMR is considered one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development [REF]. AMR accounts for an estimated 700 000 deaths per year globally [REF]. If AMR is not curbed, it could result in about 10 million global deaths per year and 4.1 million deaths in Africa by 2050 [REF]. AMR could also have devastating economic impacts as it could result in a 2% to 3.5% reduction in global Gross Domestic Product by 2050, a loss of between 60 and 100 trillion US dollars (US$) of economic output, increased treatment costs (resulting in increased morbidity and mortality in poorly funded fragile health systems in many LMICs) and a failure to achieve universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in LMICs [REF]. Increased morbidity and mortality (arising from rising rates of AMR) could result in declining labour supply and an additional 28.3 million people being pushed into extreme poverty by 2050 due to high costs of treatment and chronic infections [REF]. AMR related morbidity and mortality in animal husbandry could affect the livelihood of farmers and also threaten food security [REF]. Another danger of AMR is that it results in market failures, low return on investment and disinclination to invest in research and development in new antimicrobial agents, particularly antibiotics [REF]. Rather than invest in developing new antibiotics, multinational pharmaceutical companies are choosing the more profitable option of developing drugs for non-communicable diseases [REF]. Also, the few new antibiotics being developed are expensive and show little benefit compared to existing antibiotics [REF]. For example, the World Health Organization notes that only 2 out of the 12 antibiotics approved since 2017 represent a new class of antibiotics.9 The remainder are derivatives of already existing antibiotics [REF]. Citizens of LMICs would have to bear the unduly high costs of purchasing these newly developed antibiotics since existing and cheaper antibiotics are ineffective [REF]. Sadly, poverty and other factors such as weak antibiotic supply chain management systems deny many citizens of LMICs from accessing both old and new antibiotics [REF]. Globally, the inappropriate use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and agriculture compounds the problem of AMR as it results in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes, which can be transmitted to humans through the food chain or through direct contact with animals [REF]. However, in LMICs, the inappropriate use of antibiotics in agriculture is exacerbated by weak or non-existent regulatory frameworks [REF]. The COVID 19 pandemic has aggravated the global problem of inappropriate antibiotic use [REF]. A lack of definite treatment protocols fuelled the irrational prescription and use of antibiotics for COVID 19 patients [REF]. The danger of such irrational use of antibiotics is the future emergence of drug resistant bacteria in the community and healthcare settings [REF]. Although inappropriate antibiotic use is a global problem, the political and socio-cultural peculiarities in many LMICs make it a multifaceted problem [REF]. Therefore, policy formulation and other efforts to curb inappropriate antibiotic use (and AMR) in LMICs must have a precise knowledge of the specific drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs [REF]. The focus of this review is to discuss the drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use in LMICs.",human
"Promoting fruit and vegetable (FV) intake in children is critical to support proper brain and body development [REF] and to establish healthy dietary habits that persist over the life course [REF]. Despite the long-standing explicit guidelines and evidence regarding the importance of FV intake, average FV consumption amongst all US children (2–18 years old) remains low: only 40% and 7% meet the recommended intake for fruits and vegetables, respectively [REF]. The current average intake for children is only 0.9 cup equivalents of each (60% of recommended), with consumption levels that decline with age and are restricted in variety relative to recommended guidelines [REF]. Thus, in support of public health, it is important to develop strategies to improve FV intake in children.Preschool age children begin developing their own dietary habits by gaining autonomy over their food choice [REF], evident in the decline in FV intake as children transition from preschool age to school age [REF]. Thus, preschool age (2–5 years old) may be an optimal time for a dietary intervention to promote FV intake throughout the lifespan. However, there are key gaps and inconsistencies present in diet research that will be discussed below.Consideration of the measurement tool in diet research is particularly important in young children because they are unable to accurately report their own intake [REF]. Parent-reported measures, while most frequently used in research [REF], have been repeatedly shown to be subjective and prone to recall and reporting bias [REF]; this is especially problematic when parents are asked to report on periods of time for which they are not directly responsible for child feeding, such as during childcare hours [REF]. As such, use of objective observation measures is critical with this age group [REF]. An additional objective measure specific to FV intake is the skin carotenoid level [REF]. When FVs are consumed, the carotenoids in the FVs are absorbed and then deposited in various tissues including the skin [REF], which can be quantified using reflection spectroscopy [REF] to objectively measure FV intake within the previous two to four weeks [REF]. Due to the discrepancies associated with the different techniques used to measure dietary intake, reviews should distinguish between studies with subjective and objective measures to adequately evaluate the validity of a large proportion of this body of work.The setting of dietary interventions in children is another significant consideration. In 2019, nearly two-thirds (64%) of 3–5 year old children in the US were enrolled in childcare or preschool with 64.7% of all enrollments being full-time [REF]. Thus, childcare services have a large influence on children’s development in the US [REF], and this may be an efficient avenue to effectively influence children’s behavior, namely dietary behavior [REF]. In evaluating intervention effectiveness, it is therefore vital to consider the setting of the interventions to avoid extrapolating evidence for intervention effectiveness to other contexts.Behavior change techniques (BCTs) are the intervention components regarded as the “active ingredients” within behavior change interventions. It is often helpful to examine the use of BCTs within interventions aimed at changing dietary behaviors to assess the mechanism by which interventions may be effective at causing the behavior change [REF]. Given the heterogeneity in intervention techniques used in dietary interventions, evaluation of BCTs in reviews and meta-analyses may provide important insight on the underlying intervention components that may be at play [REF].Use of theory in developing an intervention is another metric that can be examined within interventions that target behavior change. This metric evaluates how exactly a specific theory and its concepts are utilized to tailor intervention techniques and components and allows for a better understanding of why an intervention is effective or ineffective. This knowledge may then be evaluated in systematic reviews and applied to the refinement of an interventions to better target the tenets of the theory [REF].A recent systematic literature review by Hodder et al. [REF] of FV intake in children five years and younger identified 80 trials reporting a large variety of interventions to promote FV intake in preschool-aged children globally. This review included interventions conducted in all settings and using various intervention methods, though it did not distinguish between subjective and objective measurements of food intake or evaluate BCTs and use of theory in the included studies. The main implications drawn from these findings is that more pragmatic studies are needed to test the interventions, and that these interventions should be based on BCTs and theoretical frameworks that may explain the mechanism by which these interventions may change children’s dietary behaviors related to FV intake [REF].In 2012, Hendrie et al. [REF] published a systematic review to explore the use of BCTs in home- and school-based interventions for the prevention of childhood obesity involving children and parents. More specifically, they compared the number and type of BCTs used in effective and ineffective studies and reported that effective studies incorporated more BCTs than ineffective studies (median of 10 versus 6.5). However, this review was not specific to interventions aimed at improving FV intake, so we are unable to determine whether these findings are applicable to FV interventions specifically.In 2017, Hendrie et al. [REF] used a similar technique to evaluate interventions to improve vegetable intake in children and found that the BCTs “Repeated exposure”, “Provision of staff training,” and “Planning for social support or change,” were associated with effective behavior change. This review only examined interventions conducted in home or community settings and, therefore, these results may not be extrapolated to interventions conducted in other settings, such as childcare centers [REF]. Similar to the review by Hodder et al., these two reviews are limited by their inclusion of subjective measures of dietary change, and lack of evaluation of use of theory within the included studies.To our knowledge, there are currently no published reviews that evaluate both the effectiveness of FV interventions specifically in childcare- or preschool-based settings in the US, and the use of theoretical frameworks and BCTs within these studies. This is a critical gap as comparing different types of interventions, exploring whether use of theory and BCTs moderate effectiveness, and summarizing the level of evidence is critically needed to develop effective interventions in the future. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to systematically identify published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating childcare- or preschool-based interventions designed to increase objectively measured intake of fruits, vegetables, or both, in preschool children (aged 2–5 years) in the US and to summarize their methods and results. This review also aimed to identify the use of theoretical models and BCTs in each study and to assess their effectiveness in improving FV intake.",human
"Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise from chromaffin cells and frequently secrete one or more catecholamines. Pheochromocytomas arise from the adrenal medulla, whereas PGLs originate from extra-adrenal sympathetic or parasympathetic ganglia [REF]. The diagnosis may be disregarded during life and be discovered in 0.05%–0.1% of autopsies [REF]. Usually, PCCs are detected by chance (21.1%–57.6%) and constitute approximately 4%–8% of all adrenal incidentalomas [REF]. Updating the previous epidemiological data where 10% of PCCs/PGLs were identified as malignant [REF], all PCCs/PGLs are now considered potentially metastatic [REF], and all patients should be advised for genetic counseling [REF]. Currently, 25%–30% or more of these tumors are attributed to genetic background [REF]; at least 15 PCC/PGL-related genes have been recognized, and 12 syndromes have been described [REF].The diagnosis of PCC/PGL is based on detecting urinary metanephrines [REF]. Following the biochemical diagnosis, CT scanning should be performed [REF]. At the same time, functional imaging should also be used in suspicion of metastatic disease, including positron emission tomography (PET)/CT with various radiotracers [REF] and 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy, especially to recognize those patients that could also be treated with 131I-MIBG [REF]. After a multidisciplinary team consideration, most PCCs and PGLs can be treated surgically [REF]. Still, for some unfit cases, therapy with 131I-MIBG could also be a reasonable option, if 123I-MIBG scintigraphy is positive [REF]. For metastatic PCCs/PGLs, different combinations of conventional chemotherapy, mainly the regimen cyclophosphamide, vincristine and dacarbazine, have been used for many years [REF], but recently, novel agents, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors [REF], somatostatin analogs [REF], hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), DNA-alkylating agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors [REF] are under testing for the treatment of metastatic/unresectable setting of these rare neuroendocrine tumors.Among those approaches, the inhibition of histone deacetylation via HDACis has been entered into the focus of this study. The imbalance between histone acetylation and deacetylation can epigenetically change the expression of tumor suppressor genes and/or proto-oncogenes [REF], that control cancer evolution and progression [REF]. So far, 18 human HDACs have been identified into two families according to the implicated co-factor [REF]. Different classes of HDACs are located in different cellular compartments [REF]. An overview of the classification of human HDACs, their cellular localization and their tissue expression is presented in Table 1 [REF].HDACs are overexpressed in hematologic and solid malignancies, and their inhibition became a promising anti-cancer theory. HDACis include both natural and synthetic compounds. Some HDACis selectively inhibit specific HDAC classes while others are pan-HDAC inhibitors [REF]. HDACis increase acetylation of both histone and non-histone proteins to a significant degree, resulting in cell cycle arrest, cell differentiation, induction of cell death/apoptosis (e.g., oxidative stress generation, disruption of mitosis and mitotic cell death, autophagy, etc.), as well as blocking of angiogenesis [REF]. Fig. 1 depicts the multiple mechanisms of action of HDACis [REF]. The main HDACis under clinical testing, their targeted HDACs, their chemical nature and their approved indications are presented in Table 2 [REF]. The antitumor activity of these agents depends on the specific type and stage of cancer, the characteristics of each patient and the administered dose [REF].Abbreviations: CTCL: Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma; PTCL: Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma; DLBCL: Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma; MM: Multiple Myeloma; AML: Acute Myeloid Leukemia; HCC: Hepatocellular Carcinoma; HL: Hodgkin Lymphoma; NHL: Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma; CML: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia; CLL: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia; NSCLC: Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma.In this review, we summarize the research background and the development status of currently tested HDACis for treating metastatic/unresectable PCCs/PGLs and gather all published evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies up to clinical trials, supporting their implementation in oncological practice. The most important clinical trials investigating the use of HDACis in the treatment of PCCs/PGLs and NETs are presented in Table 3.",human
"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses in humans and animals, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), and coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19). Last two decades, several outbreaks of coronaviruses are observed. The SARS outbreak was reported in 2003 with about 8000 cases and more than 700 deaths with an estimated case fatality rate (CFR) of 10% [REF]. According to WHO (Jan 2020), MERS has infected about 2500 cases with more than 800 deaths (CFR ≈ 34.3%) in different countries since 2012 [REF]. The report of WHO showed the novel coronavirus pneumonia, COVID-19, has infected about 177,108,695 confirmed cases with 3,840,223 deaths until 18 June 2021 [REF], and any protective or treatment factor is demanding for health managers.Currently, there are contradictory reports about the effect of smoking on COVID-19 infections. If smokers are protective of COVID-19, new studies could be designed to explore the mechanism of protection. Nevertheless, if smokers are at higher risk, it will be a wake-up call for health providers to adopt separate policies to protect smokers. Currently, we know that smoking is one of the main risk factors for about 20 types and subtypes of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and diabetes. Among the various body parts, the most involvement is directly connected with the respiratory system, digestive system, and nervous system [REF]. According to the 2025 estimation of the World Health Organization (WHO), there will be about 1.1 billion smokers worldwide [REF]. International statistics show that there are about 8 million deaths each year, mostly (80%) in low- and middle-income countries, equivalent to a total economic cost of US$1.4 trillion each year [REF].Currently, it is clear that current and former smokers had a higher percentage among COVID-19 patients in ICU (~ 2.4 times) and mechanical ventilation support, and they had higher mortality rates and more severe cases (~ 1.4 times) [REF]. Even after treatment, exacerbations of COVID-19 are associated with tobacco smoking in the smokers’ group [REF]. Hospitalized smokers have more severe infections and complications, especially pulmonary fibrosis, as the central pathology of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 [REF]. Like MERS, a higher CFR in hospitalized patients with smoking history is also reported for COVID-19 [REF].Moreover, tobacco smoking is involved in more severe complications of COVID-19 infections [REF]. It has been shown that cigarette smoke upregulates ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner in lung epithelium, including the goblet, club, Clara cells, and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells of human and rodent lungs, and quitting smoking decreases ACE2 expression (reversible) [REF]. So, smoking history is a predictor of ACE2 expression in the lung cells. The expression of Cathepsin B, which is a protease that activates the spike protein of the virus, is also increased in mice and human cells exposed to cigarette smoke [REF]. So, it seems that the patients’ positive smoking history (current and former smokers) can make them more susceptible to COVID-19. Also, results regarding the effect of smoking on the expression of ACE2 are opposite; besides up-regulation (preprint) [REF], down-regulation [REF] is reported [REF].On the other hand, based on the current epidemiological studies on COVID-19, China [REF], Italia [REF], Europe, and the United States [REF] have reported lower incidence of infected smokers. Tajlil et al. had performed a meta-analysis on 12 reports of COVID-19 epidemiologic data (11,382 cases, including 3,827 cases in 10 Chinese reports and 7,555 cases in two USA reports). They had concluded the significantly lower proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with smoking history [REF]. It should be added that all the current smokers, when entering the hospital or the ICU, are forced to stop nicotine uptake. Besides, a large meta-analysis of over 17,278,392 COVID-19 infected adults showed a lower incidence of infection in smokers [REF], which is concordant to former findings in China [REF], France [REF], and the United States [REF]. However, several studies showed adverse effects of smoking on COVID-19 outcomes such as studies in Kuwait (1096 cases), England (3179 cases), and USA (12,347 cases) [REF]. There is no solid evidence about the protective effect (prevention or treatment) of smoking on COVID-19 infection. The important thing to remember about epidemiological studies is that they have limitations, especially in this field. These limitations include things like the heterogeneity of COPD disease, the heterogeneity of COVID-19 disease, and the restrictions connected to it discussed the characteristics of epidemiological investigations, such as sample sizes and ascertainment bias [REF].In this study, we first tried to systematically show that cigarette smoke effects, although similar in some effects, are different from pure nicotine. Therefore, many experiments on the effect of smoke conclude their results as a probable effect of nicotine as an equivalent univalent. These conclusions can be misleading. Additionally, different cell responses to nicotine are dose-dependent. Considering the prevalence of the COVID-19 epidemic and different published results in this field and the existing judgments, an attempt was made to investigate the role of cigarettes and nicotine in this epidemic disease. Failure to assign this issue can cause misleading and diversion of people and health providers. Therefore, in this study, we have tried to take a closer basic-clinical look at this issue.In the first step, articles containing the MeSH terms of “smoke” and “COVID-19” and “meta-analysis” were investigated only in PubMed (16 Jul 2021) (Fig. 1-a).

"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies in males with an increasing prevalence in both developed and developing countries and is one of the major causes of cancer-related death in men [REF]. Although the standard treatment for local PCa is surgery and radiotherapy, some other treatment protocols, such as brachytherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) especially in patients with advanced PCa are commonly used [REF].The primary purpose of ADT is to reduce circulating androgen levels and block androgen signaling, since androgen has an important role in cancer cell proliferation and consequently disease progression [REF]. Indeed, ADT is a powerful and useful treatment approach that causes a decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and tumor volume. It provides a temporary relief to patients although some patients may experience severe to moderate side effects such as hot flashes and sexual dysfunction during treatment [REF].The response to the ADT may be observed in three phases: early, developing, and late phases (Fig. 1). The early phase is characteristic with decreased level of PSA, tumor regression, and increased quality of life while the late phase is characteristic with castration resistance, relapse, and highly metastatic and aggressive tumors. In the intervening period, which can be considered as a developing phase, homeostatic response of the cells leads to a progressive development of alteration in various cellular signaling mechanisms leading to the late phase response (Fig. 1). The cellular responses include reactivation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling through alternative mechanisms, decreased adhesion, increased motility and invasion, and altered tonic cell survival signaling. Mechanisms involving re-activation of androgen signaling include intra-tumor de novo androgen production, amplification of AR gene, mutations in the ligand-binding domain of AR (AR-LBD), expression of some constitutively active AR isoforms, overexpression of AR co-regulators, and androgen-independent AR activation [REF]. These events lead to a more aggressive phenotype of the disease called castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), generally 24–36 months after the initiation of ADT [REF]. In this stage, metastatic spread is observed in most of the patients and the average life expectancy is 18–24 months afterward [REF].Another altered mechanism is epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which decreases adhesion and increases motility and invasion. Growing evidence links EMT to ADT in advanced PCa despite the lack of consensus regarding the effect of androgen signaling in the regulation of EMT [REF]. Indeed, initial studies have reported that ADT may induce EMT in advanced PCa at least through the “cadherin switching” mechanism [REF]. These reports led to further investigation, which pointed to an aberrant activation of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β) signaling [REF], a multifunctional pathway regulating proliferation and differentiation of cells and cellular signaling molecules involved in cadherin switching [REF]. The term “cadherin switching” generally refers to diminished expression of E-cadherin, encoded by Cdh1, and increased expression of N-cadherin, encoded by Cdh2, in cells [REF]. Cadherin switching is a normal process during embryogenesis and cannot initiate tumorigenesis alone in healthy cells but may confer further migration and increased invasive capabilities on tumor cells [REF]. Decreased Cdh1 expression disrupts epithelial tissue structure causing cells to detach from one another and move freely [REF]. Consistently, decreased expression of Cdh1 depends on cadherin switching, a process closely associated with tumor invasion and metastasis, two common characteristics of advanced cancers [REF]. N-cadherin confers enhanced migratory and invasive abilities on tumor cells, which contrasts the inhibitory role of E-cadherin on migration and invasion [REF].In this study, we aim to review the current literature to dissect the role of ADT on cadherin switching in advanced PCa from a molecular perspective.",human
"Therapies that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), ‘anti-VEGFs’, play a key role in reducing angiogenesis and vascular permeability [REF] with the aim to prevent sight loss in ocular diseases, including neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), diabetic macular oedema (DMO), macular oedema caused by retinal vein occlusion and myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV). Currently, anti-VEGF treatments are exclusively administered to patients via intraocular injections for local retinal delivery of the drug. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world studies have identified that anti-VEGF treatments, including Ranibizumab, Bevacizumab and Aflibercept [REF] impart visual improvement to up to 40% of patients with nAMD, DMO and macular oedema and to about half of patients with myopic CNV [REF].Anti-VEGF treatment regimens can differ between patients with most patients requiring continual or even indefinite treatments. Patients typically receiving either proactive or pro re nata (PRN) approaches. Proactive treatment protocols involve regular anti-VEGF injections at fixed intervals, usually monthly. Prevention of further sight loss is still dependent on regular monitoring and patient adherence to their treatment regimens [REF]. Previous studies have identified failure in adherence of patients to their anti-VEGF treatment regimens or follow up visits, with various reasons reported. These reasons include the frequency of required visits, difficulty in attending clinical and follow-up appointments, financial limitations, pain, disbelief in the benefit of the treatment, and refusal of continuance of treatment due to associated comorbid conditions [REF].The World Health Organization (WHO) defines adherence to long-term therapy as ‘the extent to which a person’s behaviour—taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes—corresponds with agreed recommendations from a healthcare provider’ [REF]. There are some differences to the definitions for ‘adherence’ and ‘persistence’ in the literature. Non-adherence, in patients receiving anti-VEGF therapies, would involve deviating from their prescribed therapeutic regimen. Persistence would typically define the duration of continuation with therapy [REF], and non-persistence most often refers to patients choosing to stop their medication against the prescriber’s recommendation. Non-persistence definitions reported in patients on anti-VEGF treatments would typically include ‘discontinuation of therapy’ and ‘loss to follow up’, whereas non-adherence could refer to ‘missed appointments,’ ‘irregular attendance’ or ‘gaps in treatment’.Medication non-adherence may occur at different points in a patient’s decision-making process. It may occur at the outset of their therapy or at some point during their therapy. Previous studies have reported a variation in the rates of therapy discontinuation (non-persistence) of anti-VEGF treatment in diseases such as nAMD to be approximately 42% [REF] and 50% [REF], with factors such as patients’ level of awareness of their disease and treatment affecting compliance to therapy. Similarly, the adherence to treatment regimen with anti VEGF therapy improves the clinical outcomes in patients with nAMD, DMO and CNV [REF].Recently, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted patient-led adherence to intravitreal injections [REF]. The governments around the world imposed strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease. This included stay-at-home advisories and a reduction in non-urgent care [REF]. The consensus among retinal disease experts was that for neovascular AMD, retinal vein occlusion and diabetic retinopathy patients, anti-VEGF injection regimens should continue during lockdowns or curtailed non-urgent ophthalmic services [REF]. Regardless, from a patient perspective, fear of infection, difficulty travelling, and COVID-19 infection within a household were likely to have had an impact on attendance to appointments [REF]. It is therefore crucial to quantify levels of non-adherence during the pandemic to inform future practices to minimise disruption to essential ophthalmic care.Recent systematic reviews have investigated patient non-adherence and non-persistence to anti-VEGF treatment regimens in nAMD and DMO specifically [REF]; all identify a need for further investigation in this understudied area. In particular, there is a need to investigate reasons for non-adherence and non-persistence, rates of attendance for follow-ups and to determine strategies to tackle these challenges of under-treatment and reduce the burden of ‘sight-threatening’ chronic eye diseases for patients and healthcare providers. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the prevalence of patient-led non-adherence/non-persistence to intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy, and the barriers/reasons associated with non-adherence/non-persistence in different disease states.",human
"Anxiety disorder is a common mental illness with persistent fear or anxiety (typically lasting six months or more) and related behavioral disturbances [REF]. For a long time in the past, the incidence of anxiety disorder could not be accurately counted until there is a clear diagnostic criterion. In recent years, demographic data in the UK shows that 3% of the population were eligible to be diagnosed with anxiety disorder, but only 8% of those identified were diagnosed with anxiety disorder finally and received relevant treatment [REF]. In particular, anxiety disorders are considered to be one of the most common psychiatric disorders, affecting 15%−20% of young people [REF]. Corresponding to anxiety disorder, anxiety is a relatively widespread type of human mental illness, that has emotions of dread, apprehension, and impending disaster but not disabling as anxiety disorders [REF]. Anxiety can be adaptive as it is a response to danger or potential threats in the environment [REF]. The statistical results show that the global overall prevalence of major depression is 4.7% [REF], and about 85% of the patients also have symptoms of anxiety [REF]. It is important to note that both anxiety disorder and anxiety can have bad consequences [REF]. It is urgent to find a suitable therapeutic schedule for anxiety disorder and anxiety.At present, the treatment of anxiety disorder is still based on drug intervention and there are a variety of drugs to choose from the clinic. The efficacy and tolerance of drugs are different, which made the drug regimen of different patients has certain differences. The first-line medication is chemical drugs, but the price of drugs is generally high, which is a great expense for many patients [REF]. At present, the main purpose of clinical medicine is to relieve symptoms. A total of 50% improvement on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) or being able to live normally after stopping the drugs rather than completely curing the situation are commonly used as the endpoint indicators [REF]. What's more worrying is that these patients still tend to show symptoms of chronic anxiety in the future [REF]. According to the survey, the lifetime prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder worldwide is about 3.7% [REF]. Therefore, it is necessary to find a cheap and effective anxiolytic drug.Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may show unique advantages in the treatment of such psychiatric disorders. Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS) is a traditional Chinese medicine preparation and its composition has been derived from the Internal Medicine Abstract published in 1529 CE (Fig. 1). It is derived from the drug ‘Xiaoyao San’ in the world's first drug standard Taiping Huimin Hejifang, two Chinese herbal medicines were added on this basis. JWXYS is composed of 10 Chinese herbal medicines: Angelicae Sinensis Radix (Danggui in Chinese), Paeoniae Radix Alba (Baishao in Chinese), Poria (Fuling in Chinese), Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (Baizhu in Chinese), Bupleuri Radix (Chaihu in Chinese), Moutan Cortex (Mudanpi in Chinese), Gardeniae Fructus (Zhizi in Chinese), Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizome (Gancao in Chinese), and Menthae Haplocalycis Herba (Bohe in Chinese), the auxiliary material is Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens (Shengjiang in Chinese) [REF]. Because of its composition, it is also called Danzhi Xiaoyao San in China. Due to its mood-regulating actions, it can be translated as free and easy wanderer plus [REF]. Because the preparation is initially in powder form, San can also be translated as powder (e.g. Jiawei Xiaoyao Powder). It was called Kami-Shoyo-San or Gami-Shoyo-San in Japan and South Korea, respectively [REF]. A variety of dosage forms are widely used in clinical in China, including mixtures, pills, granules, and capsules. There are powder and tablet forms in Kampo medicines in Japan, which are often used in Kampo hospitals [REF]. In the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, it is used as pills and mixtures. In other drug standards, there are granules, capsules, and tablets. In terms of efficacy, the therapeutic effects of these dosage forms are the same [REF].Fig. 1Origin, composition and studies of Jiawei Xiaoyao San (JWXYS).

The dosage of the ten drugs in JWXYS is adjusted according to the patient’s symptoms. Some other Chinese medicines may be added according to other symptoms of patients. This is in line with the characteristic of TCM: syndrome differentiation and treatment, similar to the concept of precision medicine in modern medicine, which comprehensively considers the patient's condition, physical condition, living environment, and other factors to provide personalized treatment to the patient. In this review, some of the studies followed the concept of syndrome differentiation and treatment and other herbal medicines to the ten herbal medicines, and we will highlight these studies in subsequent articles.This review summarized the existing research on JWXYS in the treatment of anxiety disorder and anxiety which aims to deepen the understanding of the therapeutic effects of JWXYS.",human
"Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated neuropathy that is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis and affects approximately 100,000 people per year worldwide. Antecedent events are often found 4 weeks before clinical syndromes appear in GBS patients, such as surgery or infection and Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, cytomegalovirus, Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus are widely discussed [REF]. Depending on the different sites of the immune response, GBS is generally divided into demyelinating and axonal subtypes. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is characterized by the demyelination of peripheral nerves and infiltration of inflammatory cells, with subsequent axonal damage. Antibodies can be detected on Schwann cells, and AIDP is the most common subtype in Western countries [REF]. Antigenic epitopes of bacteria and viruses are presented to T cells by activated macrophages, causing the cross reactivity of T cells. Activated T cells promote the release of cytokines and free radicals, disrupt the blood nerve barrier and damage myelin, ultimately leading to acute demyelination syndrome [REF]. Experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) is an animal model of AIDP that uses myelin epitopes P0 or P2 as major antigens to induce T-cell-mediated neuritis [REF]. Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) is the second most common subtype of GBS. AMAN presents as primary axonal injury with antibody and membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition in nodes of Ranvier without obvious inflammatory cell infiltration or demyelination [REF]. Antibodies related to AMAN include anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a antibodies [REF]. In AMAN patients related to Campylobacter jejuni, the gangliosides of the peripheral nerves are similar in structure to the lipo-oligosaccharides of Campylobacter jejuni. This suggests that the pathogenic mechanism of AMAN may be the cross-reaction of homologous epitopes between bacterial lipo-oligosaccharides and peripheral motor axon gangliosides [REF]. Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a variation of GBS, and the clinical features of MFS are facial muscle weakness and ataxia. Most MFS patients have anti-GQ1b antibodies, implying a potential role for ganglioside antibodies in disease pathogenesis or as reliable diagnostic biomarkers [REF]. Anti-GQ1b antibodies have been proven to activate complement at the neuromuscular junction in vitro, and complement activation is thought to be the primary pathogenic mechanism of MFS.25Inflammatory cells and inflammatory factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of GBS. Macrophages play a dual role in the pathogenesis of GBS. Proinflammatory macrophages (M1) and anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) play a decisive role in the initiation and development of GBS and EAN. M1 macrophages can promote the destruction of the blood-nerve barrier, induce the production of cytokines and chemokines, promote Th1 polarization, and eventually lead to demyelination of peripheral nerves. M2 macrophages play a protective role in the course of disease; they can promote T-cell apoptosis, remove myelin and axon fragments, inhibit inflammation, and promote the regeneration of axons and myelin [REF]. T-cell subtypes are also involved in the pathogenesis of GBS. The imbalance between Th1 and Th2 responses contributes to the pathogenesis of GBS [REF]. Th1 responses are thought to provoke disease by activating and recruiting macrophages to sites in peripheral nerves, subsequently leading to nerve damage induced by the direct action of macrophages or by toxic and inflammatory substances released in situ. On the other hand, the Th2 response acts as a suppressor and regulator of the Th1 pathway and therefore may have the resolving effect observed in the recovery phase of GBS and EAN [REF]. Recently, IL-17 and Th17 cells have been found to play an important role in many immune diseases, and Treg cells have a suppressive effect on inflammation [REF]. In the acute phase of the clinical course of GBS, the number and ratio of CD4+CD25+ T cells decrease, but this decrease is reversible [REF]. Another study found that regulatory T cells (Tregs) from GBS patients and Tregs from healthy controls showed equal expression of FoxP-3 mRNA, and their ability to suppress the proliferation and cytokine secretion of CD4+ effector T cells was unimpaired in GBS patients [REF]. Furthermore, adoptive infusion of autologous CD4+CD25+ Treg cells can reduce inflammatory cell infiltration of the sciatic nerve in EAN rats [REF]. Cytokines are small active proteins secreted by immune cells and some nonimmune cells that have several functions, such as regulating cell growth and differentiation, modulating the immune response, and participating in the inflammatory response. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, etc., damage myelin by recruiting effector cells to peripheral nerves and promoting the in situ release of toxic substances. Anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-10, inhibit disease progression or promote myelin repair by exerting anti-inflammatory effects [REF]. Along with more studies on the pathogenesis of GBS, new strategies targeting at different points in the treatment of the disease have emerged. In this narrative review, we summarize the new approaches of classical therapies and new strategies in both animal models and clinical practice to identify potential therapies for GBS patients.",human
"Cannabis was legalized for recreational use in Canada on 17 October 2018. The reactions to this legislative action appear to be primarily split between two quite divergent viewpoints: positive from the groups who campaigned for cannabis legalization and disappointment from groups involved in treating individuals who experience the negative outcomes of cannabis use. Use of cannabis has quietly increased since legalization in Canada but the enormous business potential expected by the proponents of legalization have also failed to materialize [REF]. Cannabis use overall in Canada has increased each year since legalization from an estimated 15% of all adults over age 15 in 2017 (pre-legalization) to 25.2% of all adults over 15 in 2021 [REF]. This increase is similar to what has been seen in other countries that have legalized (as opposed to decriminalized) cannabis use [REF]. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and opioid crisis have stalled what efforts were being made to attempt to inform the general public of the potential harms that cannabis use can pose for some individuals. While it is generally agreed that cannabis adverse events are not common, with increasing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration coupled with increased frequency of use, this may become a more common issue. For example, the rate of cannabis use disorder, the DSM-5 diagnosis for cannabis dependence or abuse, has increased from an estimated 10% of cannabis users to 22% [REF]. The need to communicate the risks of cannabis use is ever increasing as there are now 38 states in the United States that have legalized medical cannabis use with 19 legalizing recreational use [REF]. South Africa, the Seychelles and Ghana have decriminalized cannabis for personal use [REF]. Other countries such as Canada and Uruguay have fully legalized cannabis use for both recreational and medical use [REF]. One comprehensive study examined the use of cannabis pre-post legalization in 587 4 year colleges in the United States (US) from 2008 to 2018 comparing cannabis use in college students in states with legalized recreational cannabis to those in states with restricted cannabis approaches and found that past 30 day use increased more in colleges where recreational cannabis was legal (OR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.19–1.28) [REF]. Here we aggregate the common and uncommon psychiatric adverse events that can be experienced with cannabis use with the hope that this will serve as a resource for Emergency Department (ED) personnel in discussing cannabis use in relation to ED visits for those who have experienced an adverse event related to mental health.Since publishing our previous paper [REF], further studies have examined adverse events related to cannabis use that can be experienced and result in an Emergency Department visit primarily based on administrative data. Papers examining cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) are probably the most common and the most frequently picked up by the media as this is clearly a dramatic adverse event and the related paradoxical effect of increased nausea that can be associated with use of cannabis during pregnancy. An article on the topic in relation to ED impacts was conducted by Andrews and colleagues but like all the cannabis related side effects, this side effect only affects a small proportion of users. However, from pre-post legalization in Canada, the number of ED visits per 100,000 increased from 15 to 21 to 32 in 2020 [REF]. This still represents a small number of cannabis users. If we frame this as a response to a pharmaceutical that is under consideration for government licensing; this frequency would mean it was considered a rare side effect. If we extend this analysis to examine cannabis adverse events in the same manner as a standard government approved pharmaceutical then the more serious adverse events would be the risk of stroke and some of the lung associated injuries such as hemoptysis which are all more clearly associated with heavy use [REF]. These are what we could consider medical side effects of cannabis use with clear quantitative measures of imaging to show the damage from the event with still more research needing to be done regarding dose relationships and temporal association; but this is outside the scope of this review. What is even more complex to examine and disentangle are the mental health adverse events which we try to address here. Additionally, we examine some of the factors that we believe are potentially complicating analysis of data in this area.",human
"Calcaneal apophysitis (CA) or Sever’s disease is the most common cause of heel pain in children and young people, showing an incidence of 3.7 per 1000 patients [REF]. It is a common musculoskeletal disease, representing between 2% and 16% of the consultations in sports clinics 3 4 and 5.8%–22.7% of repetitive stress injuries in children [REF]. The condition is most common in girls between 7 and 12 years of age and in boys between 8 and 15 years of age [REF], showing a peak in both genders between 10 and 12 years of age [REF].CA was described by Dr Sever in 1912, due to sporadic continuous pain in the posterior area of the calcaneus bone in paediatric patients [REF]. Histological studies define CA as inflammation or bone oedema due to a stress fracture in the secondary growth centre of the calcaneus, which is not related to necrosis [REF]. The inflammation is due to the traction forces from the triceps surae muscle on the CA, which is composed of hyaline cartilage [REF]. The repetition of these traction forces, combined with the vertical ground reaction force on the calcaneus, generates bending forces on the medial side of the CA. Because the number of chondrocytes is increased in the CA during the development of children, the CA is not able to tolerate these bending forces [REF]. The gender incidence of this condition is controversial. A previous study by Orava and Virtanen13 concluded that the CA incidence ratio was 10:1, being more common in boys than girls. However, Micheli and Ireland [REF], McKenzie et al5 and Kvist and Heinonem9 concluded that the ratio was 3:1, 2:1 and 1:1 in their respective studies.CA is a unilateral condition in most cases [REF], which may be related to the dominant leg. However, it has also been described as a bilateral condition in some cases [REF]. The diagnosis of CA is mainly based on its signs and symptoms, but it can also be confirmed with complementary tests, such as X-ray imaging. The pain is mainly located in the posterior and plantar side of the CA9 16 17 or in the Achilles tendon insertion [REF]. Various treatments have been described in the literature and the most frequently used include: stretching and lengthening of the triceps surae muscle, application of ice, restriction or limitation of physical activity, rest, topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, taping, and the use of foot orthoses and heel pads [REF]. Among the causes of CA, a rapid period of maturation due to accelerated growth that causes muscle–tendon imbalances has been described. Muscle development is slower than bone development, which causes muscular tension [REF]. Obesity is considered a cause of a valgus deformity of the knees and ankles, which increases the risk of CA [REF]. The distribution of body weight between the right and left feet in children with CA is higher on the affected lower limb, maintaining the highest peaks of pressure in the feet [REF]. Another cause is overuse due to repetitive impacts that generate repetitive micro-traumas, in movements such as jumping or running [REF]. This factor can be worsened by footwear that is inadequate or without cushioning [REF]. Some sports are associated with the disease, such as athletics, football, basketball, ballet and tennis [REF], as well as any running activity practised on hard surfaces [REF]. The functional limitation of the dorsiflexion movement of the ankle joint, which can be due to a limitation of the triceps surae muscle or the hamstring muscles [REF], may cause the disease. Furthermore, 95% of children with CA present with biomechanical alterations [REF]. Some authors have described the flat foot with valgus calcaneus as the most common alteration in children with CA [REF]. However, other authors5 conclude that 50% of the subjects presented a varus calcaneal deviation, which, in dynamic conditions, presents as a pronated foot. The two other main causes of CA that were identified in the literature were clubfoot1 29 and pes cavus [REF].Knowledge of the risk factors (RFs) related to CA helps to provide important information for the prevention and early treatment of this common pathology in the paediatric population. Therefore, the aim was to conduct a systematic review to identify potentially intrinsic and extrinsic RFs associated with developing CA, as well as the consequences of the condition, as described by the evidence.",human
"Under the illumination of resonant wavelength, noble metals (such as Au and Ag) can support the coherent oscillations of electrons in metals. These excitations, called as surface plasmon resonances (SPR), can greatly increase the optical extinction cross section of the nanostructure and produce significant near-field enhancement due to the high localization of electromagnetic field beyond the diffraction limit [REF]. Therefore, noble metal plasmonic nanostructures can be served as SPR sensors by utilizing the high sensitivity of local electromagnetic field to the change of surrounding dielectric environment. In the past decade, benefited from the rapid development of nanofabrication technologies (such as nanosphere lithography and nanoimprint lithography), SPR sensors have found wide applications for the label-free and real-time detection of bio-/chemical species in numerous fields [REF].A typical SPR sensing process is shown in Fig. 1, where the resonance spectrum of a SPR sensor shifts to longer wavelength as the refractive index of surrounding environment increases from n to n+Δn. The sensing performance of various SPR sensors can be evaluated by figure of merit (FOM), which is defined as spectral shift (Δλ) per refractive index unit (RIU) divided by resonance linewidth (full-width at half-maximum, FWHM), namely FOM = Δλ/(Δn × FWHM). A high FOM has therefore become an important indicator for the excellent sensing performance of a SPR sensor [REF]. To improve FOM, there are two main directions: 1) enhancing the near-field intensity of SPR sensors to obtain a large spectral shift per refractive index and 2) decreasing the linewidths of SPR sensors. The former can be realized through the fabrication of SPR sensors with strong near-field enhancement [REF], while the latter requires reducing plasmonic loss of sensor structures [REF]. For the widely used propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) sensors using prism coupling strategy, it is difficult to realize the flexible tuning of optical properties of the sensor, and the existence of optical components in the device makes it difficult to realize miniaturization and portability, which greatly limits their practical applications [REF]. As for localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensors which are usually based on metallic plasmonic nanoparticles, they do not need to meet momentum matching conditions and the preparation of nanoparticles are relatively simple with low cost [REF]. The resonant frequency of the sensors can also be flexible tuned by adjusting the material, shape and size of plasmonic nanoparticles. Nevertheless, owing to strong radiative damping of metallic plasmonic nanoparticles, LSPR sensors usually exhibit broad resonance spectra, which greatly limit their sensing performance [REF].Fig. 1Illustration of the spectral shift of a SPR sensor as the environmental refractive index changes from n to n+ Δn.Fig. 1Illustration of the spectral shift of a SPR sensor as the environmental refractive index changes from n to n+ Δn.Recent progresses in micro-/nanofabrications have encouraged the development of metallic plasmonic substrates and numerous nanostructured SPR sensors, such as metallic nanohole [REF], nanoring [REF] and nanomushroom arrays [REF], have been proposed for sensing applications. Compared with the conventional SPR sensors based on prism coupling configurations and plasmonic nanoparticles, these nanostructured SPR sensors are easy to integrate with imaging and microfluidic systems. In addition, their plasmonic resonances can be excited directly without additional coupling structures, beneficial for the multiplex and high-throughput sensing analysis and the miniaturization and portability of sensing devices. More importantly, various ingenious and flexible structural designs endow the nanostructured SPR sensors with rich optical properties, providing possibilities to enhance near-field intensities and reduce resonance linewidths and therefore improve FOM. Benefited from these characteristics, nanostructured SPR sensors have been widely used for medical diagnosis [REF], food safety analysis [REF] and environment monitoring [REF], etc.In this review, we aim to introduce effective strategies to improve sensing performance of SPR sensors. We here focus on the current approaches for reducing resonance linewidths instead of the enhancement of near-field intensities. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we will introduce the influence factors of plasmon linewidth to facilitate readers of different fields to understand relevant background. In section 3, we focus on the developed strategies for obtaining narrow resonance linewidths. In section 4, the applications of SPR sensors in different fields are reviewed. Lastly, we will discuss in depth the future development of nanostructured SPR sensors.",human
"Primary complement (C) deficiencies represent approximately 1-10% of all reported primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) [REF], even though markedly higher numbers were documented in specific national registries [REF]. The most prevalent C deficiencies affect mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which is estimated to occur in more than 10% of the Caucasian population, and C2 [REF]. Nevertheless, the vast majority of C deficiencies has an estimated prevalence of about 0.03% in the general population [REF]. However, due to the redundancies in the immune system and to the frequent presence of asymptomatic patients, many C disorders remain undiagnosed.C defects are usually inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern (except for C1-inhibitor deficiency, which is autosomal dominant, and properdin deficiency, which is X-linked) [REF] and can be mainly distinguished in: early C deficiencies regarding the classical, lectin or alternative pathway, defects in the terminal C components, and deficiencies affecting C regulatory components and receptors [REF]. Symptoms can broadly vary from almost none to serious and even lethal infections [REF]. Apart from inherited origin, C deficiencies may also be acquired through C overconsumption by immune complexes, reduced hepatic synthesis, increased protein loss via urine, presence of autoantibodies, and somatic mutations [REF].The manifestations of inherited C deficiencies fall broadly into three different clinical scenarios, depending on which factor is missing: i) increased susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections, due to inadequate opsonization, defective cell lysis, and/or onset of immune complex diseases, is usually associated to abnormalities in alternative, lectin and terminal pathways [REF]; ii) concomitant features of autoimmunity, especially systemic lupus erythematosus, can be observed in classical pathway defects [REF]; iii) dramatically enhanced or uncontrolled C activation leading to other immune-related disorders is mainly due to deficiencies in C regulators [REF]. As a general trend, these deficiencies result into severe sinopulmonary bacterial infections, bacteremia, and/or meningitis, mainly due to encapsulated bacteria (i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis). In particular, recurrent neisserial infections can indicate possible terminal component deficiencies (C5-C9) [REF] and early alternative pathway deficiency (properdin) [REF].Even in the presence of clinical manifestations, the diagnosis of C deficiencies is quite challenging due to their rarity, the heterogeneity in clinical symptoms and the complexity of diagnostic procedures. Conventionally, the activity of each activation arm of the C is initially tested by functional assays based on hemolytic activity (CH50, LP50, AH50) [REF]. Therefore, methods based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been developed to test the functionality of all three C pathways [REF], followed by the quantification of specific individual components.Due to the close association between genetic variants and C defects, genetic approaches are increasingly becoming part of the diagnostic path to unveil C deficiencies [REF]. In particular, gene sequencing has become a robust and common tool for confirming single component deficiencies detected through quantitative and functional assays, but also an alternative and immediate diagnostic procedure when functional tests are not easily available. Moreover, functional and protein analysis are time-consuming, less accurate and dependent on C system sensitivity to freeze-thaw cycles [REF]. Despite the analysis may be complicated by copy number variations, point mutations and pseudogenes, the introduction of next generation sequencing and the improvements in genetic tools are gradually changing the approach to the diagnosis of inborn errors of immunity.In the current paper, we aimed at exploiting the promising potentialities offered by genetic workup as a support to the currently available immunological assays used to identify C deficiencies. We analyzed the case of a ten-year-old boy presenting C7 deficiency, reporting a novel mutation responsible for functional hemizygosity, and then performed a systematic review of the literature to unveil the genetic bases of C7 deficiency.",human
"Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) remains one of the leading causes for child mortality and is a major contributor to long term morbidities, including epilepsy, cerebral palsy and neurocognitive delays [REF]. In industrialized countries the incidence of NE is 0.5–1.5 per 1000 live births3; here therapeutic hypothermia (HT) is standard treatment, reducing mortality and long-term morbidities by 20–25%, with a number needed to treat of seven [REF]. However, the burden of NE secondary to intrapartum events is disproportionately higher amongst low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). In particular, sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia account for more than 85% of all NE cases worldwide with regional estimates as high as 14.9 per 1000 live births [REF]. Potential therapies are limited in LMIC as the feasibility, safety and efficacy of HT in all LMIC remains uncertain [REF]. These differences in response to HT may originate from the timing of the HI insult (longer intrapartum insults with early presentation of seizures within 2 h of birth), comorbidities such as poor nutrition and the co-existence of infection/inflammation as seen in studies in sub-Sahara Africa [REF]. Therefore, identifying alternative neuroprotective treatments to HT is of major global interest, as it will have a large impact on the global burden caused by NE.The pathophysiology following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is complex and evolves through several different phases. A reduction in placental blood flow and fetal oxygen supply occurs in the first phase [REF]; such vasculature chances lead to a loss of cerebral autoregulation with a reduction of systemic fetal blood pressure [REF]. The decrease of oxygen and depletion of energy causes increased excitotoxicity, an increase of intracellular calcium, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction [REF], leading to primary energy failure and some apoptotic and necrotic cell death. After reperfusion at resuscitation, the initial hypoxia-induced cytotoxic oedema and accumulation of excitatory amino acids partially resolves, with apparent recovery of cerebral oxidative metabolism. It is thought that the neurotoxic cascade is largely inhibited during the latent phase. Around 6–24 h after HI, a secondary phase occurs despite adequate oxygenation and perfusion. This secondary phase is associated with failure of cerebral oxidative metabolism (secondary energy failure), further glutamate driven excitotoxicity, inflammation, free radical and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dysfunction [REF]. The third phase, lasting days to weeks or months, is characterized by chronic inflammation, which may lead to epigenetic changes and impairs neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and axonal growth [REF].Many of the putative therapies for NE target specific pathological injury processes, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and regeneration [REF]. HT-induced cellular protection, however, is a global process affecting multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms and results in a 6–10% decrease in cerebral metabolism for every 1 °C reduction in body temperature [REF]. However, as there are concerns around the safety and efficacy of HT in LMIC, we focus on economical, simple single therapies as an alternative to HT in this study.There are currently no other safe and effective therapeutic options for NE apart from HT. Some agents are currently under evaluation in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) in combination with or without HT, for example erythropoietin (clinical trials gov: NCT02811263), allopurinol (clinical trials gov: NCT03162653), topiramate (clinical trials gov: NCT01765218), caffeine (clinical trials gov: NCT03913221), melatonin (clinical trials gov: NCT03806816) or stem cells (clinical trials gov: NCT02612155). Some very potent pre-clinical agents such as inhaled xenon and erythropoietin have failed to show significant neuroprotection in clinical trials when combined with HT [REF]. One of the challenges transferring in-vivo or in-vitro studies into clinical studies is that preclinical studies are often performed in different labs on different continents, using different treatment protocols and models. In addition, they often lack comparison to RCTs regarding experimental design and statistical analysis [REF]. The Vannucci rodent model of unilateral brain injury is an established animal model used by researchers worldwide to screen for neuroprotective potency of agents, understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and study the different mode of actions following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury [REF]. However, there is considerable variability in the model with groups using different concentrations and duration of hypoxia [REF]. Often, pertinent experimental details such as temperature control during treatment or hypoxia are not reported and the number of animals used not reported [REF]. This challenges researchers to reproduce results although using the “same” animal model and questions the validity of the published results.As previously stated, different treatment options have shown neuroprotection using the Vannucci model. In addition, the Vannucci model has set the basis for hypothermic neuroprotection, which has become standard care. Nevertheless, this model has never been used to prove efficacy and compare the neuroprotective potency of multiple different potential neuroprotective agents in a standardized single lab set-up.The aims of this study were: (i) screen the literature for preclinical and clinical studies of promising putative therapeutic agents for NE; (ii) establish a rank-order for the most promising neuroprotective treatments which could be used in a LMIC setting by using specific scores based on evidence for an efficiency treatment; (iii) Test and directly compare neuroprotective efficacy of 25 therapeutic agents using the standardized Vannucci P7 rat model in an established single lab set-up to identify the most promising agents to progress to more intensive studies in large animal models.",human
"The hospitality sector is the most energy-intensive part of the tourism industry after the transportation sector [REF]. Hotel buildings are public buildings with high energy consumption due to heating, cooling, lighting, cooking, cleaning, entertainment, and other factors. The hotel industry in most countries and regions globally tends to focus on high-end and luxury features [REF], resulting in high investment, high consumption, and high pollution of high-star hotels [REF]. For example, the annual average energy utilization rates of high-star hotels in Singapore and Portugal are 427 kWh/(m2·[REF] and 446 kWh/(m2·) [REF], respectively, which is 20 times the energy consumption of residential buildings. In Greece, the average energy consumption per meal and bath is 5.5 kWh and 1.66 kWh, respectively [REF]. In Ottawa, the annual average energy intensity of hotels is as high as 612 kWh/(m2·[REF]. Sheng et al. (2018) found that luxury hotels in China consume on average four times more energy than other commercial buildings, highlighting the pressing need for energy-efficient operations in this sector [REF]. This has prompted scholars from various research fields to delve into the issue of hotel energy consumption. For instance, Shao et al. (2020) conducted a study on hotel building energy consumption by developing a support vector machine energy consumption prediction model [REF], while Todorović et al. (2020) explored the subject system in bivalent operation through the basic and advanced configurations of a heat pump system assisted with a gas boiler [REF].The rapid development of the hotel industry has caused a nonlinear growth in energy consumption, especially fossil energy consumption, and increased localized greenhouse gas emissions, which have negative impacts on the climate, environment, and economic growth. For instance, Oluseyi et al. (2016) found a strong correlation between energy consumption per unit room and CO2 emission levels in the hotel industry [REF]. Moreover, Sofer & Potchter (2006) pointed out that the urban heat island effect is more significant around the dense hotel belt than in other areas [REF].Various countries and regions have taken measures to reduce the hotel industry's excessive dependence on energy and alleviate the resulting environmental pressure. For instance, low-carbon hotels and green hotels have been advocated by and established in many countries [REF]. In academia, researchers have been advocating energy conservation, emission reduction, and green performance in the hotel business since the 1970s. Although the specific relationship between the total carbon emissions and the performance of hotels is unclear, there is no denying that a relationship exists [REF]. In this context, the concept of green consumption has been increasingly endorsed by tourists [REF].Most research has focused on the following aspects. (1) The composition of hotel energy and major energy consumption sectors [[REF], [REF], [REF]]. (2) Factors affecting hotel energy consumption [REF]. (3) Establishing a benchmark for hotel energy consumption [[REF], [REF], [REF]]. Early studies on hotel energy consumption were mostly case studies to demonstrate the performance of buildings and the technical level of the equipment. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that interdisciplinary research has become the main research trend. The existing studies provide evidence of international cooperation in the area of energy efficiency technologies for hotel industry Furthermore, interdisciplinary studies in energy research in the hotel industry combine knowledge from various fields including engineering [REF], environmental science [REF], business and economics [22,[REF], [REF], [REF]]. The aim is to find ways to reduce the energy consumption in hotels and increase their energy efficiency.Collaboration is essential for energy research in the hospitality industry as it allows researchers and practitioners to combine their expertise and resources to solve complex energy-related issues. Collaboration promotes the sharing of information and best practices, leading to new insights that can be applied to real-world problems. Research collaborations assure in-depth investigations, resulting in robust findings with broader applications. Evaluating research collaborations by analyzing the knowledge mapping of energy research in hospitality is vital to understand the current state, identify knowledge gaps, and focus efforts on the most pressing issues. Assessing research collaborations helps researchers identify best practices and challenges, ultimately enhancing collaboration and research quality.Interdisciplinary research drives innovation. Interdisciplinary research refers to the collaboration of researchers across different fields of study to solve complex problems that cannot be solved using a single discipline [REF]. This collaboration brings together perspectives, methods, and theories from various disciplines, which leads to innovation in research and the development of new ideas, technologies and approaches [REF]. Since research is a complex social undertaking, it relies on collaboration between researchers. Furthermore, cooperation has a substantial influence on knowledge exchange and innovation. Research cooperation has become an important aspect of bibliometrics due to an increase in bibliometric studies [REF]. However, there are very few reports on collaborative research on hotel energy-related issues. Therefore, this paper uses bibliometric and visualization methods to explore research cooperation among countries, institutions, and authors to understand the current organization of academic activities in energy research in the hotel industry. The citation networks of highly cited papers were also analyzed to clarify how knowledge is transferred and developed.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The methodology and data are described in Section 2. Section 3 presents the results and discussions. The conclusions are drawn in Section 4.",human
"Cells determine their function through signaling pathways and communication with other cells and their microenvironment. Due to ligands’ binding to their receptors on the cell surface, protein cascades are activated and consequently affect the level of gene transcription, leading to the conversion of external stimuli into biochemical signals. These signaling pathways control biological effects such as proliferation, differentiation, and death; thus, disrupting these pathways leads to malignancy [REF]. Also, they are owing to changes in some critical cell proliferation and apoptosis-controlling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Notch, Wnt/β-catenin, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In addition, a variety of inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, CD279) and its ligand PD-L1 (CD274), have been playing a significant role in various types of cancers and chronic viral infections [REF]. For instance, it was demonstrated in a report published on the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in acute viral infections affecting the lower respiratory tract that this pathway impairs the activity of CD8+ T-cells in the human respiratory system. In addition, dendritic cells inhibit T-cell function in acute viral infections by highly expressing PD-L1 on their surfaces [REF]. PD-1, on the other hand, is expressed in lymphocytes, specifically CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells, and is an inducible negative regulator of T-cell activity; as a result, PD-L1 is one of two PD-1 ligands found on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), peripheral tissues, and cancerous cells [REF]. As a result, the interaction of PD-1/PD-L1 leads to the activation of inhibitory signals in T-cells, which eventually leads to the destruction of T-cells, anergy, and reduced function [REF]. PD-1 causes regulatory T-cells to face less apoptosis while increasing the death of some T-cells in lymph nodes. On the surface of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells, PD-1 is more apparent. The PD-1/PDL1 pathway reduces the activity of T-cells; this inhibitory effect is done by binding PD-1 to its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2), which are produced on the surface of cancerous cells and peripheral tissues. The expression of PD-L1 also regulates IFN-γ-secreting T-cells [REF]. Moreover, it has been illustrated that the interaction of PD-1/PD-L1 can increase the transcription of several genes involved in cancer induction. Cancer cells express immune system regulators such as the cluster of differentiation (CD)-47 and PD-L1 to induce immune response resistance. Also, cellular myelocytomatosis (c-MYC) activation is due to CD-47 and PD-L1 expression [REF]. Because c-MYC can directly bind to the CD-47 and PD-L1 gene promoters, inhibiting c-MYC reduces the expression of both genes (CD-47 and PD-L1) and thus improves the anti-tumor immune response [REF]. It is hypothesized that T-cell apoptosis is associated with c-MYC overexpression, a critical target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway [REF]. Additionally, Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated as one of the primary inducers of cancer, accelerating the development of the disease through controlling the tumor immune cycle in various cell types, including dendritic cells, T-cells, and tumor cells [REF]. Some significant regulators of the anti-tumor function of T-cells, especially effective T-cells, T helper cells (Th), and regulatory T-cells (T-reg), are changed functionally by abnormal Wnt/β-catenin signaling [REF]. Besides, the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is observed during various types of malignancies, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), breast cancer, as well as in HPV-related cancers such as oropharyngeal and cervical cancers, head and neck, anal cancer, and vulvar cancer [REF]. As mentioned above, increased levels of PD-1 expression on the T-cells and APC cells, and also hyper-activation of the Wnt pathway during chronic HPV infection, are positively associated with tumor cell metastasis and HPV-associated cancers such as cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade [REF]. Besides, inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway in cancer cells could disrupt the expression of CD-47 and PD-L1, resulting in an increased immune defense against tumors [REF]. In other words, MYC signaling leads to increased expression of CD47 and PD-L1 in tumor cells. Meanwhile, due to CD47-SIRPα interaction, the phagocytosis activity of tumor cells by macrophages and dendritic cells is disturbed. As a result, the lack of activity of the innate immune system may cause an increase in the recruitment of T-cells to the tumor microenvironment. In contrast to PD-L1 expression, it may disrupt in the function of T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may affect MYC activation [REF].The present study hypothesized that current research concentrates on the Wnt/β-catenin and PD-1 signaling pathways, crucial elements in cancers, particularly cancers related to viruses. These findings may alter the manner that individuals evaluate cancer patients and immunotherapy (Fig. 1).During infection, the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling axis and Wnt play an essential role in developing and maligning epithelial cells. Thus, after presenting the antigen to the T-cells, the DC cells induce signaling pathways in T-cells, resulting in the induction of TCR and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Then these cytokines lead to the expression of PD-1 on the surface of T-cells. In this line, Wnt binds to its receptors. The integrated HPV genome regulates these pathways to increase escape and inhibit the immune response against tumor cells by expressing E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Also, these oncoproteins lead to the induction of a series of cellular signaling pathways of Wnt; it eventually conducts the expression of the c-MYC in the target cell nucleus. The c-MYC gene leads to increased expression of PD-L1 and CD47 at the surface of tumor cells. By binding PD-L1 to PD-1 expressed at the surface of T-cells, it leads to apoptosis, anergy, and ultimately inhibition of the immune response vs. tumor cells. Also, INF-γ secreted by T-cells leads to increased PD-L1 expression at the surface of tumor cells.",human
"With rapid economic development, changes in lifestyles and increasing work pressure, the number of people suffering from neck pain is increasing continuously. It was reported that approximately 220 million people around the world were affected by neck pain, which brought a huge economic burden to society [REF]. Neck pain in adults is usually attributed to degenerative cervical spondylosis (DCS), which in severe cases can develop into spinal cord dysfunction. DCS is a series of clinical syndromes resulting from damage to the spinal cord, nerves and blood vessels caused by degeneration of cervical intervertebral discs and subsequent changes. This debilitating disorder can be treated by conservative means in the early stages. However, once conservative treatment is no longer effective or symptoms continue to worsen, the compressed spinal cord is in danger of irreversible damage. To relieve nerve compression and improve symptoms, surgical treatment should be performed as soon as possible [REF].Currently, anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is widely recognised a gold standard for treating DCS. Through the use of anterior plate fixation, traditional ACDF can provide immediate cervical spinal stability, direct sufficient and effective nerve decompression, normalize intervertebral height, and reconstruct cervical physiological curvature, as well as reducing the incidence of pseudoarthrosis. The placement of a titanium plate can provide additional stability to the operated segment, preventing collapse of the interbody fusion device and the formation of a kyphotic deformity [REF]. However, intraoperative placement of the plate requires as much exposure of the surgical field as possible, which is usually accompanied by complications, such as anterior soft tissue injury, postoperative dysphagia and degeneration of adjacent segments [REF]. Lu et al. attributed postoperative dysphagia to soft tissue oedema at the surgical location, surrounding hematoma, esophageal injury, and tissue adhesion around the plate [REF]. Cage-plate construct (CPC) alters the normal biomechanical state of the cervical spine, which leads to loss of motion at the operated segment, concentrated stress loads on adjacent segments, and increased abnormal activity, thereby accelerating adjacent segment degeneration (ASD) [REF].With the intention of reducing the risk of the complications mentioned above, a novel self-locking stand-alone cage (SSC) based on the zero-notch design concept came into being. It was designed to allow self-locking screws to be inserted through the fusion device into the vertebral body of the adjacent segments without plate fixation. The key difference between SSC and CPC is that in the process of operation, there is no need to expose a large anatomical area, which significantly reduces the surgical injury and the formation of postoperative scars. SSCs can effectively avoid invasion of important structures located in the front of the cervical spine, thereby reducing the incidence of postoperative complications such as hematoma, ASD and postoperative dysphagia [REF]. Studies have shown that SSC has the similar clinical efficacy compared with cage-plate fixation [REF]. It can effectively obtain good stability of fused segments, thereby ensuring eventual bone fusion. Nevertheless, it faces controversy in terms of maintaining the physiological curvature of cervical spine, preventing the subsidence of fusion devices and so on [REF].Some scholars conducted meta-analyses and further compared the efficacy and complications between SSC and CPC in treating DCS, yet the findings remained diverse [REF]. Limitations existed among these previous meta-analyses, including one fact that some papers involved different surgical segments and different lengths of follow-up. Currently, the superiority of SSC over CPC in terms of short- and medium-term efficacy and safety has been confirmed in numerous meta-analyses. Still, some meta-analysis results are not clear when it comes to comparing the long-term outcomes of SSC versus CPC [REF]. One explanation for this phenomenon is that variations in surgical segments and follow-up lengths may influence the results of the meta-analyses. Up to now, no specific meta-analysis has been carried out to investigate the long-term benefits and complications between SSC and CPC in monosegmental ACDF. Therefore, our aim is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and security of SSC compared to traditional cage-plate fixation in the treatment of monosegmental ACDF with a follow-up length of ≥ 2 years, in attempt to provide convincing evidence for clinicians to make clinical decisions.",human
"Breast cancer (BC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. Data from WHO (World Health Organization) reported about 2.3 million new cases and about 685,000 deaths from BC globally [REF]. Similarly, American Cancer Society’s projections for BC incidence in the United States in 2023 (https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html), estimate about 297,790 new cases of invasive BC in women, about 55,720 new diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and about 43,700 death from this disease. The same statistics indicate for 2023 more than 3.8 million BC survivors in the United States, and 7.8 million worldwide, including both patients currently being treated and making this type of cancer the most prevalent worldwide. The median age at the time of diagnosis is 62 years and a woman’s lifetime risk of acquiring breast cancer in the United States is around 13%, with incidence rates rising by 0.5% annually in recent years. Currently, a woman’s chance of dying from BC is around 2.5%, death rates have been decreased due to improved therapeutic regimens, as well as earlier BC detection through screening programs and increased awareness. However, in recent years, the trend has marginally halted.The breast cancer mass is composed not only by epithelial cancer cells, but also by a plethora of heterogeneous populations coming from the host, including endothelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, and a variety of immune cells that form the so-called tumor microenvironment (TME) [REF]. The TME is a highly complex biological community embedded in a composite matrix of structural proteins constituting the extracellular matrix (ECM), in which immune cells (including macrophages, polymorphonuclear cells, mast cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and T and B lymphocytes) and non-immune cells (such as endothelial cells and stromal cells) establish subtle interactions with cancer cells. This cellular cross-talk is based on the production of specific soluble (growth factors and cytokines) and insoluble (ECM proteins) molecules, and it determines the tumor’s natural history.BC comprises numerous subtypes that differ genetically, pathologically, and clinically. Indeed, it is currently considered a group of neoplasms originating from mammary gland epithelial cells caused by a variety of genetic alterations, with different disease courses, responses to treatments, and clinical outcomes. This was best exemplified by next-generation sequencing studies depicting comprehensive molecular BC portraits in Cancer Genome Atlas [REF] and identifying more than 1600 likely driver mutations in 93 BC genes [REF]. BC can have distinct molecular profiles from one another, leading to a complex heterogeneity of tumor cell subpopulations within single tumors, between primary tumors and their metastasis, or between independent metastasis, as a consequence of tumor clonal evolution [REF]. In addition to clonal evolution, tumor heterogeneity can occur also at the level of cancer cell plasticity. The capability of BC cells to reprogram their gene expression and change their behavior when triggered by internal or external stimuli coming from surrounding cells and secreted factors, provides dynamic and context-dependent features to tumor heterogeneity [REF]. Moreover, heterogeneity is also modulated by the different composition of the TME, with different ratio between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, myeloid cells, macrophages [REF], with the increased presence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) [REF] and endothelial cells that controls cancer cell properties. The heterogeneity in components of the BC mass can be either observed between the different BC subtypes, known as inter-tumor heterogeneity, or within the same tumors, known as intra-tumor heterogeneity [REF].Therapeutic approaches are still currently largely based on clinical and pathological BC features, mostly on the presence or absence of targets like the hormone receptors or the Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) [REF], and they are not yet tailored to individual patients. In particular, endocrine therapy is expected for hormone-dependent BC patients, targeted therapy with monoclonal antibodies for HER2-positive patients, and chemotherapy for TNBC patients. However, the different mechanisms that contribute to the inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity are responsible for tumor escape from therapeutic interventions.Drug resistance is among the major obstacles to reach a long-term cure, and overcoming this problem is the biggest challenge in BC research today. Indeed, the heterogeneous pattern of molecular aberrations found in each cancer plays a crucial role in the resistance to anticancer treatment [REF]. The goal of cancer therapy is to target a population of cancer cells within a particular host environment. The pharmacological properties of the therapy, together with intrinsic and acquired molecular features of cancer cells, controlled also by the TME components, dictate the therapy’s efficacy. Unfortunately, despite the clinical management of BC improving every day, the number of patients developing drug-resistant tumors is still high [REF]. The resistance can be already present before the treatment (innate) or appear after the treatment administration (acquired) [REF]. The innate resistance is mainly due to intrinsic tumor heterogeneity: in primary cancer one or more subpopulations (e.g., Cancer Stem Cells) are resistant to the treatments from the beginning; on the contrary, the acquired resistance becomes evident after the therapy. In the clinical setting, innate and acquired resistance may coexist, making the long-term fight against cancer more complex.In BC, standard chemotherapies and targeted therapies have both been extensively correlated to the escape of tumor cells that shape the clonal evolution of tumors, giving rise to drug-resistant subclones [REF]. Moreover, a comparison of the genetic diversity between pre- and post-treatment in tumor specimens indicates the role of therapy in selectively expanding resistant cancer clones that were initially present but at low frequency [REF]. In this context, TME cells play an important role in mediating the drug response and educating the cancer cells to become resistant to the therapy through extensive molecular crosstalk that we will discuss below [REF].We will first describe here what is currently known regarding inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity and the impact of TME on cancer progression and drug resistance. Moreover we will discuss the up-to-date tools for studying these complex interactions in preclinical models and in patient derived samples in cancer progression and drug resistance. We will present emerging technologies, such as the spatial location of tumor subclones and TME cells within their native spatial context. We will show how the rapid growth of these techniques together with the multi-omics conjoint analysis mode and deep learning network architecture, promise to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cell-to-cell variation within and between individual tumors.",human
"Sea cucumbers, or Holothurians, are marine invertebrates belonging to the class Holothuroidea in Phylum: Echinodermata, inhabit various environments from shallow coastal waters to deep sea. Sea cucumbers perform several significant ecological functions, as efficient ecosystem engineers by deposit feeding habit reduce organic waste, constantly rework the sediments and facilitate bioturbation [REF]. Sea cucumbers are dried, processed, and sold as a product known as “Beche- de- mer” or “Trepang”, an expensive Chinese delicacy with growing demand [REF]. Globally, sea cucumber wild stocks have declined at alarming rates due to overfishing and poor management policies [REF]. However, aquaculture techniques are well established for commercial species such as Holothuria scabra [REF], which could potentially assist in recovering depleted population and trade in many parts of the world.Research on sea cucumbers of the Arabian Peninsula (AP) and Iran is scant and sporadic. Hence, a detailed and comprehensive review of the studies conducted in this region is warranted. Habitat diversity and prevailing extreme environmental conditions likely drive sea cucumber diversity in this region; however, such correlations remain poorly studied. In this review we focus on the aspects of historical and current research trends in sea cucumbers of the AP (which includes the following countries: Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and Yemen) and Iran and their marginal seas (Arabian/Persian Gulf (APG), Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Red Sea), to identify gaps in research and provide recommendations to address future research priorities.The AP is surrounded by marginal seas including the APG to the east, Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea to the south, and the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea to the west. The APG is a young (<6000 years), shallow sea (average depth 30–60 m), connected to the Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean by the Strait of Hormuz [REF]. The APG has a wide range of sea surface temperature (SST; 12 ○C to > 35 ○C) as well as highly variable salinity levels (>42 to >50 ppt) [REF]. The environmental extremes of the APG influences its relatively impoverished species richness and density of this water body [REF]. Over 200 species of macroalgae and four species of seagrass (Halodule uninervis, Syringodium istaefolium, Halophila ovalis, and Halophila stipulacea) in the APG serve as nursery grounds for several species of invertebrates and vertebrates [REF]. Resilient Corals (40 hard coral and 38 soft coral species) and coral reefs thrive in these extreme conditions [REF]. However, climate change-induced recurrent bleaching events have led to reef degradation [REF]. Furthermore, rapid coastal development in the AP threatens its biodiversity [REF].The Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, which surrounds Oman, consists of deep ocean waters with variable climatic conditions. The southwest summer monsoon triggers upwelling along the coast, which results in movement of the cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface and subsequent increase in primary productivity [REF]. Rich coral reefs and extensive sandy beaches occur along the Omani coast [REF]. In this region, mangrove forests, coral reefs, seagrass, and seaweed communities harbour rich biota [REF]. During the summer, upwelling leads to low temperature creating a dispersal barrier for the benthic fauna known as a “pseudo-high latitude effect” [REF].The Red Sea is also a relatively young sea, extending > 2000 km between the AP and Africa. With an average depth of 500 m, the Red Sea is warm and features relatively elevated salinity levels due to high evaporation rates. Mesoscale eddies play a crucial role in distributing nutrients in the oligotrophic environment of Red Sea [REF]. The world’s most productive and biodiverse tropical biotopes including mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs occur in the Red Sea [REF]. The coral reefs of the Red Sea accounts for 3.8% of the world’s reefs, and are rich in diversity of associated fauna (2710 species) with a high degree of endemism [REF]. The rich biodiversity of the Red Sea reefs attracts tourists for diving generating massive income and creating opportunities for tourism-based coastal development (e.g., beach resorts). However, such activities pose a serious threat to the biodiversity and functionality of this fragile ecosystem [REF].",human
"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common malignant tumor of digestive tract in the world. Its incidence rate ranks the third in the incidence rate of all cancers and the second in the death caused by cancer [REF]. It has been reported that the incidence of CRC is positively correlated with socioeconomic development. By 2030, the number of CRC cases in developed countries is projected to increase to 2.2 million and the number of deaths to 1.1 million [REF]. In recent years, although some progress has been made in the early diagnosis and systemic treatment of CRC, the five-year survival rate of patients with CRC is still only about 50%. This is mainly because CRC often has no obvious symptoms in the early stage, and most CRC patients are diagnosed at a late stage and even have metastases. However, the mechanism of the occurrence, development and invasion of CRC is still not completely clear. Therefore, searching for detection methods and tumor markers for early diagnosis of CRC, and further exploring the exact molecular mechanism of its occurrence, development and invasion are hot topics in current research. Epidemiological studies have found that diet, obesity and diabetes are risk factors for CRC [REF]. A large number of studies have shown that the abnormal lipid metabolism of cells is involved in the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer, and is significantly related to the clinical treatment effect and prognosis [REF].Lipids are hydrophobic macromolecules, which are divided into several groups according to structure of ketoacyl and isoprene: FAs (fatty acids), phospholipids, TGs (cholesterol, triglycerides), sphingolipids, and cholesteryl esters [REF]. Lipids are essential nutrients for cells, acting as the structural components of cell membranes, material transport, energy suppliers, signaling molecules, apoptosis and other aspects [REF]. Abnormal lipid metabolism refers to the abnormal anabolism and catabolism of lipids in the body, resulting in too much or too little lipids in each tissue, thus affecting the body function [REF]. Although normal cells regulate anabolic and catabolic pathways to adapt to changes in nutrient supply, tumor cells can exhibit uncontrolled proliferation even in the presence of nutrient deficiency. The tumor microenvironment is hypoxic, acidic, and nutrient deficient, resulting in metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells and adjacent stromal cells to promote tumor cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis [REF]. Many studies have shown that the abnormal lipid metabolism in cells is significantly related to the induction and metastasis of cancer. At the same time, clinical studies have shown that the abnormal lipid metabolism is closely related to the poor prognosis of CRC patients [REF]. Both malignant progression and accelerated proliferation of CRC cells require more energy, which induces changes in lipid metabolism to allow CRC cells survive. Abnormal lipid metabolism causes changes in various genes and proteins, as well as the dysregulation of cytokines and signaling pathways [REF]. Attentionally, lipid metabolism in CRC cells can be regulated not only by intracellular signals, but also by various components in the tumor microenvironment, including various cells, cytokines, DNA, RNA, and nutrients including lipids [REF].In this review, we discussed the changes of lipid metabolism in colorectal cancer and its role in the genesis and development of colorectal cancer, and also discussed the remodeling of lipid metabolism pathway in CRC cells and tumor microenvironment. The review provides a summary for better understanding and targeting lipid metabolism therapy and improving prognosis.",human
"Salmonella is one of the most commonly recognized pathogens that cause gastroenteritis [REF], which results in significant morbidity, mortality and economic loss [REF]. In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 153 million cases of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) enteric infections worldwide, of which 56 969 were fatal and 50% were foodborne [REF]. Salmonella was the second foodborne epidemic in some regions’ illness monitoring reports from 2006 to 2010 [REF]. Among the 2600 Salmonella serotypes discovered, NTS serovars such as Typhimurium and Enteritidis are the most common worldwide [REF]. Poultry has been identified as the one cause of human salmonellosis, and avian salmonellosis affects the poultry business and can infect humans when infected poultry meat and eggs are consumed [REF]. Eggs are the principal source of salmonellosis and other foodborne illnesses [REF]. Salmonella that grows in animal farms may contaminate eggs and meat during the slaughtering process before being transmitted to people via the food chain. Indeed, multiple earlier investigations have reported the isolation of Salmonella from animal and human diets [REF]. Human S. Enteritidis is commonly associated with the intake of infected eggs and chicken meat, whereas S. Typhimurium is commonly associated with the consumption of pork, poultry and beef [REF]. In addition, Salmonella enterica serovars have been found in varying concentrations in animal products and by-products worldwide [REF]. The most often-reported serovars connected with human foodborne diseases are Salmonella Typhimurium and Enteritidis [REF]. However, untyped Salmonella of animal origin is becoming more common in Bangladesh [REF]. However, domestic chickens in developing countries live close to humans in urban and rural communities and are frequently housed overnight in the family home [REF]. As soon as a chicken becomes infected, it sheds faeces into the environment. Additionally, interacting with employees in poultry farms and slaughterhouses, the main route of human Salmonella infections, involves contaminated meat and eggs [REF]. One of the primary reasons for animal management is the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in humans and animals [REF]. AMR is a worldwide public health issue [REF]. AMR can be caused by one of three fundamental processes: (i) antibiotic modification by lowering absorption or enhancing efflux of the antibiotic via their enzymes; (ii) alteration in the antibiotic's target site and (iii) gaining the capacity to break or change the antibiotic [REF]. Several lines of evidence showed that using antimicrobial agents in food animals contributes to the emergence and spread of AMR in foodborne Salmonella [REF]. AMR has recently been a significant issue in treating Salmonella infections [REF]. Salmonella infections in food animals are essential in public health and, in particular, food safety because food products of animal origin are thought to be the most common source of human Salmonella infections [REF]. Contamination by healthy food handlers is also assessed during food processing. In recent years, it has been estimated that animals and their products can account for up to 96% of all Salmonella infections in humans [REF]. AMR is expected to increase by 70% in Asia, posing a national and global threat [REF]. The WHO estimates that Salmonella infections cause 93.8 million instances of gastroenteritis worldwide each year and that Salmonella infections cause 155 000 fatalities [REF]. Moreover, according to a recent Shanghai study, just 1.1% of strains were responsive to all 16 medications, and AMR rates for third and fourth-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime and cefepime) were 10% and 8.1%, respectively [REF]. Furthermore, according to a study conducted in Guangzhou, annual resistance rates of ampicillin are reasonably consistent. However, resistance rates of NTS to ceftazidime in 2015 (31.43%) were significantly greater than in 2014 (16%). Furthermore, AMR to ampicillin was considerably higher in serotype Typhimurium and Enteritidis isolates than in other serotypes [REF]. Salmonella drug resistance rates to cephalosporin and cefepime were 22.3% and 13.1%, respectively, in four hospitals in Shenzhen,41 which were all higher than the results of earlier Chinese investigations [REF]. This phenomenon demonstrates that the outlook for AMR is bleak. Regarding AMR mechanisms, the corresponding resistance genes are usually found on plasmids, transposons, gene cassettes or variants of the Salmonella genomic islands SGI1 and SGI2 [REF]. However, this study revealed a prevalence of Salmonella in poultry and livestock-derived foods. In this regard, this meta-analytical study will be evidential for assessing the prevalence of Salmonella in livestock and poultry-derived food and AMR in livestock and poultry-derived foods and comprehensively investigate the whole scenario of Bangladesh. We hypothesize that Salmonella pooled prevalence and antibiotic resistance are increasing in Bangladesh.",human
"Frailty is a dynamic state of diminished physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to adverse events. It has been recognised as a prevalent and important consideration in the individualised management of older adults with cancer [REF]. Routine screening for geriatric conditions has been recommended for all adults over 65 or 70 years of age with a new cancer diagnosis [REF]. In contrast to older adults in the community-dwelling or acute care settings, those living with cancer face the additional acute stressors of cancer symptoms and potential treatment-related toxicities. Frailty has significant implications for not only understanding the underlying health status of a potentially-vulnerable individual with cancer, but also in influencing oncological treatment decisions and discourse, and tailoring non-oncological interventions or supports. Clinicians try to determine those who are too frail for treatment, those who require modified treatment or additional supports, and those who are deemed fit for standard therapy. However, there is currently no consensus regarding the optimum frailty screening or measurement tool in this population.The frailty index (FI) is one way in which frailty can be quantified [REF]. The FI conceptualises frailty as a multi-dimensional risk state which can be measured by the number, rather than the nature, of health problems. An FI is calculated as a proportion of deficits using a well-defined method [REF] e.g., someone with 6 deficits out of 40 counted has an FI of 0.15. As a continuous variable, ranging from zero (most robust) to a theoretical maximum of one (most frail), the FI affords great precision in risk stratification by capturing frailty gradations. In a scoping review of FI in the community and acute care settings, an FI ≥ 0.25 was the most frequently used score to diagnose people as frail, however this was used in less than half of the identified studies [REF]. This score was derived from work by Rockwood and colleagues, which demonstrated that FI = 0.25 had construct and predictive validity to categorise community-dwelling adults as frail or non-frail [REF]. It correlated with the crossing point between robust and frail groups according to Fried et al.’s phenotype model of frailty [REF], another well validated yet conceptually distinct definition of frailty in older persons [REF], and was predictive of institutionalisation and death. It also presented the crossing point between Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) ‘apparently vulnerable’ (mean FI = 0.22) and ‘mildly frail’ (mean FI = 0.27) [REF].However, little is known regarding the validity of FI categories in the context of cancer, and variation in who is deemed frail may be used to determine trial eligibility or treatment allocation [REF], and referral for additional assessments or supports [REF]. It is therefore important to understand how the FI has been categorised in oncology literature, and to understand the rationale for these decisions [REF].The objectives of this scoping review were: (i) to evaluate which FI categories (FI scores and labels) have been used in an oncology setting; and (ii) to identify why these categories were selected by the study authors.",human
"Cellular metabolism, cell cycle regulation, cellular endurance, and differentiation are the essential functions conducted by kinases [REF]. Nowadays, considerable attention has been given to research on kinases. The signaling pathways mediated by protein kinases have been related to a variety of diseases, such as diabetes, inflammation, and cancer [REF]. The kinases are categorized into a wide group lipid kinases, carbohydrates, and protein kinases. According to human genome sequencing, approximately 2% of the human genome codes for protein kinases, which are further classified as families and subfamilies. The major kinases found in mammalian signaling pathways are lipid kinases, tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases, and dual kinases (Ser/Thr and Ty). Protein kinases are enzymes that use the end γ-phosphate group from ATP to phosphorylate serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues in other proteins. Phosphorylation changes target protein activity by controlling signaling pathways by amplification, cellular location, or interaction with other controlling proteins [REF]. The study on human kinases revealed that there are 518 protein kinases grouped into families reliant on their biological functions as well as statistical sequence evaluation [REF].Kinase inhibitors are small molecules that inhibit kinases and are of much use in therapeutic and diagnostic fields. According to recent research, Kinase inhibitors serve as a potential target for treating various diseases like autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and inflammatory disorders [REF]. As of November 24, 2022, the US FDA had approved 72 small molecules that are therapeutic protein kinase inhibitors. All drugs that have been approved by the FDA work best when taken orally, with the exception of temsirolimus, trilaciclib, and netarsudil [REF] (https://brimr.org/protein-kinase-inhibitors/). Novel biologic agents, such as monoclonal antibodies, can also be employed for targeting specific kinases. However, target non-specificity and toxicity are the principal disadvantages associated with kinase inhibitors. Small molecules from natural sources may act together with proteins and function as signaling molecules, which can be further employed for human health. The kinase inhibitors from various plant products help treat several disorders (Table 1).In an in vivo study performed on cancer cell line 85As2 (Gastric cancer cell line), the steroidal alkaloid tomatidine as well as tomatidine rich tomato leaf extract exhibited reduction in proliferation of 85As2 cells as a result of dysregulation of type 1 interferon-stimulated genes [REF]. As a result, several marine natural chemicals have been exercised as lead drug composites that progress in future medicines. Around 22 kinase inhibitors are synthesized from marine bacteria, for instance, Bacillus and Streptomyces species; 16 from marine fungi sources like Penicillium, Aspergillus, etc.; two new kinase inhibitors from deep-sea soft corals like Cladiella australis, Cladiella pachyclados; 14 kinase inhibitors from marine animals like sea cucumber, marine echinoderm, etc.; 10 from marine algae-like cyanobacteria; 42 from marine sponges [REF].Kinase inhibitors are a rapidly growing and important category of target therapeutics. To target kinases signaling, drug discovery and development initiatives have looked at a range of approaches. The role of kinases in drug designing and as delivery systems has been described as follows:Many protein kinases are part of “cascade systems,” where multiple protein kinases sequentially activate each other. A kinase cascade plays a vital role in amplification, diversification of signal effects, and permission for grouping signaling pathways to form networks. Because kinase cascades exist, it is possible to find and produce drugs that are not kinase inhibitors but prevent kinases from being triggered due to the subsequent “upstream” kinase in the cascade through attachment to them. PD98059 is certainly the first kinase inhibitor developed for the Ras-Raf MEK-ERK cascade, which acts through binding to MEK1 and then blocking its stimulation via Raf [REF]. The dual-specificity protein kinases (MEK1/2) that block the RAS-Raf-MEK MAP kinase pathway are trametinib, binimetinib, cobimetinib, and selumetinib. Among these, binimetinib and cobimetinib are used in combination with encorafenib and vemurafenib, respectively for curing melanoma. Selumetinib is employed for Von Recklinghausen disease [REF]. Raf, Src, epidermal growth factor, and breakpoint cluster area are all kinase targets. Early on in the investigation of oncogenic proteins, Abelson’s kinase (bcr-Abl) was discovered. Clinical usage of these inhibitors has also resulted in the growth of drug-resistant malignancies as additional consequences [REF]. The detection alongside subsequent exploitation of numerous configurational positions of kinases is part of the tale of developing these kinase inhibitors. Previously, selectivity had been identified as a problem during the development of kinase inhibitors that bind at the ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) pocket. As ATP is a cofactor required for the functioning of the kinase, developmental pressure has been applied to keep the binding site of discrete kinases in a general shape and chemical similarity. As a result, the active sites avoiding the direct binding of ATP or kinase conformations with more structural and chemical heterogeneity have been employed. The activation and inactivation modes of kinases allow for the utilization of conformational variability. A rationale based on the structure was also proposed to prevent the formation of drug-resilient mutations. Since the inactive version of a kinase does not require binding with the conjoint substrate ATP, it has been found to have higher structural diversity. A pioneer kinase inhibitor, Imatinib, exhibits binding to the inactive forms of PDGF, c-Kit, and Abl kinases [REF]. Imatinib is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia as it causes inhibition of BCR-Abl, an oncogenic tyrosine kinase fusion protein also employed to manage gastrointestinal tumors and myeloproliferative disorders caused by inhibition of c-Kit tyrosine kinase and PDGF receptors, respectively. As a result, oncology happens to be the therapeutic area of choice for the vast majority of drug development efforts for kinase inhibitors [REF]. Most of the small protein kinase inhibitors that have been approved or are on the verge of getting approval for their clinical use, along with the majority of kinase inhibitors currently in the clinical trial phase, intend to target tyrosine kinases and are employed for the treatment of varied cancers. The global market for kinase inhibitors is increasing gradually. Although cancer will likely remain a top priority for kinase medication development for several years, the number of kinase inhibitors in clinical studies for many other disorders has expanded [REF]. For example, Janus Kinase inhibitors such as tofacitinib and ruxolitinib have been approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis and myelofibrosis, respectively [REF]. Inhibition of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) by six approved molecules, i.e., Alectinib, Brigatinib, Ceritinib, Crizotinib, Entrectinib, and Lorlatinib, has been employed for the treatment of NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) (link). Targets used for developing kinase inhibitors for diseases other than cancer are described in Fig. 1.WNKs direct the phosphorylation and activation of two interrelated protein kinases: SPAK (STE20/SPS1-related Proline/Alanine-Rich Kinase), OSRK1 (Oxidative Stress Responsive Kinase1), leading to the discovery that they control blood pressure. The unique location of a catalytic lysine residue on WNK isoforms might be of potential use in contrast to many other kinases to build WNK-specific ATP-competitive inhibitors, opening up a new avenue for developing better blood pressure medications. Although it is uncertain which WNK isoform of the four mammalian isoforms is possibly essential to be blocked to lower NCC (Na+/Cl− co-transporter) and NKCC2 (Na+/K+/2Cl− co-transporter-2) activity in the kidney. Additionally, in some studies, WNK4 was a negative controller of WNK1 signaling; signifying that blockage of this isoform might enhance renal salt reassimilation and blood pressure [REF]. Patients with mutations of LRKK2 acquire signs of disease that are identical to both the onset and progression of idiopathic Parkinson’s syndrome. LRKK2 is a multidomain protein with a large GTPase and a kinase domain of 2527 residues. Numerous particular LRKK2 inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of Parkinson’s syndrome. Biological drugs, like adalimumab tend to neutralize TNF-α and have a specific role in treating many inflammatory disorders like Crohn’s disease, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Several Ser/Thr specific protein kinases are involved in the Myeloid cell signaling pathway, which regulates translation, transcription, processing, and secretion of TNF-α along with other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Many serine/threonine-specific protein kinases are involved in these systems, which regulate TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines’ transcription, translation, processing, and secretion. However, it is challenging to develop advanced drugs to target these signaling pathways owing to the complexity in deciding the target protein kinase due to the production of cytokines other than IL-6/12 and TNF-α [REF].",human
"Health workers concerned about the human right to health have reason to be wary as they observe the world around them. Despite a pandemic-triggered global economy slowdown, human consumption continues to generate dangerous levels of greenhouse gasses, pushing carbon dioxide levels to their highest in three million years [REF]. During the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, profit-driven economic systems crowned a new billionaire every 30 hours while pushing one million people toward extreme poverty every 33 hours. Forty of these new billionaires are pharmaceutical executives [REF]. Colonial imprints, white supremacy, and racial capitalism contours and textures both public and private care systems in ways that create patterns of advantage for white-identified and wealthy individuals and disadvantage for (largely poorer) black- and brown-identified individuals in their encounters with COVID-19 [REF]. The consequences of these upstream forces are health inequities experienced as biological pathology. By upstream, we refer to the social, political, and economic contexts that structure society and are “manufacturers of illness,” such as profit-making institutions [REF]. Generative mechanisms in society that positively influence well-being are also examples of upstream social forces, such as equitable transportation, healthy rivers and wetlands, and community practices imbued with an ethos of care. The recalcitrant persistence of health inequities experienced across both local and global contexts has intensified interest in frameworks that claim to diagnose the root causes of these inequities accurately. Prominent among these interdisciplinary fields are social medicine, collective health, and structural competency, all of which also offer a complementary set of prescriptions to remedy inequitable outcomes [REF]. Some argue that the intensified interest at this moment is simply a cyclical rediscovery of historically well-described relationships between oppressive social conditions that structure risk for illness [REF]. Others believe that the intensified interest and energy, pressured by the emergency context of climate catastrophe, ongoing racial injustice, and a global pandemic, signal something different. They hold the hope that disruptive and generative social change will move the global community toward actual fulfillment of article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that “everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family.” [REF] Social medicine, collective health, and structural competency share core commonalities in their assertion that health is a human right generated not in the biological domain but in the upstream determination of health. This is often akin to the contemporary reference within human rights literature to civil, political, social, cultural, and economic rights. All three of these fields focus on the (re)production of health and systems of care, as well as the political economies that aid or obstruct the realization of public health as a social good. They are each interdisciplinary fields linked with social change projects with broad agendas encompassing the social response to societal ills. All three grew out of academic contexts, and their adherents publish on and organize thematic conferences focused on health justice.Despite their shared ideological interest in health justice and remedying health inequities, practitioners and scholars in the fields of social medicine, collective health, and structural competency engage in minimal dialogue. Possible reasons for the lack of dialogue include their origins in different geographic, linguistic, and historical contexts, territorialism, academic advancement linked to the generation of novel concepts and language, and the belief that new conceptualizations expanding beyond existing theories and actions are required to eliminate health inequities. Whatever the reason, the lack of exchange and engagement diminishes the possibilities of relationship-building, theoretical expansion, imaginative problem-solving, and the collective building of power needed for social change toward health justice. In short, we believe that the lack of dialogue isolates and minimizes the potential for all three to substantively contribute to the movement seeking to ensure health as a human right for all. In this paper, our goal is to ignite intentional dialogue among these three fields by (1) juxtaposing their definitions, geographic and historical journeys, and key frameworks and themes, (2) proposing that transformative pedagogy offers one strategy to foster dialogue, and (3) providing concrete examples of what such pedagogy might look like. We illustrate these points by drawing on our collective experience as a transnational group of social medicine educators and practitioners.",human
"Orofacial pain (OFP) is that localized below the orbito-meatal line, above the neck and anterior to the ears, including pain in structures of the oral cavity. According to the latest OFP classification, OFP can be acute, when it lasts for less than 3 months, episodic, when it occurs on fewer than 15 days per month whether or not for more than 3 months, or chronic, when it persists for more than 3 months and is present on at least 15 days per month [REF]. This distinction is important because chronic OFP is often accompanied by reduced quality of life, sleep and psychological disturbances and disability [REF] that require different management and it has less favorable prognosis. The estimated prevalence of chronic OFP in the general population is of 10% [REF]. OFP can be additionally classified as primary, when its etiology is unknown (e.g., chronic primary temporomandibular joint pain and idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia), or secondary, when it has an identifiable cause (e.g., temporomandibular joint pain attributed to arthritis and trigeminal neuralgia attributed to multiple sclerosis). In other words, chronic primary OFP conditions can be understood as their own disease, while chronic secondary pain syndromes represent symptoms of other underlying conditions or diseases [REF]. Some of the most challenging types of chronic primary OFP to manage include painful temporomandibular disorders (pTMDs), idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and burning mouth syndrome (BMS). These seemingly idiopathic conditions have no cure and treatment is mostly palliative, geared toward pain management and coping strategies. Often, patients living chronic pain, including pTMDs, TN, and BMS, must endure significant biological, psychosocial, and economic burdens that also affect their families, and society as a whole [REF].The most common types of primary pTMDs are myofascial pain and temporomandibular joint pain [REF]. These conditions have a prevalence of about 5% that is greater in women than in men [REF] and their hallmark is spontaneous masticatory muscle and/or temporomandibular joint pain that is exacerbated upon jaw function. TN has a lifetime prevalence of 0.16%–0.3% and also affects more women than men (1.5:1) [REF]. TN is characterized by recurrent severe paroxysmal pain restricted to the territory of the trigeminal nerves (which innervate the orofacial region) lasting from a fraction of a second up to 2 min. TN pain is described as electric shock-like, stabbing, or sharp, and is triggered by innocuous stimuli (e.g., washing the face, eating, and brushing the teeth). BMS has a prevalence of 2.5%–5% in the general population that rises to 14% among post-menopausal women. BMS is characterized by a spontaneous burning sensation that most commonly affects the tongue, lips, and hard and soft palates and may be accompanied by an alteration of taste, a stinging sensation, dryness, and atypical odontalgia [REF].Despite considerable scientific advances over the past decades [REF], the need for greater understanding of the pathophysiology underlying these primary OFP conditions persists because treatment remains suboptimal. In this scenario, pre-clinical research has been and will continue to be an important and irreplaceable means of facilitating scientific advancement. Furthermore, we are currently experiencing a boom of both pain neuroimaging and genetic studies that find crucial complementation in animal research [REF].The goal of this review is to describe the currently available rodent assays (injury models) and OFP measures (behavior) that can be used in support of chronic primary OFP research, in specific pTMDs, TN, and BMS. We will discuss their applicability and challenges considering our current knowledge of the etiology and pathophysiology of these conditions and possible future directions. Previous reviews have focused on other conditions linked to OFP, including migraine/headaches [REF] and oral cancer [REF].",human
"Biomarkers used for food origin authentication purposes are molecules which presence relates to a specific species. Two prominent categories of these molecules are proteomic (proteins and peptides) and genomic. To be considered a proper biomarker, these molecules should ideally be responsive, specific, and applicable [REF].Collagen, a fibrous protein abundant in different animal tissues like skin, bones, and connective tissue, can be partially hydrolysed to extract gelatin, which is extensively used in food and pharmaceutical applications [REF]. There are two unique types of gelatin, namely types A and B, resulting from the pH of the pre-treatments used to generate these compounds. Type A gelatin is produced by using acid pre-treatments, and it has an isoelectric point at pHs 6–9, whereas type B gelatin, generated by alkaline pre-treatments, has an isoelectric point at pHs 4.8–5.4 [REF]. Porcine and bovine skins and bones are currently the most commonly utilized materials worldwide to supply the demands of gelatin for multiple applications [REF]. However, there are currently public health concerns related to their use as they may be a source of pathogen dissemination, such as prions associated with the consumption of mammalian gelatins [REF]. Moreover, the religious beliefs of some sectors of the population are a limiting factor in the use of gelatins of animal origin by consumers. The dietary laws and requirements followed by Muslims (Halal food) and Jews (Kosher food) need to ensure that food products are free from porcine products and by-products, while Hindu customers demand food products of no bovine origin [REF]. On the other hand, gelatin is also utilized as a supplement or traditional medicine, such as donkey-hide gelatin, a traditional Chinese medicine manufactured from donkey skin [REF].Recognizing the source of gelatin is also important for the consumers of this high-value product in order to avoid product fraud. For instance, although industrial gelatin made from leather waste can have a significant level of chromium, which can lead to kidney damage and, in extreme situations, be linked to cancer [REF], some retailers have substituted industrial gelatin for edible gelatin in food products due the low cost and ease of manufacture of this product. Sausages and pork jelly are food products that are widely appreciated as a delicacy in numerous regions of China, and both items contain gelatin. The marketing expenditure allocated to the promotion of these food products exceeds $15 million [REF]. Furthermore, other cases of food fraud were reported by Demirhan, Ulca [REF] that discovered porcine DNA in some Halal food products, such as marshmallows, gum drops, and Turkish delights, that were declared to be made with Halal gelatin when they were tested. Due to worries about allergies, law, ethics, and the practice of certain religions, using less expensive materials in edible bird's nests, such as porcine gelatin, can cause issues. Using a mix of chemometrics analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), porcine gelatin was found in edible bird's nests in one instance. Porcine gelatin was discovered through PCA analysis of FTIR data, indicating at least 5% adulteration in edible bird's nests [REF].On the basis of these consumer demands and increased public health concerns, researchers are working on the most reliable and convenient approaches for manufacturers to allow the identification of the original sources of gelatins. Several methods have been established, although there is not an officially authentication method defined yet, as each method has its own advantages and limitations in its implementation. On the other hand, even though some effective methods have been successfully developed in many countries, the excessive prices of equipment/reagents of some of these techniques do not allow their regular and widespread use. One of the highly acceptable strategies is the application of proteomic biomarkers, including proteins and peptides, that could be used to determine the original source of gelatins [REF], while genomic-based methods have also been proven useful for this purpose [REF].The use of novel biomarkers to identify the origin of gelatin represents a significant improvement in the field as these biomarkers offer more precise and reliable methods for gelatin authentication. This data can be utilized to strengthen quality control, guarantee food safety, and shield customers from food fraud [REF]. Hence, this review defines and highlights the methods currently available to establish the origin of gelatin, including the recent developments in proteomic approaches, including chromatography, mass spectroscopy, electrophoresis, lateral flow devices, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods, as well as genomic approaches based on nucleic acids and PCR detection, including singleplex PCR, PCR southern hybridization, and multiplex PCR methods. The main advantages and challenges of each of these approaches will also be discussed, along with the future outlook on the field and the main research gaps needed to be addressed for an efficient identification of the original biological materials from which different gelatins are generated. Several databases (PubMed, Scopus, the Web of Science, and Google Scholar) were used to identify the sources of information relevant for this review, including sources dating since 1980 onwards until the most recent developments in the field. The criteria used for the selection of the sources of information as tailored to proteomic and genomic biomarkers and their potential application in the field of gelatin authentication.",human
"Primary liver cancer is currently the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 75%-85% of liver cancer cases [REF]. Due to the tumor heterogeneity, tumor metastasis, and resistance to traditional chemotherapeutic agents, current treatment options such as surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and liver transplantation for HCC will only benefit a few percentages of patients, novel therapeutic modalities are urgently needed for patients with advanced or unresectable HCC [REF].The crucial role of the immune system in suppressing the growth, proliferation, and progression of tumors is widely accepted [REF]. The immunotherapy of tumors mainly utilizes the host immune system to fight the tumor by regulating the host’s own immune function or enhancing the immunogenicity of the tumors [REF]. HCC is considered to be inflammation-induced cancer, showing good sensitivity to immunotherapies [REF]. Immunotherapy strategies for HCC mainly include immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), cell-based therapies, and tumor immune vaccines. Cytokines such as interferon also show certain anti-HCC effects [REF]. Checkpoint inhibitors are typically monoclonal antibodies that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) or cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). PD-1 is a surface receptor highly expressed by activated T cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DC), and natural killer cells (NK) which provides inhibitory signals to the immune system to modulate the activity of immune cells in peripheral tissues and keep T-cells from attacking normal cells in the body. The interaction between PD-L1 expressed on cancer cells and PD-1 is a key mediator of cancer immune escape, which leads to the suppression of anticancer immunity and the promotion of tumor progression [REF]. Immune checkpoints blockade with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies have been successfully utilized in the treatment of various cancers such as melanoma [REF], non–small cell lung cancer [REF], bladder carcinoma [REF], Hodgkin’s lymphoma [REF], and Merkel cell carcinoma [REF]. CTLA-4, another important ICIs target, competitively inhibits the binding of the B7 ligand to the costimulatory receptor CD28, resulting in decreased peripheral T-cell activity. Specific blocking of CTLA-4 can increase the T-cell infiltration of tumors and enhance the killing effect of the immune system on tumors [REF]. In addition, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) and other cell therapies as well as HCC tumor immune vaccines also show good effects and application prospects. However, the unique inhibitory tumor microenvironment (TME) of HCC and the genetic differences of the host make existing immunotherapies challenges. Compared to unprecedented and durable responses in these T cell-inflamed cancers, the objective response rates (ORRs) of PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade in HCC remain relatively low [REF]. It was proved that TME, specific receptors, and signaling pathways can affect the clinical outcome of PD-1/PD-L1 treatment [REF], Combining different immunotherapies or combining immunotherapies with other modalities may provide synergistic effects and facilitate the development of the treatment of HCC [REF].Regulated by related histone-modifying enzymes (HMEs), various post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone substrates, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ADP ribosylation, play a crucial role in chromatin dynamics, relative gene regulation and many other biological functions [REF]. Increasing evidence indicates that abnormal epigenetic regulation of gene transcription associated with histone modifications plays a crucial role in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis [REF]. In contrast to direct mutations or deletions in the main DNA sequence, aberrant epigenetic modifications are potentially reversible by epigenetic therapies [REF]. Several small-molecule inhibitors of HME, such as histone methylation inhibitors, histone demethylation inhibitors, histone deacetylation inhibitors, and DNA methylation inhibitors, can lead to the programmed death of tumor cells by affecting the cell cycle, angiogenesis, proliferation, and migration [REF]. To date, histone deacetylation inhibitors (HDACis) including vorinostat, romidepsin, belinostat, and panobinostat have been approved by FDA for the treatment of hematological malignancies such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and multiple myeloma [REF]. Despite promising results in the treatment of blood cancers, the therapeutic efficacy of several HDACis as a single therapeutic agent in solid tumors such as HCC has been unsatisfactory, and the prevalence of drug-induced side effects was relatively high [REF]. Till now, numerous combination therapies involving HDACis in synergy with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy have been efficiently developed to enhance therapeutic efficacy [REF].HDACis can regulate gene expression by regulating host epigenetic modification, thereby overcoming the tolerance of HCC patients to immunotherapy and enhancing the therapeutic effect. HDACis have been shown to promote immunotherapies in a variety of tumors [REF]. This effect is mainly achieved by enhancing the immunogenicity of the tumor and regulating the tumor immune microenvironment. Studies have shown that HDACis can increase the expression of PD-1/PD-L1, thereby increasing the sensitivity of tumors to ICIs treatment [REF]. In some tumors, HDACis also increase the expression of MHC molecules that assist the host immune system in recognizing tumor antigens [REF]. The regulation of HDACis on TME can promote the recruitment of T cells and NK cells and exert the function of tumor inhibition by increasing the expression of chemokines, cytokines and NK cell-related receptors. Similar mechanisms were also found in HCC. Moreover, these mechanisms work together to promote the effect of immunotherapies. The effect of HDACis on immunotherapy also allows these drugs to work without high doses. This reduces the possible cytotoxicity and adverse reactions of immune drugs, and also creates chances for wider research and application [REF].In the past few years, the rapid development of nanotechnology and its application in many fields have had a profound impact on the development of biomedicine [REF]. Nano-based drug delivery system (NDDS) constructed on the basis of nanomaterials provides an effective and powerful new strategy for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy drugs for HCC [REF]. NDDS specifically targets tumor cells through advanced delivery systems, overcoming inhibitory TME while effectively reducing the damage to normal cells. Currently, a large number of nanomedicine-based therapies are being developed for HCC [REF].Combined multidrug approaches for cancer treatment could overcome the limitations of single therapies, increase antitumor effects, and reduce drug resistance. In this review, we describe immunotherapies and HDACis in detail, explain the mechanism of their therapeutic effects in HCC respectively, and discuss current progress in the combination of novel immunotherapies with HDACis. In addition, concerned that the nano-based drug delivery system (NDDS) exhibits outstanding properties such as targeted delivery, TME response, and site-specific release in the delivery of multi-drug combination, we further discuss the potential clinical applications of NDDS in dual-therapy for HCC briefly.",human
"Transactional sex is casual sex between two people to receive material incentives in exchange for sexual favors. Transactional sex is associated with negative consequences, which increase the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion, and physiological trauma. In Sub-Saharan Africa, several primary studies have been conducted in various countries to examine the prevalence and associated factors of transactional sex among women. These studies had great discrepancies and inconsistent results. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the pooled prevalence of the practice of transactional sex among women and its associated factors in Sub-Saharan Africa.Transactional sex is defined as a sexual act (s) that is structured by the implicit assumption that sex is exchanged for a variety of instrumental supports such as educational expenses, transportation, a place to sleep, clothing, material items, or money. It reveals that socioeconomic factors have a great role in establishing exchange-based sexual relationships in many countries with high HIV prevalence. Commonly, in many countries, men provide and women receive material rewards [REF].Globally, an estimated 36.7 million individuals worldwide were infected with the Hunan Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic. Young people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are more threatened by the HIV epidemic than young people elsewhere. In total, there were 2.1 million new HIV infections worldwide, with 1.1 million occurring in sub-Saharan Africa [REF]. HIV infection deaths mainly affect the young and productive segments of the community. Among newly infected people in SSA, 40% belong to the age group of 15–24 years, and more than 60% of these infections occurred among young girls [REF].Significant proportions of females have multiple concurrent sexual relationships and engage in risky sex. Because of their risky sexual *practices*, the girls and their sexual partners, including schoolmates, are at risk of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) [REF]. Among HIV-infected young people in the world, 63% lived in sub-Saharan Africa, and among these, 59% were female. Unprotected sex also puts women at risk of unintended pregnancy, which leads to unsafe abortions [REF]. Sex motivated by financial gain is a serious public health issue, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa [REF].Assessing transactional relationships is still an important aspect of HIV prevention initiatives [REF]. Individual behaviours that harm people’s chances of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unwanted pregnancies were identified. Among these identified risk behaviours, transactional sex (sex in exchange for money, gifts, benefits, or other monetary rewards) is the main one [REF]. The infection rate of STIs, including HIV, among young women aged 15 to 24 years old, is greater than that of young males (3.6 to 1 ratio) [REF]. Early sexual activity, early pregnancy, unsafe abortions, and the increase in HIV infections have become major concerns in sub-Saharan Africa [REF]. Unwanted pregnancy is the cause of school dropout in girls. School dropout is an additional barrier that women, severely handicapped by parenthood, must face to overcome the longer-term impacts of childbearing [REF].Transactional sex involves engaging in sex for money or gifts in order to increase one’s long-term life chances [REF].In sub-Saharan Africa, cultural and social norms, gender inequality, and harmful traditional *practices*, combined with a lack of access to reproductive health services, a high unemployment rate, and young females from lower-income families, expose young people to a variety of social and economic challenges and encourage them to engage in transactional sex [REF].Transactional sex occurred at a rate of 2% in Niger, 14% in Benin, 14% in Kenya, 27% in Zambia, 31% in Uganda, 5% in Cameroon, and 85–90% in Uganda among sexually active girls who reported ever engaging in sexual relations in exchange for money or gifts in the last 12 months [REF]. Transactional sex is associated with HIV risk factors or behaviours including alcohol use [REF], sexual or physical violence or abuse [REF], inconsistent condom use [REF] and multiple partners [REF].In Sub-Saharan Africa, several primary studies have been conducted in various countries to examine the prevalence and associated factors of transactional sex among women. These studies had great discrepancies and inconsistent results across countries. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise the pooled prevalence of the *practice* of transactional sex among women and its associated factors in sub-Saharan Africa.",human
"According to the updated global cancer burden estimates from Global Cancer Statistics 2020 [REF], endometrial cancer ranks the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide, and the most common gynaecologic cancer in several developed regions, including North America and Eastern and Northern Europe. A worrying trend is that, since the late 1990s, the incidence of endometrial cancer has rapidly increased in several developing countries during urbanisation, including some Asian countries (Japan, Singapore, China and the Philippines) and South Africa [REF]. It is suggested that this phenomenon may be explained, at least partly, by changing environmental and lifestyle risk factors in these regions, such as the epidemic of obesity, lack of physical activity and long-time sitting [REF]. Although obesity is a known risk factor for endometrial cancer, the association between sedentary behaviour and endometrial cancer remains largely unclear. Sedentary behaviour includes sitting, reclining or lying behaviour characterised by low energy expenditure [REF]. During the past decades, technological innovation has influenced how people work and spend leisure-time, and has led to inevitably prolonged sitting time, particularly for desk-based office work and screen-based recreation. According to the WHO Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour (2020), long sedentary time is associated with various deleterious health outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and more recently total cancer morbidity [REF].Three previous meta-analyses investigating the association between sedentary behaviour and several types of cancers [REF], reported a 28–36% increased risk of endometrial cancer among individuals with higher levels of sedentary behaviour by summarising 3–11 individual studies. However, some evidence on sedentary behaviour and endometrial cancer has not yet been included in existing review and meta-analyses, the level of evidence for cancer-specific incidence remains unclear [REF]. Given inconsistent results reported, an up-to-date review of current evidence is in urgent need to clarify the association between sedentary behaviour and endometrial cancer risk.No distinction in domains of sedentary behaviour is a likely source of the discrepancy in previous findings. The WHO Guidelines 2020 has operationalised the definition of sedentary behaviour to further include self-reported sitting that can be assessed in various domains (including leisure-time and occupational domain) and total sedentary behaviour [REF]. Meanwhile, the association with adverse health outcomes may differ in certain domains of sedentary behaviour [REF]. It is increasingly recognised that confounding factors may vary greatly across domains of sedentary behaviour, and contribute to varied associations with health-related outcomes [REF]. For example, while occupational sedentary behaviour is related to education and socioeconomic variables, leisure-time sedentary behaviour is likely linked to lifestyle factors such as diet and obesity [REF]. Moreover, these two domains are often inversely correlated to physical activity. However, current evidence has been derived mostly from studies that have broadly categorised sedentary behaviour according to the level of sitting time involved [REF]. Domain-specific analyses, taking account of variability in study characteristics, may help to further clarify the investigated association and to refine the prevention strategy of endometrial cancer.Besides, the complex interplay within lifestyle factors, including obesity, physical activity and sedentary behaviour, needs to be taken into consideration within the context. Obesity is a known risk factor for endometrial cancer, with a clear dose-response relationship (the higher the body mass index (BMI), the greater the risk), detailed documented by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) working group [REF]. Given that prolonged sitting is likely to be related with high BMI, obesity thus may be a potential mediator linking sedentary behaviour to cancer incidence. Under this circumstance, studies adjusting for BMI as a confounding factor may attenuate the true effects of sedentary behaviour when evaluating its impacts on endometrial cancer. A few studies have probably recognised this issue and provided results without and with additional adjustment for BMI [REF]. In addition, although less evidence presented, similar concerns have been raised with regard to physical activity, which has a potential protective effect on cancer risk [REF].In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the primary aim was to analyse comprehensively the existing studies of the associations between domain-specific (occupational and leisure-time) and total sedentary behaviour and endometrial cancer risk, with additional attention paid to potential difference of the findings related to different adjustment strategies for BMI and physical activity.",human
"Microneedles have attracted increasing interest in recent years in biomedical areas, such as drug delivery, biosensing, and fluid extraction [REF]. The tips of the microneedles can penetrate the epidermis layer of skin to arrive at the top layer of the dermis that is above the blood capillaries. Thus, the microneedles would not touch the nerve endings to further avoid bleeding and pain [REF]. The microchannels can be formed on the skin by the microneedles where the molecules can pass through, or the microneedles can bring the devices, such as the electrodes to get the biomedical signals [REF]. For drug administration, the microneedle approach has the advantages of avoiding the effect of the gastrointestinal digestion, accelerating the drug absorption, prolonging the effective time, and patient self-administered without needing doctors [REF]. For biosensing, the microneedle approach provides possible continuous monitoring of the biomarkers in interstitial fluid [REF].A microneedle usually has a microscale height and width, in the shape of a cone or a pyramid, and usually, a patch of microneedle arrays sticks to the skin. The concept of transdermal delivery by using microneedles was first proposed by Zhao et al. in 2020, but due to the limitations of micromachining technology, it was not until the 1990s that microneedles were mass produced. The earliest use of hollow needles was by Mcallister et al., 150 μm micron needles made of silicon in the 1980s [REF].Several types of microneedles have been fabricated, including solid microneedles, coated microneedles, soluble microneedles, and hollow microneedles. The microneedle materials can be silicon [REF], metals, biomaterials, and polymers [REF]. A variety of fabrication methods have been explored, including photolithography with selective etching, machining with chemical etching, machining with micro-milling, laser cutter, 3d printing, soft lithography, micro-injection molding, hot embossing, electrohydrodynamic atomization, laser machining, electric-discharge machining with laser machining, soft lithography, drawing lithography, centrifugal lithography, and droplet-borne air blowing [REF].This review would focus particularly on the recent progress of the materials, fabrication methods, and biomedical applications of microneedles. The study would introduce the types of materials for constructing the microneedles, their fabrication, and related biomedical applications in drug delivery, biosensing, and body fluid extraction. Most of the published reviews on microneedles mainly reviewed the application of microneedles in drug delivery [REF]. In recent years, the potential of microneedles in the field of biosensors has attracted great attention because of its painless and slightly invasive, such as the sensor based on microneedles for biomarkers of human tissue fluid. This paper also summarizes other applications on body fluid extraction and nerves. In addition, due to the high precision of the structure of the microneedle, there are great difficulties in the preparation of the microneedle. At present, other reviews lacked discussion about the fabrication methods of the microneedle [REF]. This study summarized almost all the existing processing technologies of the microneedle that can serve as the fundamentals for future study of the microneedle devices.",human
"Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) remains a deadly disease affecting millions of people worldwide. It is estimated to affect approximately one-third of the global population and is becoming one of the most fatal infectious diseases. MTB usually attacks the lungs, but TB bacteria can infect any part of the body such as kidney, spine, or brain [REF]. Worldwide, TB is the 13th leading cause of death and the second raging infectious killer after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) [REF]. In 2020, an estimated 10 million people got ill with TB worldwide, the infection being divided as 5.6 million men, 3.3 million women, and 1.1 million children. TB affects most of the countries among all age groups and can be fatal if not treated properly. Moreover, the emergence of drug-resistant strains has further complicated the problem and has become a rising obstacle against efficient therapeutics [REF]. Therapeutics are available but the effective control of the disease is impeded due to the lack of rapid and accurate diagnostics. Under such significant circumstances, there is an urgent need for rapid, accurate, and cost-effective diagnostic test for TB to identify new cases and reduce the time-to-treatment and prevent its further transmission.The current available methods are primarily based on smear microscopy (acid-fast staining), culture, and nucleic acid amplification. Although methods based on acid-fast staining are sensitive, they pose problems in low-resource places and are time-consuming [REF]. The solid culture method requires around 4-8 weeks, while liquid-based culture methods also require around 10-14 days [REF]. Nucleic acid amplification techniques are based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Although hemi-nested PCR based on GeneXpert for MTB detection is rapid, sensitive, and specific, it also poses challenges of high cost and high end equipment dependency, which limits its implementation in low-resource regions [REF]. LAMP is an isothermal DNA amplification method that relies on four or six pairs of primers to amplify minute quantities of DNA within a shorter period with simple operation, making it more suitable for low-resource regions [REF]. Thus, research in TB diagnostics aims to find an efficient, reproducible, cost-effective tool with minimal infrastructure requirements. LAMP is a popularly adopted new age technology for rapid nucleic acid amplification which is widely used for pathogen (virus, bacteria, and malaria) detection including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) [REF]. LAMP-based detection methods have been proved to be more sensitive than GeneXpert assay. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed LAMP for TB as a replacement for smear microscopy for peripheral settings [REF].In pursuit of developing better diagnostics, which are crucial for achieving global elimination of TB, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to access the diagnostic accuracy of LAMP to detect mycobacteria. Even if couple of studies have depicted the efficacy of LAMP during the last decade, an updated version is missing. Moreover, most of these studies were specific to either pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB. Therefore, the present study not only offers an up-to-date diagnostic performance of LAMP for TB detection but also covers other Mycobacterium spp. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of LAMP were analyzed against different references. Further, diagnostic efficiency was determined based on reference methods, target genes, and detection methods of LAMP. Taken together, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic potency of LAMP as a tool for detection of mycobacteria to address the current TB diagnosis burden in low-resource places.",human
"Metformin (1, 1-dimethyl biguanide; MF) is a renowned drug with versatile utility. MF is an orally administered anti-hyperglycemic drug and is the preferred first-line drug for lowering blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)[REF]. MF, a second-generation biguanide, is extracted from the French lilac (Galega officinalis). In the Middle Ages, this plant extract was used to decrease blood sugar, relieve intense urination and alleviate symptoms of T2DM [REF]. In 1922, guanidine was discovered as an active ingredient in G. officinalis that lowers blood glucose levels.3 MF was overshadowed by phenformin and buformin—other guanide-derived drugs that were initially deemed more effective in treating T2DM. However, because of the high toxicity of the other medications, MF became the gold standard drug for managing high glucose levels in patients with diabetes, owing to its benign, nontoxic nature [REF]. The drug was approved for treating hyperglycemia in 1958 in the United Kingdom, in 1972 in Canada and in 1995 in the United States [REF]. MF is the most prescribed drug for T2DM management worldwide and is used by more than 120 million people [REF]. The molecular structure of MF is illustrated in Figure 1. As an orally administered drug, MF decreases glucose levels in the blood by inhibiting gluconeogenesis in the liver [REF]. This decrease is achieved by inhibition of intracellular binding of calcium in hepatocyte mitochondria, thus decreasing gluconeogenesis [REF]. Moreover, MF is the principal therapeutic drug for the treatment T2DM in obese patients [REF]. Beyond its antidiabetic effects, MF has antilipidemic, hepatoprotective, anti-neoplastic, cardioprotective and anti-obesity effects [REF]. It has various applications including the management of acne, hirsutism and polycystic ovarian syndrome, and as a chemo-preventive agent for neoplastic conditions [REF]. After oral administration, MF is gradually absorbed from the small intestine. The bioavailability of the drug has found to be approximately 50–60%, and the plasma half-life has been calculated to be 1.5–4 h [REF]. Approximately 30–50% of an orally consumed dose of MF is excreted in the urine within the first 24 h, whereas 30% is unchanged and excreted via the feces [REF]. Importantly, MF can pass through the placenta, and fetal concentrations of MF are often lower than maternal concentrations of MF. The pharmacokinetics of MF in pregnant women is influenced by the high glomerular filtration rate. The plasma concentrations of MF during pregnancy are therefore lower than those in non-pregnant women [REF]. MF exerts anti-obesity effects by decreasing appetite and increasing secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The anti-hyperglycemic effect of MF decreases intestinal carbohydrate absorption (decreased postprandial hyperglycemia). The inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis occurs by halting of the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation after activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [REF]. The promotion of glucose transport in skeletal muscle stimulated by insulin enhances the function of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT-4) and increases the non-oxidative glucose disposal in skeletal muscle [REF]. Additionally, MF exerts anti-lipidemic effects through increasing free fatty acid esterification and inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissue. Furthermore, the action of MF protects β-cells against toxicity and lipotoxicity of glucose and preserves β-cell secretory capacity, thereby slowing the progression to severe diabetes [REF]. During long term use of MF, the decrease in hepatic insulin resistance and beneficial effects on lipid levels have hepatoprotective effects [REF]. MF also has indirect and direct anti-neoplastic effects. It exerts an indirect effect via decreasing insulin resistance and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels. In contrast, MF exerts direct anti-neoplastic effects through AMPK-associated and AMPK-independent cellular pathways [REF]. The beneficial cardioprotective effects arise from the combined effects of a decrease in weight and an ameliorated lipid profile after long-term use of MF [REF]. Recent research has revealed that this drug also affects bone metabolism, influencing osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation via stimulating osteoprotegerin (OPG), and decreasing receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) expression [REF]. The mode of action of MF relevant to dentistry is shown in Figure 2. Note that metformin exerts its effects by (a) enhancing osteogenesis, (b) enhancing angiogenesis, (c) affecting the AMPK pathway and (d) acting in a concentration-dependent manner. (e) The clinical applications of metformin.",human
"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor in the United States, representing 14.3% of all tumors, 49.1% of malignant tumors, and 58.4% of gliomas [REF]. While the 5-year survival rate for all malignant brain tumors combined is 36%, the unique intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance that characterizes GBM translates to an even lower 5-year survival rate of 5.7% in a DCVax control population and 5% in TTF EF-14 trial, with a median survival of 14.7–16.5 months in DCVax and TTF trial control [REF]. The standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM includes maximal surgical resection followed by adjuvant combinatorial chemotherapy and radiation and subsequent temodar combined with temodar-tumor treating fields [REF]. Almost all patients (~90%) experience tumor recurrence and there is no established standard of care for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM) other than supportive and palliative care [REF]. Although repeating radiotherapy and chemotherapy or the use of anti-angiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab remain options for certain patients, the 2-year survival for rGBM remains at 26% [REF].There is significant focus on creating novel multimodal therapies to target the unique biological characteristics and immunosuppressive factors unique to GBM [REF]. Recently, clinical trials have shown moderate improvement in median overall survival of 20.9 months from 16.0 months within Tumor-Treating Fields plus temozolomide chemotherapy treatment (TTFields-temozolomide) compared to temozolomide alone, respectively [REF]. Targeted immune therapies, most notably: signaling pathway inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, and Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, have significantly improved the treatment of various hematologic malignancies, with over 50 approved therapies within the last decade [REF]. These immune therapies harness the patient’s own immune response to target specific tumor cells. Recent studies have focused on applying the success of immune therapies within GBM populations; a recent single patient case report demonstrated significant GBM tumor regression following IL13Rα2-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)–engineered T cells therapy administration, with subsequent host-immune response increases sustaining 7.5 months post-treatment [REF].Aside from CAR-T cells, a variety of other immune strategies have been employed in GBM. A multitude of immune checkpoint inhibitor trials have been attempted but have thus far failed to move the needle on survival [REF]. Single and multi-epitope peptide vaccines have in general not impacted survival, but the surviving long peptide vaccine (SurVaxM) has had an impact in recurrent GBM in early phase trials and is moving toward phase 3 trials in malignant glioma [REF]. Most recently, the strategy of personalized dendritic cell vaccine has completed a Phase 3 trial with modest improvements in survival vs. an external control group [REF]. Although these reports illustrates potential, the widespread success of immunotherapies within hematologic and solid malignancies has failed to translate to larger GBM trials, and to date no immunotherapies have been approved for glioblastoma [REF]. The lack of success in clinical trials to improve the SOC for glioblastoma underlines the importance of further understanding the intrinsic and adaptive factors of GBM that encapsulate the aggressive nature of this tumor.There are several reasons that the therapies applied in hematological malignancies have not translated to the same level of success in GBM. GBM’s many immunosuppressive properties can be divided into both intrinsic and adaptive factors. Intrinsic factors of GBM include multiple areas of immunosuppression through intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), qualitative and quantitative T-cell immune dysfunction [REF], tumor-mediated immune sequestering of T-cells within the bone marrow [REF], and the immune distinct microenvironment of the central nervous system [REF]. Adaptive factors of GBM include plasticity of Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs), selection of resistant intratumoral populations, effect of concurrent steroid treatments (Dexamethasone) on immunotherapy [REF] and adaptive genomic and epigenomic changes [REF] in recurrent glioblastoma that ultimately increase lethality. In this paper we discuss in detail the most recent advancements to the understanding of these intrinsic and adaptive factors of immunotherapy resistance within GBM. Additionally, we will discuss the latest engineered medicines, such as CD47, CSF1R, CD73, COX2, CCL2, IL6, and GITR inhibitors, and non-engineered medicines that possess the potential to overcome these clinical obstacles and improve prognosis for patients.",human
"Neck pain is one of the most frequently encountered disorders in clinical settings [REF] and is often difficult to diagnose and treat [REF]. Neck pain continues to increase in the general population and specific subgroups worldwide [REF]. Published data on the prevalence is variable, but it is estimated that 22–70% of the general population will experience pain at some point in life [REF].Patients with chronic mechanical neck pain (CMNP) are present with a wide range of symptoms ranging from mild pain and minimal functional limitation to complete disability [REF]. Therefore, it has great socio-economic and negative health impacts [REF].Among the identified risk factors for the development of CMNP are a long history of neck pain, worrisome attitude, poor quality of life, and less vitality. The same clinical practice guidelines and its updated revision identified female gender and prior history of neck pain as predisposing factors for the development of a new onset of neck pain. In addition, there is low to moderate evidence that high job demands, history of smoking, low social/work support, and history of low back pain are risk factors for the development of neck pain in general [REF].The international classification of functioning, disability, and health (ICF) endorses functional terminologies in describing health conditions. Therefore, the clinical practice guidelines linked to the ICF classify patients with neck pain into four categories: neck pain with mobility deficits, neck pain with headache, neck pain with movement coordination deficits, and neck pain with radiated upper extremity pain. Each category is presented with clinical findings specific to that category2,3.There is strong evidence that young individual patients with a duration of symptoms less than 12 weeks can be diagnosed with neck pain and mobility deficits when they are presented with symptoms isolated to the neck and have a limited cervical range of motion (ROM) [REF]. Moreover, the revised clinical practice guidelines of neck pain [REF] identified the patients with a presentation of the following symptoms as having neck pain with mobility deficits: central and/or unilateral neck pain, limitation in cervical ROM with reproduction of familiar symptoms, associated referred shoulder or upper extremity pain.College students can be a risk population for developing CMNP because of the long hours spent studying in front of computer screens [REF]. This can be also triggered by sustained posture and abnormal cervical spine mechanics with tenderness on palpation [REF]. Additional clinical examination findings of patients with neck pain and mobility deficits include limited cervical ROM, neck pain reproduced at the end of active and passive ROM, restricted cervical and thoracic segmental mobility, associated scapular/thoracic segments pain, and strength deficits in subacute or chronic neck pain [REF].Instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) has gained wide attention as a relatively new technique in the treatment of muscular tightness and pain. Originally described by Cyriax in 1982, this technique can be performed using different tools. The IASTM uses the same concept by applying an adapted pressure on the tight structures using different-shaped stainless-steel tools with beveled edges to conform to different anatomical structures. Although there is some empirical evidence for its use [REF], its effect has not yet been investigated in subjects with CMNP to the authors’ knowledge.Myofascial treatment is an emerging treatment in different musculoskeletal conditions although its clinical benefits is still not clearly understood [REF]. Myofascial release therapy (MRT) aims at restoring the normal length of a tight structure with the target goal of decreasing pain and improving function. Since patients with neck pain are usually presented with myofascial trigger points (MTrPs), MRT can be an effective treatment technique [REF].Since there is a research gap in understanding the effect of IASTM and myofascial MRT in college students with CMNP, the authors of this study were interested in building up evidence for their use. During Coronavirus time, college students were ordered to stay at home to stop spreading infection and as a mitigation strategy. Thus, they had to use the computer for long hours. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effect of the IASTM technique and MRT on college students studying using distance learning and having CMNP. Researchers hypothesized that there will be no statistically significant difference between the effect of IASTM and MRT on improving pain, function, and/or improving pressure pain threshold.",human
"Healthcare organizations are unique, in the sense that the services provided involve risks that can range from minor nuisances to life-threatening and/or fatal consequences for patients, which puts a lot of pressure on healthcare professionals, staff, administrators, boards and policymakers. The reality of day-to-day practices in healthcare was brought into sharp focus globally during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the fragility of healthcare systems globally revealing the considerable stress experienced by healthcare staff [REF]. Both past and more recent inquiries into the failings of care have highlighted the critical role of communication and information sharing, indicating that speaking up and voicing concerns is an integral part of safe clinical practice [REF]. The same inquiries, however, have shown that (a) staff’s voiced concerns are frequently not acted upon until a disaster point is reached, (b) professionals with high calling intensity (i.e., professions with psychological contracts that encourage presenteeism even when employees are ill) frequently remain silent on critical issues related to patient safety and/or unprofessional behavior, and (c) whistleblowing is still considered the most “successful” channel to address systemic and organizational problems that have remained unresolved for a long time. Silence in health care has been related to concealing personal errors and covering errors made by others [REF], as well as reduced patient safety [REF].Two influential definitions of employee voice are those of Morrison [REF] which describes “employee voice as informal and discretionary communication of ideas, suggestions, concerns, problems, or opinions about work-related issues, with the intent to bring about improvement or change” (p. 80) and that of LePine and Van Dyne [REF] with voice being a term for “speaking out and challenging the status quo with the intent of improving the situation” (p. 853). More recently, the research on employee voice has been enriched by the increased interest in behaviors of withholding information from colleagues or superiors in the workplace, known as “employee silence”. One of the most influential definitions of employee silence has been provided by Pinder and Harlos [REF]: “an employee’s intentional withholding of genuine expression about behavioral, cognitive, and/or affective assessments of organizational conditions to organizational members who seem capable of changing the situation”. Tangirala and Ramanujam [REF] define employee silence as “employees’ intentional withholding of critical work-related information from other members of their workgroup” (p. 41). However, it remains unclear what is included in the terms “employee voice” and “employee silence” in healthcare, as they can sometimes be discussed in terms of safety voice and safety silence (i.e., speaking about patient safety/patient advocacy or concealing information related to patient safety, respectively); how employee voice/silence fits within the theoretical literature on organizational culture and behavior in healthcare; and/or whether it extends to the professional culture and identity of healthcare staff. This is also related to the fact that although there is a general agreement that employee silence refers to withholding information and employee voice refers to sharing information in the workplace, any attempt to operationalize employee voice/silence reveals difficulties and challenges in identifying what should be considered voice/silence. This can in turn affect the way voice/silence are measured. For example, voice is defined as a discretionary behavior, in that individuals choose whether to engage in verbally expressing themselves or not at any particular moment with this being affected by a variety of factors [REF]. Similarly, the definitions of silence presented previously define silence as the “intentional withholding”. In healthcare though, the notion that voice/silence is a discretionary behavior can be easily misinterpreted, especially if we take into account the type of information that is often likely to be conveyed in healthcare: a concern related to patient safety and/or quality of care. Thus, the content and the context of speaking-up can differentiate the extent to which silence or voice are discretionary, as concealing a medical error for instance has ethical, moral and legal ramifications.Recent literature has suggested that, although on a lexical level employee silence and employee voice seem to be opposite terms, they might also be distinct concepts with different antecedents [REF]. Moreover, silence and voice can occur at the same time, meaning that employees might be speaking up in some situations (or regarding specific issues), but withholding their voices in other situations. For example, the definition by Pinder and Harlos [REF] specifies the withholding of “genuine expression”; this means that even in situations where employees engage in speaking, it cannot be ascertained that they are not engaging in any form of withholding voice (e.g., instead of speaking up about the unprofessional behavior of a colleague they may share a generally neutral comment on workplace behavior). This is particularly relevant to healthcare organizations, where a significant amount of the information shared (or withheld) is frequently related to patient safety and quality of care, which involves the interests not only of the healthcare professionals and the organization itself, but also those of the patients and their families—which has also been discussed as a conflict of interest [REF].The increasing empirical evidence regarding speaking-up in healthcare suggests that silence is the norm while voicing concerns is met with negative consequences for employees [REF]. For example, employee silence has been linked to employee well-being in the literature [REF]. In terms of understanding how silence/voice links with different outcomes for employees, we build upon the example of employee well-being, and more specifically burnout [REF]. The Job Demands-Control Model (JD-C) [REF], the Job Demands-Resources Model (JD-R) [REF] and the Conservation of Resources Model (COR) can help advance our understanding of employee voice behaviors in healthcare organizations [REF] and their links to employee outcomes. Both the JD-C and JD-R models view burnout through the lens of a mismatch between demands and resources; in this context employee silence could be evidence of the mismatch while employee voice could be evidence of a better fit. COR emphasizes the tendency of individuals and groups to always aim to obtaining, retaining, fostering, and protecting the resources they centrally value. One of the main principles of the COR theory suggests that when employees’ resources are (almost) depleted, individuals are more likely to enter a defensive mode to preserve the remaining resources or to seek for alternative survival/adaptation strategies if previous experiences were found to be maladaptive and consuming; these defensive modes can be sometimes aggressive and/or irrational. A common response, for example, might be defensive withdrawal, allowing the individuals to gain time to regroup, wait for help and allow the stressor to pass [REF]. Viewed through this lens, silence could be the result of an employee moving into a defensive mode in response to depleted resources.Greater understanding of how employee voice/silence among healthcare professionals is conceptualized and measured is proposed as a potentially effective way to identify what is considered employee voice/silence in healthcare. It has been argued that withholding concerns is the norm in healthcare [REF] and while healthcare organizations might share some common antecedents of voice behaviors with other industries (e.g., fear of retaliation or losing one’s job; not wanting to risk relationships with colleagues etc.), there are specific characteristics of healthcare education and professional culture that should be taken into account when examining voice among healthcare workers [REF]. Meta-analytic findings suggest that interventions to improve speaking up in healthcare achieve disappointing results [REF]. In order to better understand why this is happening, it is necessary to understand how employee silence and voice are operationalized in healthcare and whether there is a need for a new framework adapted for healthcare organizations specifically. By synthesizing and/or critiquing existing research on employee voice/silence among healthcare professionals, an Integrative Systematic Review can offer new insights and new ways of understanding the phenomenon [REF]. Therefore, the purpose of this integrative review was to explore the following questions;(1) How are employee voice and employee silence conceptualized and measured in healthcare?(2) What is the theoretical background to employee voice and silence in healthcare?",human
"Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with the highest incidence and mortality rates, making it the greatest threat to human health and life [REF]. Currently, the standard treatment for lung cancer is surgery along with postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy [REF]. However, most patients experience varying degrees of deterioration in quality of life after discharge from the hospital due to cardiopulmonary dysfunction, negative psychology, and adverse reactions from chemotherapy and radiotherapy, all of which harm their prognosis after surgery and may even shorten their survival period [REF]. In addition, chemotherapy may trigger hazardous effects in varying degrees [REF]. Patients suffer from long-term pain and are under tremendous psychological stress [REF]. They are physically and psychologically weary. Negative emotions such as anxiety and fear, in turn, affect their treatment efficacy and quality of life. To avoid being trapped in a treatment cycle, it is critical to strengthen nursing intervention during chemotherapy [REF]. Many studies have confirmed that lung cancer patients need additional assistance and care after being discharged from the hospital. Therefore, high-quality, efficient, continuing care should be given to patients to ensure and improve their quality of life after they return home.Surgical resection is currently the most effective and important method for treating early stage lung cancer. Surgical methods are classified as thoracoscopic surgery and thoracoscopic surgery, while thoracoscopic surgery is further classified as multi-hole thoracoscopic surgery and single-port thoracoscopic surgery [REF]. Thoracoscopic surgery has been reported to minimize complications, improve postoperative quality of life, reduce postoperative discomfort, improve lung functions, shorten hospital stay, and hasten the return of patients to normal life [REF]. In the past 20 years, the popularity of minimally invasive techniques, namely video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), has been continuously increasing and has been widely used in the treatment of cancer [REF]. Since the first video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy was performed in the early 1990s. Previous studies have shown that for early non-small cell lung cancer, video-assisted thoracoscopy has significant benefits over traditional thoracotomy lobectomy, including shorter hospital stay, improved recovery, reduced perioperative complications, and improved long-term survival for selected patients [REF]. Thoracoscopic surgery usually includes 3–4 incisions. With the development of thoracoscopy technology and equipment, thoracoscopic surgery has progressed from being multiple-incision to double-incision surgery, and, finally, to single-incision thoracoscopic surgery, which is also known as single-port thoracoscopic surgery. Table 1 depicts the various lung cancer treatment alternatives.The therapy approaches for lung cancer.In the 1990s, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) was proposed [REF]. This concept optimizes the clinical pathways through evidence-based medicine, reduces traumatic stress, shortens hospital stays, and promotes early organ function recovery [REF]. The concept of ERAS has been progressively expanded in recent years, as have the perioperative nursing measures [REF]. Long-term hunger or dehydration, for example, should be avoided before surgery; carbohydrate beverages should be consumed before surgery, and early feeding and mobilization should be advocated. Unfortunately, there have not been many studies on intraoperative nursing measures that promote rapid postoperative recovery. As a result, this article focuses on the latest advancements in intraoperative nursing related to rapid postoperative recovery, which can promote patients’ early recovery after surgery and reduce the incidence of complications.",human
"Palliative anticancer drug use is reported to prolong survival and relieve disease-related symptoms for some patients with incurable cancer [REF]. Conversely, other studies have reported a marginal impact of anticancer therapy on life expectancy and showed an unclear relationship between the use of this treatment and quality of life [REF]. Furthermore, the potential benefits of using anticancer drugs in terminally ill cancer patients are disputed because cancer therapy might threaten patients’ quality of life and even survival, and also imposes a significant cost on the healthcare system. Moreover, an increasing number of articles claim that near the end of life, anticancer treatment is associated with poorer quality of life [REF] and does not improve survival [REF]. In this review, the term “end of life” is used referring to final days, weeks, months in a person’s life in which it is medically obvious that death is imminent or a terminal moribund state cannot be prevented [REF].Anticancer drug use towards the end of life is highly prevalent worldwide and increasing in some countries [REF]. A single centre study in Korea reported that, the proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy in the last month of life was 25.7% in 2000, 32.7% in 2005, and continued to increase to 44.2% in 2010 [REF]. In the USA, between 1993 and 1996, the proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy within the 2 weeks before death rose from 13.8% to 18.5%, while recent studies reported stagnation in the USA [REF]. The trend and magnitude of end of life anticancer treatment frequency may be explained in part by the rapidly evolving treatment options in oncology, like immunotherapy and newer targeted treatments, which have broadened the therapeutic landscape. Recent reviews on resource utilization in end of life cancer patients show great diversity in settings, methods, and outcomes across publications [REF].These differences are more evident when defining the study population. While in retrospective population-based studies, which include all cancer patients in the analysis, regardless of previous treatments received or stage of cancer, they typically reported a lower frequency of end of life cancer treatment [REF]. Conversely, research studies that enrolled patients with advanced cancer or those who had undergone cancer treatment in the past reported substantially higher frequencies of end of life cancer treatment in the same period [REF].The goal of this article is to explore the methods and outcomes used by the studies, and along these differences, describe the current magnitude of anticancer treatment at end of life. These objectives lend themselves to a scoping review approach because they aim to identify knowledge gaps, clarify concepts, and scope the literature related to cancer treatment at end of life. Scoping reviews are particularly useful for mapping the existing literature in a specific field, allowing researchers to compare the methods and outcomes used by various studies [REF]. In this case, a scoping review can provide a comprehensive overview of the current magnitude of anticancer treatment at end of life, highlighting differences in methods and outcomes across studies. Furthermore, this scoping review can inform decision-making and set research agendas to identify areas that require further investigation and inform future systematic reviews or primary research on this topic [REF].",human
"In the past two decades, due to urbanization, economic growth and population aging, the world has experienced a rapid epidemiological transformation. Infectious diseases have been largely replaced by cardiovascular diseases as the leading cause of death, and dyslipidemia is the second largest risk factor related to cardiovascular disease, which is often ignored. Previous epidemiological studies have stated a positive correlation between abnormal lipid metabolism and increased risk of atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer’s disease and osteoporosis. Furthermore, excessive lipid accumulation is also associated with some other diseases, including diabetes [REF], non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/hepatitis, pituitary dysfunction, testosterone deficiency and hypothyroidism [REF]. At the same time, massive studies have also reported the role of lipid metabolism in regulating the biological process of tumors, especially on tumorigenic signal pathway, iron death and tumor microenvironment [REF].Alterations in energy metabolism is deemed to be a denote of cancer and an important target for cancer treatment. Uncontrolled and unlimited cell proliferation of cancer cells requires efficient energy sources, and in order to meet the needs of cancer cells, lipid metabolism is over-activated [REF]. Therefore, metabolic abnormalities, including abnormal lipid metabolism, occurred in the whole process of tumorigenesis and progression. Study on the mechanism of abnormal lipid metabolism in tumor can provide new ideas for tumor treatment.Lipid metabolism pathway plays an important role in many metabolic pathways. Lipids are defined as a diverse group of molecules insoluble in water, including triacylglycerides, phosphoglycerides, sterols and spatholipids. Among them, fatty acid is the principal component of triacylglycerol ester, which is mainly used for energy storage. Phosphoglycerides, along with sterols and sphingolipids, are the main structural components of biofilms. In addition, lipids can also play an important role as second messengers and hormones in signal transmission [REF]. Changes in lipid metabolism can alter the stability of biofilms and are associated with tumor aggressiveness. Many tumor cells exhibit a high rate of de novo lipid synthesis. In 1953, some scholars proposed that tumor tissues could synthesize lipids in a manner similar to embryonic tissues [REF]. Therefore, there is increasing evidence that cancer cells exhibit specific changes in different aspects of lipid metabolism and may be involved in the disease progression of tumors (Figure 1). This review mainly introduces the research of abnormal lipid metabolism and tumor and the potential role of drugs that related to lipid metabolism in tumor from three aspects: cholesterol, triglyceride and Sphingolipid.Abnormal lipid metabolism and tumor progression. In tumor cells, cholesterol metabolism is generally enhanced, thereby supporting the progression of cancer. This can be demonstrated from four aspects: a: enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis, b: increased exogenous cholesterol uptake by LDLR, c: increased cholesterol esterification by ACAT1, and d: increased production of hydroxysterols. In addition, the intrinsic driving factors of its carcinogenesis include: (1) activating carcinogenic genes such as MYC, which leads to the activation of mevalonate pathway genes, further increasing the expression of miR-33b, thus increasing the expression of MYC through positive feedback; (2) In the process of relying on target ABCA1, p53 mediated inhibition of the mevalonate pathway is absent; (3) SQLE activates Akt by inhibiting PTEN expression, leading to CE accumulation.",human
"Wilms tumour (WT), also known as nephroblastoma, is a malignant kidney tumour that accounts for 5% of all paediatric cancers and 95% of childhood malignant renal neoplasms [REF], with an incidence of 1 in 10,000 children [REF]. It is caused by aberrant kidney development at the embryonic stage, during mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) at the beginning of nephrogenesis [REF]. It typically affects children aged 0–4 years of age [REF], with a median diagnostic age between 3 and 4 years [REF], and an equal distribution between males and females.Whilst the majority of WT cases (90%–95%) are unilateral, 5–10% of cases affect both kidneys (synchronous bilateral or multifocal tumours) [REF]. Approximately 98–99% of WT cases are sporadic, whereas 1–2% are familial [REF]. Metastatic forms are observed in approximately 12% of cases [REF]; they are 80% pulmonary, 10% hepatic [REF], but lymph node or bone metastasis may be observed in rare cases [REF]. Up to 20% of WTs are discovered inadvertently during routine check-up visits as tumours can become large without manifesting any specific symptoms [REF]. However, WT is generally characterised by the development of a palpable hard abdominal mass or swelling that may be associated with abdominal pain, intra-tumoral bleeding, microscopic haematuria (in 25% of cases), hypertension (25%), fever (20%) and vomiting [REF]. Medical imaging, primarily ultrasound, helps establish the diagnosis, which may determine if the mass is intra- or extra-renal, solid or cystic. Three dimensional imaging (CT scan and/or MRI) are then performed, which are required for staging purposes and initial disease-monitoring [REF].WT is an undifferentiated mesodermal tumour comprising variable amounts of embryonic kidney elements (blastocyst, epithelium, and stroma). Based on prognosis, there are two distinct histopathological types - favourable (>90% of cases) and unfavourable (6–10%). Anaplastic and sarcomatous variants are unfavourable and associated with poor clinical outcomes [REF]. WT is treated following either the North American NWTS protocol or the European SIOP protocol [REF]. In Morocco and much of Europe, the SIOP protocol is implemented, with preoperative chemotherapy, then total nephrectomy with primary ligation of the vascular pedicle and lower resection of the ureter, followed by postoperative chemotherapy [REF]; usually with combination chemotherapy [REF]. Sometimes, chemotherapy is combined with post-operative radiation therapy, depending on the stage and histology of the tumour [REF]. Nevertheless, whilst maximising survival, these therapies can have adverse side effects, including short-term toxicity, particularly gastrointestinal and cardiac, and long-term toxicity, which manifests in the slowing of bone growth with a risk of scoliosis as well as an increased risk of secondary malignancies [REF].MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, highly conserved, non-protein-coding, single-stranded RNA molecules of approximately 20–22 nucleotides in length [REF]. They were first discovered and identified in 1993 to be post-transcriptional downregulators of protein-coding genes, by binding to the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), inhibiting protein translation (translation silencing) via deadenylation (poly-A tail degradation) [REF]. Circulating miRNAs are stable over time, even after repeated freeze-thaw cycles and are typically contained within membrane-bound particles termed exosomes/extracellular vesicles. A minority are bound to serum protein complexes (e.g., Argonaute, lipoproteins). Levels of miRNAs can change in body fluids when cellular damage or tissue injury occurs [REF].As miRNAs cause mRNA degradation, in cancer, miRNA effects are therefore ‘opposite’ depending on whether the protein-coding target gene is an oncogene or a tumour suppressor gene [REF]. Hence, up-regulation of oncomirs (miRNAs with an oncogenic effect) or down-regulation of suppressor-miRs (miRNAs with a tumour suppressor effect) may play a causal role in the generation or maintenance of tumours [REF]. Thus, expression profiles of miRNAs are used to classify cancerous and normal tissues and for disease-monitoring and response to therapy [REF]. The role of miRNAs is context-dependent. For example, a particular miRNA may act as an oncomir in one tissue/cancer and as a suppressor in another, based on the differing protein-coding transcriptomes, and thus mRNA targets, in different tissue types. Taking for example, miR-203 that acts as a tumour suppressor in pancreatic cancer by modulating DUSP5 expression [REF], in renal cancer by targeting FDF2 [REF], while it is an oncogene in breast cancer by targeting fibroblast growth factor 2 [REF] as well as in melanoma cancer by targeting BMI1 gene [REF]. Interestingly, miR-203 in ovarian cancer acts as a suppressor miR when targeting BIRC5 gene [REF], but as an oncogene by regulating PDHB gene [REF].Bioinformatic data indicates that a single miRNA can bind to more than 200 target genes of different functions. Thus, miRNAs potentially control the expression of at least one-third of human mRNAs, highlighting their potential role in most cellular processes. Several studies have shown that miRNAs act as key regulators of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell differentiation. Therefore, deregulation or inhibition of miRNA expression has been involved in many diseases [REF].Interest is currently focused on studying alterations in miRNA expression levels in various tissues at different stages of diverse diseases [REF]. For instance, miRNAs are implicated in numerous types of paediatric cancer, including childhood germ cell tumours [REF]. Hence, profiling miRNA expression levels in cancer can become a tool for diagnosis and prognosis or for identification of therapeutic targets [REF].MiRNAs have emerged as promising theranostic agents in the last decade, owing to their small size and ability to regulate multiple cellular pathways by targeting specific genes [REF]. This has spurred interest in developing miRNA-based therapeutics, which involves expressing or depleting specific miRNAs in diseased cells or organs using viral vectors, liposomes, antibodies or nanoparticles. However, delivering miRNAs to specific cells or tissues remains challenging [REF]. Furthermore, some studies suggest that miRNAs could be used in combination therapy, due to the ability of some mimetic or antimimetic miRNAs to modulate the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs [REF].Clinical trials investigating the role of miRNAs in cancer treatment have shown promising results, such as the study of Xie et al. that found that miR-621 enhances chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel plus carboplatin (PTX/CBP) by suppressing FBXO11-dependent inhibition of p53 [REF]. Another study by Hsu et al. demonstrated that the delivery of miR-122 to a MYC-driven mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma strongly inhibited tumorogenesis [REF]. However, to date, there have been no clinical trials investigating the use of miRNA delivery for tumour suppression in Wilms tumour, and most studies on miRNAs and WT have been limited to in vitro experiments.WT is primarily managed using two distinct approaches. In Europe, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is often initiated without tissue biopsy; although 90–95% of patients benefit from not needing to undergo biopsy to start treatment, up to 5% of children retrospectively will be observed to have received inappropriate treatment [REF]. In contrast, North American trials have identified pre-treatment prognostic biomarkers to stratify high-risk patients for intensified treatment, and upfront tumour resection or tissue biopsy is preferred. The identification of accurate blood-based biomarkers for WT, such as miRNAs, may help prevent misdiagnosis and mistreatment and may contribute to standardising treatment by providing valuable information on risk stratification. The main focus of research was to profile miRNAs in WT tissue. Among these miRNAs, miR-21, miR-140-5p, and miR-155-5p have been the most extensively studied. MiR-21 is consistently found to be overexpressed and is linked to poor prognosis of WT due to its correlation with down-regulation of PTEN expression [REF]. On the other hand, miR-140-5p and miR-155-5p, which are typically down-regulated in WT, have demonstrated potential in suppressing cellular proliferation and metastasis. MiR-140-5p targets TGFBRI and IGF1R genes [REF], while miR-155-5p targets CREB1 gene [REF]. Despite these findings, no circulating miRNA has been widely studied as a diagnostic biomarker for WT to date. This systematic review and meta-analysis compiles the list of WT-associated circulating miRNAs identified to date, discusses their correlation with tumour histological types, where available, and assesses their diagnostic performance for WT.",human
"Transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) is now commonly administered for postoperative pain control and reduced opioid consumption in patients undergoing major colorectal surgeries, such as colorectal cancer, diverticular disease, and inflammatory bowel disease resection. However, there remain several controversies about the effectiveness and safety of laparoscopic TAPB compared to ultrasound-guided TAPB. Therefore, the aim of this study is to integrate both direct and indirect comparisons to identify a more effective and safer TAPB approach.Recently, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has been recommended to treat colorectal diseases, such as colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and diverticular disease, because of its equivalent efficacy and improved functional recovery [REF]. Compared to traditional protocols, enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathways could significantly shorten the length of hospital stay (LOS) and reduce the healthcare costs without compromising surgical outcomes [REF]. Acute postoperative pain, however, remains the most common concern of ERAS. Meanwhile, regular administration of opioids is associated with postoperative ileus (POI), postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), delayed mobilization, acute urinary retention, and early-term somnolence and delirium [REF]. Despite the increasing popularity of the conception of opioid-sparing multimodal analgesia, consensus on optimal pain management after MIS is lacking.Transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) as a type of local anesthesia involves the injection of a local anesthetic between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles to infiltrate the segmental nerves at the level of T8-L1 [REF]. TAPB is now commonly employed during laparoscopic colorectal surgery and has proven to be effective in reducing postoperative opioid consumption [REF]. In the ERAS Society Guidelines for Perioperative Care in Elective Colorectal Surgery 2018, the use of TAPB is strongly recommended instead of epidural analgesia in colorectal MIS [REF]. Both laparoscopic (Lap-) and ultrasound-guided (US-) TAPB have allowed to reduce the risk of peritoneal penetration and facilitate the accurate identification of the tissue plane [REF].Currently, training in the use of ultrasonography among anesthesiologists is commonplace in tertiary referral centers [REF]. Characterized by ability to perform dynamic maneuvers and assess long segments of nerves, lack of radiation and contraindications, and portability, ultrasonography is recognized as one of the optimal imaging modalities for peripheral nerves [REF], which contributes to its widespread application in perioperative nerve blocks. Conversely, due to additional human, time, and economic costs, techniques of ultrasound-guided nerve blocks might not be available in the primary hospitals. Furthermore, despite the guidance of ultrasound, procedure-related inadvertent visceral injury still should not be ignored [REF]. Lap-TAPB can seemly be a potential alternative to reduce the waste of healthcare resource. Though visualization of laparoscopy minimizes intraperitoneal injection and visceral injury originated from peritoneal penetration, the precise positioning of the nerves and planes can be compromised by Lap-TAPB compared to US-TAPB [REF].The existing systematic reviews generally aimed to assess the differences between TAPB and no-TAPB locoregional analgesia or placebo control in colorectal surgery [REF]. Focusing on not all colorectal MIS but only laparoscopic colorectal surgery, a recently published meta-analysis cannot provide a convincing conclusion owing to the small sample size (3 studies, 219 patients) [REF]. Above all, there remain several controversies about the effectiveness and safety of Lap-TAPB compared with US-TAPB, and high-quality evidence is needed to guide individualized clinical practice [REF]. We hypothesize that surgeon-performed Lap-TAPB would be non-inferior to anesthesiologist-delivered US-TAPB. To verify this, we conduct the present meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness and safety of the two specific TAPB approaches for postoperative analgesia in colorectal MIS.",human
"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a systemic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia with high mortality and morbidity [REF]. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 10.5% of people aged 20 to 79 years old are currently suffering with DM and the incidence will rise to 11.3% by 2030 and to 12.2% by 2045 [REF]. Long-term hyperglycemia brings a higher risk of neurovascular injury, which leads to a series of complications such as cardiovascular disease, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy, in association with negative impacts on patients’ quality of life and heavy economic burdens [REF]. DM can be mainly classified into type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on the pathogenesis [REF]. Additionally, DM can be the secondary disease caused by Coxsackie-viral infection [REF], cystic fibrosis [REF] and pancreatic cancer [REF]. Although the etiologies of different types of DM are distinct, it is generally accepted that the progression of DM is highly associated with abnormal communications between cells, tissues and organs [REF]. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a group of heterogenous, multi-functional lipid bilayer membrane vesicles secreted by a wide spectrum of cells into extracellular space [REF]. The characteristics of EVs are highly heterogenous and influenced by the parental cell types [REF]. EVs contain various biologically active molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, where the bioactivity of their contents could be preserved by the membrane structure, making EVs as suitable carriers transmitting signals among cells [REF]. Over the last decade, EVs have garnered great interest for their critical roles in mediating intercellular and interorgan communications, which have been demonstrated to be involved in various physiological and pathological processes [REF]. Beside their intrinsic bioactive properties, EVs have also been confirmed with other advantages, such as abundant sources, low immunogenicity, biocompatibility, flexibility to modify, and ability to cross biological barriers [REF], making EVs-based therapies as attractive strategies in the treatment of various diseases [REF].The pancreatic islet discovered by Paul Langerhans in 1869 consist of its own vasculature and five types of hormone-producing cells known as α-cells, β-cells, δ-cells, pp-cells and rare ϵ-cells [REF]. The hormones produced by different endocrine cells play a crucial role in controlling blood glucose level, making pancreatic islet an important mini-organ to maintain glucose homeostasis [REF]. Among different cell types, insulin-secreting β-cells occupy a decisive position given that loss and failure of β-cells are highly associated with the emergence and deterioration of DM [REF]. Present researches indicate that EVs-mediated crosstalk between pancreatic islets and extra-islet tissues plays key roles in maintaining glucose homeostasis under physiological conditions, whereas such crosstalk is strongly involved in the occurrence and development of DM under pathological conditions [REF]. Under physiological conditions, pancreatic β-cells can lower blood glucose by secreting insulin to increase glucose uptake of peripheral tissues, while peripheral tissues may promote insulin secretion and growth of β-cells via EVs-mediated crosstalk [REF]. On the other hand, EVs containing autoantigens derived from pancreatic islets may target autoimmune cells, causing severe autoimmune response in T1DM. Furthermore, peripheral tissues-derived EVs impose negative impacts on pancreatic islets, leading to dysfunction and death of islet cells in T2DM [REF]. EVs-mediated crosstalk between pancreatic islets and other tissues can also lead to the secondary diabetes after other diseases [REF]. Notably, EVs have also been widely applied as biomarkers and therapeutic agents for DM. Lakhter et al. reported that up-regulated miR-21-5p cargo in β-cell derived EVs in response to inflammatory cytokines can serve as a potential biomarker of T1DM [REF]. Sun et al. showed that EVs secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used for the treatment of T2DM by promoting survival and insulin secretion of pancreatic β-cells [REF].This review aims to outline the current knowledge of EVs-mediated intercellular and interorgan crosstalk of pancreatic islet, focusing on its roles in regulating systemic metabolism, as well as its potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment of DM. We hope to provide a new and specific perspective for understanding certain physiological and pathological processes and give new thoughts to novel biomarkers discovery and anti-diabetic drug development.",human
"In recent years, significant resources have been invested in the research into treating retinovascular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and macular diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This effort has led to remarkably improved outcomes for patients suffering from these diseases. This experience has not been replicated for retinal artery occlusion (RAO). The reason for this is multifactorial and includes fewer RAO patients relative to the other retinovascular diseases and the fact that several central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) patients present for treatment after the theoretical time limit for retinal neuron survival [REF]. Unlike DR, RVO, and AMD, treatment for CRAO must be instituted within a specified time when neurons are still salvageable [REF].CRAO is an ocular variant of acute ischemic stroke (AIS); they share similar predispositions and pathogenetic mechanisms [REF]. CRAO eyes have been classified into four categories based on etiology, permanency of occlusion of the central retinal artery and preexisting collateral supply (cilioretinal artery). The four known types of CRAO are non-arteritic (NA) CRAO, NA-CRAO with cilioretinal artery sparing, transient NA-CRAO, and arteritic CRAO (occurring secondary to giant cell arteritis-GCA). Hayreh has shown that the natural history of these four types of CRAO defers significantly in terms of spontaneous improvements in vision and visual fields after an acute episode. Upto 82% of transient NA-CRAO and 67% of NA-CRAO with cilioretinal sparing will show spontaneous improvements in vision [REF]. The NA-CRAO variant is more commonly encountered in patients [REF]. The pathogenesis of NA-CRAO is thromboembolic. Emboli may occur at the narrowest portion of the central retinal artery (CRA), which is the point at which it penetrates the dura [REF], or thrombi may form within the region of the lamina cribrosa, usually posterior to it [REF]. Vascular occlusion in CRAO can be partial or complete. CRAO can also be permanent or transient, depending on the nature and mobility of the vessel occluding emboli [REF]. Patients who suffer transient CRAO are at increased risk of more permanent NA-CRAO and other ischemic diseases and should be evaluated carefully. In a more significant proportion of patients, when CRAO occurs, it can cause profound and irreversible loss of vision. The reported visual outcome of CRAO using the so-called conservative treatment in most cases is similar to or worse than natural history and unsatisfactory [REF]. Seventeen percent of CRAO patients regain functional vision. In 80% of patients, vision is counting fingers or worse, while in about 50% of patients, only a tiny peripheral island of vision remains [REF]. Neovascularization of the iris may occur in up to 18.2% of cases [REF]. Treatment principles for CRAO are similar to that for AIS and include 1. Acute reperfusion of the CRA, 2. Prevention of ocular complications, and 3. Vascular review to prevent further end-organ ischemia.There are guidelines by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Stroke Association (ASA) which guide the management of patients with acute stroke [REF]. Also, the Retinal and Ophthalmic Artery Occlusions Preferred Practice Pattern® of the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) gives detailed instruction on the holistic care of a patient who suffers a CRAO [REF]. In addition, local intra-arterial thrombolysis is used by several departments worldwide for the treatment of NA-CRAO. This practice continues despite the finding that intra-arterial thrombolysis was similar in efficacy to conservative therapy for treating NA-CRAO and resulted in a higher rate of adverse events, in the EAGLE study [REF]. However, significant criticisms and short comings have trailed the EAGLE study design, including that the average time from symptom onset to intra-arterial therapy was >12 hours in the treatment group. In addition, none of the patients received intra-arterial therapy within 4.5 hours of symptom onset [REF].This review explores neuroprotection as an additional strategy alongside already-known strategies for the care of NA-CRAO. The role of neuroprotection is often overlooked in ocular stroke. Instead, revascularization techniques are given the spotlight. This manuscript seeks to redirect our attention to neuroprotection which is an important element of ocular stroke management. The need for a different approach arises from the unfortunate fact that outcomes after CRAO over the past three decades have remained the same. `The lack of randomized controlled studies providing guidance or recommendations for treatment makes the situation worse. To fulfil the need for improved outcomes after NA-CRAO, it should be mentioned that there are two ongoing clinical trials investigating the use of intravenous alteplase. These are a Phase 2 trial (Early Reperfusion Therapy With Intravenous Alteplase for Recovery of VISION in Acute Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (REVISION),) [NCT04965038] [REF], and a Phase 3 trial (Multicenter Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of IV THrombolysis (Alteplase) in Patients With acutE Central retInal Artery Occlusion (THEIA)) [NCT03197194] [REF]. These two studies investigate the role of treatment < 4.5 hours after symptom onset in NA-CRAO patients. Similarly, there is a phase 3 study, TENecteplase in Central Retinal Artery Occlusion Study (TenCRAOS) [NCT04526951] [REF], investigating the role of intravenous Tenecteplase for CRAO. These studies hopefully will provide some information and fill the knowledge gap that currently exist on the use of intravenous thrombolysis for treating NA-CRAO. In several cases of CRAO, reperfusion of the retina does occur without significant improvement in vision [REF]. The lack of improvement in vision in CRAO is multifactorial, as elucidated by Jusufovic et al, and a significant contribution is due to the issue of retinal survival time (RST) [REF]. Real-world experience suggests that a substantial proportion of CRAO patients eventually seek care after exceeding the RST.",human
"Iron in essential for various intracellular activities, and stem cells would be no exception. For example, ribonucleotide reductase is an enzyme that facilitates DNA synthesis and repair, and iron is a cofactor for this enzyme. Also, iron is essential for mitochondrial respiration. It is used in the synthesis of haem and [Fe-S] clusters; specifically, cytochrome c that not only participates in the electron transport chain, but also has a role in apoptosis [REF]. Cytochrome P450 are a group of enzymes that utilise haem (iron) as a cofactor, and these enzymes play an important role in detoxification/metabolism of drugs [REF]. The enzyme catalase possesses haem groups (containing iron) and this enzyme is an important anti-oxidant as it converts hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, and thereby prevents/reduces cell damage by free radicals [REF]. Amongst specific examples of the involvement of iron at cellular level include the incorporation of iron within haemoglobin in maturing erythrocytes, and thereby aiding in oxygen transport throughout the body. Iron is also a part of myoglobin found in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue.In a pathological context, specifically pertaining to stem cells, iron has been found to maintain cancer stem cells [REF] and iron loading has been found to inhibit self-renewal of human pluripotent stem cells [REF]. Also, iron and iron-related proteins play a role in Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) biology. This includes the role of iron loading on cellular components, processes and signalling pathways of the MSCs [REF].MSCs are the most widely researched stem cell types because of their ability to support several physiological processes in the body and their exuberant reparative and regenerative properties. Located in various body tissues, these cells not only show multilineage differentiation but also secrete immune and trophic factors that stimulate endogenous repair mechanisms at the target site. Furthermore, MSCs show tropism towards tumour and inflammation/injury [REF]. Expectedly, these cells have shown promising results in several in-vitro, pre-clinical and clinical trials for a wide range of pathologies including COVID-19 [REF]Despite their therapeutic potential, MSCs are not frequently used in clinical settings for amelioration of pathological conditions. Amongst the many reasons for this are the challenges encountered in pre-transplantation MSC labelling and post-transplantation MSC detection via non-invasive methods like the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Nanoparticles including iron oxide nanoparticles have been used to enhance MSC detection, but their usage is confounded by various challenges [REF]. Evidently, these processes involve multistep and complex approaches that are yet to be perfected.Therefore, it is extremely important to search for effective and non-toxic approaches that not only preserve MSC functionality during extraction and in-vitro cultivation stages but also permit the detection of transplanted MSCs non-invasively and help retain and/or enhance their reparative and regenerative potential in-vivo.Iron-related genes and proteins have shown the potential to support many of these pre-requisites for a successful MSC therapy. Thus, this review compiles and critically evaluates the usage of the iron-related genes (genes of ferritin, transferrin receptor-1 and MagA) as reporter genes because their encoded proteins allow cellular iron accumulation that eases in-vivo MSC detection and tracking via MRI. The review also addresses the roles of deferoxamine (iron chelator) and the iron-related proteins haem oxygenase-1, lipocalin-2, lactoferrin, bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and hepcidin in preserving MSC characteristics in-vitro and in-vivo, and in enhancing MSC therapeutics.",human
"The term “pyroptosis” was first proposed in 2001 and consists of “pyro” and “ptosis”, which represent the features of inflammation (fire or fever) and programmed cell death (falling), respectively [REF]. Due to the discovery of diverse pyroptosis-executing proteins, pyroptosis has been redefined as a form of programmed necrosis mediated by gasdermin proteins with the characteristics of cell swelling, membrane rupture, and the release of cellular contents [REF]. Gasdermins belong to the pore-forming protein family and consist of six gasdermin proteins, including gasdermins A-E and DFNB59 [REF]. Among them, DFNB59 is not associated with the formation of membrane pores and pyroptosis [REF]. With the exception of DFNB59, the members of the gasdermin family have two domains: an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain linked by a flexible peptide. Upon activation, the cleaved N-terminal domain is responsible for inducing pyroptosis [REF]. This review focuses on GSDMD, the most extensively studied executive pyroptosis-executing protein with the clearest mechanism. More detailed discussions of other members of the gasdermin family can be found in other reviews [REF].GSDMD serves as a direct substrate of inflammatory caspases, including caspase-1/4/5 and murine caspase-11, and is cleaved into an active N-terminal domain (GSDMD-NT) upon canonical or noncanonical inflammasome activation induced by exogenous stimuli or endogenous injuries [REF]. Recent studies have demonstrated that caspase-8, which is responsible for apoptosis, is also involved in GSDMD activation [REF]. GSDMD-NT oligomerizes and forms membrane pores, leading to the release of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and IL-18, as well as non-selective ion fluxes [REF]. Massive membrane pore formation compromises membrane integrity, causing lytic cell death and the release of cytoplasmic contents that amplify inflammatory signals.While GSDMD-induced pyroptosis has been shown to protect the host against bacterial infection [REF], numerous studies have demonstrated that abnormal GSDMD activation causes severe inflammatory cascades such as disruption of ionic homeostasis, organelle dysfunction, cell lysis, and sustained release of inflammatory cytokines. Abnormal GSDMD activation can cause persistent inflammation, which has been implicated in various inflammatory diseases, including ischemic stroke [REF], familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) [REF], neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) [REF], experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) [REF], sepsis [REF], nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [REF], cancer [REF], human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [REF], neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [REF] and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [REF]. Moreover, cell pyroptosis has been shown to play an important role in a series of clinical symptoms caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Excessive inflammation and cytokine storm are the main causes of tissue damage and organ failure in COVID-19. GSDMD serves as a regulatory protein upstream of cytokine storm and is thus a promising target for the treatment of COVID-19 [REF]. Given the important role of GSDMD in pyroptosis and inflammatory disorders, we summarize the structure and activation mechanisms of GSDMD and focus on the discovery of GSDMD inhibitors in this review.",human
"Circadian rhythm, which runs for approximately 24 h, is present in all animate beings and acts as a regulatory mechanism that promotes optimal adaptation to various biological activities, including not only sleep and wakefulness but also various biological activities such as feeding, reproduction, and social activities [REF]. Normally, when circadian rhythms are synchronized with the light–dark cycle of the external world, melatonin is secreted as light exposure diminishes during the night and sleep is initiated during the downward phase of the core body temperature (CBT). Among the circadian rhythm markers, dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) and CBT rhythms show a phase relationship with the 24-h cycle. The relationship between the circadian rhythm markers (i.e., DLMO or CBT rhythm) and sleep timing (i.e., sleep onset or offset) is called the “phase angle” of circadian entrainment. Both Earth’s rotation and social activity rhythms run on the 24-h cycle, but the endogenous circadian rhythm in humans may be typically a little longer than 24 h. The length of the intrinsic circadian period is called “tau.” Although the length of tau varies from individual to individual, the mean period of tau is reported to be 24.15 h (standard deviation 0.2 h) [REF], with the length of tau of women being approximately 6 min shorter than that of men [REF]. Endogenous circadian rhythms are entrained to follow a 24-h cycle of the external world by various zeitgebers, which are the external factors that serve as cues for entrainment. Among these, light stimulation at a certain time of the day alters the firing rate of neurons in the brain’s suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN; the command center of the circadian clock), activates the molecular signaling pathway, and alters the transcription of clock genes that determine the phase of the circadian cycle by regulating the rhythm of endogenous melatonin secretion [REF]. The effect of circadian phase resetting through melatonin and photic stimulation in the SCN follows the phase-response curve (PRC). In the PRC, if light is applied before the minimal point of CBT (CBTmin) appears, the melatonin secretion phase is likely to be delayed, whereas if light is applied after CBTmin, the phase is likely to advance [REF]. In a normal lifestyle, evening light delays the circadian clock by delaying the sleep onset timing, whereas morning light advances the circadian clock. Light exposure is the most important entrainment factor, but other zeitgebers, such as exercise, mealtime, and social activities also contribute to circadian rhythm entrainment. However, the entrainment ability of these factors is weaker than that of light [REF].Many adolescents and young adults worldwide exhibit a delayed sleep pattern, which can be considered a disorder when it significantly affects important areas of an individual’s functioning. Delayed Sleep–Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD) [REF] is a circadian rhythm disorder in which the delay of sleep phase causes difficulty in falling asleep and waking up at a desired time, resulting in daytime dysfunction. This disorder is associated with multiple factors including specific biological traits, socio-psychological backgrounds, sleep hygiene problems, and comorbid psychiatric diseases. DSWPD is prevalent during adolescence and young adulthood. The establishment of treatment strategies against this disorder is therefore important because the incidence of DSWPD during these critical developmental stages can damage an individual’s future prospects. However, the pathological mechanism of DSWPD as well as many aspects such as the adequate classification, assessment, and treatment strategy of subgroups based on patients’ backgrounds, psychosocial characteristics, and physiological findings remain unclear. Furthermore, recent changes in the light environment surrounding adolescents have increased the likelihood of eveningness chronotype possibly leading to the development of DSWPD [REF]. A significant number of young people do not meet the diagnostic criteria of DSWPD but have delayed sleep phases (DSP) [REF]. Social jetlag (SJL) is a new concept that refers to the difference in sleep timing between weekdays and rest days has also been proposed as a concern regarding circadian rhythm related sleep hygiene in young people [REF].The development of DSWPD reflects the multifaceted interaction between social schedules, timing of exposure to light and dark, genetic factors, homeostatic pressure on sleep, and the circadian system. The extent to which a combination of any of these factors is impaired is difficult to identify in a clinical setting. Moreover, approximately 40% [REF] of patients with DSWPD have normal timing of melatonin secretion profile (the most important marker of circadian rhythm) even though their sleep–wake schedule is clearly delayed. This subgroup of DSWPD without circadian misalignment is termed circadian-entrained DSWPD and occurs based on the psychological and behavioral backgrounds in addition to biological factors in the young generation [REF]. Recent studies have also shown that DSWPD is frequently comorbid with some psychiatric disorders, particularly neurodevelopmental and mood disorders, both of which have a bidirectional association with the pathophysiology of DSWPD. In 2015, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) published revised guidelines for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders (CRSWDs), including DSWPD. However, additional treatment methods for circadian-entrained DSWPD and DSWPD complicated by psychiatric disorders should be established.In this review, we describe the physiological and psycho-behavioral backgrounds of circadian-entrained and non-entrained DSWPD in young people, as well as the relationship between psychiatric disorders and DSWPD. Furthermore, we discuss the current problems and future development of the treatment of this disorder based on the results of psychological and psychiatric assessments.",human
"Heart failure (HF) incidence is increasing globally, with almost half of all HF patients being women [REF]. The 2022 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics report by the American Heart Association reported a projected rise in HF prevalence by 46 % from 2012 to 2030, expecting to increase the total percentage of the population from 2.4 % in 2012 to 3 % in 2030 [REF]. HF causes significant morbidity and mortality among women [REF], and the incidence of HF tripled between ages 65–74 and 75–84 [REF]. In women, HF tends to occur at an older age and usually manifests as HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Furthermore, women are more likely to be more symptomatic than men [REF]. Although women are less prone than men to develop coronary artery disease (CAD) at premenopausal age, they reported worse quality of life and increased risk for depression [REF]. Guideline-directed medical therapy for HF does not differ in women; however, women are vastly underrepresented in HF trials [REF].Sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) are hypoglycemic agents which block the sodium-dependent glucose transporter-2 in the early proximal renal tubule of the kidneys. Their primary effect is increasing urinary glucose excretion and decreasing blood glucose levels. Additional effects of SGLT-2is, especially on the cardiovascular system, have been increasingly reported in the literature. In early 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration approved empagliflozin to treat HF. SGLT-2is use is currently one of the four pillars in managing patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [REF]. In patients with HF and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), empagliflozin showed a 21 % lower relative risk in the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF [REF]. In the recently published 2022 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America (AHA/ACC/HSFA) heart failure guideline, SGLT-2is received a class I recommendation for patients with HFrEF, including those at risk for HF (Stage A) [REF]. Similarly, the 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for acute and chronic HF highlighted the importance of SGLT-2is (class IA recommendation) in reducing HF hospitalization and mortality risk in patients with HFrEF [REF]. Possible mechanisms of cardiovascular benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors are changes in energy metabolism, reduction of blood pressure (BP) and vessel stiffness, increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit, improvement of myocardial remodeling, and weight loss [REF].Men and women may differ in myocardial adaptation after a cardiac event [REF]. HFpEF is more common in women than in men. Furthermore, women with HFpEF have more comorbidities than those with HFrEF, with >60 % having at least four comorbidities [REF]. White women with HFpEF had the highest proportion of hospitalization for HF [REF]. A meta-analysis by Singh et al. showed that the reduction in primary composite outcomes with SGLT-2is appears to be significantly less in women with diabetes than in men [REF]. However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated whether there are sex differences in cardiovascular (CV) outcomes among HF patients on SGLT-2is. We conducted a thorough systematic review and meta-analysis of all the CV outcomes studied with SGLT-2is in patients with HF with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) to study the primary composite outcomes based on the sex of the patients.This study aimed to determine the effect of SGLT-2is on primary composite outcomes among patients with HF, with or without type 2 DM, stratified by sex, through a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant randomized controlled trials.A comprehensive search and review of the PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases was conducted from 2017 to 2022. Results were limited to randomized clinical trials and clinical trials only. Relevant keywords such as “SGLT-2 inhibitors,” “heart failure,” “chronic heart failure,” and “acute heart failure” and their combinations were used in the search. All subsequent articles cited in these studies were also considered and reviewed.Only dedicated cardiovascular outcome trials conducted with SGLT-2is investigating the primary outcome of the composite of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent visit for heart failure, and published the results of subgroup analysis based on sex were included. Studies with either HFrEF or HFpEF participants were included. Other studies which did not have cardiovascular death and HF hospitalizations as the primary endpoint and did not have a randomized controlled trial design were excluded from the analysis. Studies that have met the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria were compiled. The study was done in line with the statements mentioned in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (11). A detailed PRISMA diagram for the process of inclusion and exclusion for selecting key studies that have been used in this meta-analysis has been depicted in Fig. 1.The full text and all supplementary appendices were obtained, screened, and reviewed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. The tool evaluates studies on seven domains, including random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias. Three authors (FBR, DDL, and VST) independently extracted data using a standardized data collection form. Differences in rating given by the reviewers were discussed by all authors and resolved with a consensus. Statistical analysis was completed using Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.4. Inverse variance weighted averages of logarithmic hazard ratio using random effects model were used to calculate for study weight. The pooled hazard ratio [HR], stratified by sex, and the 95 % confidence interval (CI) were based on intention-to-treat analysis. Odds Ratio [OR] was then computed between pooled HR to compare primary composite outcomes between sexes. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method and Cochrane Q statistics. Results were classified as low (<25 %), moderate (25 to 50 %), and high (>50 %) heterogeneity based on the 12. All reported two-sided p values are considered significant if <0.05.The primary outcome of interest was a composite of the following outcomes: cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent visit for heart failure.",human
"Many marine organisms are characterized by very large distribution ranges, a finding often attributed to the lack of physical barriers. Allen (2008) estimated that the average range of a teleost (bony) reef fish in the Indo–Pacific is 9 million km2, roughly the size of China, compared to 350,000 km2 for a typical freshwater fish range [REF]. The spatial scales of population structure and dispersal in marine ecosystems are also much larger than in terrestrial and freshwater environments [REF]. Long-distance colonisation and range expansion, both facilitated and constrained by oceanographic and geographic processes, have shaped the distribution and genetic architecture of marine fishes [REF].The patterns of genetic variation within species are linked to geographical processes that give rise to sub-divided populations, as indicated by quantifiable factors such as genetic connectivity and demography. The study of population connectivity is especially pertinent to management practices for commercial exploitation and conservation [REF]. Genetic diversity is also an important axis for species assessment in a conservation context, especially for wide-ranging marine species like sharks [REF].Sharks and rays play a crucial role in the sea by maintaining coastal and oceanic ecosystem structure and function. Large sharks function as top predators while smaller sharks are mesopredators and prey of larger sharks and other oceanic predators [REF]. Unlike teleosts, most elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and skates) show late sexual maturity, long gestation period, low fecundity, slow growth rate, high level of maternal investment and long-life spans [REF]. These extreme life histories result in elasmobranchs being among the slowest reproducing vertebrates in the ocean and make their populations extremely vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures such as overfishing, habitat modification, pollution and climate change [REF]. The primary cause of declining shark and ray populations is overfishing, as harvest rates exceed their capacity to replenish, and their life history traits render them vulnerable to rapid declines [REF]. More than half of this fishing mortality is due to bycatch [REF]. The expansion of the shark and ray fishing industry is an outcome of declining commercial fish populations (teleosts) and/or stringent restrictions on their capture [REF].Sharks are found in coastal, demersal, and pelagic habitats that are largely limited to continental shelves, although there are a few completely oceanic species like Carcharhinus longimanus (oceanic whitetip shark). Several species in the family Sphyrnidae (hammerheads), Carcharhinus falciformis (silky shark), Galeocerdo cuvier (tiger shark), and Carcharodon carcharias (white shark) migrate between coastal and oceanic waters [REF]. Rays are mostly marine except for a few species in the family Dasyatidae capable of living in low salinity habitats, and members of Potamotrygonidae completely adapted to a life cycle in freshwater [REF]. Like sharks, they occupy a variety of niches with pelagic rays capable of undertaking long migrations [REF]. However, population subdivisions may be more common in rays because of limited dispersal and greater susceptibility to geographical impediments [REF]. Sharks that inhabit coastal waters aggregate for mating and parturition at specific discrete locations which provide protection for juveniles [REF]. The extent of population subdivision and genetic divergence between populations in different geographic regions is directly influenced by such segregation and philopatry [REF] and the dispersal ability of individuals.For example, philopatry to natal sites in blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) is a major contributor to genetic structuring within the Indo-Pacific and between islands in French Polynesia, by reducing dispersal [REF]. Bull shark juveniles from nurseries in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic showed significant genetic variation in the mitochondrial control region (mtDNA-CR) but were homogenous with nuclear microsatellites indicating male biased dispersal [REF]. Similarly, population structure (using mtNADH sequences) among juvenile bull sharks from 13 nurseries located in rivers around Northern Australia also indicated a strong influence of female reproductive philopatry [REF]. These observed genetic differences support philopatry and indicate a strong role in shaping population separations in bull sharks [REF]. Site fidelity and long-term residency also resulted in fine-scale genetic structuring within reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) in New Caledonia [REF].Understanding elasmobranch biology and life history is therefore important for evolving species-specific management plans. Their governance poses a challenge as many species of sharks and rays migrate across national boundaries and international waters, and there is little knowledge/information about the migratory habits of transboundary species in international waters [REF]. Presently, conservation measures for sharks and rays are influenced by political boundaries, oceanic expanses, and centres of high demand [REF]. Conservation efforts are under-resourced due to lack of adequate funds, technical capacity and political will to efficiently monitor, control and manage elasmobranch fisheries/trade [REF].Hence, we examined patterns of phylogeography and population structure within and across multiple families of sharks (Carcharhinidae, Cetorhinidae, Hemiscyllium, Odontaspididae, Stegostomatidae, Alopiidae, Rhincodontidae, Sphyrnidae and Lamnidae) and rays (Dasyatidae, Mobulidae, Myliobatidae and Gymnuridae) in relation to their habitat and life history. We explored these patterns by (a) compiling data from a variety of published and unpublished sources, (b) constructing haplotype networks and examining network topology, (c) estimating nucleotide and haplotype diversity, and (d) assessing population genetic structure using AMOVA. In a few species, we report data from a single study, but for many species, our meta-analysis combines data from multiple sources, both published and unpublished, and provides insights from comparisons across genera, and between sharks and rays.",human
"The use of three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures has been growing due to their widespread application ranging from studying drug efficacy and toxicity to creating disease models (Zheng et al., 2016). By using a 3D-culture model, one can mimic the in vivo environment of human physiology more accurately than two-dimensional (2D) models, such as standard cell culture [REF]. Therefore, the quality of the conducted experiments improves. The progress of 3D devices and technologies has advanced to the development of microfluidic chips to capture organ-level function known as organ-on-a-chip (OOC) [REF]. The design of the OOC devices is made to mimic the human cellular microenvironment. It includes the flow of fluids through micro-channels to mimic the vasculature network for providing nutrients and transporting waste and metabolites. The OOC models could also simulate the physical environment of human organs (e.g., lung, gut, and kidney) by mimicking the structural features [REF]. This can eventually facilitate the translation of the in vitro findings to the human condition.The use of OOCs has the potential to make the drug discovery process fast and cheaper (with a cost reduction of up to 26%) [REF]. However, despite many advances, its applicability is hampered by the lack of online detection schemes, allowing the real-time observation of cellular behaviors [REF]. This shortage limits our understanding of cellular mechanism as a function of time and consequently unable us from correcting for the defects in the produced OOC models. The analytical techniques that have been used so far include optical imaging, electrochemical sensors, fluorescence- or label-free assays such as photonic crystal in a total internal reflection [REF], capillary electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry (MS) [REF].Among these techniques, MS offers high sensitivity and specificity to analyze changes in metabolites, proteins, and lipids [REF]. Utilizing MS for the in-situ monitoring of 3D cell systems in OOC can provide insight into the molecular composition of culture media, excreted metabolites, and waste products [REF]. Despite the multiple advantages of MS, it cannot be directly coupled with OOC for online and real-time analysis of molecules of interest (e.g., cytokines, proteins, chemokines) [REF]. This problem occurs mainly due to the presence of cell media in the chambers of OOC, which is rich in salts, nonvolatile buffers, and compounds that can hamper the MS analysis by creating ion suppression [REF]. Currently, offline sample preparation methods are used to normalise chip-to-chip variability or manipulate cell excretes before MS analysis [REF]. However, with these approaches, the time-resolved detection of metabolites is largely reduced, which is an essential factor for unravelling cellular mechanisms.Considering the numerous advantages offered by MS for biomedical applications, this paper focuses mainly on the investigated approaches for direct coupling of OOC with MS. The capabilities and weaknesses of each approach for real-time analysis are reviewed in detail.The review begins with an introduction to OOC and used analytical techniques to evaluate the mimetic tissue models. After a brief discussion on the techniques of phase contrast microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), the review is mainly focused on MS. To this end, MS introduction is followed by hyphenation techniques that bridge OOC with MS, namely, electrophoresis, solid phase extraction, liquid chromatography and droplet-based chips, and their limitations are discussed. This article provides an exhaustive review of relatively new developments that would potentially enable the development of a robust and reliable interface for analyzing OOC content with MS as a rapid, sensitive, and specific analytical technique.",human
"Diabetes is becoming an increasingly serious global public health issue. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) shows that patients with diabetes mellitus are on the rapid rise worldwide, and the number of patients with diabetes worldwide is expected to reach 783 million by 2045 [REF]. An epidemiological investigation exhibited that the estimated prevalence of diabetes in China in 2018 was 12.4%, and only 50.1% of treated diabetic patients were adequately controlled [REF]. People living with diabetes are at risk of developing several serious and life-threatening complications, leading to an increased need for medical care, reduced quality of life, and undue stress on families [REF]. Diabetes and its complications, if not well managed, can lead to frequent hospital admissions and premature death [REF]. Despite the emergence of new antidiabetic drugs, the glycemic control achieved is far from perfect, and some drugs may cause adverse events and increase cardiovascular disease as well as ineffectively improve the clinical symptoms [REF].Therefore, there is an urgent need for new drugs that are effective with minimal side effects and favorable hypoglycemic effects, as well as relieving clinical symptoms. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been applied in the treatment of diabetes for thousands of years. In recent years, TCM has made significant progress in modernization and globalization. Jinlida granule is a Chinese patent medicine composed of 17 Chinese herbs (Ginseng, rhizoma polygonati, rhizoma atractylodis lanceae, sophorae flavescentis, ophiopogon japonicus, rehmanniae, polygoni multiflori, dogwood, poria perrin, eupatorium, coptis chinensis, anemarrhena, epimedium, salvia, puerariae, semen litchi, and cortex lycii radices). It was approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) as a treatment drug for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in 2005 (National Drug Approval No. Z20050845) and has been widely used in clinical practice [REF]. In the previous work, our research team conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Jinlida in T2D with a sample size of 192 subjects who received the Jinlida or placebo for 12 weeks based on using metformin. Our results showed that glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was reduced more significantly in the Jinlida group [REF]. Furthermore, meta-analysis and systematic reviews of Jinlida granules showed significant reductions in fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-h postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), and HbA1c [REF]. Animal experiments show that Jinlida granules could promote the thermogenesis of brown and beige adipocytes by enhancing the mitochondrial function and inhibiting the expression of miR-27a, thereby improving the metabolism of glucose and lipids [REF]. Jinlida granules could also reduce insulin resistance in rats fed with high fat by regulating phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [REF]. However, as previously reported, current studies in Jinlida put more emphasis on the effect of blood glucose levels and their potential mechanisms and largely ignore the role of improving clinical symptoms in T2D.Though the efficacy and safety of Jinlida, as well as its potential action mechanisms, were elucidated, the role of improving clinical symptoms in Jinlida has yet to be studied. Hence, in this work, we conducted a secondary analysis based on the previous randomized controlled trial [REF] to investigate the role of the standard-reaching rate of blood glucose and improving clinical symptoms in Jinlida to bridge the gap between hypoglycemic agents and improvement in diabetic clinical symptoms.",human
"Migraine is the second leading cause of disability in the world after low back pain [REF]. It is a neurological condition with a global prevalence of 14.4%, with the peak prevalence and years of life lived with disability occurring between ages 35 and 39 years [REF]. The impact generated on the patient’s various social and family dimensions induces a decline in quality of life and a high economic cost due to work absenteeism, a decrease in work efficiency, and increased healthcare costs [REF].Pharmacological interventions are the most common approaches, typically consisting of the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans for acute management [REF]. Prophylactic drugs, such as topiramate or valproic acid, are recommended for chronic migraine [REF]. Other pharmacological approaches have been developed in recent years, including the human monoclonal antibody erenumab, botulinum toxin, ditans, and gepants, with good results in the reduction of the frequency of migraine and evolution of migraine attacks [REF]. However, the main problem with these interventions is their concomitant adverse effects, such as the increase in blood pressure with triptans use, the risk of allergic reaction with monoclonal antibodies, the transient development of blepharoptosis and muscle weakness produced by the injection of botulinum toxin, and interaction with other drugs [REF].In addition to pharmacological treatment, behavioral change interventions are fundamental in the clinical management of migraine. These treatments include management of stress, sleep, diet, and exercise [REF], of which aerobic exercise and yoga modalities are proposed as preventive alternatives for migraine [REF]. Exercise prescription for migraine improvement appears to be a safe and effective intervention that could decrease migraine symptoms and disability and increase quality of life. Aerobic exercise has been the most studied modality [REF].Migraine and exercise information disseminated on social networks has increased exponentially in recent years; however, the quality of that information is questionable [REF]. Several international scientific societies recommend the practice of exercise as part of the therapeutic approach to migraine. The French Headache Society includes physical exercise as part of the non-pharmacological treatment of migraine headaches [REF]; the Danish Headache Society agrees with a similar recommendation and also includes relaxation and postural exercises [REF]; and the American Headache Society recommends regular exercise as part of the biobehavioral treatment of migraine management and prevention [REF].The recommendations of the various headache societies for treatments involving exercise for migraine have one characteristic in common: exercise is mentioned in a very general way, and the various exercise modalities that can be used for migraine treatment are not mentioned in depth. Current scientific evidence has not yet determined the adequate exercise prescription parameters for patients with migraine. Also, there are still no clinical practice guidelines on exercise prescription for migraine. Therefore, we consider it necessary to develop a guide to help clinicians who treat headaches so they can make better recommendations or provide a more specific exercise prescription.The main objective of this clinical practice guideline is to provide a series of recommendations regarding different exercise modalities that could be effective in the treatment of migraine, and other lifestyle recommendations that could increase the efficacy of exercise interventions, for healthcare and exercise professionals, such as neurologists, physical therapists, and exercise physiologists, so as to better treat patients with migraine. For this proposal, we reviewed the current evidence that shows which exercise interventions improve migraine symptoms (intensity, frequency, and duration), disability, and quality of life. Moreover, the intention of this guideline is to provide parameters of exercise prescription for each exercise modality that could be adapted depending on the patient’s characteristics (e.g. migraine frequency, physical condition, and patient’s preferences). It is not a standard of medical care that determines the exercise intervention approach for migraine treatment. Patients’ clinical presentation, experiences, and expectations, as well as clinicians’ experiences and expertise should guide the exercise prescription based on the best recommendations of the current evidence.",human
"Microbiota are communities of microorganisms that co-exist with the host ecosystem in a specific environment. The term microbiome refers to the microbial genome. Current metagenomic sequencing has identified more than 10 million microbial genes in the human gut microbiome [REF]. The gut microbiome plays an important role in health and disease; indeed, it is sometimes referred to as an organ in its own right. Studies have suggested that the gut microbiome influences the interaction between the central and enteric nervous systems (the gut-brain axis) (reviewed by Carabotti et al. [REF]), with effects on health outcomes such as depression. Characteristics of an unhealthy gut microbiome (e.g., dysbiosis) have also been linked to several diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease [REF]. Recent studies suggest a role of the gut microbiome in modulating the functions of the immune system (reviewed by Shreiner et al. and Yamamoto and Jorgensen) [REF], indicating a possible effect on risk or severity of infection. For example, some components or metabolites of gut bacteria (e.g. polysaccharide A and short-chain fatty acids) promote anti-inflammatory responses [REF]. The composition of the gut microbiome is diverse, both within and between individuals, and it is challenging to characterize a healthy gut microbiome. However, it is generally accepted that gut microbial communities with greater diversity, richness, and stability, and a higher relative abundance of species associated with production of short-chain fatty acids are associated with better health outcomes [REF]. There has been increasing interest in the potential effect of vitamin D on the composition of the gut microbiome. The active form of vitamin D (calcitriol, 1,25(OH)2D) binds to macrophages and induces the production of antimicrobial peptides, resulting in bacterial killing [REF]. Rodent studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency or a lack of vitamin D receptor is associated with an increase in both Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla, which are generally considered less healthy (reviewed by Yamamoto and Jorgensen) [REF]. Vitamin D also helps maintain the physical and functional integrity of the gut mucosal barrier by reducing permeability of epithelial cells and modulating tight-junction proteins [REF], preventing invasion of pathogenic bacterial species.A systematic review of studies in humans found a link between vitamin D and the composition of the gut microbiome as measured by diversity and the abundance of different bacteria [REF]. Subsequent to this review, a non-randomized pre-post interventional study (n = 80) in healthy women found significant increases in gut microbial diversity and the abundance of health-promoting probiotic taxa, Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium, after 12 weeks of supplementation with 50,000 international units (IU) per week of vitamin D.9 We identified only three small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the gut microbiome [REF], two of which were published subsequent to the systematic review. All had a sample size ≤26 and intervention duration ≤16 weeks; one study was conducted in adults with cystic fibrosis [REF], one among overweight or obese adults [REF], and the third in healthy adults [REF]. These studies found some positive effects of vitamin D supplementation or of high versus low dose supplementation on some beneficial bacteria; however, effects on the diversity indices were mixed.In light of the paucity of data from RCTs, we aimed to investigate the effect on the gut microbiome of supplementing older adults with 60,000 IU of vitamin D per month for five y, using a subsample (n = 835) of participants recruited from the large population-based D-Health Trial.",human
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), also known as autism, is a kind of neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by communication deficits, social impairments, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors, and sensory-motor coordination defects [REF]. The latest diagnostic systems, the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, revised (DSM-5-TR) used the term ASD to summarize autism, Asperger syndrome, and several other diseases [REF]. The World Health Organization estimated that one in 160 children globally has ASD, with a male-to-female ratio of 4:1 [REF]. The number of reported ASD cases has increased approximately 20-fold over the past 30 years. Currently, the prevalence of ASD in the United States and China has exceeded 2%, of which the number of patients in China has exceeded 10 million, increasing at a rate of nearly 200, 000 cases every year [REF]. ASD is child-specific, and its symptoms mostly manifest in early childhood and persists throughout life, which has a serious negative impact on the patients’ daily life, family, and social development. Therefore, active prevention and treatment of ASD has always been an important work committed by medical workers all over the world.At present, the pathogenesis of ASD remains undefined, but some researchers believed that genetic, environmental, neurodevelopmental, and immune factors play an important role in its occurrence and development [REF]. There has been no effective treatment method for ASD due to the lack of sufficient evidence to clarify its mechanism [REF]. In modern medicine, several drugs have been used to treat ASD, but these drugs are only used to target specific symptoms or comorbidities rather than ASD [REF]. Although risperidone and aripiprazole can improve patients’ agitation and irritability, they are often accompanied by adverse effects such as weight gain, nausea, sedation, and hyperglycemia [REF]. In addition, methylphenidate, atomoxetine, and guanfacine have been used to improve attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, but can cause adverse effects such as sleep disruption, loss of appetite, nausea, irritability, fatigue, sedation, and hypotension [REF]. In addition to pharmacological therapy, behavioral and educational intervention (BEI) has also been used in the treatment of ASD, but most high-quality BEI need 20–40 h of treatment per week, and it takes a long time to show benefits [REF]. Therefore, both doctors and patients’ families are actively searching for an effective alternative or complementary therapy for ASD [REF].Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was first proposed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States. It refers to medical care practice outside of modern mainstream medicine. Complementary medicine refers to the diagnosis and treatment methods used simultaneously with alternative conventional medicine. Alternative medicine refers to the method of treating diseases instead of modern mainstream medicine [REF]. The regimens of CAM have been tried in 52–74% of ASD patients, and even some patients received at least seven CAM therapies [REF]. Currently, the CAM therapies for ASD can be divided into biologically based treatments and non-biologically based treatments [REF]. Biologically based treatments include dietary interventions, nutraceuticals, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and chelation. Although studies have found that eliminating gluten and casein in diet is beneficial to ASD patients, such trials are often difficult to be effectively controlled due to the lack of control group, poor diagnostic characteristics, small sample size, and non-standardized outcome measurement [REF]. Chelation has various adverse effects, especially the loss of essential elements in the body during the treatment process [REF]. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) has divided non-biologically based treatments into three groups: mind–body medicine (including yoga, music, and dance), manipulative and body-based practices (such as massage, chiropractic care, and acupuncture), and energy medicine (such as Reiki or homeopathy) [REF]. To date, all these therapies have been observed to be beneficial in treating ASD to some extent, but there is not enough evidence to confirm their clinical effectiveness [REF]. Acupuncture has been shown to be more promising in the treatment of ASD [REF].Acupuncture is a unique treatment method of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It consists of inserting the needle into the specific acupoints of the patient’s body at a certain angle, and then the acupoint is stimulated with twirling, lifting, and thrusting of the needle, so as to achieve the purpose of treating diseases [REF]. Acupuncturist usually take the subject’s feeling of “De-qi”(气, 针感) as the standard to judge the treatment response [REF]. In China, acupuncture has been practiced for thousands of years. Many ancient TCM books have recorded its efficacy in treating a variety of diseases, including neurological and mental diseases, such as stroke, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease [REF]. At present, acupuncture has spread to many countries and regions around the world, especially in the United States [REF]. It is reported that 22 states in the United States licensed acupuncturists through the Medical Board, and 48 states have statutes and regulations that determine licensure and medical professional training requirements [REF]. However, despite this development, acupuncture has not been recognized as the authoritative CAM recommendation for the treatment of mental diseases due to the lack of sufficient scientific evidence, which is why we carried out this review [REF].Unlike modern medicine, which only aims at the disease itself or symptoms, the principle of TCM treatment of diseases emphasizes the overall concept and syndrome differentiation [REF]. The advantage of this medical concept is that it can treat patients individually and reduce the probability of adverse events [REF]. In TCM, ASD has no corresponding term, but its symptoms are in line with the category of “Shen zhi” diseases (神志病; mental disorders), such as “Dian zheng” (癫证) (sluggishness, depression, irritability, and decreased appetite), “Wu chi zheng” (五迟证) (delays in standing, walking, hair, teeth, and speech development), and “Jie lu”(解颅) (delayed closure of fontanels, delayed bone development, which is similar to congenital or acquired hydrocephalus in modern medicine) [REF]. The pathogenesis of ASD in TCM is related to the congenital deficiency of the Zang-Fu (viscera) organs such as the heart, liver, spleen, and kidney, as well as their acquired mutual regulation imbalance [REF]. Therefore, TCM divides ASD into four syndrome types, namely, syndrome of exuberant fire of heart and liver (心肝火旺证), syndrome of heart spirit confused by phlegm (痰蒙心窍证), deficiency of heart and spleen syndrome (心脾两虚证), and deficient kidney essence syndrome (肾精不足证) [REF]. In terms of treatment, TCM restores the internal balance of the body by clearing the heart and calming the liver, clearing the heart and purging fire, refreshing the brain and opening the orifices, promoting Yang, and relieving heat [REF]. Correspondingly, according to the need of different syndromes, acupuncturists will select a group of acupoints in various parts of the human body, such as head (scalp acupuncture), ear (auricular acupuncture), tongue (tongue acupuncture), and trunk and limbs (body acupuncture) for a certain session of treatment [REF]. Compared with other CAM therapies of modern medicine, acupuncture has the advantages of low cost, lasting effect, and no serious side effects [REF]. With the development of medical technology, acupuncture has also derived a variety of therapies such as laser acupuncture (LA), electroacupuncture (EA), and transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS), which have been proved to be suitable for the treatment of a variety of human diseases [REF]. However, because the theory of TCM is complex and difficult to understand, there are differences in the mastery of knowledge among acupuncturists [REF]. In addition, the clinical application of acupuncture also lacks a universal international authoritative standard. Therefore, the analysis and discussion of previous studies will help to formulate unified standards and carry out relevant high-quality research in the future.Several articles have analyzed the clinical studies on acupuncture in the treatment of ASD in recent years, but most authors have not made an in-depth interpretation of the relevant TCM knowledge of ASD and the function of acupoints, especially the potential relationship between TCM and acupuncture and modern medicine [REF]. Therefore, we reviewed the clinical study reports on acupuncture in the treatment of ASD in past 15 years. The reports mainly included randomized, controlled, and double-blinded trial, pilot study, case report, prospective single-blinded controlled study, and retrospective study on manual acupuncture, EA, LA, and TEAS in the treatment of ASD. These reports are analyzed and discussed from the aspects of study subjects, group setting, intervention modalities, acupoints selection, outcome evaluation, and safety. Furthermore, we also discussed the relevant mechanisms of some acupoints selected in these reports by associating TCM with modern medicine in order to provide a more comprehensive reference for the development of acupuncture in the treatment of ASD.",human
"According to the released statistics in 2019, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third foremost pervasive malignancy in cancer patients. It is projected that CRC causes over 1.8 million newly diagnosed cases with an approximate annual death of 900,000 [REF]. Due to recent progress in cancer therapy, the survival rate for CRC patients has been dramatically improved. Despite these advances, the therapeutic outcome under progressive CRC conditions is suboptimal based on a five-year survival rate in 12% of CRC cases [REF]. Molecular investigations have indicated that the incidence and development of CRC is an intricate process with the involvement of exogenous and endogenous variables [REF]. For instance, recent investigations in molecular pathological epidemiology revealed a close association between dietary and lifestyle factors with the risk of CRC. It is suggested that smoking, alcohol drinking, processed meat, genetic predisposition, and some therapeutic agents such as aspirin can increase the chance of CRC in human [REF]. Hypermutation has been detected by large-scale sequencing in CRC samples, especially in association with substantial microsatellite instability (MSI) caused by hypermethylation and suppression of the MLH1 gene [REF]. Likewise, APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA, and KRAS are the candidate genes most often mutated [REF]. To date, numerous attempts have been done to recognize the molecular processes and signaling pathways implicated in CRC development and progression [REF].The mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a critical constituent of a signaling pathway that controls varied cell activities such as progression and proliferation, metabolism, motility, phenotype acquisition, and angiogenesis [REF]. mTOR is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinases family, which has a substantial impact on CRC [REF]. Regarding the central role of mTOR in CRC pathophysiology, future studies should focus on the elucidation of mTOR activity in CRC cases.Several studies have shown that several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have a role in the regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway [REF]. lncRNAs are transcripts that include more than 200 nucleotides and lack protein-coding capabilities [REF]. Some of the lncRNAs may be transcribed by RNA polymerase II with comparable features to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) [REF]. Transcribed or spliced RNAs from lncRNAs can alter the activity of several genes at multiple levels such as transcription, translation, and protein modification [REF]. Following the progression of CRC, oncogenic lncRNAs can stimulate tumor activity, while other lncRNAs with a role as tumor suppressors inhibit tumor activity [REF]. Data suggested that overexpression of certain lncRNAs is allied with poor prognosis and metastatic behavior in CRC patients [REF]. To this end, therapies targeting lncRNAs may be potential approaches in CRC patients [REF]. RNA sequencing data from the TCGA dataset have indicated that about 200 lncRNAs expressed differentially in CRC patients [REF]. In particular, mTOR is a potential target that is affected by lncRNAs in CRC cases. Whether and how lncRNAs influence mTOR has been the subject of the area. In this systematic review, mTOR-associated lncRNAs were highlighted using literature database potentials to find possible correlations between lncRNA expression and mTOR regulation in CRC cases.",human
"This Position Statement was prepared by the Nutrition Department of the Brazilian Association for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (ABESO), with the collaboration of dietitians from research and clinical fields with an emphasis on strategies for weight loss. The preparation of this document was based on results from the main randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses that tested different nutrition interventions for the treatment of obesity. In addition, we included the analysis and interpretation of studies with interventions that are not scientifically recognized and have a low evidence level, but that are of great popularity. We also addressed the topics of intestinal microbiota, inflammation and nutritional genomics in the context of obesity, as well as the processes involved in weight regain. Aspects related to eating behavior and nutritional strategies recommended for the adoption of adequate eating habits were also included in this Position Statement.Obesity is a chronic, progressive disease resulting from multifactorial causes mainly related to lifestyle (sedentary lifestyle, inadequate eating habits) and to other conditions such as genetic, hereditary, psychological, cultural, and ethnic factors [REF]. The treatment is complex, long-lasting, and involves lifestyle changes with an emphasis on nutritional therapy, physical activity practice, psychological interventions, and pharmacological or surgical treatment. Due to the chronic character of obesity, the diet recommended for it’s treatment must contribute to the individual’s global health. Even a modest reduction in body weight (5%) can already improve the metabolic profile and reduce cardiovascular risk [REF].Figure 1 shows examples of strategies for the long-term follow-up of patients with obesity, seeking global health.Fig. 1Strategies for successful long-term weight lossStrategies for successful long-term weight lossThe main diet-related cause associated with obesity observed in Brazil over the last decades was the increase in calorie intake, mostly associated with a gradual increase in the consumption of ultraprocessed foods. A cross-sectional study conducted in Brazil in 2008–2009, with 55.970 participants, showed that these products represent from 15.5% (lower quartile) to 39.4% (upper quartile) of the total dietary energy intake [REF]. The greater household availability of these foods was positively and independently associated with a higher prevalence of excess weight and obesity in all age groups [REF]. According to NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data from the past 2 decades, the estimated proportion of energy intake from ultraprocessed foods has increased among youths in the United States and has contributed significantly to their total energy intake (TEI) [REF]. Another important investigation conducted in several countries showed that ultraprocessed foods consumption ranged from 18% of TEI among preschool children in Colombia to 68% among adolescents in the United Kingdom. In almost all countries and age groups, the increase in ultraprocessed foods intake was a potential determinant of obesity in children and adolescents [REF].Low vegetable intake is known to be another relevant factor associated with obesity, as shown in a North American study conducted with 120,877 individuals followed during 4 years [REF]. In this investigation, there was an inverse association between weight gain and the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, and nuts [REF]. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 (GBD) [REF], even though there was no specific analysis of the diet-related causes associated with obesity, this important study demonstrated the relationship between low intake of fiber and vegetables (fruits, grains and vegetables) and increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.In this scenario, the recommendation of a balanced diet for the prevention and treatment of obesity and its comorbidities is crucial. In the last years, the term “diet” has been associated with food restriction and highly restrictive meal plans that prioritize the exclusion of specific nutrients or food groups. The probable link between the word “diet” and food restriction might be associated with the use of the term “diet foods” in low-fat foods and sugar-free beverages [REF], or even with the beginning of the use of artificial sweeteners in the mid-twentieth century [REF]. Therefore, there was a negative reaction from the general population toward the adoption of an adequate diet, even a non-restrictive diet. Even some health professionals have opted not to prescribe diets for their patients. In this context, it is worth clarifying the real meaning of the word “diet”, which comes from Greek and has a broad meaning [REF]. The Greek term projects its meaning as a synonym for quality of life, comprehending healthy eating from a qualitative and quantitative point of view, among other practices. According to the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), diet is one of the main determinants of an individual’s future health, especially for the prevention of cardiometabolic diseases and cancer [REF]. Thus, ABESO understands that the recovery of the real meaning of the word “diet” can contribute to the adherence to a healthy diet by the population and relieve something that seems difficult to follow.Fad diets cause a significantly negative impact on the treatment of obesity. These approaches are spread by bloggers and digital influencers, as well as by some health professionals. Among the approaches that promise rapid weight loss, there are several fad diets, methods and programs, such as probiotics, teas, thermogenic capsules, phytotherapy, supplements without scientific evidence, gluten-free or lactose-free products, coconut fat, among others. These products are ineffective and have potentially harmful effects on health, and are many times created with the only purpose of promoting the marketing of products with a clear conflict of interest biases. In this regard, ABESO has been giving frequent warnings to the population about approaches that promise a rapid solution for such a complex condition as obesity.Therefore, the elaboration of an individualized healthy meal plan, respecting individual cultural habits, lifestyle, preferences and possibilities, is essential for weight loss and maintenance, facilitating easier adherence to treatment. In this sense, highly restrictive diets are difficult to follow and are associated with increased short and long-term dropouts, potentially leading to weight regain [REF].The proposed treatment involves lifestyle changes, regular practice of physical activity and the adoption of a healthy dietary pattern that promotes an energy deficit to induce weight loss [REF]. Studies that compared different diets for weight loss showed that varied proportions of carbohydrates and fats had similar results in 12 months [REF], demonstrating that the impact of calorie restriction is superior to that of macronutrient composition [REF]. Nevertheless, the adoption of dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet [REF] and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet [REF], mainly constituted by fruits, vegetables, grains, eggs, low-fat dairy and lean meats, can bring additional benefits by reducing cardiometabolic risk. Figure 2 shows factors of a healthy eating pattern for patients with obesity.Fig. 2Healthy eating pattern for patients with obesityHealthy eating pattern for patients with obesityAn important point to consider is the fact that nutritional guidance in isolation might not be sufficient to promote eating behavior change, since obesity is a cognitive behavioral condition [REF]. Thus, the association of behavior therapy is essential for the development of abilities that will support the attainment of a healthy weight [REF].In this scenario, this Position Statement aims to discuss the main scientific evidence that may contribute to the clinical practice of health professionals regarding the nutritional treatment of obesity and reinforce the relevance of the adoption of an adequate diet that promotes energy deficit, that is sustainable in the long-term and that contributes to the individual’s global health. This document also emphasizes the importance of guiding dietitians on how to manage the nutritional treatment based on scientific evidence in addition to promoting eating behavior changes.Box 1 presents a summary of nutrition recommendations for the treatment of overweight and obesity.Box 1Summary of nutrition recommendations for the treatment of overweight and obesityDiet/StrategyStatementClass of recommendationLevel of evidenceDoes ABESO recommend?Energy densityConsumption of foods and beverages with low energy density associated with energy deficit from diet can be useful in the treatment of obesityIIbBYPortion controlPortion size control can help to reduce the excessive consumption of foods and beveragesIIbBYFoods Fruits and vegetablesEncouraging the intake of fresh fruits and vegetables, associated with a hypocaloric diet, contributes to weight managementIIaAY Fast-foodThe intake of fast-food meals high in sugars, sodium, and saturated and/or trans fat is not recommendedIIbCN Ultraprocessed foodThe consumption of ultraprocessed foods is associated with excessive calorie intake and weight gainIIIBN Sweetened beveragesSweetened beverages or even unsweetened fruit juices contribute to increased calorie intake and body weight, and should be discouraged for the prevention and treatment of obesityIANCalorie-based interventions Low-calorie dietsLow-calorie diets are fundamental for obesity treatment and the management of the meal plan must be associated with lifestyle changesIAY Very low-calorie dietsVLCDs should not be the first option for obesity treatmentIIaASpecific situations Meal replacementsMeal Replacements can help to structure a LCD and increase diet adherenceIIaAY*Based on dietary patterns MediterraneanThe Mediterranean diet has cardiovascular benefits to the individual with obesityIAY Plant-based and vegetarianVegetarian or plant-based diets with reduced intake of ultraprocessed foods can be an option for the prevention and treatment of obesityIIaAY*Based on macronutrients Low-carbLow-carb diets promote weight loss in short and medium duration (3 to 6 months)IIaANLow-carb diets do not promote more weight loss compared to other diet types in long-term studiesIIaA KetogenicThe ketogenic diet should not be recommended for the treatment of obesity as it does not promote a balanced diet or favor adherence to healthy eating habitsIIIAN Low-GIGlycemic Index as a measure of carbohydrate quality appears to be a minor determinant for body weight, weight loss and obesity preventionIIbBNBased on Meal frequency and timingIntermittent calorie restriction presents similar weight loss results as meal plans with continuous calorie restrictionIIbANWeight loss is induced by the energy deficit, and not by the fasting period per se or the number of daily mealsIIbALate consumption of most of the daily calories can negatively impact body weightIIbB Breakfast consumptionThere is no conclusive evidence if breakfast plays a causal role both for weight gain and weight lossIIbAYSweetenersThere is inconclusive evidence about the effect on weight loss of sweeteners when used alone, without healthy food choices accompanied by an energy deficitIIbBN*Supplements PhytotherapicsThere is no recommendation to use phytotherapics for weight lossIIIBN CaffeineThe use of caffeine supplements should not be considered as a strategy for weight loss and obesity treatmentIIIBN Whey protein supplementsThe prescription of whey protein is not indicated as a therapy for weight lossIIIAN Coconut fatThere is no scientific evidence to support the indication of coconut oil as a weight loss strategyIIIBN ProbioticsThere is not enough scientific evidence for the use of probiotic supplementation for weight managementIIIANThere is not enough scientific evidence for performing gut microbiota tests in clinical practice for the treatment of obesityIIIANEating behavior Cognitive behavioral therapyCognitive-Bevahioral Therapy should be used for weight management in patients with overweight and obesityIAY Motivational interviewingMotivational Interviewing can be considered and used for weight management in patients with overweight and obesityIIaAY Mindful eatingThe results related to Mindfulness-Based Interventions in the treatment of obesity are still divergent, and it is yet not possible to guarantee that this is an appropriate approach for all patientsIIaAY*Y Yes, N No*The strategy might be used as part of the hypocaloric diet; the individual’s profile must be always assessedSummary of nutrition recommendations for the treatment of overweight and obesityY Yes, N No*The strategy might be used as part of the hypocaloric diet; the individual’s profile must be always assessed",human
"In 2017, the African Union committed to “Harnessing the Demographic Dividend Through Investments in Youth”, prompting leaders across the continent to develop multisectoral policy roadmaps and action plans for attaining the demographic dividend [REF]. The demographic dividend presents countries with the opportunity to accelerate economic growth and maximize per capita gains [REF]. These benefits come to fruition because of a demographic transition initiated by declines in national fertility and infant and child mortality rates. These changes work in tandem to modify the population age structure, limiting the number of child dependents and increasing the number of working age adults, resulting in a lowered dependency ratio and a larger labor force [REF]. With a larger workforce, countries have the potential to boost their economic output and work to impart social and economic change.However, the demographic transition and subsequent dividends in economic growth are not automatic. Indeed the extent to which countries benefit from this demographic transition is highly dependent on the existence of policies that establish optimal conditions for capturing the full returns of the demographic dividend [REF]. Moreover, countries have a limited window of opportunity to act on maximizing the potential of the demographic dividend. Reher [REF] estimated the window of opportunity was open for 100 years for Spain and Sweden and only 10 to 30 years for a subset of developing countries. Eventually, the demographic age structure will shift again when the increased adult population ages and enters an older, less-productive cohort that relies on their savings and retirement funds [REF]. In conjunction with smaller birth cohorts due to fertility declines, the dependency ratio will subsequently rise again, but will be characterized by the need to care for elderly populations. Evidence suggests that ensuring demographic dividend-favorable policies are in place, preferably before entering the demographic transition, can assist countries to fully harness the benefits of the demographic transition. However, most of this evidence comes from Southeast Asian and European countries with limited knowledge from African countries [REF].Bloom and colleagues have previously described that investments in health, education, and the labor-market are key to capitalizing on the demographic transition [REF]. More specifically, key policy areas should: expand family planning and reproductive health to facilitate rapid fertility declines; improve maternal and child health and nutrition to reduce child mortality; increase educational attainment to facilitate a strong labor force and productivity; and invest in the labor and economic sectors to promote job creation and economic growth [REF]. Less well-documented are the specific policy investments and strategies that countries should enact to create a demographic dividend-favorable environment.The Population Reference Bureau (PRB) recently conducted a literature review to identify specific policy inputs conducive to achieving the demographic dividend [REF]. This review provided evidence that policy interventions like legalizing contraception, establishing family planning service delivery and outreach, investing in disease prevention and public health, offering free public education, reinvesting gross domestic product (GDP) growth in working-age populations, developing open trade policies, and encouraging foreign direct investment, among others, can facilitate attainment of the demographic dividend. Similarly, the World Bank reviewed policy documents for policies that would catalyze and accelerate a demographic transition among eight West African countries [REF]. Their review documented achievements and opportunities for improvement in allocating financial resources, stakeholder support, institutional building and strengthening, and results monitoring to fast-track the demographic dividend.Although knowledge of evidence-based policies to realize the demographic dividend exists, the extent to which they are incorporated into national planning is not well understood. Discerning the degree to which these policies are embedded within policy frameworks requires a comprehensive review of the national policy landscape. This intensive process can be accomplished through an exhaustive review of national strategic frameworks and sector-specific policy documents. However, the scope and relevance of these policies may vary depending on which phase of the demographic transition a country is experiencing. For instance, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa are in the pre-demographic dividend phase, with total fertility rate (TFR) greater than four children per woman, or the early-demographic dividend phase, whereby TFR is below four children [REF].Evidence suggests that pre-dividend countries should prioritize human development outcomes, with a goal towards accelerating the fertility decline, creating a population age structure with fewer dependents, and assisting a growing proportion of the population that is working age to develop the necessary skills to enter the labor market in the future. Conversely, early-dividend countries should prioritize accelerating job creation to ensure that the growing share of the working-age population remains employed to promote economic growth. The labor market must develop productive jobs to appropriately match labor supply with a growing labor demand. Regardless of demographic transition stage, countries adopt a multisectoral and integrated approach to ensure that the right supportive policies are in place to catalyze the demographic transition and translate it into concrete economic growth.While studies have suggested specific policy enactments for countries to capitalize on changing demographic structures, these suggestions were mostly generated from the experiences in Southeast Asian and European countries. Furthermore, there are no demographic dividend-favorable policies specific to stages of the demographic transition in African countries in the existing literature. Using the Demographic Dividend Framework, developed by the Gates Institute, we aimed to review the policy landscape of two pre-dividend African nations as case studies, and to identify existing evidence-based policies conducive to fostering a demographic dividend-favorable environment in the pre-dividend context of each country. We also assess existing national policies based on their degree of comprehensiveness and identify gaps. We subsequently make recommendations regarding policy amendments that both African nations could undertake to capitalize on their changing demographic structures to attain a demographic dividend, and boost their economies.",human
"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating, inflammatory disorder, which impacts mainly preterm infants and remains one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies in the preterm infant population [REF]. In the United States alone, it is estimated that up to 9% of infants weighing less than 1,500 g at birth will develop NEC [REF]. The mortality rate from NEC is significant and has been reported up to 30%–50% depending on disease severity [REF]. Treatment strategies have remained limited, non-targeted, and have not changed significantly in decades [REF]. Although NEC was formally described in 1965 by Mizrahi et al., the specific causes have yet to be fully elucidated [REF]. To help clinicians with NEC diagnosis, Bell et al. published the first clinical staging system for NEC in 1978 that was designed to help clinicians know when to surgically intervene [REF]. Eight years later, Walsh and Kliegman published a modified version of Bell's staging system [REF]. The Bell and Modified Bell staging systems have consistently been the most widely used clinical definitions and are considered the “gold standard” in the field. However, most researchers and clinicians now focus on Bell ≥2 and believe that Bell stage 1 or Modified Bell stage 1A and 1B are considered largely non-specific [REF]. This has led to the development of six newer definitions for NEC, which all propose to be superior at NEC diagnosis than the Bell and Modified Bell staging definitions [REF].While many discoveries are being made within the NEC field, which may help prevent or treat NEC in the future, there remain fundamental limitations that clinicians and scientists in the field face. First, there is no universal definition of NEC. As discussed in the last paragraph, there now exist multiple definitions of NEC and clinicians and scientists can choose the one that suits their purposes best. This can lead to differences in what clinicians diagnose as NEC at various institutions. An added challenge is that the etiology of NEC has yet to be fully understood. Many in the field believe that NEC is a multifaceted disease and is the common end point of several pathways and pathologies. This multifaceted nature of NEC has made biomarker discovery difficult. Despite the NEC field spending ample time, resources, and research focus attempting to discover better biomarkers to aid in better prevention and mitigation strategies, all biomarkers discovered thus far have been insufficient [REF]. Therefore, NEC as a disease has the potential to benefit greatly from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) [REF]. So far, AI has shown promise in identification and prediction of diseases, biomarker discovery, disease risk evaluation, and development of improved treatment plans for many diseases both for adults and neonates [REF]. While AI and ML studies applied to the healthcare setting have rapidly increased in recent years, most instances have been applied to common and more well-defined diseases such as sepsis or cancer and only a few published studies have applied AI and ML to NEC. This review will summarize basic concepts of AI and ML (Section 2), present and summarize the current published literature on AI and ML in NEC (Section 3), as well as describe some of the limitations and pitfalls of AI and ML (Section 4).",human
"Esophageal cancer (EC) is a malignant tumor originating from the esophageal mucosal epithelium and is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive tract. The incidence rate and incidence patterns of esophageal cancer vary significantly among different countries and regions. East Asia has the highest incidence rate, which can reach twice that of the world average level (12.2/100,000) [REF]. The pathological type is mainly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which accounts for more than 90% of cases in China [REF]. In relatively low-incidence areas, such as Europe and the United States, the pathological type is mainly adenocarcinoma [REF]. It was estimated that in 2020 there would be 604,000 new cases of esophageal cancer worldwide (accounting for 3.1% of all cancers), along with its incidence rate ranking tenth among all malignant tumors (the standardized incidence rate is 9.3/100,000 for males and 3.6/100,000 for females), and 544,000 deaths (accounting for 5.5%), and the mortality rate would rank sixth among malignant tumors (the standardized mortality rate is 8.3/100,000 for males and 3.2/100,000 for females) [REF]. China is an important country for esophageal cancer and according to the latest cancer report released by the National Cancer Center in 2019, 246,000 new cases of esophageal cancer and 188,000 deaths were recorded in China in 2015 [REF]. The incidence rate and mortality rate ranked sixth and fourth, respectively, among all malignant tumors, accounting for 53.7% and 55.7% of the global total, respectively [REF]. A total of 70% of patients with esophageal cancer had lost the opportunity for surgery due late detection and a high tumor burden [REF].Most early ESCC and precancerous lesions can be treated using minimally invasive methods of treatment performed under an endoscope, with a 5-year survival rate of patients being as high as 90% [REF]. Patients with advanced ESCC have a low quality of life and a poor prognosis, and the overall 5-year survival rate is less than 20% [REF]. At present, the early diagnosis rate of esophageal cancer is still low [REF]. Most patients are diagnosed after developing progressive dysphagia or metastatic symptoms, and the tumor is often in the middle or late stages by this time. The most effective method of reducing the disease burden in areas with a high incidence of esophageal cancer is to prevent the disease from developing into invasive cancer. Due to the lack of typical clinical symptoms during early esophageal cancer, the key to improving the early diagnostic rate of ESCC is to screen high-risk populations. However, because of the uneven professional level of endoscopists, there are still many missed cases due to failure to recognize lesions. Endoscopic screening program in high-risk areas of ESCC also leads to an increased workload of endoscopists. Studies have showed computer-aided endoscopic monitoring can help detect and classify suspicious lesions, thereby improving the detection rate of ESCC [REF]. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted endoscopic diagnosis has shown promising prospects to solve the problems of the sharp increase in the workload and low inspection efficiency [REF]. In this review, we summarize the current status of utilizing AI for endoscopic detecting of early ESCC.",human
"Stem cells have self-renewal and multidirectional differentiation potential. According to the different developmental stages, they are divided into embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and adult stem cells (ASCs) [REF]. Stem cell therapy has prominent application prospects. For example, allogenic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation can rebuild the patients’ hematopoietic and immune system, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can reduce transplantation rejection and severe COVID-19-induced lung injury [REF]. Under the accumulation of gene mutations, cell fusion, chromosomal mutations, etc., mechanisms regulating the self-renewal and differentiation potential of the stem cells are compromised on, which then drive tumor growth from the malignant transformation of stem cells. Numerous studies have shown that the pluripotency, differentiation ability and cell reprogramming of stem cells are regulated by various transcription factors, such as Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Klf4 and c-Myc [REF]. However, recent studies have found that posttranscriptional modifications are critical for regulating different cellular processes and stem cell fate [REF]. Posttranscriptional modifications have been increasingly demonstrated to be important for both RNA biosynthesis and degradation, including N6-methyladenosine (m6A), N1-methyladenosine (m1A), inosine (I), pseudouridine (Ψ), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), N6,2’-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), and 7-methylguanosine (m7G) [REF]. The modification of mRNA widely affects key biological processes, such as its folding [REF], translation [REF] and transport [REF]. In recent years, A-to-I editing, which is the most common type of RNA editing in animals, has gradually attracted attention. It is widely involved in a variety of gene regulatory mechanisms at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, including alteration of sequences coding for amino acids at the transcriptome level and mRNA splicing, mRNA stability and circular RNA formation. Its dysregulation drives aberrant transcription and translation programs that promote cancer occurrence and progression [REF].As an enzyme acting on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the ADAR protein family was discovered in 1987 [REF]. The ADAR family has three different members: ADAR1, ADAR2 and ADAR3. ADAR1 and ADAR2 have enzymatic activities that explain the existence of RNA editing in different tissues [REF], while ADAR3 is only present in brain tissue and has no enzymatic activity, which may compete for dsRNA substrates and thus act as an RNA editing inhibitor in the brain [REF]. ADAR1, a specific adenosine deaminase, binds to dsRNA and converts adenosine (A) to inosine (I) after RNA transcription, which is known as A-to-I editing [REF]. It contains three isoforms, p150, p110 and p80 [REF]. P150 has been reported to be involved in the regulation of type I interferon signaling [REF]. The IFN-inducible p150 heterodimer of ADAR1 contains a Zα structural domain that recognizes RNA with an alternative left-handed double helix structure, termed Z-RNA. Heterozygous ADAR1 mutations in the Zα structural domain cause type I IFN-mediated disorders in humans and mice. Mutations in the ADAR1 gene are associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) and Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH), where AGS manifests mainly as neurological lesions associated with chronic activation of type I interferon (IFN) [REF]. Analysis of ADAR1 mutations in AGS patients showed 11 mutations, with 8 amino acid substitutions located in the catalytic domain with a significant increase in the production of interferon-α [REF]. Like AGS, DSH is characterized by exceeding 130 ADAR1 mutations. Both DSH and AGS share a common mutation, Gly1007Arg. This is also the only missense mutation that completely eliminates the editing activity of ADAR1 [REF]. Moreover, ADAR1 blocks endogenous Z-RNA-dependent activation of Z-DNA binding protein 1(ZBP1) in response to pathogenic type I IFN, suggesting that ZBP1 may be a key molecule in type I interferon disease caused by ADAR1 mutations [REF].ADAR1 has been found to affect immune cell functions, for instance, mediating early T-cell development [REF] and T-cell immune tolerance and preventing colitis [REF]. ADAR1 is involved in regulating macrophage function and maintaining the balance of DC cell subsets [REF].In addition to its classical role in triggering adaptive immunity, there has been a growing report about the effects of ADAR1 on stem cells. A study found that knockout of ADAR1 leads to lethality or premature death of mouse embryos, suggesting that RNA editing regulation has vital biological significance [REF]. ADAR1 promotes leukemia stem cell (LSC) self-renewal via let-7 pri-microRNA editing [REF] ADAR1 knockdown also reduces the self-renewal ability of blast crisis leukemia stem cell (BC-LSC) in RAG2+ γc+ mice. These data show that ADAR1 reprogram malignant progenitor cells to drive leukemia progression [REF]. By the way, ADAR1 plays an important role in the survival and maintenance of intestinal stem cells and intestinal homeostasis by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and interferon (IFN) signal transduction. ADAR1 is highly expressed in Lgr5+ cells, and its absence in adult mice leads to rapid apoptosis and loss of these active circulating stem cells in the small intestine and colon [REF]. In addition, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway can be triggered by ADAR1, thereby affecting the regulation of the proliferation of malignant hematopoietic stem cells [REF]. However, the specific mechanism of ADAR1 as a new target for the clinical treatment of stem cell-related diseases is not yet known.In this context, we will discuss the protein structure and biological function of ADAR1, and its potential role in stem cell. In addition, we describe some theoretically feasible treatment strategies for stem cells related diseases based on ADAR1 function in this review.",human
"In today's competitive world, critical thinking is one of the abilities which all individuals must have.[REF] Critical thinking is a vast, comprehensive process that begins with a problem and continues until a solution is found.[REF] Regarded as one of the primary skills in the twenty-first century,[REF] critical thinking is an essential competence in all professional and academic fields.[REF] Critical thinking consists of the two domains of disposition and skill. The importance of creativity is high in order to provide innovative solutions for decision-making and problem solving.[REF] A critical thinker can accurately analyze data to arrive at correct conclusions or use alternative methods to solve problems.[REF] Thus, development and evaluation of critical thinking are significant in teaching and learning.[REF] However, due to information overload and quick advances in technology, the goal of education has moved toward mere transfer of information at the cost of raising intelligent and creative individuals.[REF] Karakoc Najafi et al. concluded in their study that critical thinking skills should be emphasized in university education.[REF]The integration of technology into face-to-face learning has raised great interest. Due to its efficacy in allowing for flexible, timely, and continuing learning, blended learning is regarded as the most effective and popular approach to learning.[REF] As blended learning combines classroom learning with online learning,[REF] it has the benefits of both conventional learning and electronic learning.[REF] Blended learning is regarded as a practical learning model for increasing the skills of learners in the twenty-first century.[REF] This type of learning transforms students from passive learners to active learners who seek knowledge.[REF] Blended learning consists of the subcategories of the flex model, self-blended model, enriched virtual model, and rotation model and its subcategories.[REF] These modern, dynamic methods of learning promote students’ ability to investigate and identify their own learning needs, to perform critical thinking, to play an active role in their learning process, to have better initiative in different situations, and to improve their problem solving skills.[REF] According to Wahyuni, blended learning had a significant impact on improving students’ critical thinking skills.[REF] However, the results of the study of Hajrezayi et al. showed that the contribution of blended learning to students’ critical thinking was not significant.[REF] Harrington et al. suggested that there was need for more research into the effects of the flipped classroom model (one of the subcategories of blended learning) on students’ critical thinking and problem-solving skills.[REF] Teaching critical thinking is the most important effort that should be made in nursing education.[REF] Some experts believe that education is just teaching thinking to the learner. On the other hand, there is a need to review current educational strategies and making more use of active learning strategies has been repeatedly emphasized.[REF] Accordingly, in the present study, the researchers conducted an extensive systematic review of previous studies of the effects of blended learning and its subcategories on critical thinking (and its subcategories) which are among the essential skills in the twenty-first century.",human
"Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease defined as ischemia or hemorrhage, of which ischemic stroke accounts for 76% [REF], and leads to a variety of neurological defects. Statistics show that there are 2.4 million new stroke patients in China every year, about 1.1 million deaths, and 11 million stroke patients, most of which are ischemic stroke, and these statistics show an upward and younger trend year by year. China has become the country with the heaviest burden of stroke in the world [REF]. Data show that 29–78% of stroke patients have dysphagia [REF], and the mean incidence of the disease is 50% [REF]. 91% of patients with post-stroke dysphagia are mild [REF]. Although the survival rate of stroke patients has been significantly improved because of the improvement of medical skills such as first aid and thrombolysis, most survivors of stroke are affected by sequelae such as dysphagia and speech, motor, and memory impairments [REF]. Stroke is the most common neurological cause of dysphagia [REF]. Dysphagia is a process in which food cannot be transported safely and efficiently to the stomach because of the damaged structure and function of organs, such as the jaw, the Soft Palate, the lips, the tongue, the throat, the esophagus, etc. Swallowing muscles mainly include the laryngeal muscles (suprahyoid muscle and thyrohyoid muscle) and the subglottis. These muscles experience kinematic effects and muscle strength weakens, resulting in reduced movement in the swallowing process [REF]. Swallowing is one of the most complex somatic reflexes. It is controlled by the cerebral cortex, cortical medulla oblongata pathway, brainstem, the swallowing center, and pairs 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th of the cerebral nerves and C1, C2, and C3 of the spinal nerves [REF]. Stroke disrupts the swallowing network and can lead to dysphagia. According to the location of food passing through, swallowing can be divided into four stages: pre-oral stage, oral stage, pharyngeal stage, and esophageal stage [REF]. The majority of post-stroke dysphagia occurs in the delivery of food and fluid from the oral cavity to the stomach, and their dysfunction occurs primarily in the oral and pharyngeal phases. It often manifests as saliva or food coming out of the mouth, holding food in the mouth for a long time without swallowing, food or water coming out of the nose (nasal reflux), food sticking to the mouth or throat, and bucking when eating or drinking. Moreover, dysphagia can lead to bucking, aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, etc. Severe cases endanger life due to asphyxia. Thus, post-stroke dysphagia seriously affects patients’ quality of life and increases family and social burdens, and it is necessary to find an effective strategy for promoting the functional recovery of patients with post-stroke dysphagia.The European Stroke Organization and the European Society for Dysphagia have jointly developed the 2021 European guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia after Stroke [REF]. The guidelines recommended that the treatment for post-stroke dysphagia include dietary interventions, nutritional interventions, behavioral interventions (swallowing training), oral health, medication (Capsaicin receptor 1 agonist and dopaminergic drugs), and peripheral or central nervous regulation (repetitive trans cranial magnetic stimulation, trans cranial electrical stimulation, trans cranial direct current stimulation, and pharyngeal electrical stimulation) [REF]. However, so far there is no specific and effective therapeutic schedule for the treatment of post-stroke dysphagia. In China and some East Asian countries, acupuncture has been widely used in the treatment of stroke and achieved a good curative effect. Tongue acupuncture is a special micro-acupuncture therapy. Clinical practice has proved that tongue acupuncture is an effective treatment for dysphagia after a stroke. Tongue acupuncture is a kind of swift pricking blood therapy; the acupuncture therapy has the benefits of being fast, with little pain and no side effects. It is easy to administer by acupuncturists and well-accepted by patients.In traditional Chinese medicine, post-stroke dysphagia can be classified into the “she jian” (which means sluggish tongue impeding speech) and “yin fei (which means the tongue is paralyzed and cannot work well). Their main clinical manifestations are slow rotation of tongue, uncontrolled eating, and loss of speech. Acupuncture is an effective and internationally recognized treatment of stroke that can significantly reduce the disability rate. Acupuncture can stimulate nerve terminal receptors, help nerve sensory input, promote the recovery of the damaged cerebral cortex and subcortical nerve, improve the function of the glossopharyngeal nerves and the reflex arc, and enhance the swallowing reflex [REF].Tongue acupuncture is a special micro-acupuncture therapy created by famous acupuncturist Guan Zhengzhai, based on the theory from Huang Di Nei Jing of the relationship between tongue and Zangfu-meridians theoretic and modern biological holography, combined with decades of clinical experience, and has become an important part of acupuncture together with ear and head acupuncture methods [REF].According to the theory of Chinese medicine, the heart may be reflected on the tongue, which is connected directly or indirectly with the Zangfu-meridians theoretic by the circulation of the meridians and the infusion of qi and blood, closely connected with the heart, spleen, and kidneys. The heart is said to govern blood and vessels as well as the spirit. The tongue is governed by the heart-mind and brain marrow. Stimulation of the tongue may promote brain function repair and improve post-stroke dysfunction through “blood-vessel-heart-spirit.” Acupuncture points on the tongue stimulate the connected meridians or Zangfu-meridians theoretic in order to regulate qi and blood flow, opening and closing the orifices, and at the same time nourishing the blood channels of the tongue, smoothing the tongue meridians, and promoting tongue and pharyngeal recovery. Clinical practice shows that tongue acupuncture therapy is less painful for the patient, is easy to administer, and is more effective when combined with body acupuncture. Tongue acupuncture in the treatment of dysphagia can improve swallowing function by changing the excitability of cortical nerve cells, promoting the recovery of neurological function, enhancing neuron muscular excitability, activating related pathways or the combination of both, and improving the control of swallowing-related nerves and muscles. Thus, tongue acupuncture is an effective, safe, and reliable traditional Chinese medicine therapy with many years of clinical experience and is a potential method for the treatment of dysphagia.This article aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of tongue acupuncture in the treatment of post-stroke dysphagia by Meta-analysis, and we hope to provide a reliable therapy for the treatment of post-stroke dysphagia and to promote its clinical application.",human
"The amygdala and accessory regions referred to as the extended amygdala, are key emotional centers in the brain, which have classically been studied in the context of motivated actions, defensive behaviors, and fear learning. Anatomical, molecular, physiological, and behavioral studies have delineated functionally distinct subregions of the amygdala, including the basolateral, central, and medial subregions (BLA, CeA, and MeA, respectively). In addition to the classical amygdala structures, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a heterogeneous forebrain region with multiple neuronal subpopulations that has also been characterized as part of the extended amygdala [REF]. Like the CeA, the BNST is composed primarily of neurons that utilize the fast inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The vast majority of these GABAergic neurons also synthesize and release varying combinations of several neuropeptide modulators, although such multiplex forms of neural transmission remain largely uncharacterized.Here, our abbreviation of AMY refers to structures of the classical amygdala (BLA, CeA, and MeA), as well as the extended amygdala (BNST), as both are critical for behavioral responding to emotionally salient stimuli and consolidation of emotional memories [REF]. While the AMY has historically been primarily studied in the context of threat avoidance and fear conditioning [REF], extensive research has linked the AMY not only with negative emotional states of anxiety and aversion, but with positive emotional states of approach and reward as well [REF].More recently, experimental manipulations of CeA and BNST neurons also revealed their abilities to potently modulate transitions between sleep and wakefulness [REF]. These sparse reports extend the functions of AMY neurons far beyond their canonical roles as detectors and mediators of affective behavioral states [REF]. In fact, they likely represent only “the tip of the iceberg” in terms of the multifaceted contributions of AMY circuits to arousal regulation, and in particular, the relationships between emotional regulation and arousal (wakefulness) in sleep disorders such as narcolepsy.Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder impacting ~4 million people across the globe that is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and abnormal episodes of sleep that intrude upon normal wakefulness [REF]. Human patients with narcolepsy can experience sleep-like episodes at any period throughout the day, often coupled with hypnopompic or hypnagogic hallucinations [REF]. Furthermore, approximately half of people with narcolepsy are estimated to experience symptoms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, in which normal muscle atonia during REM fails and they may physically act out the behaviors ongoing in their dreams [REF]. One popular interpretation of narcolepsy is that it is an inappropriate intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness. Other interpretations exist—for a summary, see Adamantidis et al. (2020). Previous studies in humans and animals have identified genetic markers linked to increased risk of narcolepsy [REF], and the neuroimmune hypothesis of narcolepsy has been described in detail elsewhere [REF]. Those topics are beyond the scope of this article, and we refer the reader to other expert reviews.Categorized into two types, narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) presents with more severe symptoms and is accompanied by cataplexy [REF]. In contrast, narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) has less severe symptoms and is not coupled with cataplexy. For these reasons, our review will focus exclusively on NT1 rather than NT2, although there is scant literature suggesting that lesions of the amygdala can generate symptoms of NT2 [REF].NT1 in humans is strongly associated with the loss of a specific subpopulation of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) containing the wake-promoting neuropeptide Orexin [REF]. Correspondingly, NT1 patients display lower levels of Orx in the cerebrospinal fluid [REF] as well as of Orx mRNA and peptide in the brain [REF]. The Orx peptide system is critical for stabilizing wakefulness (arousal) and Orx-LH neurons project broadly throughout the brain to exert excitatory physiological effects via signaling of the G-protein-coupled Orexin receptors type 1 and 2 [REF]. Orx activity is essential not only for initiating and maintaining wakefulness, but also for many motivated behaviors such as avoiding threatening stimuli or approaching rewarding stimuli [REF]. NT1 has been identified in other animals as well, with canine NT1 being caused by a mutation in the OX2 receptor gene [REF]. NT1 can also be modeled using genetic manipulations of the Orx system, as discussed later.During episodes of cataplexy, awake and alert subjects can lose muscle tone and eventually experience muscle paralysis and fall into a REM sleep-like state, and these transitions can be detectable by loss of muscle activity on electromyogram recordings (EMG). Frequently, cataplexy is triggered by individuals experiencing powerful positive emotional stimuli, such as laughter or social interactions [REF]. In rare cases, it may be triggered by sexual intercourse (Poryazova et al., 2009a). Occasionally, negative emotional stimuli such as anger or frustration can also initiate cataplexy [REF]. It has been shown in mouse models of narcolepsy that both appetitive/rewarding and aversive stimuli can increase cataplexy [REF].The circuitry underlying the switches between sleep and wake states is complex and involves multiple subregions, pathways, and neurotransmitters. However, given the interpretation of narcolepsy as an intrusion of REM sleep into wakefulness, and that episodes of cataplexy trigger a loss of muscle tone, as seen during REM sleep, it is important to review the circuitry believed to underlie the muscle atonia of REM sleep. During REM, it is believed that activation of the sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus (SLD, also known as subcoeruleus nucleus) is what maintains muscle atonia. Downstream projections from the SLD ultimately lead to inhibition of motor neurons. During wake, projections from the Orx-expressing LH neurons to REM-regulating regions ultimately inhibit the SLD, allowing normal muscle tone to persist (for a detailed review of this circuitry, see Arrigoni et al. (2016)). In NT1, with loss of Orx neurons in the LH, this tonic inhibition of the SLD is lost, leading to inappropriate intrusion of muscle tone during wake (Figure 1).Summary of the known functional connections between AMY, Orx-LH neurons, REM-off promoting neurons, and the SLD. The thickness of the lines indicates hypothesized strengths and activity levels of connections. Under normal conditions, stimulation of BNST-GABA neurons can trigger wakefulness, and stimulation of CeA-Neurotensin neurons can increase NREM sleep. The BNST and CeA send modulatory neuropeptide (and inhibitory GABAergic) inputs to Orx-LH neurons, as well as inhibitory GABAergic projections to REM-Off regions (including vlPAG, LC, DRN, LPT). BLA neurons send excitatory glutamatergic projections to REM-Off neurons. REM-Off neurons inhibit SLD glutamate neurons that generate muscle atonia such as during REM under normal conditions. In NT1, with loss of Orx, there is an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory input to REM-off regions. Inhibitory input from AMY to REM-Off neurons may be more pronounced as a consequence, resulting in less disinhibition (excitation) of SLD glutamate neurons. SLD glutamate neurons typically promote muscle atonia, and can lead to cataplexy upon being released from inhibitory control during wakefulness. Figure created using BioRender.com.Given the known role of the AMY in driving affective states, and the well-documented impacts of powerful emotions on sleep and wakefulness [REF], decades of research have sought to elucidate the neural interactions between AMY circuits and Orx-LH neurons in NT1 [REF]. Here, we (1) describe the distinct interactions of AMY subregions with hypothalamic and cortical systems relevant to narcolepsy, and their relationships to sleep regulation. Next, we (2) summarize descriptive studies in human patients that link changes in AMY activity and connectivity to NT1. In the following section, we (3) provide a synopsis of mechanistic studies in animal models of NT1 that causally demonstrate roles for the AMY in cataplexy bouts. Finally, we (4) synthesize these collective findings into an updated circuit model highlighting distinct AMY pathways in discrete contributions to affective regulation and emotional triggers in the context of narcolepsy with cataplexy.",human
"Cancer is one of the major diseases threatening human life and health. According to GLOBOCAN 2020, there will be approximately 19.3 million new cancer cases and at least 10 million cancer deaths worldwide in 2020 [REF]. It was predicted that by 2022, there would be approximately 4.82 million new cancer cases and at least 3.21 million cancer deaths in China and approximately 2.37 million new cancer cases and at least 0.64 million cancer deaths in the United States [REF]. In many countries, cancer is increasingly becoming the main cause of death. At present, frequently used treatment methods that target tumors include radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, and targeted therapy. In December 2013, Science magazine named tumor immunotherapy one of the top 10 technological breakthroughs of the year [REF]. American scientist James P. Allison and Japanese scientist Tasuku Honjo were awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that negative immune regulation can be used to treat cancer. The current clinical applications of tumor immunotherapy include immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, adoptive cellular immunotherapy, and cancer vaccines, among others [REF]. Clinically, tumor immunotherapy has shown clear efficacy in patients with different cancer diagnoses, including long-term remission after treatment [REF]. Moreover, tumor immunotherapy has the potential to cure a small number of patients who develop metastases and were previously thought to be incurable [REF]. Tumor immunotherapy is a novel treatment approach that has rapidly developed in recent years [REF]. Unlike traditional therapy, tumor immunotherapy primarily targets the immune system rather than tumor cells. The immune system prevents cancer progression because of its ability to recognize and destroy abnormal cells. Tumor immunotherapy can eliminate tumor cells by strengthening the body’s innate immune defense and reshaping the immune microenvironment [REF]. Therefore, reactivating the body’s immune system is conducive to killing tumor cells.Although immunotherapy has benefited many patients, these patients remain a minority [REF]. Two studies found that the gut microbiome had a significant impact on cancer immunotherapy in mouse models [REF]. Furthermore, scientists have observed that the impact of the gut microbiome on cancer immunotherapy is variable in cancer patients; specifically, some gut microbiome metabolites can significantly strengthen cancer immunotherapy and, thus, are considered favorable. There is no consensus on what is considered favorable. Researchers from France found that Akkermansia muciniphila was beneficial for immunotherapy against epithelial tumors [REF]. Researchers from North America discovered that the beneficial gut microbes included Collinsella aerofaciens, Enterococcus faecium, and Bifidobacterium longum in patients with metastatic melanoma [REF], while researchers from South America identified Ruminococcaceae as part of a favorable gut microbiome in patients with melanoma [REF]. Furthermore, researchers from China identified Bifidobacterium longum, Prevotella copri, and Alistipes putredinis as beneficial gut microbes for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving immunotherapy [REF]. These results imply that regional differences influence what is considered a favorable microbiome. Therefore, scientists have begun to explore the relationships between microbial metabolites and enhanced cancer immunotherapy.Obesity is defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2 (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and is the most important risk factor for human health. Unfortunately, the long-term effectiveness of dietary intervention is limited. No effective drugs are currently available for individuals who have morbid obesity. Therefore, bariatric surgery is widely applied and is a high-efficiency treatment option for most patients with obesity. Bariatric surgery is recommended for obese patients with a BMI > 35 to 40 kg/m2 and other comorbidities. Generally, bariatric surgery has become an option for inducing weight loss, and numerous studies have recently shown that it also alters the gut microbiota profile. Indeed, many researchers have reported that alterations in microbial metabolites after bariatric surgery are beneficial in the context of other diseases, such as type 2 diabetes [REF]. However, the impact of the microbial metabolites associated with bariatric surgery on cancer and antitumor immunity requires further investigation.In this review, we introduce and analyze the changes in microbial metabolites caused by bariatric surgery and the effects of the subsequent gut-derived metabolites on anticancer immunity. Furthermore, we attempt to clarify the relationship between the changes in microbial metabolites caused by bariatric surgery and the effectiveness of cancer treatment with the aim of providing strategies for cancer patients with obesity.",human
"Health professions trainees in the 21st century have access to an unprecedented amount of open access educational resources that greatly exceeds the organizational capacity of an individual’s mind [REF]. In response, future practitioners must be proficient in knowledge acquisition [REF] The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching highlighted the need to incorporate habits of inquiry and improvement in the 2010 Call for Reform of Medical Education as a learning strategy to optimize proficiency in knowledge acquisition [REF]. To meet the evolving needs of trainees and to foster greater student curiosity as the foundation for learning, inquiry-based learning (IBL) has emerged as an appealing educational strategy.IBL focuses on learner driven acquisition of knowledge through development of inquiries, and hypothesis generation. This differs from problem-based learning in that PBL is focused on learner investigation of teacher provided problems. Comparative to problem-based learning is case based learning wherein learners are provided cases around which to target their investigation and research. Through exclusion of these other teaching methods and focusing only on open inquiry, we attempt to distinguish the specific benefits of pure trainee inquiry learning and consider how this can be incorporated in areas of health profession that involve mature learners such as post-graduate medical education and nursing education.Educational philosopher John Dewey, a prominent education reformist in the early 20th century laid the foundation for inquiry as a central focus of science education, and Jerome Bruner pioneered the inquiry-based instruction in science curricula [REF] in the 1950s. The theory behind IBL is the constructivist, learner-driven active process of knowledge acquisition. Students formulate hypotheses and make observations in order to construct their knowledge [REF]. While descriptions of IBL vary widely in the literature, the framework can be divided into five general phases:[REF] Orientation: the topic is introduced, and the student creates a problem statement,Conceptualization: the student develops an open question pertaining to the problem, and generates a hypothesis,Investigation: the student explores or observes, they may even experiment, and interpret their findings,Conclusion: the student reviews the problem, hypothesis, and their interpretation of the findings to consider whether their question has been answered, and,Discussion: the student communicates their findings to others (external) and reflects upon successes and areas for improvement within the inquiry process (internal). Orientation: the topic is introduced, and the student creates a problem statement,Conceptualization: the student develops an open question pertaining to the problem, and generates a hypothesis,Investigation: the student explores or observes, they may even experiment, and interpret their findings,Conclusion: the student reviews the problem, hypothesis, and their interpretation of the findings to consider whether their question has been answered, and,Discussion: the student communicates their findings to others (external) and reflects upon successes and areas for improvement within the inquiry process (internal).While the IBL curriculum design has evolved and taken many forms since Bruner’s initial model, the core foundation of student-directed epistemic curiosity has been consistently aimed at encouraging active participation, and improving scientific literacy [REF]. Studies in higher education have found that IBL can hone students’ analytical and critical thinking abilities [REF], and may improve students’ overall academic performance compared to a traditional lecture-based curriculum.7IBL has been variably classified and subdivided in the literature. Aditomo et al. grouped IBL curricula based on assigned tasks that include: scholarly research (students formulate questions and collect empirical data to address them), simplified research (students formulate question but only perform some aspects of data collection or analysis), literature-based research (no empirical data collection), and applied research (similar to simplified, though focused on practical issues and “real-world” problems).8In some cases, IBL has been considered as overlapping or else an umbrella term encompassing problem-based learning (PBL) [REF]. Some have sub-classified IBL based on the roles and responsibilities of teachers and students [REF]: Structured inquiry (e.g. PBL) – teachers provide a problem and an outline for addressing it,Guided inquiry – teachers provide questions to stimulate inquiry however students are self-directed in the investigation, conclusion, and discussion, and,Open inquiry – students develop questions themselves, and are self-directed in investigation, conclusion, and discussion. Structured inquiry (e.g. PBL) – teachers provide a problem and an outline for addressing it,Guided inquiry – teachers provide questions to stimulate inquiry however students are self-directed in the investigation, conclusion, and discussion, and,Open inquiry – students develop questions themselves, and are self-directed in investigation, conclusion, and discussion.While there have been apparent benefits of IBL in higher education, particularly with regards to fostering inquiry behavior, the outcomes of an IBL curriculum in health professions education are yet to be fully elucidated. In this scoping review, we examine the published literature exploring student outcomes in inquiry-based learning curricula in health professions training. We aim to describe the extent of existing literature in this area, to characterize study designs and outcomes, and to identify gaps in the health professions’ literature where future studies on IBL should focus.",human
"The development of vertebrate intestine, like many other organs, takes place in two phases, the initial formation of a neonatal/juvenile form and subsequent maturation into the adult form. This second phase often occurs during postembryonic development, a perinatal period when plasma thyroid hormone (T3) level peaks [REF]. This period corresponds the first 2-3 weeks after birth in mouse and metamorphosis in amphibians such as the highly related anurans pseudo-tetraploid Xenopus laevis and diploid Xenopus tropicalis (Note that due to the conservations between the two species, we will simply refer to both as Xenopus unless specified, although earlier studies on anuran metamorphosis were mainly on Xenopus laevis while more recent ones, particularly gene knockout studies, have been on Xenopus tropicalis). Importantly, maturation of the intestine during this second phase appears to be highly conserved [REF]. For example, the mouse intestine has villi but no crypts, where adult stem cells reside, at birth and develop crypts during the first 3 weeks after birth when T3 levels are high. Similarly, the intestine in a premetamorphic Xenopus tadpole, when there is little or no T3, is also simple in structure, consisting of mostly a single layer of epithelial cells, surrounded by thin layers of connective tissue and muscles (Figure 1A) [REF]. As T3 levels rises after stage 54 (about 4 weeks of age) [REF], metamorphosis begins and larval epithelial cells undergo programmed cell death [REF]. Some larval epithelial cells undergo dedifferentiation during metamorphosis to form clusters of cells that proliferate rapidly and express well-known adult intestinal stem cell markers such as Lgr5 by climax of metamorphosis, e.g., stage 61 (about 6-7 weeks of age) (Figure 1A) [REF]. By the end of metamorphosis or stage 66 (about 2 months after fertilization), these proliferating stem cells differentiate to form a multi-folded epithelium surrounded by elaborate connective tissue and muscles [REF]. In the adult frog, the intestinal stem cells are localized at the bottom of the epithelial fold while cell death occurs mainly at the crest of the fold, similar to those taking place in the crypt-villus unit in adult mammalian intestine [REF]. (A). Schematic diagram of Xenopus intestinal metamorphosis. Both tadpole and frog intestine are structurally simple, consisting of mainly three tissue layers: inner epithelium, connective tissue, and outer muscle layers. The tadpole intestine is much simpler, with only a single epithelial fold, the typhlosole. In contrast, the frog intestine has multiple epithelial folds with elaborate connective tissue and muscle layers. The major events underlying the change from tadpole to frog intestine during metamorphosis include the apoptosis of essentially all larval epithelial cells, as indicated by circles. Concurrently, the adult epithelial stem cells, with high level expression of known stem cell markers such as Lgr5, are formed de novo through dedifferentiation of some larval epithelial cells and rapidly proliferate at the climax metamorphosis, as indicated by the dots. The connective tissue and muscle cells also develop extensively during metamorphosis. (B). Apoptotic and proliferating cells are non-overlapping epithelial cells during T3-induced intestinal metamorphosis. Premetamorphic Xenopus laevis tadpoles at stage 54 were treated with 10 nM T3 for 0, 3, or 6 days and sacrificed one hour after injection with EdU to label proliferating cells. Intestinal cross-sections were double stained for EdU and by TUNEL for apoptotic cells. A higher magnification of the boxed areas labeled with a’-c’ is shown on the right. The dotted lines depict the epithelium-mesenchyme boundary. Note that apoptosis as shown by the TUNEL signal in the epithelium occurred prior to the appearance of the clusters (islets) of EdU-labeled cells and in distinct epithelial cells during T3 treatment (c’). Arrows point to some apoptotic cells. See [REF] for more details.T3 not only has peak levels during postembryonic development but also plays critical roles during this period, with T3 deficiency causing severely developmental problems in all vertebrates including human [REF]. T3 is both necessary and sufficient for anuran metamorphosis. Thus, preventing the synthesis of endogenous T3 allows Xenopus tadpoles to remain in tadpole form for years while wild type animals typically finish metamorphosis by around 2 months of age [REF]. Conversely, treating premetamorphic Xenopus tadpoles with physiological levels of T3 in the rearing water causes precociously metamorphosis. Making use of the ability to easily manipulate anuran metamorphosis by controlling the availability of T3 to tadpoles or even organ or primary cell cultures and the advancement in genetic technologies, especially gene-editing for knockout studies in the diploid Xenopus tropicalis [REF], we and others have been studying the molecular mechanism by which T3 regulates cell fate and tissue transformation during metamorphosis. Here, we review some recent studies on intestinal remodeling, with an emphasis on the potential role of cell cycle activation in larval epithelial cell death and adult stem cell development.",human
"The leading cause for the failure of tumor chemotherapy is the lack of effective drug delivery in the lesion site, which is still a severe challenge for glioblastoma (GBM) therapy [REF]. The increase in tumor resistance to drugs primarily lies in the use of low-specific and highly cytotoxic therapeutics and fluctuations in plasma drug levels. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a specialized endothelial structure that is partially covered by pericytes and almost entirely surrounded by the end feet of astrocytes. The primary function of BBB is to maintain the normal physiological part of the brain and the balance of the central nervous systems (CNS) environment [REF]. It is noteworthy that the lack of fenestration in endothelial cells results in the low permeability of BBB, and tight junctions (TJs) between adjacent brain endothelial cells make the barrier 50–100 times tighter than peripheral microvessels. Except for some special transport channels, almost 100% biological macromolecules and 98% small molecules cannot cross the BBB into the brain, which seriously limits the efficacy of therapeutic agents for brain diseases, including GBM [REF]. Therefore, the critical scientific problem to be urgently solved for treating GBM is to improve the transport efficiency of therapeutics into the brain effectively.Recently, extensive and substantial progress has been made in GBM therapy, including brain receptor-mediated targeted therapy [REF], focused ultrasound opening the BBB [REF] and Borneol for “orifice-opening” of the BBB [REF]. Among them, the preferred strategy for GBM-targeted treatment is receptor-mediated intracerebral transport which shares characteristics of high specificity, affinity and selectivity [REF]. Several studies have described that many kinds of receptors are overexpressed on the BBB, including insulin receptors (IR) [REF], low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) [REF], transferrin receptors (TfR) [REF] and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) [REF]. And their ligands are usually employed to facilitate receptor-mediated intracerebral delivery of anti-GBM therapeutic drugs. However, the intracerebral transport efficiency of medications is still unsatisfactory. In the author’s crude opinion, some of these reasons are mainly attributed to the fact that current studies on brain-targeted drug delivery systems primarily focus on the interactions between ligands and their receptors, as well as targeted cells and targeted tissues, while ignoring the dynamic changes of BBB function during the development and treatment periods of brain diseases. One or even several treatments of the brain-targeted delivery system may achieve tumor-inhibiting effects in the short term. Still, in the long run, its impact on the restoration of pathological BBB can continue to inhibit the intracerebral delivery efficiency of therapeutic drugs, and lead to the failure of their treatment. In addition, the poor druggability of the vast majority of brain-targeted drug delivery systems limited their clinical application. Therefore, there is still a long way to find safe and effective ways to go to treat brain diseases, and anti-GBM therapy still needs the discovery of new mechanisms, the breakthrough of new technologies and the emergence of new treatments.The pathological process of GBM is likely to be closely related to BBB, which might also play a vital role in the occurrence and treatment of GBM [REF]. Under physiological conditions, BBB is a biological membrane barrier composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells and their TJs, basement membranes and the end feet of glial cells around capillaries [REF]. TJs structure is an essential morphological basis of the BBB, forming the low permeability of the barrier and its high resistance properties [REF]. Under pathological conditions, the occurrences of brain diseases [REF], including GBM, Parkinson’s disease (PD), cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are usually accompanied by pathological impairment of BBB, with decreased TJs proteins and increased BBB permeability.Studies have confirmed that BBB pathological fenestration provides an opening paracellular pathway for the transport of therapeutics across the BBB. Hu et al. have demonstrated that BBB pathological fenestration in GBM provided an extra paracellular route for angiopep-2 modified glycolipid-like nanoparticles transporting across the barrier in vitro and in vivo [REF]. Nevertheless, during multiple dosing treatments for GBM, the first administration with brain-targeted nanotherapeutics would cause pathological BBB restoration, which resulted in poor intracerebral transport efficiency during re-administration and eventual treatment failure. Our previous study has confirmed that the treatment of targeted Ap-CSssSA/P nanoparticles could restore pathological BBB mainly via VEGF downstream signaling pathway inhibition. However, pathological BBB functional recovery seriously reduces the intracerebral transport efficiency of Ap-CSssSA/P nanoparticles, leading to a poor outcome in GBM therapy. Therefore, combined sequential treatment with functionalized Ap-CSssSA/P nanoparticles and BBB permeability regulator SC79, which could reversibly re-open the restored BBB, was proposed to treat GBM. And the strategy finally produced an observable and significantly enhanced anti-GBM effect in vivo, compared to single Ap-CSssSA/P nanoparticles treatment [REF]. Hence, the regulation of pathological BBB for improving the transport of therapeutic agents across the BBB may provide new opportunities for GBM effective treatment.",human
"Achilles tendinopathy is a type of degenerative tendon disease that causes functional impairment and morbidity [REF]. According to epidemiological data, a prevalence of 2.16 cases per 1,000 patient-years was estimated in the general population and 6.2%–9.5% in athlete population [REF]. According to its anatomical location, it is divided into two primary categories: insertional, which occurs at the calcaneus Achilles tendon junction, and mid-portion, which occurs 2–6 cm proximal to the calcaneus [REF]. The characteristic of mid-portion tendinopathy is diffuse or localized swelling, degenerated tendon morphology and pain caused by repetitive loading without adequate compensation of the plantar flexor muscle function [REF].In consequence, one of the most effective management strategies for mid-portion AT have been proposed to be exercise-based therapy [REF]. To date, several exercise interventions have been reported for AT, such as the “Alfredson protocol” which is also known as heavy eccentric calf training [REF], concentric training [REF], the “Stanish protocol” [REF], and the “Silbernagel protocol” [REF]. These interventions can be classified as three different loading protocols: eccentric, concentric, and combined (eccentric plus concentric) training, respectively. Among those, eccentric loading has emerged as one of the primary conservative approaches for AT rehabilitation over the past twenty years. It is hypothesized to influence the formation in carboxyterminal propeptide of type I collagen, boosting tendon volume and tensile strength [REF]. Eccentric exercises may also have the potential to reduce the neovascularization and related nerve ingrowth being responsible for pain development [REF]. A recent meta-analysis examined the relationship between eccentric exercise treatments and tendon volume in healthy and pathological tendons [REF]. In healthy tendons no significant immediate volume changes following acute exercise interventions were apparent. In pathological tendons, immediate and short-term volume reductions were reported, while no long-term adaptations were found as investigated in one study only. Based on the limited number of studies examining long-term changes in tendon morphology, the proclaimed effect of eccentric training on tendon volume remains inconclusive [REF].Research indicates that both concentric and combined exercise treatments can also be effective in improving plantar flexor functions such as power (e.g., height of countermovement jump) [REF] in the AT population, which is believed to occur through the strengthening of the affected tendon [REF]. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the effects of eccentric loading are different from other types of loadings, such as slow concentric loading [REF]. The primary cause for these similar adaptations may be explained by the “time-under-tension” hypothesis, which states that positive adaptations could be achieved regardless of contraction type, as long as the mechanical strain is performed slowly and heavy enough [REF]. Since the tendinopathic regions can be subjected to mechanical strain that restores normal fibril alignment and cell morphology, different types of loading may have a comparable impact to eccentric exercise.In conclusion, different types of exercise treatments have reported positive findings in varying functional outcomes in addition to eccentric training [REF]. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the effect of specific exercise treatments for improving specific functional outcomes (e.g., strength) in mid-portion AT. Being able to differentiate the effects of different types of exercises on functional outcomes might allow for more tailored treatment in people with AT. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the effect of various exercise treatments (eccentric, concentric, combined) on different functional outcomes (strength, power, range of motion, balance) in people with mid-portion AT.",human
"Cognitive dysfunction, one of the most common non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), is up to six times more common in PD than in the healthy aging population, worsens the prognosis of PD, and increases caregivers’ burden and economic consequences [REF]. It was estimated that 40–50% of PD presents with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline, and 75–80% of MCI progresses to dementia in a longitudinal study [REF]. Recently, the process of cognitive decline in PD patients have received growing interest.Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) refers to decreases in cognitive capacity without detectable impairment on neuropsychological tests, indicating intact cognitive functions, accompanied by pathological changes, and was believed to be an at-risk state of MCI and a prodromal stage for dementia in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [REF]. A study showed β-amyloid deposition and atrophy as well as brain activation in people with SCD, suggesting a compensatory mechanism, which might reflect early neuronal dysfunction together with memory performance preserved [REF]. Thus, the state of SCD was recognized as an essential course of AD pathology and a risk factor for cognitive decline [REF]. Similar to AD, SCD may be an intermediate state between cognitive normality and MCI in PD. Thus, a possible three-stage clinical performance related to cognition might be applicable to patients with PD, with SCD as the prodromal phase, followed by MCI, finally leading to dementia [REF]. Neuroimaging study focused on PD patients with SCD (PD-SCD) demonstrated reduced FDG metabolism in the middle frontal, middle temporal, and occipital areas and the angular gyrus of the cortex, which suggested there may be early pathological changes in PD-SCD [REF]. Follow-up studies showed a significantly higher risk of developing PD-MCI and dementia for patients with PD-SCD compared to PD without SCD at baseline [REF]. However, there are inconsistent results, results just shown a correlation between SCD and depression, anxiety and other related mood features rather than cognitive dysfunction [REF]. For example, in Barbosa’s study, he regarded SCD as subjective cognitive complaints (SCC), and found SCD severity was related to depression (p = 0.026) rather than Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores (p = 0.141) in PD with normal cognition (PD-NC), which suggested clinician to alert affective disorder in PD-SCD [REF]. Study led by Baschi defined subjective memory complaints (SMC) as SCD, and results showed PD-SCD was significantly associated with anxiety (OR = 3.93) when compared to PD without SCD [REF].Overall, cognitive impairment in PD is a huge financial burden to society as well as caregivers, and it is time to highlight the importance of identifying cognitive decline as early as possible [REF]. However, studies on PD-SCD have thus far been scarce, and there is no consensus regarding the definition of SCD nor is there a gold standard as an evaluation tool. Little is known about whether there is a clear association between SCD and cognitive dysfunction or later cognitive decline in PD.The review aimed to outline how SCD has been used as a diagnostic criterion in studies on PD as well as to describe the possible correlation related to objective cognitive impairment, help recognize SCD as an at-risk state early indicator and allow clinicians to predict conversion to PD-D more accurately.",human
"Viral Hepatitis is one of the major global public health issues, and every year millions of individuals suffer from it.[REF] Viral Hepatitis caused 1.34 million fatalities worldwide in 2015, with the majority of viral Hepatitis deaths owing to chronic liver disease or primary liver cancer (mortality due to cirrhosis: 720,000; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): 470,000). The death rate from viral Hepatitis has continued to climb over time.[REF] Nowadays, viral Hepatitis can be comparable to the big three communicable diseases: tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and malarial infections.[REF] Viral Hepatitis can be caused by any of the known five hepatotropic viruses, namely Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis D Virus (HDV), and Hepatitis E Virus (HEV).[REF] Based on the 2017 global Hepatitis report, a large number of individuals do not have access to screening and treatment for Hepatitis, consequently leading to Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) and cancer mortality due to Hepatitis.[REF] The World Health Organization (WHO) is urging countries to take quick action to increase the knowledge, diagnosis/testing, and treatment services for Hepatitis. According to a WHO report, one in twenty individuals are living with viral Hepatitis.HAV and HEV are enterically transmitted pathogens that produce sporadic infections as well as outbreaks of Acute Viral Hepatitis (AVH).[REF] HAV is a single-stranded RNA virus and it is mostly transmitted through the fecal-oral pathway.[REF] In India, HAV infection is common among children, and it generally leads to mild anicteric Hepatitis. The majority of children under the age of two (85%) and nearly half of those aged two to five years (50%) have nonspecific symptoms and are usually anicteric.[REF] HAV infection disease severity increases with the patient's age and the prevalence of existing chronic liver diseases.[REF]Chronic HBV affects 240 million persons worldwide and chronic HCV affects 130–150 million.[REF] Chronic Hepatitis affects approximately 400 million individuals worldwide, with the Asia-Pacific area serving as the hub of the epidemic.[REF] HBV and HCV are mainly transmitted through the parenteral route and are known to cause chronic Hepatitis, which can progress to serious consequences such as liver cirrhosis and HCC.[REF]HBV and HCV infections are more alike, which include distribution, hepatotropism, disease transmission, and at last leading to chronic infection which may end in liver cirrhosis and HCC.[REF] HBV and HCV infections do not have a standard of care due to the individual category of infected subjects so it is difficult to cure.[REF] Thus, studying the magnitude becomes a crucial component in prevention of HBV and HCV. The current review aimed to summarize the prevalence of viral Hepatitis in India from peer-reviewed articles published from February 2000 to February 2021.To study the overall prevalence of viral Hepatitis in India from peer-reviewed articles published from February 2000 to February 2021.To review the determinant factors of viral Hepatitis in the Indian region with the included article.Hepatitis: According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) “Hepatitis is an inflammatory disease of the liver caused.”Funnel plot: “A funnel plot is a simple scatter plot of the intervention effect estimates from individual studies against some measure of each study's size or precision.”[REF] Funnel plot is a graphical representation used to detect systematic heterogeneity and publication bias.",human
"The eye has been at the forefront of innovative genetic therapies due to its relative accessibility, ease of drug administration that precludes systemic administration of therapeutics as well as the availability of functional outcome measures for therapeutic evaluation. Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) in particular have been at the forefront of diseases for which gene therapies are currently being developed. There is an imperative need for therapies to cure IRDs: they have a world-wide prevalence of about 1 in 2000, affect more than two million people and cause significant economic as well as and psychological burden [REF]. While gene replacement therapy has proven to be a safe and effective therapy for IRDs, with an approved treatment for RPE-65-associated IRD now available and others being evaluated in clinical trial [REF], an unmet therapeutic need remains for genes too large to fit into the 4.7 kB packaging constraints of an Adeno-associated virus (AAV) (e.g., ABCA4 or USH2A), the gold standard delivery vehicle for most gene replacement therapies, or genes that are expressed as multiple isoforms in the human retina (e.g., CRB1) [REF].RNA therapeutics work by reversibly changing the transcriptomic sequence without inducing permanent genomic changes, thus eschewing the risk of udesired, permanent genomic off-target effects of DNA editing techniques [REF]. RNA therapeutics can broadly be classified into antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), RNA interference (RNAi) and RNA editing therapies. ASOs are currently under clinical investigation for treatment of several IRDs, such as CEP290- and USH2A-associated IRDs [REF]. RNAi therapeutics for IRDs are being developed in preclinical stages with the primary therapeutic target of autosomal dominant RP (adRP), where a dual RNAi suppression strategy using artificial mirtrons, atypical RNA interference effectors spliced from transcripts as short introns, is coupled with a gene replacement strategy [REF]. For a comprehensive review on RNA therapeutics and their use in the eye the review by Kumar et al. (2022) is recommended. The third RNA therapeutic is RNA editing, which is derived from an essential post-transcriptional modification in humans. The most common form of RNA editing in humans involves the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) at the C6 position (A-to-I editing) by a family of enzymes aptly named Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADARs) [REF]. The catalytically active ADAR enzymes, ADAR1 and ADAR2, share a C-terminal deaminase domain (ADARDD) and have multiple double stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD), with which they bind to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and edit tens of thousands to millions of sites in the human transcriptome [REF]. When A-to-I deamination takes place in coding sequences, inosine is biochemically read as guanine by the translational and splicing machinery due to their structural similarity and inosine is paired with cytosine during translation [REF]. While only the minority of A-to-I editing takes place in coding sequences, it is a powerful and essential tool for proteome diversification, particularly in neurons, where A-to-I editing mediated protein recoding modulates receptor and ion channel properties [REF]. RNA editing harnesses ADAR’s recoding ability and uses it as a programmable tool to correct pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs).Therapeutic RNA editing can broadly be divided into approaches utilising exogenous or endogenous ADAR as catalytically active deamination effectors. The first strategy facilitates editing by overexpression of the either full-length ADAR protein or, more commonly, overexpression of the catalytically active deaminase domain fused to an intermediate RNA binding protein such as deactivated Cas13b (dCas13b) [REF]. The second strategy aims to harness the cell’s native, endogenously expressed ADAR enzymes and recruit these for deamination. Both exogenous and endogenous ADAR editing approaches require a programmable guide RNA (gRNA) that is antisense to the target sequence and marks the target adenosine with an A-C mismatch. The gRNA and the target RNA sequence create a dsRNA that serves as a substrate for the ADAR deamination. For all exogenous ADAR approaches harnessing an intermediate binding protein, the gRNA carries a recruitment sequence that binds the intermediary protein. For approaches harnessing the endogenous ADAR or recruiting an exogenously expressed full-length ADAR, the gRNA either carries an ADAR recruitment sequence or simply relies on the dsRNA structure to recruit ADAR. Like other genome editing approaches, the central challenge is to design a system that achieves deamination with high on-target editing efficiency and specificity for the target adenosine, while minimising bystander and transcriptome-wide off-target edits. RNA editing with exogeneous ADAR has exhibited high on-target editing efficiency but has been hampered with high transcriptome-wide off-target editing. Therapeutic endogenous ADAR RNA editing has up until now been unable to compete with exogenous RNA editing due to low on-target efficiency. However, due to exciting developments in the endogenous RNA editing field which succeed in stabilising the gRNA by circularisation or chemical modification, endogenous ADAR editing might be approaching viability in an in vivo, therapeutic clinical setting. Whether this is relevant for ocular gene editing will depend on the ADAR-tissue expression as well as finding a suitable vehicle for delivery.To unlock the utility of ADARs as an RNA editing toolset, editing must be achieved with a high on-target efficiency and specificity which precludes off-target editing in the form of bystander editing and transcriptome-wide off-target editing. For editing with endogenous ADAR, the central challenges are improving on-target editing efficiency while limiting bystander editing in the gRNA:target RNA duplex, while the central challenge for exogenous ADAR editing is restricting promiscuous transcriptome-wide off target editing and achieving target specificity while retaining high on target editing rates.This review aims to give an outline of the history and recent developments in the field of RNA editing with endogenous ADARs and discuss the potential for treatment of IRDs. Since an understanding of the structure, function and role of ADAR enzymes is essential to understanding the design, challenges and strategies in the RNA editing field, an overview of ADAR enzymes will proceed the discussion on RNA editing with endogenous ADAR.Three members of the ADAR family are encoded in the mammalian genome and are highly conserved across species [REF]: ADAR1, ADAR2 and ADAR3 [REF]. ADAR1 is expressed as two separate isoforms: the full-length ADAR1p150, which is under the control of an interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) inducible promotor and the shorter ADAR1p110 isoform, which is constitutively expressed [REF]. ADARs from all characterised species have two main structural motifs: several double stranded RNA Binding Domains (dsRBD) and a single Deaminase Domain (DD) [REF]. Each dsRBD is approximately 65 amino acids (aa) in length and makes direct contact with dsRNA, recognising higher order structures within dsRNA. While dsRBDs bind perfectly matched duplex RNA, they can also bind imperfectly matched structures with bulges, hairpins, and mismatches with high affinity [REF]. Both ADAR1 isoforms and ADAR2 have a single deaminase domain (DD) at their carboxy (C-) terminus that form the enzyme’s catalytic centre. ADAR1 has unique Z-DNA binding domains (ZBD), that have been shown to bind both Z-DNA and Z-RNA, but whose function remains poorly understood [REF]. The full-length ADAR1p150 isoform contains two ZBDs, ZBD alpha and beta. ZBD alpha domain is only present in ADAR1p150, whereas the shorter ADAR1p110 only has one ZBD, Z beta, at its N-terminus. Both ADAR1 isoforms contain a Nuclear Localisation Signal (NLS) in the third dsRBD, but only ADAR1p150 contains a Nuclear Export Signal (NES), which is located in the ZBD alpha domain. ADAR2 contains a NLS, located toward the N-terminus. ADARp150 can shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, but in accordance with the NES found in its ZBD beta, ADAR1p150 is detected mainly in the cytoplasm [REF]. ADARp110 and ADAR2 are expressed predominantly in the nucleolus and nucleus [REF]. ADAR1p110 is expressed ubiquitously at high levels and is therefore responsible for the majority of editing activity, particularly in repetitive sequences in noncoding regions, which are particularly suited for dsRNA formation due to their inherent ability to base pair with themselves [REF]. While ADAR2 expression is ubiquitous, it is generally expressed at much lower levels than ADAR1. The exception to this is ADAR2 expression in the brain, bladder, and lung, which exhibit high levels of ADAR2 expression (The Human Protein Atlas1).Overview of structure and function of ADAR enzymes. (A) ADARp110 and ADAR2 are expressed predominantly in the nucleolus and nucleus, while ADAR1p150 is expressed in the cytoplasm. ADAR1p110 is expressed ubiquitously at high levels and is primarily responsible for editing in noncoding regions. ADAR1 expression is ubiquitous, whereas ADAR2 expression is highest in the brain, bladder, and lung. (B) ADAR enzymes hydrolytically deaminate Adenosine to Inosine in dsRNA. Inosine is biochemically read as Guanosine.The presence of ADAR2 and ADAR1 protein expression levels in the neuronal cell types of the retina has not yet been comprehensively analysed, but immunohistochemical evidence points toward ADAR2 expression in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer [REF]. It is also unclear how much protein ADAR protein expression is needed to induce therapeutic editing in the retina. In concordance with its expression profile, ADAR2’s protein recoding ability is particularly important in the neuronal system [REF]. ADAR3 has a catalytically inactive deaminase domain, its expression is restricted to the brain and is thought play an inhibitory role of RNA editing by the catalytically active ADARs [REF]. Due to its lack of A-to-I editing, it will not be the focus of this review.In general, ADARs mediate A-to-I editing in both coding regions, where editing can lead to proteome diversification through codon changes and induction of alternative splicing, and in non-coding regions, where one of the many functions comprises the modulation of the innate immune response [REF]. Certain transcript targets are edited exclusively by ADAR1 or ADAR2, whereas other sites can be edited by both (Nishikura, 2016, tables 1 and 2) [REF]. ADAR2 is the primary, but not the exclusive editor of protein coding sequences in mammals [REF]. Through this A-to-I mediated alterations of coding sequences and splicing sequences, ADARs are capable of creating different protein isoforms as well as altering and regulating gene expression at an RNA level. Two of the most well-characterised ADAR editing sites are the R/G and the Q/R site of the pre-mRNA encoding the subunits of the a-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA)- subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor (GRIA2, also known as GluR2) [REF]. Both ADAR1 and ADAR2 can edit the R/G site [REF] and this sequence is of particular importance in RNA editing because of its use as a physiological recruitment sequence for endogenous or full-length exogenous ADAR in the gRNA design [REF]. The ADAR dsRBDs bind to the pre-mRNA exon/intron border at the R/G site of the GluR2 receptor and results in highly specific ADAR-mediated editing at this site [REF]. Mouse knockout studies suggest that the GluR2 Q/R recoding site is ADAR2’s only essential target [REF], where it converts the CAG (Glutamine, Q) codon to CGG (arginine, R) at the Q/R site of the GRIA2 subunit. Adar2-null mice experience neuronal death due to an excess influx of calcium, which leads to frequent epileptic seizures and death several weeks after birth [REF]. This severe phenotype is fully rescued by introducing an allele containing an arginine (R) codon for the Q/R site in knockout mice. Other physiologically important mammalian genes that undergo recoding type editing that alters their protein function is the G-protein-coupled serotonin receptor 5-HTR2C, the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1 and the alpha-3 subunit of GABAA receptor [REF].While the recoding of proteins is of most interest when harnessing ADARs for a therapeutic design, it should be stated that vast majority of native A-to-I editing takes place in the non-coding region of the human genome such as introns, untranslated regions and non-coding RNA. Within the non-coding region, editing mostly takes place within mobile elements such as Alu [part of the class of short interspersed elements (SINE)] and long interspersed elements LINEs [REF]. ADAR1 is recognised as the primary editor of these sequences [REF]. Over 99% of the editing are detected in Alu repeats [REF], and similarly to the GluR2 motif, Alu elements have therefore been used as recruiting domains for endogenous ADAR [REF]. Perhaps the most prominent function of ADAR1 is the suppression of the activation of the innate immune response to endogenous ADAR [REF]. A-to-I editing of long, dsRNA motifs disrupt the perfect pairing of the repetitive RNA transcripts and hinders melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) binding and the downstream activation of the interferon induced innate immune response [REF]. Murine studies showed the embryonic lethality of Adar1 knockout mice, likely due to an aberrant interferon response and subsequent stress induced apoptosis of liver haematopoietic cells [REF]. In a human knockout neuronal progenitor cell line, MDA5 (dsRNA sensor)-dependent spontaneous interferon production, Protein kinase R (PKR) activation and cell death was observed [REF]. In humans, mutations in ADAR1 have been shown to cause type I interferonopathies such as Aicardi-Goutières-Syndrome [REF]. ADAR1 has many other important physiological functions, such as the altering of miRNA maturation and targeting as well as promoting genome diversification, and roles in human disease pathogenesis. For excellent reviews on this topic, as well the details of ADAR editing in coding and non-coding regions, refer to Nishikura, (2016) and Song et al., (2022).It has yet to be fully understood which characteristics determine whether an adenosine within dsRNA is deaminated, but it is thought that ADAR exhibits a sequence preference for particular RNA motifs [REF] while the secondary structure of the dsRNA substrate confers editing selectivity [REF].ADAR preferentially deaminates adenosines that occur in an A-C mismatch over those that occur as A-A or A-G mismatches or in an A-U pairing [REF]. These characteristics are commonly used to confer target specificity in a gRNA when an A-C mismatch is used to mark the adenosine. On the other hand, this preference is used to avoid bystander editing in a long, gRNA:targetRNA duplex by creating an A-to-G mismatch across from adenosines vulnerable to bystander edits [REF].Although ADARs do not exhibit strict sequence specificity, the enzymes do exhibit a preference for certain neighbouring nucleotides. The most pronounced preference is seen for the base flanking the 5′ end of the target adenosine. Here, both ADAR1 and ADAR2 favour Uridine (U) as a neighbouring base, followed by A, C and G (U > A > C > G). While the nature of the 3′ neighbouring base is thought to be less important, both ADARs prefer guanosine (G) at this position. More specifically, ADAR1 prefers G > C ≈ A > U and ADAR2 exhibits a slightly different order of preference: G > C > U ≈ A [REF]. These preferences make the stop codon RNA motif 5′-TAG-3′ a preferential editing site, whereas a particularly difficult RNA motif to edit would be one with a 5′ neighbouring G (5’-GAN-3′).Beyond sequence-specific preferences, ADAR-dsRNA interactions rely on the structure of the RNA substrate to confer target editing specificity. Generally, ADAR acts on both inter- and intramolecular dsRNA of >20 bp in length [REF]. Long (>100 bp), perfectly matched dsRNAs have been found to be non-selectively deaminated and exhibit an editing rate of 50–60%, whereas shorter dsRNA structures are edited more selectively (editing rate < 10%) indicating that the secondary structure of dsRNA may dictate editing site selectivity [REF]. In general, imperfectly paired dsRNA which is periodically interrupted with mismatches or loops of at least 6 bp exhibited a much more selective deamination than perfectly paired dsRNA, since internal loops are equivalent to helix termini for ADAR1 [REF]. The non-specific editing of long stretches of dsRNA might be explained by the presence of dsRBD which are thought to bind to dsRNA in a sequence independent manner [REF]. Thus, the insertion of internal loops into long stretches of dsRNA are another strategy to decrease the bystander deamination events that occur in particular when using guide RNAs with a long specificity domain within the dsRNA substrate and confer selectivity in dsRNA deamination [REF].Since many RNA strategies employ only the deaminase domain of ADAR, it is important to note that ADARDD alone also has targeting capacities [REF]. However, our understanding of the features controlling ADAR target recognition is incomplete and a precise prediction of editing sites is not currently possible [REF]. Once the target adenosine has been identified, a base-flipping mechanism enables the target adenosine to access the enzyme’s catalytic site. The ADAR base flipping loop approaches the RNA duplex from the minor groove side and flips the adenosine out of the RNA double helix and into the enzyme’s catalytic pocket, where the hydrolytic A-to-I deamination reaction takes place at the C6 position [REF]. Structural studies have revealed the presence of inositol hexakisphosphate (INsP6) in the enzyme core and close to the catalytic centre [REF]. The deaminase domain can function as an independent catalytic unit in the absence of the dsRBD. The space vacated by the reactive base is stabilised by the intercalation of the E488 amino acid side chain. This amino acid (among others) can be mutated to induce a hyperactive ADAR variant widely employed in RNA editing [REF].In a landmark study almost 30 years ago Woolf et al. showed the potential of endogenous ADAR recruitment for therapeutic RNA editing when they demonstrated A-to-I editing in a Xenopus embryo microinjected with a pre-assembled duplex consisting of a target RNA hybridised to a 52 nt long, unstructured gRNA [REF]. Two central hurdles of editing with endogenous ADAR, namely low on target efficiency and bystander edits, were already apparent in this landmark study.In a crucial step toward harnessing endogenous ADAR for RNA editing, Wettengel et al. (2017) designed a gRNA for the recruitment of full-length ADAR in 2017. While this strategy still required the overexpression of full-length ADAR2 under the strong CMV promotor, either from a plasmid or from an ADAR2 expressing cell line, it did not rely on an intermediary protein to mediate gRNA binding to ADAR and thus laid the groundwork for recruiting endogenous ADAR.The ADAR2-recruiting gRNA was composed of two parts: (1) an antisense sequence complementary to the target RNA substrate located at the 3′ end and (2) the R/G GluR2 ADAR-recruiting domain at the 5′ end. The antisense region contained a C mismatch opposite the target A, and the optimal length was determined to be 18–20 nt. Lengthening of the antisense region beyond this point led to declining editing rates as well as bystander edits.In an eGFP – reporter plasmid with a premature stop codon, on-target editing rates up to 50% were observed, which increased to 65% when the ADAR2 expression was integrated in the host genome of HEK293T cells under the CMV promotor. When editing components as well as ADAR2 were given at high concentrations, massive off target effects were seen and a gRNA lacking the R/G motif was able to elicit editing. These effects were decreased when lowering the concentrations of all transfected components, indicating that dosing is a central question when trying to achieve desired editing while lowering bystander edits. Furthermore, the authors showed editing of several endogenous housekeeping gene transcripts with editing rates ranging from 10 to 35% in 12 out of 13 target sites. Interestingly enough, one site in beta actin consistently achieved 0% editing, indicating the target variability in editing rates. Apart from showing editing of several endogenous housekeeping genes, a 10% correction of the PINK W437X nonsense mutation, a functional rescue of cellular phenotype was also shown. In a longitudinal analysis of editing, peak editing was observed at 48 h after transfection which remained constant until 72 h and then started to decline at 96 h.In a follow-up study by Heep et al. (2017) the same gRNA construct was shown to be able to recruit the two inducible as well as the constitutively expressed isoforms of ADAR1 in an ADAR1 expressing cell line. The gRNA design was also optimised to minimise auto-editing of adenine within the R/G GluR2 hairpin by substituting A/U base pairs with C/G base pairs.Using a very similar gRNA design to Wettengel et al. (2017) and Fukuda et al. (2017) also showed that an ADAR-recruiting gRNA (AD-gRNA) design based on the secondary structure of GluR2 (GRIA2) pre-mRNA, was capable of recruiting ADAR2 in an ADAR2 overexpressing cell line.In 2019, Katrekar et al. used the design of the ADAR-recruiting gRNA (named adRNA after ADAR-recruiting gRNA) described in Wettengel et al. (2017) and Fukuda et al. (2017) and compared delivery of the adRNA alone with the delivery of the adRNA together with full-length exogenous ADAR2 [both wild-type and hyperactive ADAR2 (E488Q)]. Several factors were varied: the length of the antisense region (20, 60, and 100 nt), the number of GluR2 recruiting domains (0, 1, and 2) as well as the position of the A-C mismatch. Several important observations were gleaned from this study: when elongating the adRNA antisense region to 60 bp or more, administration of the adRNA alone (without exogenous ADAR2 overexpression) resulted in editing an endogenously expressed RABA7 transcript in HEK293T cells through the recruitment of endogenous ADAR. Even when the GluR2 recruitment domains were removed from the adRNA, the adRNA elicited editing. An A-C mismatch placed at the centre of the antisense region exhibited the most effective editing. While the RNA editing through adRNA recruitment of endogenous ADAR exhibited a target editing efficiency lower than the RNA editing achieved with overexpressed wild type and hyperactive ADAR2 (E488Q), this was the first indication that endogenous ADAR was able to be recruited by an ADAR-recruiting gRNA, with and without the ADAR-recruiting domain R/G GluR2. These results held true in vivo, when different adRNA designs were tested on a G > A point mutation in a sparse fur ash (spfash) mouse model of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. One month after retroorbital injection adRNA alone resulted in low but significant RNA editing yields in the liver. Nevertheless, the highest edited fraction came from adRNA delivery together with the hyperactive ADAR2 mutations (E488Q) (4.6–33.8% RNA editing).Building on this work, Qu et al. developed LEAPER (leveraging endogenous ADAR for programmable editing of RNA), an endogenous ADAR-recruiting gRNA (arRNA), consisting of a long, single arRNA without ADAR-recruiting sequences or chemical modifications. During the optimisation of LEAPER, several design principles were established: similar to Katrekar et al. which required an adRNA of at least 60 bp for endogenous ADAR recruitment, a minimum length of at least 71 nt was required for efficient endogenous ADAR recruitment and subsequent editing. The length of the arRNA correlated positively with the target editing efficiency, with arRNA counting 111 and 151 nt being used in experiments in standard and primary cell lines. A mismatch position placed in the middle of the arRNA lead to the highest editing efficiency and the preferred 5′ neighbouring base was 5’U. The standard cell lines all lacked ADAR2 expression, indicating that ADAR1 was being recruited for editing. But in a knockout cell line, editing was rescued by the addition of ADAR2 as well as ADAR1 isoforms, indicating that LEAPER can recruit ADAR1 and ADAR2. In addition to a testing in a reporter plasmid assay, where arRNA achieved a target efficiency of approximately 13%, LEAPER was tested on an array of standard and primary cell lines, showing a wide range of target editing rates. The highest editing rates were shown in the primary bronchial epithelial cells targeting transcripts of the endogenous PPIB gene with editing rates >80%. When targeting this same transcript with lentiviral transduction in HEK293T cells, the editing rates dropped to 6% at 6 days post transduction. This efficiency increased to 20% when chemical modifications were introduced in the form of 2-O-methyl and phosphorothioate backbone modifications at either end of the arRNA. This highlights the wide range of editing rates in human primary cell lines, that are dependent on target sequence, delivery mechanism and endogenous ADAR expression in the target tissue.Due to the length of the antisense domain, As occurring in the target sequence were promiscuously deaminated, although the extent of this varied between targets. The highest bystander editing was seen in the KRAS gene transcript, where one-third of As were subject to bystander editing. In an attempt to curb this bystander editing, A to G mismatches were placed across from the potential target As. Clinical relevancy of LEAPER was shown by editing the tumour suppressor gene transcript TP53 as well as a nonsense mutation in the IUDA gene transcript in a primary cell line isolated from a Hurler syndrome patient. Editing rates were modest but nevertheless significant. Expression levels of targeted transcripts were monitored to rule out possible RNA interference (RNAi) effect of the arRNA.In the same year, Merkle et al. chemically modified their previously described [REF] ADAR2-recruiting gRNA to develop the ADAR-recruiting antisense oligonucleotide construct RESTORE (recruiting endogenous ADAR to specific transcripts for oligonucleotide-mediated RNA editing). Chemical modifications included selective phosphorothioate (PS) backbone stabilisation as well as 2’-O-methyl (2’-OMe) modifications and were intended to stabilise the gRNA and thus enable more efficient recruitment of endogenous ADAR without the need for lengthening the antisense domain subsequent increase of probability for bystander editing. The RESTORE construct consists of a short (20 or 40 nt), programmable antisense specificity domain with an invariant ADAR-recruitment domain based on the naturally occurring R/G motif of the GluR2 subunit, a well-characterised editing target for both ADAR1 and ADAR2 [REF]. While the genetically encoded gRNA described in Wettengel et al. (2017) was only able to recruit overexpressed ADAR, the heavily chemically modified ASO achieved significant editing rates in a range of standard and primary cell lines. RESTORE editing relied primarily/heavily on the ADARp150 isoform, since editing rates consistently improved by 2- or 3-fold after IFN-alpha treatment. The two best performing ASO versions, ASOv9.5 and ASOv25, both contained a fully chemically modified R/G GluR2 domain and a chemically modified antisense domain either 18 bp (ASOv9.5) or 40 bp (ASOv25) in length. In ASOv25, locked nucleic acids (LNA) were also included at the 3′ end of the antisense region. ASO9.5 showed 19 and 32% editing in a panel of human standard cells and human primary cell lines, respectively. Since editing relied heavily on ADARp150, IFN-alpha treatment increased these editing rates by 2- or 3-fold. In HeLa cells, ASOv25 showed higher editing of 26% without IFN-alpha and 43% with IFN-alpha. In primary cell lines with the 5′ stop codon of the endogenously expressed GAPDH as a target, editing levels ranged between 9 and 27%, with IFN alpha treatment increasing the target rate by two-fold. To illustrate therapeutic potential of RESTORE in vitro, the E342K missense mutation (PiZZ mutation) in the SERPINA gene, the most common cause for alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, was targeted. In a HeLa cell line expressing mutated SERPINA, cDNA editing rates of 10% were found without IFN-alpha, which increased to 20% with IFN-alpha treatment. When targeting the Tyr701 site in the 5′ UAU codon of the endogenous STAT1 in HeLa and primary cells, the highest editing yields were achieved with IFN-alpha induction and ranged from 20 to 30%. Neither LEAPER nor RESTORE were tested in vivo.In 2022, the Stafforst group further modified their original gRNA design and created CLUSTER, which retained the basic design principle of RESTORE, but achieved recruitment of endogenous ADAR without chemical modification. While the short, 20 nt antisense target specific domain as well as the invariant GluR2 recruitment domain remained, a series of single stranded RNA recruitment sequences (RS), a “cluster,” were added to the gRNA design. These RS bind to the target mRNA in various regions distal to the target site and distal to each other. These RS were 7–20 nt in length and could be flexibly chosen to exclude adenines that would otherwise be prone to bystander editing. The spacer regions between the RS binding sites were generally between 10 and 460 nt. The Stafforst group provides an open-source bioinformatics tool named recruitment cluster finder (RCF) to enable users a customised CLUSTER gRNA design. This strategy allowed for an increased binding affinity of the gRNA to the target sequence by adding RS while retaining the minimised chance of bystander editing that occurs when using a short specificity domain. Another important difference to RESTORE was the type of ADAR recruited. RESTORE preferentially recruited ADARp150 for editing and thus required IFN-alpha induction, but CLUSTER preferentially recruited the ubiquitously expressed ADARp110 and was also able to show recruitment of ADAR2. In contrast to LEAPER, CLUSTER was shown to benefit from the GluR2 ADAR-recruiting domain, but not from an extension of the specificity domain, so the specificity domain was kept at 20 nt to avoid extraneous bystander editing. At least 2 RS were needed to enable significant editing through the recruitment of endogenous ADAR. A luciferase reporter assay in HeLa cells was used for CLUSTER gRNA optimisation and testing of ADAR-specific recruitment. In HeLa cells using transfection of disease relevant transcripts and CLUSTER gRNA, editing yields between 3 and 61% without bystander edits were observed. When comparing CLUSTER to LEAPER, LEAPER outperformed CLUSTER by 20% on the BMPR target transcript, but CLUSTER yielded higher on target efficiencies for the mIDUA target transcript. In contrast to LEAPER, which showed high bystander editing rates up to 50%, CLUSTER did not elicit any detectable bystander edits. Coding and non-coding regions of endogenous transcripts with varying levels of expression were targeted in HEK293Ft cells and yielded on target rates of 19–44% without bystander editing. Encouragingly, editing efficiencies were similar for targets in the ORF and the 3’UTR. Fibroblasts taken from a Hurler patient were treated with CLUSTER gRNA in the form of chemically stabilised ASO. Editing rates of 24% were seen as well as an increase in IDUA enzyme activity. Off-target effects were investigated and found to be mainly located in repetitive Alu sequences with three novel exonic off target effects also observed. Of note, Adenovirus (AV) not AAV was used. Finally, two different CLUSTER designs were tested in wild-type C57/BL6 mice by co-delivering the dual luciferase reporter plasmid with a CLUSTER gRNA into the liver by hydrodynamic tail vein injection. Both gRNAs had a similar design with a 20 nt target specificity domain, an invariant GluR2 ADAR-recruiting sequence and 3 × RS. The length of the RS varied between the two constructs with the first having 15-, 13-, and 11 nt and the second gRNA having 20-, 15-, and 15 nt. 72 h post-injection, the first CLUSTER gRNA demonstrated 5% editing rate both in luminescence detection and Sanger sequencing while the second gRNA demonstrated a 10% editing rate.In 2022, two groups utilised the elegant method of RNA circularisation, developed by Litke and Jaffrey (2019) for therapeutic RNA delivery, and applied it to the ADAR-recruiting guide RNA with the idea of enabling a more stable, long-lasting gRNA expression and thus allowing for more efficient on-target editing. Litke based the Tornado (Twister-optimised RNA for durable overexpression) expression system on the endogenous mechanism of RNA circularization in a subset of intron-containing tRNAs, in which a tRNA specific endonuclease (TSEN) cleaves the intronic sequence, thus creating an exonic and intronic sequence that both have unique 5’hydroxy and 2′3’-cyclic phosphate ends. The nearly ubiquitous RNA ligase RtcB uses these unique 5′-and 3′-prime RNA ends to form a mature tRNA from the exonic sequence and circularises the intronic sequence. To produce ribozyme-assisted circular RNA (racRNA), a genetically encoded RNA sequence is flanked by autocatalytic twister ribozymes, which mimic processing by the endogenous TSEN and rapidly self-cleave to produce the unique 5′ and 3′ ends required for circularisation. A short, 19-nucleotide stem was created through RNA hybridisation and this stem placed the unique 5′ hydroxyl and 2′-3′ phosphate 3′ ends near each other to facilitate recognition and ligation by RtcB RNA ligase (Figure 2). Since ADAR-recruiting gRNA are usually transcribed from a polIII promoter such as U6, they do not have a 5′ prime cap and polyA tail, which makes them prone to rapid degradation by cellular exonucleases. The ring structure of circular RNA protects against exonuclease-mediated degradation and thus confers circular RNA with a high stability and consequently, a longer half-life [REF]. The ribozyme-assisted circularisation of RNA was harnessed by Yi et al. (2022) and Katrekar et al. (2022) with the hypothesis that increasing the half-life of the gRNA would lead to both an increased target efficiency as well as an increase in the editing duration.Circularisation of endogenous ADAR using autocatalytic twister ribozymes. Twister ribozymes rapidly self-cleave after transcription has occurred. RNA hybridization brings the unique 5’ and 3’ ends in close proximity for the ligation by the ubiquitously expressed RNA ligase RtbC.Yi et al. based their circularised ADAR-recruiting gRNA (circ-arRNA) on their previously described arRNA, LEAPER. Like in the original design, the target specific antisense region of LEPAER2.0 was 151 nt long, with the A-C mismatch placed at the centre of the sequence and no chemical modifications (Figure 3). To increase editing efficiencies for target sequences that showed no or even reduced benefit from the circ-arRNA (as was the case for MALAT1 and KRAS), a 50 nt, flexible polyAC linker (AC50) was included to increase the structural flexibility of the circ-arRNA. This circ-arRNA_AC50 showed increased editing efficiencies across all target sites. Editing efficiency was tested for 20 sites across 9 endogenous target genes in HEK293T cells. On average, editing efficiency increased by 2.3 for circ-arRNA and by 3.1 for cir-arRNA_AC50 across all target sites when compared to the linear arRNA LEAPER design. Sustained editing >13 days was shown when targeting the PPIA transcript in HEK293T cells via transfection. When transduced with AAV containing cir-arRNA, HEK293T, primary human hepatocyte cell line and cerebral organoids showed long term, sustained editing over 9 days, whereas the linear counterparts did not elicit significant editing. KRAS was one of two sites that exhibited initial editing efficiencies below that of linear arRNA. Yet over 7 days, editing rates with linear arRNA fell precipitously, while circ-arRNA exhibited continuous, stable editing, resulting in more efficient cumulative editing by circ-arRNA. Similarly, when targeting a reporter plasmid, the expression of arRNA was still detectable at high levels on day 21, whereas the linear arRNA counterpart was not detectable at day 21. While circ-arRNAs produced sustained, high editing efficiencies, they also exhibited pronounced bystander editing along the length of their antisense region. To reduce these bystander edits, the base flipping mechanism required to access ADARs catalytic centre was found to be hindered by deleting the Us opposite the adenosines prone to bystander editing. Different numbers of base deletions were strategically placed across the antisense regions. The cir-arRNA with 14 deletions in the antisense region as well as a flexible AC50 linker was shown to eliminate all bystander edits while retaining a 60% on-target editing efficiency across 8 target sites of the endogenous PPIA transcript. A cir-arRNA with a AC50 linker and 4 deletions opposite unwanted adenosines showed a 70% editing rate in a clinically relevant p53 nonsense mutation as well a restoration of full-length protein expression in p53−/− HEK293T cells. Of note, even though the editing rate of cir-arRNA_AC50 (not carrying deletions) was much higher than that of the construct with the deletions, the functional recovery was higher despite the lower editing rate, likely due to the low rate of bystander editing.Overview and comparison of the utilisation of circularised guide RNAs. Both circular gRNA are generated with the help of autocatalytically active twister ribozymes and vary in the length of their antisense domain. To improve target efficiency, the antisense region can be lengthened, or the “dose” of the gRNA increased, or the structure of the gRNA made more flexible by including a linker sequence. To decrease bystander editing, deletions, loops and A-G mismatches are used to disrupt perfectly paired gRNA. Circular gRNA can be delivered as DNA or RNA.To optimise their previously described adRNA, Katrekar et al. undertook a screening of linear adRNA of 100 and 200 nt with and without different ADAR-recruiting domains (GluR2 and Alu recruiting domains as well as the stabilising U6 + 27 cassette) as well as circular adRNA (cadRNA) in HEK293T cells using the 3’ UTR of the RABA7 transcript as a target. Once again, a positive correlation was seen between gRNA length and on-target editing efficiency, with a linear arRNA of 200 bp resulting in a 1.6-fold increase in on-target editing efficiency compared to the linear 100 bp adRNA counterpart. While addition of ADAR recruitment domains resulted in an only marginal increase in editing efficiency compared to the simple 100 bp linear guide RNA, addition of the stabilising U6 + 27 cassette resulted in a 2-fold increase in target editing and circularisation of the adRNA resulted in a 3.5-fold on-target editing improvement over the linear adRNA. ADAR1 recruitment was confirmed by knockdown of ADAR1 and concomitant abrogation of editing efficiency. To decrease bystander editing, Katrekar et al. employed two strategies (Figure 3): (1) A-G mismatches were introduced opposite all non-target adenosines (cadRNA.bulges) and (2) Introduction of 8 bp loops. While the cadRNA bulges eliminated bystander editing, they also led to a 50% drop in the on-target editing efficiency. By contrast, inclusion of 8 bp loops positioned 5 bp upstream and 30 bp downstream and every 15 bp after that along the antisense domain substantially reduced bystander editing while retaining on target efficiency. CadRNA was tested in vitro for its ability to target the coding sequence and 3’ UTR sequences of eight transcripts in HEK293T cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, robust editing up to 40% was shown in almost all target transcripts with the exception of TARBDP, which showed very little editing. The highest editing (90%) was shown when K562 cells were electroporated with genetically encoded cadRNA targeting the 3’UTR of the RABA7 transcript. These editing rates were similarly high (70% editing) when electroporating the cell line with in vitro transcribed RNA (IVT RNA).Both Yi et al. and Katrekar et al. investigated transcriptome-wide off-target editing of cadRNA/circ-arRNA and compared these with transcriptome- wide off-target editing of exogenously delivered ADARs. In Yi et al. 17 off-target transcriptome wide edits were seen using circ-arRNA, whereas overexpression of exogenous ADAR led to >16,000 transcriptome-wide off-target effects. Katrekar et al. found similar results: With enzyme overexpression 10^3–10^4 off targets edits were routinely observed, this decreased by 2–3-fold when using cadRNAs. Both groups noted cadRNA and circ-arRNA did not lead to a change in mRNA expression levels, indicating the there was no RNA interference mechanism at play.The in vivo results generated in both these studies were the first to show sustained editing of a disease-causing mutation using endogenous ADAR (Figure 4). Katrekar et al. first targeted the 3’UTR of the endogenous PCSK9 gene transcript in the liver of a wild-type C57BL6J mouse model. The best performing linear gRNA with a U6 + U27 cassette was compared with two different cadRNA, one encoding a single copy of the gRNA, while the other encoded two copies of the gRNA. After 2 weeks, the linear gRNA produced no editing, while the two cadRNA exhibited 11 and 38% editing, respectively. Eight weeks post-injection, the editing rates for the cadRNA containing two copies was even higher at 53%. Both Yi et al. and Katrekar et al. used the same mouse model of Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) Type I (Hurler syndrome) with the pathogenic nonsense variant W392X in the Idua gene to show transcript editing efficiency of cadRNA/circ-arRNA. Both studies used a genetically encoded cadRNA/circ-gRNA packaged in scAAV or AAV8, respectively, to target the liver. Yi et al. showed a 10% targeted editing rate at 4 weeks post injection while Katrekar et al. showed a 7–17% correction of the premature stop codon 2 weeks post-injection. On a protein level endpoint both studies detected a decrease in GAG accumulation (Katrekar et al. measured a 33% decrease) as an indirect marker for partial restoration of alpha-L-iduronidase activity (Figure 3).Summary of in-vivo results achieved with circularised and chemically stabilised gRNA. Two wild-type and one disease model were used to evaluate the in-vivo efficacy of endogenous ADAR recruitment. All studies showed sustained on-target editing over a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 weeks.In the first study demonstrating endogenous ADAR recruitment in a non-human primate (NHP) animal model, Monian et al. used fully chemically modified, short, 30 nt antisense oligonucleotides (AIMers) for endogenous ADAR recruitment. Optimisation of the chemical modifications of the AIMers showed that in addition to the selectively placed 2′ ribose modifications 2’deoxy-, 2’fluoro and 2’-O-methyl, a phosphorothioate (PS) backbone increased target editing activity. PS backbone chirality also influenced editing activity with left-handed (Sp) PS modifications increasing editing efficiency, while right-handed (Rp) PS chirality decreased editing efficiency. Modifications that preferentially enhanced ADAR1 rather than ADAR2 were selected since ADAR1 is expressed ubiquitously at higher levels than ADAR2 and thus may be considered a more therapeutically relevant recruitment target than ADAR2. In addition to optimising chemical modifications for editing activity, an N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) modification was included to improve AIMer delivery to hepatocytes via asialoglycoproteins receptor [REF]. The use of these short and chemically modified AIMers circumvented the need for packaging the gRNA into an ancillary delivery vehicle such as a lipid nanoparticle or AAV. For testing the optimised AIMers in vivo, three different, 30 nt GalNAc AIMers were used to target a UAG sequence in the 3’UTR of the ACTB transcripts in the liver of cynomolgus monkeys. Six animals were dosed with subcutaneous injections once a day for 5 days. Two days post final injection, all AIMers showed substantial editing ranging from 30 to 50%. At day 45 post injection, the editing persisted and ranged from 35 to 39% (Figure 4). While the editing rates of the initially best performing ADARs decreased over time, the editing rate of the AIMer with the lowest initial editing efficiency of 30% showed a small increase in editing efficiency to 34% post injection, highlighting the importance of gathering longitudinal editing data. No bystander editing or hepatotoxicity was observed and off-target editing at predicted sites was <5%. An overview of the different gRNA designs used to recruit native ADAR is given in Figure 5.Overview of the design and development of ADAR recruiting guide RNAs.The feasibility of targeting pre-mRNA with RNA editing has been investigated in several studies. Apart from determining which guide RNA is most effective, the ability to target the pre-mRNA would broaden the RNA editing scope to intronic and splice site mutations, which currently present important therapeutic targets in DNA editing and ASO therapy [REF]. Furthermore, it would expand RNA editing to target exonic mutations adjacent to splice donor and splice acceptor site, which have been shown to cause both missense and splicing defects [REF].Localisation of the components required for editing (endogenous ADAR and gRNA) is an important indication of the feasibility of pre-mRNA targeting. Both Yi et al. and Reautschnig et al. demonstrated gRNA localisation to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, albeit in different proportions. While Yi et al. found the circ-arRNA to localise to both cellular compartments in equal proportions, Reautschnig et al. found the CLUSTER 16p8 gRNA predominantly localised to the nucleus when transfected. These findings suggest that RNA editing takes place at least partially in the nucleus. The nuclear localisation of ADAR1p110 (and ADAR2) underscores the probability of this assumption. Reautschnig et al. compared the editing yields of a pre-mRNA gRNA to those of a gRNA targeting the mRNA in the coding sequence close to an exon/intron border of three endogenously expressed genes in HEK293FT cell lines. For the GUSB target transcript, there was no difference in editing rates between the two gRNAs. For the other two targets, GPI and NUP43, the pre-mRNA gRNA was found to be one-third and one half as effective as a gRNA targeting mature mRNA. The Wei group investigated pre-mRNA and mRNA gRNA targeting the coding sequence of in the IDUA transcript both in vitro and in vivo [REF]. In a primary fibroblast line of a patient with Hurler syndrome patient, the gRNA targeting the pre-mRNA outperformed the gRNA targeting the mature mRNA. The same held true when the two arRNA were electroporated into another primary fibroblast cell line of a patient with an IDUA mutation, where the arRNA targeting the pre-mRNA showed an editing rate of nearly 30%. When tested in vivo on the Idua W392X mouse model the circ-arRNA/pre-mRNA showed the same target efficiency of 10% as achieved with the circ-arRNA/mRNA. These results were confirmed when looking at IDUA enzyme activity and decrease in GAG accumulation, which both gRNA exhibited in equal measure. In a particularly interesting study, Katrekar et al. used a pre-mRNA targeting gRNA to correct a G > A point mutation located in the last nucleotide of exon 4 of the OTC gene transcript of the spfash mouse. Due to its location, the G > A mutation was shown to lead to the production of a mutant protein as well as missplicing by read-through of the splice donor site [REF]. A 4.6–8.2% correction in the pre-mRNA transcripts as well as a reduction in the incorrectly spliced product was observed. In the correctly spliced OTC mRNA, a high edited fraction (4.6–33.8%) was seen.For RNA therapeutics to be effective, achieving delivery to the target cell type is a critical step. Whereas RPE cells lend themselves to oligonucleotide uptake by having phagocytic and endocytic capabilities [REF], entry into photoreceptor cells is more challenging. As RNA structures are functional in the cytoplasm, direct delivery of RNA may be desirable as it avoids the need to overcome the nuclear membrane barrier. Such delivery of small RNA structures appears to be highly viable in the retina with transfer of antisense oligonucleotides (AON) proving very effective. Intravitreal delivery of an AON targeting the mouse Ush2a gene was detected in photoreceptor cells up to 259 days post-injection, which was associated with desired exon 12 skipping [REF]. Developed by ProQR, clinical trials are now ongoing to deliver an AON for skipping the human equivalent region, exon 13 (NCT05085964, NCT05176717, NCT05158296) following encouraging results from a similar AON therapeutic targeting the CEP290 gene [REF]. These data indicate that small RNA structures can be delivered safely to the vitreous and make their way to the photoreceptor cells where they appear to survive and maintain activity for many weeks. Other chemically modified small RNAs have also been developed and delivered in vivo by intravitreal injection with promising pan-retinal survival up to 9 days post-injection [REF]. ADAR-mediated RNA editing has been achieved with chemically modified short RNAs [REF] and though yet to be tested in the retina, the ProQR AON studies offer encouraging signs that translation to the eye may be viable.However, longer RNA structures may be necessary depending on the treatment strategy, for example, the LEAPER strategy [REF] uses RNA of 71–91 nucleotides to encourage ADAR recruitment. Delivery of longer RNA structures to the retina has been attempted in different ways. Chemically modified Cy5-labelled mRNA (for translation of GFP) was provided by subretinal or intravitreal injection into 6–7-week-old wild-type mice, either as naked RNA or with a lipofectamine-based transfection reagent [REF]. At 24 h post-injection, the mRNA delivered with the transfection reagent by subretinal injection was evident around the injection site in the RPE and photoreceptor cells. By 7 days, the Cy5-labelled mRNA was barely detectable, but GFP expression was apparent in the photoreceptor cells and RPE. No mRNA or GFP expression was evident in eyes that received the naked mRNA. The inclusion of the transfection reagent was also important for mRNA survival following intravitreal injection. At 7 days post-injection, the mRNA was predominantly evident in the ganglion cell layer with some detection in the inner nuclear layer. Sporadic signs of GFP expression were only apparent in the inner nuclear layer. Achieving any delivery of mRNA to the retina and in particular the photoreceptor cells is highly encouraging, but the timeframe of survival and subsequent expression levels are of some concern. RNA editing strategies will likely require sustained presence of the RNA therapeutic and whilst regular repeat treatments of the less invasive intravitreal injection may be viable, it would be preferable to achieve long-term efficacy from a single treatment.Lipid nanoparticles have been used to carry mRNA encoding reporter proteins (eGFP or mCherry) to the retina [REF]. Initial data indicated subretinal injection of these vectors enabled reporter expression in Müller glia and RPE cells at 24- and 72-h post-injection, which was much reduced by 120 h. Nanoparticles may therefore be an option for treatments targeting the RPE, but the timeframe of the expression profile is again of some concern and delivery of RNA using these carriers has yet to show efficacy in other cell types [REF].An alternative strategy may be to use nanoparticles to carry DNA that enables transcription of the required RNA structures. Whilst various nanoparticle forms provide efficient delivery to the RPE, the polyethylene glycol (PEG)-substituted polylysine (CK30PEG) nanoparticles appear to be a promising form for delivery of therapeutic DNA to photoreceptor cells [REF]. However, if a DNA element for long-term expression of the RNA structure is required then adeno-associated virus (AAV) is likely to be the vector of choice. Subretinal injection would provide targeted delivery and sustained transgene expression in the photoreceptor cells. Compared to other therapeutic transgenes, RNA structures for enabling endogenous ADAR-mediated editing are relatively short and therefore easy to package. A U6-expression cassette has been used to deliver ADAR-recruiting RNA for editing in mouse muscle [REF] and more recently, the circular ADAR-recruiting guide RNAs discussed previously in this review were packaged in AAV and delivered for editing in the liver [REF]. If native ADARs prove to be active in the photoreceptor cells, then delivery of ADAR-recruiting RNA structures may be most effectively provided by AAV.",human
"Natural organisms face many challenges, including environmental changes, food acquisition, and predator threats [REF]. Therefore, organisms have evolved biological materials with multifunctional properties beyond soft tissues [REF]. Biomaterials are complex hierarchical structures composed of inorganic hard- and organic soft-ordered phases bridging the macroscale and the nanoscale [REF]. All the multiscale structural models of the biomaterials evolved their innate functional features according to survival necessities [REF]. For example, the lamellar arrangement found in nacre and conch shells endows them with outstanding mechanical strength and toughness (Fig. 1) [REF]. The structure of enamel contains neatly arranged enamel pillars filled with the organic matrix. Such a structural design maintains striking similarities among numerous species (Fig. 1) [REF]. Bone, wood, and bamboo have coaxial layered structures [REF]. This structural arrangement exhibits not only excellent mechanical properties but also exceptional transport capabilities of matters (Fig. 1). Biological materials such as fish scales, lobster claws, and insect shells have a Bouligand-type structure (Fig. 1) [REF]. Fish scales are a natural body armor with remarkable mechanical properties [REF]. Lobster claws are a natural weapon with excellent impact resistance [REF]. The Bouligand-type collagen fibers of insect shells exhibit outstanding mechanical properties and distinct structural color features [REF]. Many species depend on physical characteristics besides mechanical ones to survive [REF]. For example, from an optical perspective, changes in the microstructure of a chameleon’s skin can manipulate the color of the natural light it reflects, thereby achieving concealment [REF]. The array structure of butterfly wings not only endows it with structural color but also exhibits excellent hydrophobicity [REF]. Regarding visual sensory organs, the compound eyes of insects provide them with a full range of visual capabilities (Fig. 1) [REF].Multiscale additive manufacturing technologies. The building blocks of natural materials are primarily composed of an organic matrix and inorganic precursors. Various biomicrostructures result in the formation of different biofunctional materials. For example, (i) the coaxial layered structure leads to the formation of bone, wood, and bamboo; (ii) the columnar microstructure contributes to the formation of enamel; (iii) the Bouligand-type structure yields biomaterials such as fish scales, lobster claws, and insect shells; (iv) an array structure can be found in insect compound eyes; and (v) the lamellar arrangement exists in nacre and conch shells. These natural microstructures inspire the development of additive manufacturing technologies, including self-assembling, layer-by-layer, freeze-casting, 3D printing, and other related techniques.Learning from nature can discover new ways to solve technical bottlenecks in industry and life [REF]. Natural biostructures are an origin of inspiration for designing next-generation structural materials with multifunctional properties [REF]. The formation process of biological materials involves multiple physiological and biochemical processes of cells, fine regulation of genes and proteins, and bottom-up self-assembly using environmental resources [REF]. This process occurs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it economically and environmentally friendly. By gaining insight from the structure and formation process of biological materials, it is possible to design and develop new materials with high performance under room temperature and pressure [REF].However, the complexity of natural structures far surpasses conventional design and fabrication techniques, which poses a marked challenge for applying biomimetic materials in engineering systems [REF]. Understanding the multilevel structure and formation process of biological materials reveals that organisms’ growth from small to large can be considered a natural additive manufacturing process directed by numerous multiscale biological processes that eventually yield the formation of a macroscopic shape conferring local heterogeneity [REF]. Therefore, to prepare and develop biologically inspired materials, exploration and learning must be conducted from multiple scales, such as nano, micro, and macro [REF]. However, designing and preparing structural materials with cross-scale properties using technical methods remains challenging in materials science and technology. Additive manufacturing, which includes self-assembling, layer-by-layer, freeze-casting, 3D printing, and other technologies, actively constructs structures, and its ability to build ordered microscale structures provides a feasible approach for developing new materials with bioinspired functions [REF]. However, in the process of imitating the formation of natural biological structures and developing new materials with anticipated properties, cross-scale structures, and functions using additive technology, 3 critical scientific bottlenecks must be overcome: (a) understanding the mechanism of the formation process and multiscale structure of natural biological materials, (b) controlling bioinspired additive manufacturing processes in constructing cross-scale structures, and (c) understanding the connection between the structure and functional application of new materials developed by bioinspired additive manufacturing.This review outlines current bioinspired multiscale additive manufacturing advancements for designing new multifunctional materials. The review is divided into 2 parts: (a) classification of typical biomaterial examples based on their microstructural characteristics, including lamellar arrangement, columnar alignment, coaxial layered arrangement, Bouligand structure, and array structure (their multiscale structures are summarized from molecular, nano, and micro to macro levels, alongside examples of the functionality endowed by these special biological structures), and (b) a summary of additive manufacturing technologies used to prepare biomimetic materials with targeted functions based on the classified multiscale structures of biomaterials. Finally, we discuss key mechanisms for developing new functional materials with cross-scale properties in multisystems through bioinspired additive manufacturing, current challenges, and prospects.",human
"Using educational technologies to mediate health professionals’ education process regarding health interventions expands access to information, eases the teaching-learning process, promotes knowledge dissemination and causes changes in health care, through devices that favor positive perspectives in the health standards[REF].In the Nursing education context, educational videos (EVs) have been widely used as a rich, interesting and complex tool that contributes to the promotion of education[REF]. When properly developed, EVs can serve as a solid foundation to support understanding and effective reflection. However, their production requires special precautions in relation to the structuring and organization of all the information. This educational tool is used in different ways in teaching-learning environments to present motivational concepts or experiences, convey information and other applications[REF].It is also noted that access to EVs, to be made available on digital platforms, contributes to reaching the target audience regardless of their geographic location and time, and enables Nursing professionals to update on the theme developed, with the possibility of positive repercussions on the assistance provided[REF].Several methods have been used for the development of educational videos (EVs) and three stages are generally adopted, namely: pre-production (preparation and validation of a script and storyboard), production (video recording and editing) and post-production (evaluation of the video by the target audience)[REF].When properly created and structured, following the methodological steps for their elaboration, EVs can become a powerful tool for building knowledge and improving the care practice. In addition to that, due to their potential as an appealing visual communication medium, EVs have aroused great interest in users[REF].A study whose objective was to validate a video script and storyboard for an educational intervention on Nursing care aimed at syphilis prevention and management showed that the educational material produced can contribute for Nursing professionals to better understand the issues that involved the occurrence, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of syphilis[REF].In addition to that, it provided users of health services with the choice of infection prevention methods, as well as with the perception of the benefits of self-care, with regard to changing behaviors and to safe sexual practices[REF]. Other studies[REF] showed that using videos contributed to advancing knowledge in Nursing and to acquiring practical skills by Nursing students and professionals, in addition to methodologically supporting the development of other EVs in the health area. In this context, studies that develop and validate EVs on different Nursing procedures are relevant both for education and for health care. This is because they allow Nursing professionals to incorporate validated educational technologies, such as videos, in order to promote permanent and continuing education[REF].Considering the methodological rigor required for the construction and elaboration of EVs, in some cases, the scientific production related to the theme has shown failures in fulfilling the methodological steps, which exerts negative impacts on the quality of the materials produced. In this sense, this review is justified by the contribution to Nursing professionals’ knowledge, through the presentation of diverse information about the methodologies used in the production of EVs. This approach aims at favoring the creation of safe and good quality educational materials, promoting the dissemination of scientific knowledge in the Nursing area.Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the diverse scientific evidence on the methodologies used by Nursing professionals in the production of educational videos.",human
"Schistosomiasis poses a serious public health problem and a social challenge affecting over 240 million people, the majority of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends praziquantel (PZQ) drug treatment through regular mass drug administration (MDA) accompanied by social mobilisation and health education and sensitisation. With social mobilisation and health education and sensitisation, there is bound to be increased demand for the PZQ, especially in the case of endemic communities. However, it is not clear where communities go for PZQ treatment in the absence of PZQ MDA. We explored the health-seeking behaviours regarding schistosomiasis treatment among communities along Lake Albert in Western Uganda when MDA had delayed, to inform a review of the implementation policy for the achievement of the WHO’s 2030 target of 75% coverage and uptake.Schistosomiasis is one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTD) that affect a significant proportion of the world’s population and is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa [REF]. Of all the species, Schistosoma mansoni (intestinal schistosomiasis) is the most common in Uganda [REF]. Current control and prevention measures primarily include preventive chemotherapy through mass drug administration (MDA) of PZQ for school-going children aged 5–14 years old and adults in certain situations, supplemented with improvement in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health education and sensitization, and snail control [REF]. The WHO categorizes schistosomiasis infection endemic areas into three levels: low for areas below 10%; moderate for those between 10 and 49%; and high for areas from 50% and above [REF]. The WHO further recommends that PZQ be administered at least once every 2 years, once a year, and twice a year for low-, moderate-, and high-endemic areas, respectively. Although it is hoped that these interventions can facilitate the achievement of the WHO’s target of 75% MDA coverage by 2030, in Uganda’s case, this is far from attainment. This is evidenced by low uptake among school-going children of 28.2% in 2011 to 48.9% in 2012 and among adult communities of 48.8% in 2016 [REF]. To ensure optimum outcomes and sustainability of PZQ uptake, there is a need to improve the MDA implementation strategy to realize increased drug uptake [REF]. Moreover, individuals who experience schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms must always seek PZQ treatment. Some of the signs and symptoms are skin rash, fever, head and body aches, breathing difficulties, diarrhoea and constipation, blood in the feces and swollen bellies [REF]. While liver fibrosis, intestinal ulcers, high blood pressure, stunted growth, cognitive impairment in children, and infertility in women appear in advanced stages but are difficult to diagnose [REF]. Most of these signs and symptoms show up at different stages after infection, some of which may trigger health-seeking by some community members.Health-seeking behaviour refers to “any activity undertaken by individuals who perceive themselves to have a health problem or to be ill, to find an appropriate remedy” [REF]. Studies conducted on health-seeking behaviour in many parts of the world have suggested that people seek treatment from either biomedical or traditional healthcare sources or both [REF]. In Southwest Ethiopia, for instance, most of the urban communities (80.7%) sought health services from modern sources in contrast to rural areas at 48.1% [REF]. Determinants of health-seeking also vary across space, time, and different population groups [REF]. Factors such as age, sex, education level, marital status, socioeconomic status, social networks, ethnic beliefs, and attitudes among others, have been found to influence the decisions to seek treatment from different sources [REF]. Disease-related factors, such as cause and type of illness, acute or chronic illness, and severe or trivial, also influence individuals’ health-seeking behaviour [REF]. The above findings suggest that different populations seek medication for certain illness conditions from various sources, but it is not clear whether this is the same for schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms.Studies on health-seeking regarding schistosomiasis treatment with PZQ have equally been conducted showing varied findings. For instance, in the Kiri community of Adamawa state- Nigeria, findings showed that a significant proportion of the participants usually bought drugs from the pharmacy or drug shops for schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms, whereas some got medication from herbalists and the majority never sought medication at all [REF]. Likewise in Tanzania, some participants sought medication for schistosomiasis treatment from both traditional and modern healthcare sources, although modern medicine was taken to be the most effective [REF]. Findings from studies in Eastern Uganda and Zanzibar, also showed that some participants did not receive PZQ drug treatment because either they were absent or unaware of the MDA program, were busy, feared side effects, or were pregnant [REF]. Similarly, in Ethiopia, a study on health-seeking for different NTDs showed that gender disparities in healthcare access and utilization were attributed to inequalities and power dynamics between men and women regarding the decision to seek treatment and its financing [REF]. Furthermore, studies show that people with biomedical knowledge of transmission and who perceive the symptoms as severe and acute, tend to seek treatment from modern sources [REF]. Lack of health workers and limited drug supplies have also been found to hinder the communities along Lake Victoria in Eastern Uganda from seeking treatment for schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms from a health facility [REF]. This finding was similar to studies in Brazil, the Philippines, and Nigeria where communities reported the following barriers to seeking treatment from a facility: the long distance from the nearest health facility, transport costs, poor road networks, and lack of health information [REF]. Whereas these studies have been conducted on health-seeking regarding the treatment of schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms, they have mainly focused on PZQ of MDA but did not provide an insight into where the populations turn to in the absence of the MDA program.In Uganda, the PZQ-MDA program has been implemented for almost 20 years now since it was first introduced in 2002 [REF]. The PZQ drugs are procured with support from development partners such as the schistosomiasis control initiative (SCI), ARISE and ASCEND, and are managed by the vector control division of the Ministry of Health and delivered to the districts [REF]. From the district, the vector control officers together with the district health team distribute them to the communities for VHTs to administer to adult community members and children of five years and above but not going to school, and for teachers to give to school-going children in schools [REF]. Before the MDA is implemented, social mobilisation (SM) and health education and sensitization are conducted by the Ministry of Health and donors, that is the development partners [REF]. Social mobilisation refers to activities conducted to influence a large number of individuals to take certain actions for the benefit of the community as a whole [REF]. In the context of MDA of PZQ, social mobilisation is those activities conducted by the district health team, VHTs, village chairpersons and the development partners, aimed at raising awareness and informing the target communities to participate in the program [REF]. Consequently, there has been a steady increase in the uptake of PZQ over the years [REF]. SM, in particular, is likely to lead to further increased demand for PZQ drugs. Moreover, endemic communities (especially those that live along the lake shores) that continue to engage in risky water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices [REF], must receive constant treatment to contain the spread of the disease and control morbidity levels. However, in the absence of MDA, it is not clear what such communities do when they need the PZQ. Understanding where the communities go for treatment and the reasons that drive their actions is important to inform policy recommendations for improved NTD control and ultimately eliminate the disease. To investigate this gap in current knowledge and understanding, we conducted a community-based qualitative study among communities in Western Uganda where MDA treatment had not been conducted for more than a year, to explore their health-seeking behaviour regarding schistosomiasis treatment. Specifically, we assessed (1) the communities’ sources of health care services for the treatment of schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms and, (2) the factors determining their choices of health-seeking regarding schistosomiasis-related signs and symptoms in the absence of the MDA program, to inform government and partners on how to improve praziquantel drug uptake.",human
"Beijing initiated the nation’s most comprehensive tobacco control program that adheres to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. This study aimed to identify a set of indicators for the scoping of an Health Impact Assessment (HIA) to assess this policy.China is the world’s biggest tobacco consumer, with an estimated consumption that exceeds that of the 39 countries combined [REF]. In 2018, there were more than 300 million smokers in China, with a smoking prevalence of 50.5% for men and 2.1% for women [REF]. According to estimates, 68.1% of the surveyed of nonsmokers in China experience SHS at least once each day [REF]. In China, smoking contributed to roughly 2 million fatalities in 2017 [REF]. China signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2005, and it went into effect in 2006. However, it has taken a little while to fulfill the responsibilities [REF]. Due to China’s tobacco monopoly, the FCTC has made only modest national progress [REF], and there is no smoking ban in public places [REF].As seen by the 21 cities in China that have passed smoke-free regulations in recent years, there is a rising bottom-up approach to tobacco control legislation in that country [REF], including Beijing. For the smoke-free Olympics, Beijing implemented a smoking ban in 11 different types of public spaces in 2008 [REF]. Beijing residents’ smoking rate has fallen by 1.5% as a result of the regulation [REF] however, the smoking phenomenon quickly returned to its previous status after the Olympics [REF]. Beijing implemented the Beijing Municipal Tobacco Control Regulation in June 2015, seven years later [REF]. The National Tobacco Tax Reform was started in May 2015 almost simultaneously [REF], which, by the middle of 2015, has created the Beijing comprehensive tobacco control policy. Six MPOWER measures, including Monitoring tobacco use, Protect people from tobacco smoking, Offer help to quit tobacco, Warning about the dangers of tobacco, Enforcing tobacco advertising, promotion & sponsorship, Raising taxes on tobacco, as recommended by WHO, make up Beijing’s comprehensive tobacco control policy. These include a ban on smoking in all indoor and four outdoor public places, a higher tobacco tax, a ban on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship, the establishment of a cessation support system, and a media campaign [REF]. In 2015, this was the nation’s most successful tobacco control strategy that followed the WHO standard.[REF]. The introduction of the 2015 policy have decreased the amount of cigarettes sold per person between 2015 and 2017 by 1388.2 sticks [REF]. From 2014 to 2017, there was a further decline in smoking prevalence and SHS exposure, with decreases of 20.3% and 25.6%, respectively [REF]. After the adoption of smoke control measures, 18,137 (26.7%) hospital admissions for stroke decreased [REF] and 5581 (17.5%) hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders [REF] were probably avoided in Beijing for 25 months.Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a combination of procedures, methods and tools by which a policy, program or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the health of a population, and the distribution of those effects within the population [REF]. HIA has been used extensively to assess the health impacts of major national policies and inform the policy making process [REF]. Basic steps for carrying out an HIA include screening, scoping, appraisal, reporting, and monitoring. Screening means making a quick mapping of whether there are potential linkages between the policy, program or project and health, and what different aspects of health they might affect. Scoping is intended to identify how the HIA will be carried out and to set the boundaries for the assessment. Appraisal means rapid or in-depth assessment of health impacts using available evidence – who will be affected, what is the baseline, what is the prediction, significance and mitigation. Reporting contains conclusions and recommendations to remove or mitigate negative impacts on health or to enhance positive impacts. Monitoring is where appropriate, to monitor actual impacts on health to enhance existing evidence. The existing scoping approach lace a clear, systematic method of selection of indicators in HIA [REF].Costa et al. applied the HIA methodology on the Portuguese law on Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control including indicators: rates of total and premature tobacco associated mortality, standardized mortality rate for all tobacco related diseases, the number of hospital admissions for ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, the number of patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking prevalence and the total number of smoking cessation consultations [REF]. Though it measured the change of some indicators after a tobacco control policy, the selection procedure of indicators was not mentioned and whether these indicators were comprehensive remained unknown. The WHO recommended four essential indicators [REF] for measuring the effect of the tobacco control legislation on “outcomes”: mortality, tobacco consumption, smoking prevalence and tobacco control policies. But it focused on outcome evaluation without including process evaluation and only four indicators were recommended. While Beijing’s tobacco control policy employed many local measures, such as tobacco control complaint, which generated a series of process indicators, so we feel there was a need for a comprehensive set of indicators to measure the impact of tobacco control policy in Beijing based on a scientific selection procedure.This study aimed to identify a set of indicators for the scoping of an HIA to assess Beijing’s comprehensive tobacco control policy and serve as a reference for future HIAs on tobacco control policy in China and perhaps in other developing countries. Results of HIA would be summarized in further publication.",human
"In recent years, rapid technological change has driven innovation in teaching strategies. Educators have combined digital technology with teaching methods and administrative strategies in ways that suit course goals, settings, and subject matter. With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools had to conduct distance education, over long periods and in repeated intermittent waves, in response to the unpredictable occurrence of new outbreaks. Several countries have adopted educational strategies that integrate newly-developed technology devices into courses, e.g., e-learning [REF], augmented reality [REF], virtual reality [REF], mixed reality [REF], educational chatbot [REF] or podcasting [REF]. Newly-developed technology was used, springing up throughout the field of education. These devices have overcome many challenges throughout the education field, especially nursing education. Nursing education courses implement many skills by students’ hands and training how to achieve critical thinking. Of these technologies, podcasts have emerged as a more easily accessible and engaging tool for supplementing educational content. Recently, they have become increasingly important learning tools [REF]. This mini-review article aims to overview the application of podcast technology and its current state in nursing education, which may shed light on possible future trends.Podcasts start back to the 1980s. At that time, digital technology was booming, leading radio to evolve into new, far-reaching forms. The term “podcast” is derived from “iPod” combined with “broadcast.” The term podcast was first coined by the journalist Ben Hammersly from The Guardian in a newspaper article in 2004 [REF]. The definition of a podcast is an audio frequency launching via the internet, a platform homepage, or certain online portals, e. g., iTunes, or YouTube [REF]. With the advent of social media and the cloud, podcasting featured a decentralized open architecture in which audio content is stored on the website and allows users to link and download via RSS, aka. “Rich Site Summary” (or “Real Simple Syndication”). RSS was first developed by Dan Libby and Ramanathan V. Guha at Netscape in 1999, and by adding the open RSS into Apple’s platform, the podcast was transformed into a digital medium for mass consumption with the first business models stemming from the United States since 2012 (“the second age of podcasting”) [REF]. The podcast is soon becoming popular in Western countries because of its convenient properties, such as fast delivery, lower cost, and exceptional user-friendliness [REF]. In addition to independent and amateur users, podcasts are also applied by educators for knowledge exchanges, e.g., the University of Oxford provided 254 free podcasts of entire courses and lessons on iTunes in 2013. Moreover, podcasts played an integral role in the continuing education development in emergency medicine and critical care [REF]. In Eastern countries, such as Taiwan, podcasting did not gain a high profile until 2020 when two local companies– SoundOn and Firstory– provided a high-quality Chinese interface with convenient access technology via smartphones, Bluetooth, and an internet discount package to create a suitable podcast development ecosystem [REF]. In 2000, Taiwan only had 300 podcasts in the market, but it increased to more than 870 new podcasts in the first half of 2020. Furthermore, the frequency of downloads in Taiwan’s podcasts in December 2020 was 446 times and even 579 times in January 2021 compared to Jan. 2020 [REF]. Currently, podcast programs have grown drastically and steadily month-to-month by about 67% in Taiwan since 2020. Taiwanese’s favorite podcast programs are related to entertainment, interests, and professional knowledge, subsequently. Society/culture, news/politics, and gossip topics were the general interests.In general, using podcasts can benefit educational pursuits. For example, podcasts reduced visual fatigue levels, enabled cyclical listening to heighten learning effectiveness, and improved the learning experience. According to the 2020 Edison Research survey, more than half of American audiences over 12 have the habit of listening to podcasts [REF]. Sixty percent of Taiwanese podcast listeners are of the average age of 23–32, among which nearly 95% have a college degree or above, and more than half of them have the habit of listening to podcasts [REF]. In Taiwan, the government promoted distance learning in higher education in the early 1990s [REF]. Taiwan is a global front-runner in digital technology development. Taiwanese nursing educators continually work with new technologies and innovations to apply various high-technology devices in nursing curriculum teaching strategies. However, podcasts were rarely used in healthcare-related education in Taiwan.",human
"Cervical cancer is one of the primary causes of gynecologic cancer and one of the most common and dangerous diseases for women, even though it can be treated if detected early. Cervical cancer is cancer that forms when cells on the cervix grow abnormally. There is a large volume of published studies utilizing the Pap smear test to detect pre-cancer in the uterine cervix [REF]. This type of cancer also remains one of the major public health challenges in several countries, especially countries with low and middle income, in terms of the financial aspect and logistical issues [REF]. Previous studies have reported that this cancer is the fourth most pervasive cancer type, which affects the life of many people worldwide [REF]. A large and growing body of literature has investigated the main cause of cervical cancer, stating that the long-lasting infection with a certain type of human papillomavirus (HPV) is passed from one person to another during sex. Non-human papillomavirus-associated adenocarcinomas (NHPVAs) are uncommon uterine cervix tumors with a deceptive appearance [REF].HPV will affect at least half of all sexually active persons at some point in their lives, but only a small percentage of women will develop cervical cancer. A pap smear test is used to detect cervical cancer in most cases and is known as a widely used screening procedure for cervical cancer. However, in recent years, practitioners have executed this evaluation manually, and the results are still controversial due to the accuracy of the diagnosis in detecting cervical cancer cells. In addition, the evaluation is done using the naked eye to determine the type of cervical cell. Furthermore, due to human error, this manual screening approach has a high rate of false-positive results [REF].However, far too little attention has been paid to the occurrence of cervical cancer that can be effectively reduced with preventive clinical management strategies, including vaccines and regular screening examinations [REF]. It has previously been observed that early diagnosis and classification of cervical lesions greatly boost the chance of successful treatments of patients [REF]. The main objective of the initial diagnosis and classification of cervical cancer is to reduce the mortality rate [REF]. This cancer can be successfully treated with earlier detection. The findings from existing research recognize the critical role played by the screening test in reducing the mortality rate caused by cervical cancer.In the past years, the Pap smear test has attracted much attention and is best known as a preventive approach used in the current medical field for detecting cervical cancer [REF]. This test demands a specialized and labor-intensive analysis of cytological preparations to trace potentially malignant cells from both the internal and external cervix surfaces. The cytopathologist analyzes the microscopic fields by screening for abnormal cells. The use of slide digital cytology imaging to increase cytological diagnosis accuracy could be beneficial. Recent evidence suggests that screening diseases, including cervical cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, using cell images from slide cells has been widely applied in recent years [REF]. However, poor image quality due to the uneven staining, complex backgrounds and overlapped cell clusters poses a greater challenge in nuclei segmentation [REF].In addition, biomedical signal processing, which entails analyzing, improving, and presenting pictures obtained via x-ray, ultrasound, MRI, and other methods, has the same concept as biomedical image processing. Image processing is a technique for performing operations on an image to improve or extract relevant information. It is one type of signal processing that processes an input of a picture and turns the output maybe into an image or characteristics/features associated with that image. Most recent attention has focused on image processing for classifying cervical cells. However, the nature of the accurate classification of Pap smear images is still in the improvement stage for better performance. It is still one of the challenging tasks in medical image processing, and its performance can be enhanced by extracting and selecting well-defined features and classifiers [REF]. Computer-assisted cervical cancer screening based on automated recognition of cervical cells offers the potential to minimize errors and increase the accuracy of the test when compared to manual screening. Traditional approaches rely heavily on cell segmentation accuracy and discriminative hand-crafted feature extraction [REF]. The purpose of this paper is to review recent research on automated detection methods available for the classification of cervical cancer.",human
"Any food product is instinctively scrutinized from a visual sense before deciding on purchasing or consumption. Color remains one of the most prominent visual cues contributing to the sensory aspect of foodstuff. There is significant research underscoring that the color of the food psychologically manipulates impelling the expectation of flavor generated in our brain before tasting the food [REF]. Consumers’ inclination to a particular food item is primarily visual specific to the color of the food which aids the consumers to predict the flavor and taste of the food. Interestingly, the perception of colour is deep-rooted and comes intuitively to human beings. For ages, the colour of fruits, vegetables, and meat has remained a determinant factor to distinguish raw from ripe and fresh from old or spoilt.The implication attached to colour to the food impacted the decision of worldwide food manufacturers to add in a variety of colour additives. The natural colorants derived from natural sources including plants and microbes were used to impart colour to food which was later replaced by synthetic colorants. Natural colorants are of two categories: organic (derived from living sources) and inorganic (gold, silver). Synthetic food colorants are chemicals processed from coal tar compounds and most of them contain dyes from the azo group [REF]. Moreover, natural identical man-made colours like riboflavin are also available [REF].A considerable hike in demand for packaged food fostered the massive use of food colorants. Henceforth, food colorants are added to every packaged and processed food product sold on the markets and almost every food item sold or manufactured by a food industry or a food selling outlet. Additionally, prepared food, e.g. in restaurants and other small food-selling outlets, contains food colouring agents to enhance their visual appeal to entice consumers. However, health hazards reported predominantly in children triggered by these fascinating synthetic colours need to be addressed [REF]. The colossal use of permitted and non-permitted food colorants, their toxicities, and associated adulterations are global concerns with varying gravity in different countries.India is considered a hub of food diversity in terms of the taste, smell, and colour of foods. The Indian food industry is gaining copious profit by marketing different geographical food styles. Bright attractive colours are the distinctiveness of Indian cuisines which aid the growth of the synthetic food colorant (SFC) industry [REF]. Additionally, the market for natural food colorants is on the rise due to an increase in health awareness among consumers [REF]. Besides the potential adverse health effects of SFCs, this hike led to another serious misbranding of natural colorants as synthetic. The misuse of the label ‘natural’ to attract consumers, the adulteration of natural colorants, and the lack of proper legal regulations in the processing of natural colours are serious issues demanding the imperative attention of authorities. There is a pressing need for proper labelling to distinguish the presence of natural colorants as well as to implement systematic standards on the processing and use of natural colorants. We have proposed a label for distinguishing the incorporation of natural colorants in food. Even though India is known for its multi-hued foods and natural resources of colours [REF], hardly a few studies have been published regarding the status of SFCs and natural colorants.Here we discuss the rapid growth of the Indian food colorant market, the reports on side effects, and the associated regulations in a comprehensive manner. Stringent regulations and government-funded research initiatives are required to tackle together this growing menace.",human
"Pediatric malnutrition is an ongoing burden in developing countries, particularly in Southern Asia, as compared with Latin America and the northern and western regions of Africa. It is globally known to be the most crucial risk factor for morbidity and mortality [REF]. Approximately 1.9 billion people in the Asia and Pacific region have limited access to a healthy diet, and the need to improve the diet quality, especially in children, is critical [REF]. However, when we assess the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of malnutrition, there should be a differentiation between nondisease-related malnutrition, also known as nonillness-related malnutrition, and disease-related or illness-related malnutrition [REF].The first type of malnutrition occurs in relation to environmental factors, such as limited food access or decreased dietary intake, which results in an imbalance relative to nutritional needs, thereby affecting growth, development, and other health aspects. Disease-related malnutrition may progress to acute or chronic disease and occurs because of an energy imbalance due to increased catabolism, decreased appetite, or increased energy losses, which also have detrimental effects on the outcomes [REF].Studies have clearly observed that disease-related malnutrition is associated with an increase in the length of stay of hospitalized children and additional financial burdens. A study in the Netherlands noted the annual medical costs for the country, estimated at €80 million for disease-related malnutrition, which equals 5.5% of the total hospital costs for these hospitalized children [REF]. Disease-related malnutrition, especially in pediatric chronic disease, requires long-term nutrition support to prevent long-term growth faltering and impaired development and also to prevent poor health-related quality of life [REF].The causes of malnutrition in children with chronic disease are multifactorial and are associated with the underlying disease; thus, careful assessment and management are required for chronic disease.This study observed the most common chronic diseases in children, such as congenital heart disease (CHD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic liver disease (CLD), and malignancy, in which their nutritional assessment may be complicated with preceding conditions such as feeding intolerance, water retention, peripheral edema, electrolyte disturbance, tumor masses, and decreases in bone density and fat mass [[REF], [REF], [REF], [REF]]. Indonesia, like other developing countries, also faces malnutrition associated with infectious diseases, such as diarrhea, AIDS, tuberculosis, and parasite infections. However, it is also observed that nutritional deficiency is known to be a predisposing factor for poor immune response, which makes children more susceptible to infection [REF]. The 3 factors undernutrition, infectious diseases, and immune systems form a simple cycle and make their roles interlinked [REF].Our research focused on chronic malnutrition in children with chronic diseases as mentioned above, which has received less attention in developing countries than that on malnutrition caused by infectious diseases. The combination of anthropometry assessment, clinical evaluation, observation on feeding tolerance, and biochemistry analysis should be conducted on a regular basis to ensure adequate nutrition. Lack of uniform definitions, heterogenous screening practices, and the failure to recognize nutrition as part of crucial patient care, however, have contributed to underrecognition of the prevalence of malnutrition in relation to its outcomes [REF]. In developing countries, assessment also depends on the availability of resources and regular monitoring to achieve good outcomes [REF].The initial concept of the study was derived from an expert meeting that consisted of 6 child health professionals, who contributed input and presented current challenges in managing malnutrition in chronically ill children. The purpose of this study was to review articles available on the measurement of malnutrition in pediatric chronic disease, especially in developing countries where resource limitations restrict identification of the nutritional status in pediatric chronic disease with complex conditions.",human
"Animal product industrialization has grown speedily, which also leads to development in the scale and scope of animal husbandry and breeding. The world's trade in animal products accounted for sixteen percent of the whole agri-food market. The value of animal products that were traded internationally went from €56 billion in 2000 to €152 billion (in current currency) in 2018 [REF]. Animal products are becoming more and more popular, so large-scale livestock farming and the food chains that support it have become very important. Research have been carried out to analyse a range of manufacturing factors that affect the quality of livestock products, as well as attempts, were made to optimize and boost the quality from all facets. As seen over the previous decade, following food security, it is mandatory to produce adequate safe food. With the increase in the demand for food needed, the threat to food safety is growing and wants extra attention [REF]. World Health Organization [REF] stated that the safeguarding of food quality and safety continuously poses new challenges for the food sector and science and millions of people suffer every year due to contaminated foods. The manufacturing of quality products is one of the features of food security, which dictate methodical research aimed at monitoring the existing quality regulations and standards, initially from grass and fodder production, their processing, animal feeding, animal products manufacturing, transportation, and up to the purchaser's basket. In industrialized countries, food safety is of major concern where consumers are more and more demanding superior quality and safer foods [REF]. The livestock products processing necessitates improvements in food quality and taste, cold chain transportation, and preservation. However, it is complicated to manage the quality of animal products in the traditional supply chain.At the same time, the nuisances raised include various types of food frauds, because fraudsters usually have a high level of cleverness and scientific knowledge, which makes it complicated to blame the perpetrators. Inadvertent contamination and residues in the end products occur repeatedly regardless of established high standards of hygiene and measures for quality assurance [REF]. The global economy faces massive social and economic loss due to mislabelled, misbranded, contaminated, and adulterated food products. The food supply chain, including on-farm rearing, processing, storage, shipping, and retail chain, can be contaminated by microorganisms due to improper management and pose a threat to the contamination of foods [REF]. An expected 600 million humans or nearly one of 10 people on the earth, fall unwell after consuming contaminated food products [REF]. Genomic testing and analysis are appropriate for the detection of meat speciation as well as a genetically modified ingredient or product [REF]. Based on Proteomics, animal species, technological processes or storage-dependent changes can be well understood. Metabolomics analyses, which are generally done by mass spectrometry (MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and iso-topolomics techniques are pertinent for indication of origin or means of manufacture [REF]. However, comparatively huge instrumentation and laboratory infrastructure is mandatory in these testing methods and is usually time-consuming as well as expensive even though some parameters can be rapidly tested on-site with the use of rapid test kits. Such defined analytical procedures are followed in the food industry in addition to that, implement by food regulations authorities [REF]. Additionally, the food regulation and safety standards authorities insist on complete traceability of foods from farm to fork. So far, the intermediates/supervisors can find a way to escape from these claims by manipulating transport documentation and bill invoices. In the international food trade system, the food recall-related work and supply chain reformation process during the food safety issues are shown to be expensive, time-ingesting, and very difficult.The food traceability system assembles, stores and transmits adequate history of livestock products, from the rearing of livestock on a farm up to the final product in the consumer's basket, at all stages inside the Food Supply Chain (FSC) in order to check the product for quality control as well as safety and can be traced forward and backward direction whenever required [REF]. Traceability is well thought-out as a new quality indicator in the food sector. Case-sensitive information storage and handling becomes mandatory in the food industry. Regulations are imposed by food authorities to allow monitoring and identification of all raw materials and substances utilized in food product preparation [REF]. These types of necessities have been incorporated by many FSC participants but a number of them still rely on a non-automated paper-based system. The food sector makes use of a traceability system for the enhancement of FSC and facilitates the traceback for food quality and safety [REF]. Traditional technologies for record-keeping can offer some solutions to the above issues, but that can't clear up all the issues. Therefore, it is strongly desired to introduce a new edge think tank as well as advanced technologies that create possibilities to solve product quality and supply chain problems.Traceability-driven FSC management in the food sector is likely to implement novel technology like the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT-associated applications provide up-to-date info about products as well as contamination facts in the course of production and distribution [REF]. IoT-enabled programs and applicable technology such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) possibly will revolutionize the food sector by digitizing facts to be queried and managed in real-time [REF]. The application of blockchain technology has recently experienced a remarkable boom. The capability of the blockchain era within the food sector is only starting to emerge with use cases across different regions, as shown via the growing number of studies, trials, research initiatives, and projects [REF]. Early researchers indicated that blockchain technology has to be used in the food sector for two reasons: a greater efficient food tracing system, which may promptly recognize a source of food infection while a food safety crisis happens; the second is to construct purchaser's faith in food safety via blockchain technology [REF]. Blockchain assures a tamper-proof, transparent, shared, and protected system that can allow an innovative business solution, in particular together with smart contracts [REF]. Blockchain is a virtual and distributed transaction ledger, maintained with the aid of multiple peer-to-peer computing machines that are not depending upon a trusted third party. Every transaction information file (block) is controlled thru unique software program systems that permit the records to be transmitted, processed, saved, and represented in human-readable form [REF]. This article explains blockchain technology, how it works with food safety and traceability systems, and how it has recently been included in the initiatives related to the livestock products sector.In 1982, David Chaum first time proposed a cryptographic concept similar to Blockchain technology [REF]. Haber and Stornetta [REF] further described tamper-proof time-stamping of digital documents or information on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks. Bayer et al. [REF] integrated Merkle trees in this design to improve efficiency by permitting numerous document certifications to be composed into one block.The concept of BCT was imagined by a person (or group of people) in 2008 using the name Satoshi Nakamoto to provide a digital and decentralized public transaction ledger of the crypto-currency: Bitcoin. Nakamoto stepped forward the layout by employing a Hash cash-like technique to timestamp blocks without the involvement of trusted central authorities or the financial sector. More than ten years have passed ever since the release of the virtual currency “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” by using the pseudonymous creator [REF]. Blockchain Technology is coming into recognition as the underlying digital infrastructure on which cryptocurrencies work. A cryptocurrency (e.g. Bitcoin) is a digital currency that can be used in the same way as international or national currency like the USD or Indian rupee. Throughout the last decade, Blockchain has passed through extensive progress, which is a digital currency (Blockchain 1.0), digital economy (Blockchain 2.0), and digital society (Blockchain 3.0).Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, and jointly verifiable ledger technology consisting of digital records called a block. Blockchain technology (BCT) particularly connects blocks thru cryptographic strategies (Fig. 1). Each data block consists of information regarding a particular system and creates virtual signatures to authenticate the validity of facts and links to the subsequent data block to form the main chain that is referred to as Blockchain [REF]. The information on a blockchain is immutable, which makes it a justifiable technology for industries like finance, cybersecurity, healthcare, food supply chain, and public services [REF]. The BCT makes use of a hash algorithm. The first block will act as the genesis block, additionally known as the block header. The beginner (genesis) block mainly includes the Hash, Mine difficulty; Nonce (number only used once) for mining data, Timestamp, and Merkle tree root records [REF]. Through this, the individual blocks are linked together and protected against manipulations. The blockchain is distributed on the computers of all subscribers (which act as a node) so that a “peer-to-peer network” is obtained. All participants (stakeholders) keep eye on the data and verify the data (consensus principle) to be added to the block at the same time by the addition of a timestamp to the document/information [REF]. The data on the block become tamperproof by the addition of a hash algorithm of the previous block and finally a new hash algorithm generated for that block. In this way, it forms a chain between block to block by hash algorithm. The hash procedure is a one-way code word technique and guarantees that the transaction data/information becomes tamperproof [REF]. If someone changes data/information on the block, it will automatically change the timestamp of the block so that the created hash value will change and data/information turns out to be invalid [REF]. The Merkle tree root on the blockchain accumulates the values of all nodes and these nodes contain the hash value for data/information present on blocks [REF].Fig. 1Blockchain formation.Fig. 1Blockchain formation.It refers to the regulation of permission to the digital register (ledger) and associated services. Based on reads and write control allowed to participants over block data, it is classified into three types.1)Public Blockchain: It enables everyone to access the network. Energy usage is high. Access to the block information is permitted for each node (Participant) on the blockchain network. These digital ledgers are distributed and freely accessible. The contract or transaction can be validated by any node, and information is made publicly available. The public blockchain is very anonymous when it comes to the participant's identity [REF]. The majority of cryptocurrencies commonly use it.2)Private Blockchain: A genuine invitation is a sole way for a participant to function as a node. Data privacy is ensured since only specific nodes on the system could access block data. It is not a completely decentralized system. The controller permits the nodes to view the data. It functions as a centralised, cryptographic-based organisational network, e.g. Multichain [REF]. It is applicable to sectors like the banking system, securities foundations, etc …3)Permissioned Blockchain: Access to over-block data is only permitted by the system's verified and trusted nodes who meet the required standards. The blockchain network is controlled by authorized members, each of whom has a specific role and defined authorization. It combines elements of both public and private blockchains. The likelihood of a Sybil attack is very low [REF]. Most of the industrial sectors like the health-care sector, food sector, education sector, real-estate sector, agricultural sector, etc … can have applicability of permissioned Blockchain [REF].Public Blockchain: It enables everyone to access the network.

Most of the industrial sectors like the health-care sector, food sector, education sector, real-estate sector, agricultural sector, etc … can have applicability of permissioned Blockchain [REF].Almost every transaction is distributed via the network of computing machinery that runs a blockchain procedure and is required to be authenticated by all computer nodes [REF]. The consensus algorithm (consensus mechanism) allows a network of computers (nodes) to work together aiming that all contributors obtain identical copies of the distributed database files. The “Proof of Work” (PoW) and “Proof of Stakes” (PoS) are mainly used consensus algorithms in blockchain technology.The well-known cryptocurrency: “Bitcoin” uses a “Proof of Work” (PoW) and it requires computer nodes (miners) to solve the difficulty level of mining before authenticating transactions and adding data/information to block in Blockchain [REF]. The first computer that is able to solve difficulty level (mathematical algorithm) as well as determine the hash and values authenticated by others, receives a number of bitcoins. This practice is repeated every 10 min [REF] (Bohme et al., 2015). The probability to solve mathematical algorithm increases with an increase in numbers and networks of computers (miners) and at the same time, miners guarantee the network's inaccessibility against hackers. The miners compete continuously for computer power that springing up a race between individual miners. So in the PoW mechanism, the requirement of hardware, computer power and energy is very high that making it costly [REF].As an alternative to this, another mechanism that got momentum is “Proof of Stake” (PoS) with the emergence of the Ethereum system in 2015, which is established on a different algorithm that does not necessitate special hardware equipment and higher computing power [REF]. In this mechanism, the validating power is given to individuals/bodies who possess coins within the system and place them “on stake” during transaction authorization. The computing nodes are identified as “validators” rather than “miners” [REF]. To validate blocks and generate hashes, participants are chosen at random, and the stake volume maintained determines the likelihood of the random selection. So this mechanism is resource-saving and secure [REF].Other consensus mechanism includes Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), Proof of Authority (PoA) [REF] Delegated Proof of Stakes, Steller Consensus Protocol, Ripple, Raft, Proof of Burn, Proof of Personhood, etc … as described in details by Mingxiao et al. [REF], Zubaydi et al. [REF] and Cachin and Vukolic [REF].There are numerous blockchain platforms (i.e Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger, Agnostic, BigChainDB, Corda, Credits, Multichain, Openchain, Quorum, Stellar and Symbiont Assembly, etc …) working on any one of the consensus mechanisms as described in detail by Cachin and Vukolic [REF]. Ethereum and Hyperledger are the most popular blockchain platforms experimented with or deployed in the groceries/agri-food supply chain and among these two, as time passed from the year 2015 to the year 2020, the Hyperledger blockchain took the lead over Ethereum [REF].Since the inception of blockchain technology, it has increased interest in its application to various sectors because of building up trust among stakeholders [REF]. In the start-up, it was intended to maintain and record financial transactions among participants, and with the technological improvements, the application area for BCT has been broad up internationally [REF]. Globally, more and more attention is given to research in this area by various organizations and countries. The revolutionizing changes applied in this technology have increased its application in digital data authentication and signature, controlling and storing organizational records, IPR and patent tracking and verification, tracing patient health records, enabling smart contracts, real estate management and record of ownership transfer, tracing products through the supply chain from producers to consumers [REF]. Szabo [REF] introduced the concept of smart contracts and now a day, it is vastly applied in this technology under the term Blockchain 2.0, which made tempering or censoring of data impossible. A contract is an agreement having a legal object entered into willingly by two or more bodies/parties. Each of them takes part to create one or more authorized obligations between them. A smart contract is a digitalized computer protocol that allows an agreement to be automatically executed with predefined conditions and authenticates as well as administers the performance of a contract or averts the need for a contractual clause [REF]. A frequently used example for simple understanding is the task of drinks vending machine, which dispense a predefined volume of drink after the required money is entered into the machine [REF]. The application of smart contracts in blockchain technology could be widely used in food supply chain (FSC) management systems to solve various food safety and traceability-related problems. The data interoperability, auditability, transparency, cost-reduction, tracing of products, authenticity and integrity are the important benefits of BCT application with smart contracts in the FSC traceability system [REF].The main area of application of BCT in the food sector concern to traceability system in the supply chain but along with this it can be also valuable for tracking and identification of the point of food fraud and authentication of food safety in the FSC management system from farm to fork. The BCT effectively promotes food safety and purchaser's reliance by timely and tamperproof sharing of data of product just like batch number, location and date of production, food safety certification, real-time hygienic and sanitary condition of production site [REF]. In FSC the food passes through multiple locations starting from production, processing, transportation, distribution, and retail store up to the consumer. The involvement of intermediators can make the food transactions vulnerable to food fraud and costly in above said supply chain [REF] because of improper maintenance of all records about food products from farm to fork. So till date, the current system of FSC is inefficient and unreliable [REF]. The use of various kinds of sensors and digital technologies (i.e. RFID tags, NFC, Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) systems, mechanical and biological sensors, time-temperature indicators, smartphones, digital signatures, etc …) [REF] can produce real-time information about environmental, production, processing, packaging, storage, transportation and distribution condition of food products. All real-time data records can be transferred to blocks using BCT and smart contracts after being verified and validated by all participants using a consensus process. This serves as an immutable way to deposit data records that are accepted by all participant parties [REF]. The smart contracts in this system can be executed for management of food safety standards, food quality certifications, application of HACCP, Good Agricultural Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices and other standards as and when required at various stages of food transactions [REF], [REF], [REF]. If the required procedure and standards from production to the consumer's basket do not meet, the smart contract will automatically dismiss the food supply process and information is not allowed to enter in Blockchain [REF]. At last, all the information about the product from production to retail store can be available to the consumer by scanning a QR code labelled on the product which increases the consumer's trust and is also useful to manage food quality and safety from farm to fork. The participant parties of the food chain include producers, processors, logistic suppliers, retailers and purchasers. Each one act as a node and every node can see the information on the public service platform without knowing the private details of the parties/bodies [REF]. Each participant's private details can be stored in a permissioned chain whereas the data which should be released is stored in a public chain. This permit parties to access, write and confirm with each other and safeguard participants' privacy to the maximum level possible [REF].The production, processing and handling of foods in a hygienic way to safeguard human health is known as food safety. The growing international trade of foods increases the difficulty to maintain food quality assurance and safety [REF]. Globally, animal food safety and quality are of main concern. The safety issues in animal products are mainly due to the use of hormones, antibiotic residues, adulteration, zoonosis, microbial contamination as well as from animal feed with pesticides or herbicides residues, heavy metals and other contamination [REF]. Drinking contaminated water can cause illness in animals which require veterinary medicines to treat their illness so along with the safety of animal feed, the provision of safe and potable drinking water is also necessary.The handling of animals and temperature directly affect the safety of animal products mainly meat products. Stress due to fluctuation in environmental temperature during the transportation of animals to the slaughterhouse can cause quality problems in meat products after slaughter [REF]. Illness in animals before slaughter, Improper handling of carcass or meat products during processing and packaging leads to microbial contamination and temperature fluctuation increases the microbial load, which causes abnormality in meat products quality [REF]. In the same way, the production, collection, transportation, and processing of milk and milk products also require proper attention. Therefore, real-time monitoring and recording of temperature handling of animals and relative humidity from farm to fork are necessary to support products safety and quality as well as to improve the management, productivity and profitability which can be possible by application of BCT along with sensors as described earlier [REF]. So in the FSC, the stage where standards criteria of process and regulatory and production standards do not match, the parties are informed in a real-time manner to correct the process and further supply chain can be stopped or recall of that particularly affected batch of animal products can be carried out very fast and easily in a time-saving and cost-effective manner that leads to maintaining buyer's faith in safety and quality of product and trust in the company [REF]. The feed provided to animals, administration of veterinary drugs as well as antibiotics and species, breeds and quantity of animals raised and managed by farmers are also necessary to record on the blockchain. As the data on BCT is verified by a consensus mechanism, if the inconsistent and improper or illegal amount of drugs, hormones and antibiotics used by farmers, the smart contract automatically terminates the transaction and data is not documented in Blockchain [REF]. The recording of genomic and proteomic information of farm animals on the blockchain can provide immutable data about whether the animal products produced are from the same animals or different [REF] leads to quality assurance and food safety. Food industries can minimize food frauds by real-time detection and relating outbreaks to their definite cause [REF]. In this way, the distributed ledger technique like blockchain technology permits more determined and feasible control of food safety and quality.Locating product-related information starting from animal rearing up to product dispatch in a retail store in FSC is known as food traceability. It includes data for animal breeding, nutrition, health, production and management on farms, processing and preservation related data of product, packaging and logistic information and finally up to the consumer's basket [REF]. Now a day, the proof of food integrity and transparency is also inquired about by stakeholders as well as purchasers. The real-time tracking of all data can increase the speed of the supply chain and decrease food fraud in all stages of the product's life cycle. But in current, online and centralized monitoring or offline and paper-based traceability systems, data infringement can be possible by supervisors or intermediators of supply chain management. BCT offers an immutable and consensus mechanism-driven online data recording system in the supply chain at all stages of food production which makes the traceability system concrete, irreversible and unchallengeable by any means [REF]. BCT-driven food traceability can be simply illustrated as a three-layer flow (Fig. 2) where the physical flow layer is for the physical food supply chain in which food products go on their way from producer to purchaser. The second flow layer is for a digital record system in which data recording of the physical flow layer is going on simultaneously with the use of various types of sensors, RFID, QR code and other digital technologies as described earlier. The third flow layer is a digital blockchain infrastructure network in which employing a smart contract, the data recorded in the second flow layer is verified by all participant bodies/parties with a consensus algorithm and forms a virtual data block at every stage of the supply chain. This flow layer also follows the physical flow layer and forms a chain of digital data blocks [REF]. If any person tries to hack or change information recorded, the hash value of that particular block changes and that does not permit the altered value to enter into that particular blockchain which means it is an immutable record-keeping platform. The food product on its way to the consumer's basket passes through various points of production and at every point some data is recorded to the blockchain as described below.A.Stockmen: They provide information about the rearing of livestock on a farm, Data in details recorded on blockchain about feeding, breeding, health, production and management practices followed by them and tag number and ownership details of all livestock whether any animal is directly purchased from the market or not. The hygienic and environmental conditions of farm and animal welfare practices can also be recorded.B.Manufacturing parties: The information about plant practices, handling of livestock, the hygienic and sanitary condition of a plant, standards and regulations maintained at the plant, equipment availability, utilization and disinfection procedure followed at the plant, data regarding processing methods, use of packaging technologies, labelling details of every batch of product, etc. The data about the financial transaction between manufacturer and stockmen as well as between a manufacturer and logistic supplier is also recorded on a block.C.Logistic supplier (Distributors): Data regarding transportation method used, shipping details, transit period, and real-time data recorded about temperature, humidity and other product environmental conditions during transportation period. The financial deals between logistic suppliers and authorized dealers should also be recorded.D.Dealers (Wholesalers): Real-time data about storage condition (i.e. time, temperature and humidity) of product up to its supply to retailers. Transportation details can also be recorded. The monetary transaction between dealers and retailers is also recorded.E.Retailers: Data about the current stock of each product, storage details, expiry date, and period at the store up to the consumer's purchase is recorded on the Blockchain.F.Buyer: The buyer scan the QR code labelled on the product to get all the details of the product starting from farm to purchase with the use of an internet connection to have an idea about the quality, safety and reliability of the product purchase.Fig. 2Blockchain technology driven food traceability.Fig. 2Stockmen: They provide information about the rearing of livestock on a farm, Data in details recorded on blockchain about feeding, breeding, health, production and management practices followed by them and tag number and ownership details of all livestock whether any animal is directly purchased from the market or not.

The possible advantages of blockchain technology in food safety and traceability are briefly illustrated in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Benefits of Blockchain technology in food safety and traceability.Fig. 3Benefits of Blockchain technology in food safety and traceability.Soon after the inception and promotion of BCT, it started to be used in supply chain management systems and there are so many shreds of evidence that prove its beneficial application [REF]. In global supply chain management, this technology is predicted to grow at an annual growth rate of 87% and escalate from $45 million in 2018 to $3314.6 million by 2023 [REF].Globally, a number of large animal products manufacturing food enterprises have already started to incorporate BCT in their food supply chain. First time ever in 2016, the use of BCT in the animal products supply chain was initiated by U.S.-based retailer company Walmart to monitor pork products in China and produce imported to the U.S. via Latin America [REF] (Insights, 2017). It has resulted that the tracing of pork products on their route to the U.S. takes a few minutes related to several days taken in past and also provides all the details of pork from farm to Walmart retail store in the U.S. [REF]. IBM launched its blockchain technology using a software system namely “IBM Food Trust” and it was started to be applied by many big grocery/food companies like Walmart, Nestle and Unilever [REF]. This type of large food sector entities are also involved their suppliers to practice blockchain in their supply of raw materials to the company. The cold-chain monitoring in the supply chain was developed by ZetoChain using the Internet of Things. It was stated that cold-chain problems are identified in real-time and the responsible parties are informed quickly for fast action on the issue. The Zeto tags can be scanned by the purchaser to locate product history [REF]. In the pilot project carried out in 2016 by U.K.-based tech start-up “Provenance”. The company tested “Tuna” fishing and supply to traders, processors, brands, and supermarkets on a blockchain platform. This digital identity also traces the audit info that verifies that fish were caught legitimately and sustainably [REF].Blockchain-based tracing of turkeys from farms to their shopper's stores was developed by Cargill Inc. [REF]. In 2017, the Chinese e-commerce company Jingdong (JD.com) deployed Hyperledger Fabric – an open-source blockchain platform-based supply chain first time in partnership with Kerchin, an Inner Mongolian-based beef manufacturer [REF] where the purchaser can find the history like animals used, nutrition info, food safety test reports and slaughtering related information. In 2018, the primary emphasis of the company is to monitor beef supply from Australia and so JD.com declared a plan to adopt BCT for its meat supply chain [REF]. Similarly, Alibaba, another China-based e-commerce giant, announced a trial program to track global food consignments sold to China, on its online marketplace T-Mall, which were supplied by Australian healthcare supply firm Blackmores and New Zealand dairy product maker Fonterra [REF]. A research project was conducted in Australia to track beef production from origin to consumption with the use of BCT based “BeefLedger” platform [REF] which can be useful to reduce the time required to trace infected stock which ultimately improves efficiency and food safety. BCT-based trading of meat subscription boxes was deployed by The Grass Roots Farmers' Cooperative in 2017 to inform consumers in a trustworthy way about the rearing conditions of their animals. In the pilot project performed in San Francisco, where cartoons of chicken distributed were labelled with QR codes that link to the story of the meat they contain [REF]. Intel presented the Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain platform's operating model for seafood supply chain traceability in 2017 [REF].The blockchain-based Pacific Islands' tuna fishing traceability project was announced by World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) in 2018. Through this, fishermen can register their fishing on a network platform by RFID and fish scanning which eliminate illegal activities [REF]. The French retailer company, Carrefour announced a plan in 2018 to adopt BCT-directed food traceability for its own branded Filiere Qualite Carrefour (FQC) products like salmon fish, eggs, tomato, chicken, fresh milk, cheese, etc … and planned to expand its application to all FQC products by 2022 as well as indicated that BCT can be a good solution to reduce uncertainty about quality and ingredients by access to detailed information of food product [REF]. In a report about Blockchain's use in the Irish beef supply chain, the American company Deloitte said that smart farming technologies like smart feeding equipment and cow collars could share data with Blockchain to shed light on the cows' diet. Through the use of this technology, we will be able to track the whereabouts of all Irish beef that changes hands. In addition to increasing openness, this action reflects Ireland's dedication to beef safety and quality. The use of smart contracts in trade finance has the potential to boost productivity and cut costs for international trade. Using their smartphones, customers can scan a QR code that provides in-depth information on the product's path to the shelf [REF]. In 2018, a pilot project was deployed by “Perutnina Ptuj” - the largest poultry producer in South-eastern Europe, to provide trustworthy info to their consumers about the rearing condition of poultry, in partnership with OriginTrail: A BCT provider [REF]. In 2019, U.S.-based Bumble Bee foods adopted a seafood traceability system functioning on a blockchain platform in collaboration with German tech company SAP. In this system, a consumer can scan a QR code to access info like products' origins, the size of the catch, the point of capture, shipping history, and trade certification [REF]. To build up a shrimp supply chain and fortify customer trust in the product, Walmart Inc. announced a pilot project in 2019 for end-to-end shrimp traceability from the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh to the U.S. [REF]. Topco Associates, LLC, a leading U.S. food cooperative, employed Envisible's Wholechain traceability technology in 2019 to help member-owner supermarkets trace and highlight seafood origins [REF]. Bumblauskas et al. [REF] have described a case study of public blockchain-based egg supply chain traceability used by Bytable Inc. in partnership with “farmers' hen house” in which consumers can get information about a particular farmer from whom the eggs came to their basket like farm photos, management practices and certifications that followed in egg production system by scanning QR code on an egg carton. Ripe Technologies, a software firm that offers B2B solutions to grocery stores in order to boost their store and omni-channel performance, has partnered with Neogen, a food safety company based in the United States, to strengthen the link between animal genomics, feed use, and food safety. Ripe's president and co-founder Phil Harris has said that systems like blockchain can be used to back up claims of value addition and production labels. Production could be streamlined with the use of additional digital tools like sensors, the IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence [REF]. In keeping with the present push of many sectors towards the Internet of Things era, Leme et al. [REF], investigate the usage of a unique infrastructure. They presented a system that is efficient, secure, decentralized, and dispersed, which will modernise the way the cattle sector for beef and milk production operates in predominantly rural areas. They mentioned that while the internet is widely available currently, it is still undeveloped and expensive in rural regions, making widespread deployment unfeasible for most farmers. Surjandari et al. [REF], tested a permissioned blockchain-based system for the halal industry utilising Hyperledger Fabric and raft consensus. The Blockchain Network of Halal Meat Ordering Systems solves traceability issues. This case study proved effective for protecting halal transaction data on the blockchain. The “tampered-proof” feature gives end users transparency into the halal supply chain. To boost trust in the international beef supply chain between Australia's cattle farmers, processors, and Chinese customers, Cao et al. [REF], prototyped a blockchain-based human-machine reconcile method for beef supply chain traceability. BeefLedger, a commercial developer and provider of a blockchain-enabled beef provenance tool built on the Ethereum platform and the proof-of-authority (POA) protocol, commissioned and co-led the case-based design. This Blockchain-credentialed traceability prototype inspires more faith and confidence in Australian beef products among Chinese customers. As a result of their findings, they have decided to further develop, apply, and test the human-machine reconcile mechanism with a wider range of producers, consumers, and supply chain stakeholders such as customs, agri-departments, quarantine, and regulatory authorities. Through integration with TraceX's blockchain-powered traceability technologies, a dairy foods company based in India, “Milk Mantra”, is able to record the digital path of milk in real time, allowing for the creation of reliable consumer brands. Technology makes it possible for all parties in the dairy value chain to share democratic data in a safe and secure way. This addresses consumers' main concern about food safety in the dairy industry [REF]. Dey et al. [REF], developed a FoodSQRBlock (Food Safety Quick Response Block) based on blockchain technology with Google Cloud Platform to emulate an actual food production scenario with milk as a livestock produce example, which digitalizes the information involved in food production and makes it approachable, transparent, and traceable by consumers and producers via QR codes. Similarly, Khanna et al. [REF], proposed a blockchain-based platform with the use of smart contracts, QR technology, and IoT to increase the safety and traceability of the dairy supply chain in India, specifically targeting products like milk, butter, and cheese. Besides the issue of food traceability, this aims to maintain the nutritional quality of dairy products by detecting adulteration and contamination and boosting the efficiency of production. According to them, the framework proved helpful in locating and eliminating adulterated and contaminated food products from a supply chain, which helped build trust between unknown partners and made conflict resolution more manageable. Smart contracts help cut down on the expense of supply chain management by doing away with middlemen. Nonetheless, they emphasised the importance of future research for real-time application, as the interconnection of numerous dairy supply chains operating in different regions may present a complexity for smooth operation. After testing it for more than a year, Dong Nai, Vietnam's largest pork-producing province, put TE-FOOD's traceability system into use all over the country in 2022. The goal of the project is to build a high-tech system for identifying, managing, and tracing animal products and to improve the management and quality control of breeding, slaughtering, transportation, trade, and consumption in the province [REF].Many other experiments and prototypes were proposed to build an IoT and blockchain-based supply chain traceability system for livestock products [[REF], [REF], [REF], [REF], [REF], [REF]]. From these studies, we can deduce that implementing a conceptual framework for animal product supply chain traceability can greatly enhance the efficiency, security, and accountability of supply chain information, boost food quality and safety, and cut down on logistical losses by means of monitoring, tracing, and management. Although the area is still in its infancy and the vast majority of research are still in the design phase, the results of various experiments suggest that a sizeable portion of the effort is already in the implementation or piloting stage. Sendros et al. [REF], noted that just 14% of published studies on agricultural blockchain applications address the potential for use in the production and distribution of livestock products. There are several other projects/initiatives that were deployed on a pilot basis or permanent basis in the agricultural food supply chain other than livestock products [19,50,[REF], [REF], [REF], [REF], [REF], [REF]] that show the very good impact of BCT-driven food supply chain traceability and food safety.The application of blockchain technology in the food supply chain has shown many benefits, but it is necessary to determine the current challenges faced in the application of this technology in the food supply chain. Development of the Blockchain technology is still in a nascent stage, so the availability of Blockchain specialists is less as compared to other software developers. This leads to an increase in financial load for the deployment of this technology as it was noted that a blockchain specialist charges very high fees as compared to other software technologists [REF]. So, it's no longer possible for new entrepreneurs or small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) to use BCT. The skills and awareness regarding BCT are still deficient worldwide [REF] and in the livestock food supply chain, the ground-level participants are mainly farmers, who do not have proficiency in advanced technologies, which necessitates the increasing number of training platforms as well as trainers, who can make understanding and operability of this technology easy among the ground-level participants and food entities. In the growing phase of this technology, it is required to demonstrate the scalability, speed, and security to deploy it in the food supply chain [REF]. Sometimes, the immutability of data stored on a blockchain can create obstacles to the smooth performance of the food supply chain, as stated by Hald and Kinra [REF].This is the digital ledger technology, which requires a large number of computers and hardware to mine and store data, which leads to an increase in the initial cost of implementation along with the cost of the validation process. However, this challenge can be overcome by using intelligent concepts in a digital framework as described by Cocco et al. [REF]. Globally, the public thought of the BCT as a technology used for cryptocurrencies. The high volatility and large daily changes in the value and market share of cryptocurrencies have a negative psychological effect on BCT's reputation [REF]. The homogeneity of knowledge and understanding among technical experts and policymakers is still a deficit. The legal conduct of smart contracts in a distributed ledger technology (DLT) framework, particularly in relation to disputes such as enforceability, jurisdiction, the applicability of legal principles of contract law, etc., is still an important and vexed question [REF]. The confidentiality of information is still a boundary condition as industries resist sharing their private information with competitors in the market [REF]. The lack of common standards may act as a hurdle to the implementation of BCT in the real-life food sector. So, the harmony and regularisation of different blockchain platforms in the food sector are added challenges.Sustainable, adequate, and safe food supply chain advocacy has also helped bring bioeconomy into the spotlight. The term “bioeconomy” refers to the process by which renewable biological resources are produced and transformed into goods of worth, including waste streams. Livestock production is one of the main production sectors to which bioeconomy would be most closely linked [REF]. In order to make the transition to a bioeconomy, it is important to recognize the myriad of interactions that can arise between various governmental objectives and the food industry as well as consumers, which may be solved with blockchain-driven innovations by providing framework for traceable, verifiable, and complete communication of bio-farming practices to consumers who are increasingly wanting to make eco-friendly consumption choices [REF]. Blockchain technology within the bioeconomy of the livestock products industry in general does not appear to have attracted the attention of researchers as of yet. More work needs to be done in this area of study, and perhaps in the future an in-depth content analysis of the blockchain-based bioeconomy of livestock output will need to be attempted.",human
"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cell wall is probably the most complex membrane of all bacteria. The architecture of this complex wall extends to a massive core comprised of peptidoglycans covalently attached via a linker unit to a linear galactofuran and to several strands of a highly branched arabinofuran, and mycolic acids. Mycolic acids are oriented perpendicular to the membrane plane and provide a lipid barrier, which is the main feature of this bacteria [REF]. Several immune-evasion mechanisms conferred to Mtb, such as higher hydrophobicity, depend on its cell wall by masking pathogen-associated molecular patterns with phthiocerol dimycocerosates and inhibiting toll-like receptor 2 with sulfoglycolipids [REF]. These strategies inhibit the detection of bacteria and the activation of cytokine responses. They also recruit naive rather than microbicidal macrophages to sites of infection, preventing detection by targeting antigen presentation pathways of the adaptive immune system [REF]. M. tuberculosis uses several components of the cell wall to alter the processing and availability of peptide antigens for MHC class I and MHC class II. Furthermore, these cell wall-derived molecules can inhibit innate immunity processes such as autophagy [REF].During primary infection, the first cells to encounter Mtb are lung epithelial cells (EpCs) and alveolar macrophages which are capable of sensing and mounting an immune response versus Mtb, mainly through a wide variety of antimicrobial peptides. Most of these peptides display conserved properties including amphipathicity, cationicity and a small molecular size (12-50 amino acid residues) [REF]. Whether or not these short cationic peptides can disrupt this thick and impermeable wall will be discussed herein.Although tuberculosis [TB] is a preventable and treatable disease, it remains an important threat to public health. Transcriptomic analysis has shown that MDR-Mtb is capable to modify acetylation/methylation patterns in macrophages and lymphocytes infected, leading to oxidative stress and premature cellular aging, which correlates with higher intracellular survival and dissemination. Besides, some mycobacterial products play epigenetic changes promoting DNA methylation or altering the expression of non-coding RNAs to upregulate the immune response activation [REF].Despite the growing effort of the global health community to eradicate tuberculosis, in 2021 a total of 1.5 million people died from TB. In fact, Mtb was the second leading infectious killer after COVID-19. Due to vaccination and management of the pandemic, TB is profiling to return as the leading cause of mortality. This time, however, it will be even stronger as all healthcare resources were directed to the containment of SARS-Cov2 during the COVID-19 pandemic and important TB control programs, including vaccination, multidrug-resistant surveillance, and direct observed therapy, were ignored (DOT) [REF]. Nowadays, drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major public health challenge, and it poses a significant threat to global efforts to control TB. The treatment of drug-resistant TB is complex, lengthy, and expensive, and it often requires the use of toxic and poorly tolerated drugs. The emergence of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) further complicates the situation, as there are limited treatment options available. There is an urgent need for new and more effective therapies to combat drug-resistant TB, and antimicrobial peptides are a feasible option to shorten and improve the conventional therapy to address this pressing public health challenge. M. tuberculosis spreads from person to person almost exclusively by aerosolized particles. Nearly 90% of Mtb-infected individuals spontaneously control infection and eliminate mycobacteria [REF], while the remaining percentage of infected individuals contain the bacteria in a granuloma. Interestingly, numerous individuals living in densely populated areas prone to TB seem to be resistant to Mtb infection. They may presumably have immediate elimination of Mtb by innate phagocytes, epithelial cells, soluble antimicrobial molecules, innate invariant T cells, and natural killer cells, located in the mucosa and alveoli of the bronchial pulmonary airway mucosa and alveoli. They appear to have never been Mtb-infected as they are found to be negative for tuberculin skin test reaction and show an absence of granulomas. The resistance of such individuals may suggest the capability of innate immunity as a major natural effector against Mtb [REF].The defining characteristic of Mtb that is atypical of other bacteria is the complexity of its cell wall, which is associated with pathogenesis and provides a barrier against antibiotics and the immune response of the host [REF].",human
"Achieving high COVID-19 vaccine booster coverage is an ongoing global challenge. Health authorities need evidence about effective communication interventions to improve acceptance and uptake. This study aimed to test effects of persuasive messages about COVID-19 vaccine booster doses on intention to vaccinate amongst eligible adults in Australia.COVID-19 vaccination has been critical for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic by protecting vulnerable individuals from severe disease, safeguarding health systems and helping return society to normal functioning [REF]. Booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines (additional doses given after completion of the two-dose primary course) are necessary to provide ongoing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and offer increased protection against severe disease [REF].Suboptimal uptake of COVID-19 booster doses has occurred globally. In Australia, completion of a primary course of COVID-19 vaccine for individuals ≥16 years is >96%, but booster dose (third dose) coverage has stalled at just over 70% [REF]. In other countries, the United Kingdom (UK) has achieved approximately 70% booster dose coverage in the eligible population [REF], while Europe and the United States (US) have achieved just over 50% and 43% respectively [REF].While many factors can contribute to low vaccine uptake, including both access and acceptance barriers, low motivation may continue to act as a barrier to uptake if not addressed [REF]. This has been the experience with other pandemic vaccines, for example the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic vaccine [REF]. There are a range of factors that influence motivation to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Both personal and collective health benefits have been found to shape acceptance and motivation [REF], building on evidence from strategies to increase vaccine uptake more broadly [REF]. Non-health benefits, i.e. the broader benefits of vaccination beyond direct protection from disease such as ability to travel, have been found to be motivating factors [REF]. Attaching importance to certain moral values, such as individual liberties and the agency or freedom to make personal health decisions, have been linked to hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccines [REF] as well as routine vaccines [REF].Considering these findings, emphasising motivational factors in persuasive messaging could potentially be a successful strategy to support higher intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. There is evidence that persuasive messages can support higher intentions towards vaccination in general [REF]. For COVID-19 vaccination specifically, a systematic review has found that messages emphasising personal or community health benefits of vaccination can be effective in supporting higher intentions, although results are mixed [REF]. Three survey experiments in US and UK adults comparing the effect of a range of messages on intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine found that messages emphasising personal health benefits of vaccination have a larger effect than those emphasising benefits to others [REF]. By contrast, another large survey experiment in US adults found that messages emphasising non-health benefits (such as freedom from public health restrictions) and community benefits were effective. The community messages were the most effective of all, while those emphasising personal health benefits were not more effective than the control [REF]. Evidence of the effectiveness of messaging promoting altruistic behaviour (i.e. behaviour beneficial to the community) on COVID-19 vaccine intention has also been found in other experiments in US and UK adults [REF]. There is limited research investigating the effectiveness of messages emphasising personal agency in making COVID-19 vaccination decisions.Given the current state of evidence, it remains unclear what types of messages have the greatest effect on intention to receive a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine. This is especially the case in populations that have experienced relatively low risk of encountering COVID-19, combined with restrictive public health measures. These were the conditions experienced in Australia at the time of this experiment, where COVID-19 case numbers were relatively low during the first two years of the pandemic, while public health restrictions, such as border closures and lockdowns, were applied liberally due to the country’s pursuit of a COVID-19 elimination strategy [REF]. Such evidence can inform communications from health authorities and other stakeholders to encourage uptake of COVID-19 booster doses, especially written communications (e.g. emails), which were used to communicate with the public in Australia during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. This study aimed to compare the effect of persuasive messages on intention to get a booster dose of COVID-19 vaccine in Australian adults. This study is part of a larger study investigating factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Australia and elsewhere [REF] and developing messaging to support acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in various populations [REF].",human
